Yup , you guessed it .
The Legend of Zelda trailer featured here is part of an elaborate April Fool 's Day prank .
What follows is our original story announcing the trailer to the ( in some cases ) unsuspecting public .
Also : we 've added a making - of video for the most curious of fans . ]
Few videogame properties hold the cachet of The Legend of Zelda .
As a film project , it 's on the scale of Lord of the Rings .
But no one has tackled a live - action adaptation of the storied franchise … until today .
Production Company Rainfall Films has asked IGN to premiere the very first footage from their live - action Zelda film — a very literal adaptation of the magical epic — and , of course , we said , " Yes ! " Much like the indie gem Cloverfield , this project has been shrouded in secrecy and details kept close to the vest .
What we do know is that the film is being written and directed by newcomer Sam Balcomb .
Going the route of Star Wars : Episode IV , this production decided to cast all unknowns in the iconic roles .
Link is played by JR Killigrew , Camille C. Brown portrays a very Elven Princess Zelda , and Gregory Lee Kenyon stars as Ganondorf .
You may , however , recognize Camden Toy ( see TV's Buffy and Angel ) in the supporting role as Sahasrahla .
Loading
We 'll have more about this project as details surface , but for now , gaze upon the first footage of this amazing undertaking .
And when you 're through with that , revisit ourfrom 2006 to see just how far off we were with our picks .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , be sure to chime in with your thoughts on the flick below !
Forget Chequers and the Palace of Versailles .
The next time Gordon Brown or Nicholas Sarkozy need a bolthole in which to recharge their batteries or a place for a private pow - wow , they might find themselves lured to a new retreat amid the pink rocks of the Nevada desert .
Donna Vassar , part of the Vassar education dynasty , has launched plans to build a $ 300 m ( £ 150 m ) private getaway for stressed - out presidents and prime ministers who want to " reconnect with their unique purpose in life " .
The Universitas Leadership Sanctuary is intended as part monastery and part conference centre where the most powerful men and women on the planet can get away from it all with a combination of reading , contemplation and even a spot of gardening .
To remind them of their role as leaders of the planet , the sanctuary will be built in the shape of a four - storey globe on the shores of Lake Las Vegas , a privately - owned lake in the south Nevada desert where temperatures can reach 50 C at the height of summer .
Vassar , whose family established the liberal arts college of the same name in New York State , has unveiled plans which include libraries , contemplation spaces and debating chambers .
She intends to recreate a monastic existence which means entourages of press officers , policy advisers and secretaries which routinely support world leaders will be banned .
There will even be a garden to provide food for the sanctuary tables , raising the prospect of future world leaders tilling the soil together while ruminating on the direction of the latest round of world trade talks .
" The Universitas Leadership Sanctuary will be a centre specifically created to embrace and challenge leaders , " says the vision document which Vassar has published .
" Together we will create an individual journey leading to the highest place within , enabling leaders to reconnect with their unique purpose in life .
They emerge - renewed , with clarity , and reflecting true transformation . "
Speaking through a spokeswoman , Vassar said visitors would be encouraged " to keep things informal in order to submit to the relaxing atmosphere " .
Leaving cares behind
Vasser hired Douglas Patterson , the London - based artist and architect to work on the plans , after she saw a mansion he built in a Mogul style on the Caribbean island of Mustique .
Before the commission to design the Sanctuary , Patterson travelled to study the life and architecture of Buddhist Dzongs ( monasteries ) in Bhutan and the Christian orthodox monasteries of Mount Athos and Meteora in Greece .
He is now working with Laurie Chetwood , an architect who made his name designing eco-friendly supermarkets for Sainsbury's .
" This will be a place for people to leave their cares behind and get back to what they are all about , " Chetwood said .
" The building is approached by a labyrinth which means the leaders will leave their cares and their entourages behind both metaphorically and literally .
" The place is designed to strip away the layers of protocol that build up around these kind of people and help them get back to clarity .
They can also use the place like a monk might .
There will be libraries and a garden to produce food , although I can't quite see Gordon Brown going out and tilling the land . "
The main globe building will be on four levels .
The ground floor will house a library and the first floor a debating chamber , while on the second floor will be technology to help make the building energy efficient .
At the top , under a dome of glass , will be the spiritual heart of the development - the contemplation space where leaders will be encouraged to sit in silence .
Simple quarters
The world leaders will have simple quarters next to the globe where they will be able to eat and sleep during retreats lasting a weekend or longer .
It is not the first attempt to bring world leaders together in a different environment to the conference halls and meeting rooms of the United Nations , Davos and Camp David .
In late 2006 President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan opened the Pyramid of Peace in Astana , his capital .
The 77 - metre - high building , designed by Lord Foster , includes a 1,500 - seat opera house .
At its apex it is crowned by a meeting space decorated with images of doves especially designed to host conferences of the leaders of the world 's religions .
Vassar has set up Destination Universitas Foundation , a New York charitable foundation , to raise money for the project , which she estimates will take two and a half years to build .
She is travelling the world to meet potential donors and has told them her mission is " to create better balance in the world by transforming leaders " .
A spokesman for Lake Las Vegas resort confirmed that late last year the foundation expressed an interest in buying a 65 - acre plot in its development which already includes a Ritz Cartlon Hotel , luxurious homes and a spa .
The location means that if the world leaders tire of their monastic retreat they will find a golf course on their doorstep as well as a small casino .
And if all that concentrating on inner thoughts gets too much , the Las Vegas strip is just 17 miles away .

ActivteWeave , the parent company of BlogRovR , has been acquired by BuzzLogic , an online advertising software provider .
BlogRovR CEO Marc Meyer and CTO Jean Sini will be joining BuzzLogic as part of the deal , with Sini also becoming the combined company ’s CTO .
As you may recall from our previous coverage , BlogRovR is a browser plug - in that shows you related content from a blogs you subscribe to as you surf the Web .
For example , if you subscribe to Mashable in BlogRovR , you might see one of our posts about Facebook while you 're browsing the social network and have the plug - in turned on .
BlogRovR actually found itself in a mini-controversy here at Mashable last year , as we investigated the impact that the service 's default feeds were having on FeedBurner stats for top blogs .
Nonetheless , the company ’s add - on went on to be installed more than 180,000 times prior to this evening 's acquisition announcement .
Meanwhile , the acquiring company was not one I was immediately familiar with , but upon a demo of BuzzLogic ’s system , I can see how BlogRovR might fit into their plans .
BuzzLogic offers what they like to call an “ influence targeting ” ad network , meaning that advertising messages are designed to reach specific influencers ( generally speaking : bloggers ) and their audiences in different genres .
For example , if BuzzLogic determines ( through linking patterns , author credibility , amongst other characteristics ) that I am the pre-eminent expert that blogs about virtual worlds , they may align ads for customers trying to reach virtual world users with my posts .
Since BlogRovR monitors more than 200,000 blogs to provide its content recommendations to users , it ’s pretty easy to see where it fits in with BuzzLogic ’s plans : providing deeper analysis of who the influencers are in different categories , which in turn should yield better results on ads and put more money in everyone ’s pockets .
ActiveWeave was funded by Esther Dyson and Eric Di Benedetto , amongst others .
Terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of workers filing new claims for jobless aid jumped by a much larger - than - expected 69,000 last week to the highest in over two years , government data on Thursday showed , but the numbers were likely skewed by the timing of a public holiday .

The Labor Department said initial claims for state insurance benefit were 375,000 in the week ending January 26 , the highest since October 2005 , when claims reached 376,000 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
A Labor Department official said it was also the largest weekly increase since September 2005 , when claims had mounted by 95,000 .
Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast 315,000 claims last week following an upwardly revised 306,000 the week before , previously reported at 301,000 claims .
U.S. stock index futures and the dollar fell after jobless claims , while bond prices rallied on the prospect of another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve .
The Labor Department official said the timing of last week ’s Martin Luther King , Jr. holiday may have been a factor .
“ Holiday effects are very hard to pick up ahead of time ... it is very hard to accurately predict ahead of time what the impact on claims will be , ” the Labor official said .
The four - week average of weekly claims , which helps smooth out fluctuations to expose the underlying jobs trend increased to 325,750 last week from 315,500 the week before .
“ The four - week moving average is a better indicator , but still there ’s headline shock in a number like 375 ( thousand ) , ” said Michael Darda , chief economist at MKM Partners LLC in Greenwich , Connecticut .
“ If claims were to stay at that level it would indicate signs of softening in the labor market .
A few weeks ago the claims had risen to 350 - plus and pulled back nicely .
Taken together it ’s not necessarily a disaster , ” Darda said .
The number of so - called continuing claims rose by 47,000 to 2.72 million in the week ended Jan 19 , the latest period for which figures were available .
The continuing claims total compared with economists ’ forecasts for 2.68 million claims .
The scientists were investigating the lifestyle of two early elephants ( proboscideans ) Moeritherium and Barytherium that lived in the Eocene period , over 37 million years ago .
By analysing isotopes in tooth enamel from Moeritherium they were able to deduce that it was very likely a semi-aquatic mammal , spending its days in water eating freshwater plants . ‘
We know from molecular data that modern elephants share a common ancestry with the sirenians - aquatic sea cows and dugongs , ’ said Alexander Liu of Oxford ’s Department of Earth Sciences , lead author of a report of the research published online in PNAS .
‘ It suggests that elephants may have an ancestor which was amphibious in its mode of life and we wanted to know if Moeritherium or Barytherium was this semi-aquatic ancient relative .
Unfortunately only fragments of the skeletons of these early elephants survive , so instead of looking at their bones we looked at the chemical composition of their teeth to determine what they ate and how they lived . ’
Alex Liu , with colleagues Erik Seiffert from Stony Brook University ( USA ) and Elwyn Simons from the Duke Lemur Center ( USA ) , analysed the oxygen and carbon isotope ratios contained within tooth enamel from both extinct proboscideans .
While carbon isotopes can give clues as to an animal ’s diet , oxygen isotopes found in teeth come from local water sources - and variations in the ratios of these isotopes can indicate the type of environment the animal lived in .
They compared the ratios of these isotopes to definitely terrestrial animals from the same period and these results – when combined with results from studies of embryology , molecular data , and sedimentology – lead them to believe that Moeritherium was semi-aquatic .
Alex Liu commented :
‘ We now have substantial evidence to suggest that modern elephants do have ancient relatives which lived primarily in water .
The next steps are to conduct similar analyses on other elephant ancestors to determine when the switch from water to land occurred , and to determine exactly when the now fully - aquatic sirenians split from their semi-aquatic proboscidean relatives . ’
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton and rival Barack Obama are running neck - and - neck in Ohio and Texas one day before their crucial Democratic presidential showdowns , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Houston Chronicle poll released on Monday .
Clinton , fighting to save her presidential bid after 11 straight wins by Obama , desperately needs victories in the big - state battles to keep her candidacy alive and face the Republican candidate in the November election .
Obama , an Illinois senator , has a slim advantage on Clinton in both states , although the leads are within the poll ’s margin of error of just under 4 percentage points .
Obama leads 47 percent to 44 percent in Texas , as Clinton gained 1 point overnight in the polling conducted by Zogby International .
He leads 47 percent to 45 percent in Ohio , a turnaround from Clinton ’s 1 - point advantage on Sunday .
Obama has wiped out big leads in the last two weeks in both states for Clinton , a New York senator and former first lady , but in the final days of the race neither candidate has managed dramatic shifts .
“ There are no big movements , no great swings , these are just very tight races , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ At least for now it does n’t look like either one of them is going to be winning in a blow - out . ”
Republican front - runner McCain , however , appears headed to easy victories in both states .
He has big double - digit leads over his last major rival , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .
McCain , an Arizona senator , is moving closer to clinching the Republican presidential nomination and has built an insurmountable lead in delegates , who will choose the nominee at the party ’s September convention .
COALITIONS STABLE
Both Democratic candidates have maintained the voter coalitions in Ohio and Texas that fueled them in earlier contests , with Clinton winning women , older voters , traditional Democrats and Hispanics while Obama attracts men , young voters , blacks and independents .
In Texas , Clinton continues to hold a big lead among the state ’s sizable bloc of Hispanics and has an edge in the state ’s heavily Hispanic south and conservative west .
Obama is strong in the cities , but the two have battled back - and - forth in east Texas and now run even there .
“ It really is looking like east Texas is the place to watch in the popular vote , whoever wins there could have the edge in the state , ” Zogby said .
Clinton moved ahead slightly in Ohio among voters who made their decision in the last few days -- a possible sign Obama ’s momentum could be slowing after days of Clinton attacks on his readiness to become U.S. commander - in - chief .
Slideshow ( 35 images )
In Ohio and Texas , 6 percent of Democrats are still undecided on the day before the primary .
In the Republican race , McCain leads Huckabee 61 percent to 28 percent in Ohio and 53 percent to 33 percent in Texas .
The other remaining Republican candidate , Texas Rep. Ron Paul , had 6 percent in Texas and 5 percent in Ohio .
McCain leads handily in nearly every voter category and in all regions of both states .
He even leads in Ohio among those who call themselves very conservative , although Huckabee leads in that category in Texas .
Slideshow ( 35 images )
McCain has faced a revolt among some conservatives unhappy with his past stances on immigration , tax cuts and campaign finance reform , although it has done little to slow his march to the nomination .
The rolling poll was conducted Friday through Sunday .
It surveyed 761 likely Democratic voters in Ohio with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points , and 748 in Texas with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points .
The poll of 675 likely Republican voters in Ohio had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points .
The survey of 628 voters in Texas had a margin of error of 4 percentage points .
In a rolling poll , the most recent day ’s results are added and the oldest day ’s results are dropped to track changing momentum .
The poll will continue one more day .

President Bush often argues that history will vindicate him .
So he can't be pleased with an informal survey of 109 professional historians conducted by the History News Network .
It found that 98 percent of them believe that Bush 's presidency has been a failure , while only about 2 percent see it as a success .
Not only that , more than 61 percent of the historians say the current presidency is the worst in American history .
In 2004 , only 11.6 percent of the historians rated Bush 's presidency in last place .
Among the reasons given for his low ratings : invading Iraq , " tax breaks for the rich , " and alienating many nations around the world .
Bush supporters counter that professional historians today tend to be liberal and that it 's too early to assess how his policies will turn out .
Researchers using the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes have identified what they believe may be the youngest star - forming galaxy ever observed , seen just 700 million years after the birth of the universe itself .
This period in the history of the universe is thought to be a kind of cosmic " dark age , " when space was suffused with clouds of cold hydrogen gas that had yet to coalesce into stars and galaxies .
The galaxy observed , which astronomers think they are seeing as it was 12.8 billion years in the past , would thus have been one of the early points to light up with new - formed stars .
" This galaxy presumably is one of the many galaxies that helped end the dark
ages , " said astronomer Larry Bradley of Johns Hopkins University , and leader of the study .
" Astronomers are fairly certain that high - energy objects such as quasars did not provide enough energy to end the dark ages of the universe .
But many young star - forming galaxies may have produced enough energy to end it . "
Astronomers were able to take advantage of a natural lens in space to see so far back in time and space .
A massive cluster of galaxies called
Abell 1689 , about 2.2 billion light years away , exerts enough gravitational pull on the surrounding space to bend the path of light from objects behind it .
This natural " gravitational lens " effect essentially magnified the distant light by nearly 10 times , making it bright enough for Spitzer and Hubble to detect .
However , it is still invisible in the ordinary light spectrum , because the expansion of the universe over time has stretched the wavelength of the light emitted by the young galaxy into the infrared spectrum .
By today 's standards , it 's a tiny galaxy , the mass of just a few billion stars like our Sun .
But astronomers believe that was typical for early star - forming galaxies .

Spammer Gets Nine Years
In Prison Posted by Pile ( 10574 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Spam ]
Virginia 's Supreme Court on Friday upheld the first US felony conviction for spamming .
The spammer will serve nine years in prison for sending what authorities believe to be millions of messages over a two - month period in 2003 .
Jeremy Jaynes is the man who will make history .
A Raleigh , North Carolina , resident who made Spamhaus ' top 10 list of spammers , Jaynes was arrested in 2003 even before the CAN SPAM act was passed by Congress .
Jaynes was convicted in 2005 , but his lawyers appealed the conviction .
This past Friday , the Virginia Supreme Court upheld that conviction , but the vote was a narrow 4 - 3 .
The prosecution presented evidence of over 53,000 illegal e-mails that Jaynes sent over just three days during July , 2003 , but it is believed that he sent 10 million messages per day between July and August of that year .
Though he is a North Carolina resident , Jaynes was charged in Virginia because the AOL servers he used for sending spam were located in Loudoun County , Virginia .
While defending Jaynes , his lawyers attempted to argue that a provision of the Virginia Computer Crimes
Act violates constitutional First Amendment rights to " anonymous speech , " as well as the interstate commerce clause of the US Constitution .
The court rejected these claims due to Jaynes ' use of fake e-mail addresses , which breaks the US CAN SPAM law 's condition of giving recipients a means of contacting the sender .
The court also stated that his peddling of scam products and services excludes him from First Amendment rights .
In effect , the court said that you can't scam people and then cry " free speech ! " when hooked by the law .
While one might think that Jaynes ' case should have been open and shut , Justice Elizabeth Lacy highlighted some of the reasons behind the close 4 - 3 verdict , along with the potential dangers of vague anti-spam legislation .
In her written dissent , Lacy argued that the " unsolicited bulk electronic mail " provision of Virginia 's Computer Crimes
Act is " unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it prohibits the anonymous transmission of all unsolicited bulk e-mail including those containing political , religious or other speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . "

Stephen Harper is returning from last week 's NATO meeting with the commitments he says he needed to justify keeping Canadian forces in Kandahar .
So Canadians will face having our troops act as combatants in the Afghanistan war for at least three more years in a mission that started in 2001 .
At 10 years it will be , by far , Canada 's longest war .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
With these developments , it may be a good time to examine how Canada 's traditional peacekeeping role regressed into war - making .
We are being encouraged to celebrate news of how many people Canadian soldiers have managed to kill ­- with body counts reminiscent of U.S. media coverage of the Vietnam War .
From a country that made a unique contribution to peaceful conflict resolution , Canada now stands alongside the U.S. in supporting aggressive military intervention .
We seem to be devolving as a nation .
The most committed advocates of the war in Afghanistan , including Harper and John Manley , are characterizing Canada 's new militarism as the natural extension of Lester Pearson 's concept of peacekeeping .
This concept is being sorely abused , with the same audacity as when the Americans named one of their nuclear missiles " The Peacekeeper . "
In his February speech to the Conference of Defence Associations ( CDA ) , Harper began by talking about Pearson , the Canadian reluctance to take up arms , support for the United Nations , and our international reputation for working among " the world 's poor and oppressed . "
But this was just the set up for his announcement of permanent increases to Canadian military spending and a profound shift away from peacekeeping .
Harper 's plan will see Canadian troops exercising the " robust use of force , " with purchases of new equipment for every branch of the military .
Mixed in with a lot of talk about noble aims , Harper announced that Canadian security now includes protecting trade and investment opportunities for Canadian corporations in foreign countries .
If that does n't alarm you , it should .
Military spending as ' development '
Claiming Canada 's new aggressive military " missions " are consistent with our peacekeeping tradition is just one way to reframe militarism as humanitarianism .
Another way is to tie it to development .
Harper made this connection in his speech to the CDA , and even arms dealers -- the main beneficiary of Canada 's new foreign policy stance -- are making it part of their sales pitch .
When the CBC sent Nelofer Pazira , known for her lead role in the film Kandahar , into an arms trade show , she tried to convey to the arms dealers present how people living in conflict zones experienced their products .
She told them she could remember as a child counting Soviet tanks on the streets of Kabul and the fear they engendered .
But the response she got was dismissive .
She was told " You can't have development and reconstruction without having a minimum level of security . "
The military wares being sold to Canada were the " foundation of the solution " for Afghanistan .
Up is down , war is peace .
Fear of Canada
Pazira appealed to Canadians that we look at the equipment Canada was purchasing for use in Afghanistan and consider whether we would not feel fear if we saw it on the streets of our own cities .
She was well aware that development could not happen without security , but in her view the overwhelming emphasis by Canada on military force actually undermined security for both Afghans and Canadian troops as it alienated the population .
Pazira warned that hoping high tech weaponry would enable Canadian forces to kill Taliban without causing civilian casualties was an illusion , as the Taliban are intermingled with the population in places like Kandahar .
In their report documenting the rapid escalation of Canadian military spending , Steven Staples and Bill Robinson examine why there is the perception that Canada spends little on its military despite the fact that the military 's budget is higher now than at any time since World War II .
The cost of military operations in Afghanistan alone had reached $ 7.2 billion by the end of March 2008 .
To put it in comparative terms , Canada has spent $ 225 per Afghan citizen on its military mission in a country where per capita income is only $ 293 .
Abandoning peacekeeping
According to Professor Walter Dorn of the Royal Military College , " The first consequence of our current deployment in Afghanistan is that Canada is currently at a historic low in its UN peacekeeping contribution . "
Most Canadians would probably be shocked to learn that the federal government has all but eliminated Canada 's role in United Nations peacekeeping .
Professor Dorn reported in his testimony to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs that Canada now contributes fewer soldiers than ever -­ a mere 55 out of a total 70,000 UN peacekeeping troops .
Where Canadians used to make up 10 per cent on average of UN forces , that figure has dwindled to .1 per cent .
It is not because of a collapse of interest in peacekeeping that Canada 's role is so diminished .
The demand for UN missions and the number of peacekeeping soldiers is at an all time high .
What has collapsed is the commitment among Canadian political and military elites for peacekeeping as an alternative to war .
So General Rick Hillier can say , without being contradicted by anyone in government , " We are the Canadian Forces , and our job is to be able to kill people . "
How is the Canadian military operation in Afghanistan different from peacekeeping ?
Are n't our troops just protecting civilians from violent aggressors as they do in peacekeeping missions ?
Back to basics
Professor Dorn has contrasted Canada 's role in Kandahar with the basic principles that define peacekeeping , principles that are critical to grasp given all the warm and fuzzy rationalizations being served up for the war .
Canada is in Kandahar not as part of a UN mission but as part of the Americans ' " Operation Enduring Freedom . "
The Canadian military is not impartial , does not have the consent of both parties to the conflict to be there , and is not limiting its use of force to the minimum required for self - defence and protection of the civilian population -- key trademarks of peacekeeping .
Peacekeeping may be possible in some areas of Afghanistan , but in the south foreign military intervention is contributing to the violence by effectively weighing in on one side of a civil war .
And rather than look for ways to de-escalate the conflict , giving combatants whatever opportunities exist for alternatives to waging war , Canada 's top general forecloses these opportunities by calling " the enemy " scumbags .
Efforts to build peace anywhere there is violent conflict are not for the faint of heart , and they can appear near impossible in Afghanistan .
A Taliban leader was killed for offering to negotiate with the Karzai government .
But peacekeeping missions have worked even in parts of the world with the worst history of violence , such as in Mozambique .
That was the genius of Pearson 's idea , and it is a contribution Canadians are justly proud of .
The Harper government seems bound and determined to denigrate it and erase it from what defines us as a nation .

The Census Bureau 's data file
Last week I posted an article about calculations with data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau .
I 'm thinking about writing that up in more detail , but today I learned something so astonishing that I could n't wait to mention it .
The data is available from the Census Bureau 's web site .
It is a CSV file .
Most of the file contains actual data , like this : 20220 , , " Dubuque , IA " , Metropolitan Statistical Area , " 92,384 " , " 91,603 " , " 91,223 " , " 90,635 " , " 89,571 " , " 89,216 " , " 89,265 " , " 89,156 " , " 89,143 " Experienced data mungers will feel a sense of foreboding as they look at the commas in those numerals .
Commas are for people , and if the data file is written for people , rather than for computers , then getting the computer to read it is going to require at least a little bit of suffering .
Indeed , the rest of the data is rather dirty .
There is a useless header : table with row headers in column A and column headers in rows 3 through 4 ( leading dots indicate sub-parts ) , , , , , , , , , , , , ^M " Table 1 .
Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas : April 1 , 2000 to July 1 , 2006 " , , , , , , , , , , , , ^M CBSA Code , " Metro Division Code " , Geographic area , " Legal / statistical area description " , Population estimates , , , , , , , " April 1 , 2000 " , ^M , , , , " July 1 , 2006 " , " July 1 , 2005 " , " July 1 , 2004 " , " July 1 , 2003 " , " July 1 , 2002 " , " July 1 , 2001 " , " July 1 , 2000 " , Estimates base , Census^M , , Metropolitan statistical areas , , , , , , , , , , ^M And there is a similarly useless footer on the bottom of the file .
Any program that wants to use this data has to trim off the header and the footer , or ignore them , or the user will have to trim them off manually .
( I 've translated ASCII CR characters to ^M sequences so that you can see that although the lines of the file are CR - LF terminated , some of the items contain extra LFs for no particular reason . )
Well , all this is minor .
My real complaint is that some of the state name abbreviations are garbled : 19740 , , " Denver - Aurora , CO1 " , Metropolitan Statistical Area , " 2,408,750 " , " 2,361,778 " , " 2,326,126 " , " 2,299,879 " , " 2,276,592 " , " 2,245,030 " , " 2,193,737 " , " 2,179,320 " , " 2,179,240 " Notice that it says CO1 rather than CO , short for " Colorado " .
I was fortunate to notice this garbling .
Since it occurred on the line for Denver ( among others ) the result was that the program was unable to locate the population of Denver , which is the capital of Colorado , and a mandatory part of the program 's output .
So it raised a warning .
Then I went in and manually corrected the CO1 to say CO .
I also added a check to the program to make sure that it recognized all the state abbreviations ; I should have had this in there in the first place .
Then I sent email to an acquaintance who works for the Census Bureau ( identity suppressed to protect the innocent ) , pointing out the errors so that they could be corrected .
My contact checked with the people who produced the data , and informed me that , according to them , CO1 was not an error .
Rather , the 1 was a footnote mark , directing me to a footnote at the bottom of the file : " 1Broomfield , CO was formed from parts of Adams , Boulder , Jefferson , and Weld Counties , CO on November 15 , 2001 and was coextensive with Broomfield city . " , , , , , , , , , , , , ^M " For purposes of presenting data for metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas for Census 2000 , Broomfield is treated as if it were a county at the time of the 2000 census . " , , , , , , , , , , , , ^M A footnote .
I realize now that that footer was not as useless as I thought it was .
Wow .
A footnote .
Wow .
I would like to suggest the following as a basic principle of computerized data processing : Data files should contain data .
Not metadata .
Not explanations .
Not little essays .
And not footnotes .
Just the data .
There 's a larger issue here about confusing content and presentation .
But " Data files should contain data " is simpler and easier to remember .
I suspect that this file was exported from a spreadsheet program , probably Excel .
Spreadsheet programs desperately want you to confuse content and presentation .
This is why one should not use a spreadsheet as a database .
I now recall another occasion when I had to deal with data that was exported from a spreadsheet that was pretending to be a database .
It was a database of products made by a large cosmetics company .
A typical record looked like this : " Soft - Pressed Powder Blusher " , " 618J -05 " , " Warm , natural - looking powder colour for all skins .
Wide range of shades - subtle to vibrant .
With applicator brush . " , " Cheeks " , " Nudes " , " Chestnut Blush " , " All " , " " , " 19951201 " , " Yes " , " " , " 14.5 " , " " The 618J - 05 here is a product code .
Bonus points if you see what 's coming next .
" Water - Dissolve Cream Cleanser " , " 6.61E+01 " , " Creamy cleanser for drier , more sensitive skins .
Dissolves even the most tenacious makeups . " , " Cleansers " , " " , " " , " " , " Sub I , I , II " , " 19951201 " , " Yes " , " 1 " , " 14.5 " , " " That 6.61E+01 should have been 661E - 01 , but Excel decided that it was a numeral , in scientific notation , and put it into normal form .
Back to the Census Bureau , which almost screwed me by putting a footnote on a state name .
What if they had decided to put footnotes on the population figures ?
Then I would have been really screwed , because it would have been completely undetectable .
No , wait !
It 's all become clear .
That 's why they put the commas in the numerals !
[ Addendum 20080129 : My Census Bureau contact tells me that the authors of the data file have seen the wisdom of my point of view , in spite of my unconstructive and unhelpful feedback ( I said " Wow , that is an incredibly terrible idea " ) and are planning to address the issue in the next release of the data .
Hooray for happy endings ! ] [ Addendum 20080129 : My Census Bureau contact tells me that they do sometimes put footnotes on the data items , so do n't laugh too hard at my remark about the commas . ]

The mind is a wonderful thing – there is so much about it which remains a mystery to this day .
Science is able to describe strange phenomena , but can not account for their origins .
While most of us are familiar with one or two on this list , many others are mostly unknown outside of the psychological realm .
This is a list of the top ten strange mental phenomena .
We have all some experience of a feeling , that comes over us occasionally , of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before , in a remote time – of our having been surrounded , dim ages ago , by the same faces , objects , and circumstances – of our knowing perfectly what will be said next , as if we suddenly remember it !
— Charles Dickens
10 Déjà Vu
Déjà vu is the experience of being certain that you have experienced or seen a new situation previously – you feel as though the event has already happened or is repeating itself .
The experience is usually accompanied by a strong sense of familiarity and a sense of eeriness , strangeness , or weirdness .
The “ previous ” experience is usually attributed to a dream , but sometimes there is a firm sense that it has truly occurred in the past .
9 Déjà Vécu
Déjà vécu ( pronounced vay - koo ) is what most people are experiencing when they think they are experiencing deja vu .
Déjà vu is the sense of having seen something before , whereas déjà vécu is the experience of having seen an event before , but in great detail – such as recognizing smells and sounds .
This is also usually accompanied by a very strong feeling of knowing what is going to come next .
In my own experience of this , I have not only known what was going to come next , but have been able to tell those around me what is going to come next – and I am right .
This is a very eerie and unexplainable sensation .
8 Déjà Visité
Déjà visité is a less common experience and it involves an uncanny knowledge of a new place .
For example , you may know your way around a a new town or a landscape despite having never been there , and knowing that it is impossible for you to have this knowledge .
Déjà visité is about spatial and geographical relationships , while déjà vécu is about temporal occurrences .
Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote about an experience of this in his book “ Our Old Home ” in which he visited a ruined castle and had a full knowledge of its layout .
He was later able to trace the experience to a poem he had read many years early by Alexander Pope in which the castle was accurately described .
7 Déjà Senti
Déjà senti is the phenomenon of having “ already felt ” something .
This is exclusively a mental phenomenon and seldom remains in your memory afterwards .
In the words of a person having experienced it : “ What is occupying the attention is what has occupied it before , and indeed has been familiar , but has been forgotten for a time , and now is recovered with a slight sense of satisfaction as if it had been sought for .
The recollection is always started by another person ’s voice , or by my own verbalized thought , or by what I am reading and mentally verbalize ; and I think that during the abnormal state I generally verbalize some such phrase of simple recognition as ‘ Oh yes — I see ’ , ‘ Of course — I remember ’ , etc. , but a minute or two later I can recollect neither the words nor the verbalized thought which gave rise to the recollection .
I only find strongly that they resemble what I have felt before under similar abnormal conditions . ”
You could think of it as the feeling of having just spoken , but realizing that you , in fact , did n’t utter a word .
6 Jamais Vu
Jamais vu ( never seen ) describes a familiar situation which is not recognized .
It is often considered to be the opposite of déjà vu and it involves a sense of eeriness .
The observer does not recognize the situation despite knowing rationally that they have been there before .
It is commonly explained as when a person momentarily does n’t recognize a person , word , or place that they know .
Chris Moulin , of Leeds University , asked 92 volunteers to write out “ door ” 30 times in 60 seconds .
He reported that 68 per cent of his guinea pigs showed symptoms of jamais vu , such as beginning to doubt that “ door ” was a real word .
This has lead him to believe that jamais vu may be a symptom of brain fatigue .
5 Presque Vu
Presque vu is very similar to the “ tip of the tongue ” sensation – it is the strong feeling that you are about to experience an epiphany – though the epiphany seldom comes .
The term “ presque vu ” means “ almost seen ” .
The sensation of presque vu can be very disorienting and distracting .
4 L’esprit de l’Escalier
L’esprit de l’escalier ( stairway wit ) is the sense of thinking of a clever comeback when it is too late .
The phrase can be used to describe a riposte to an insult , or any witty , clever remark that comes to mind too late to be useful — when one is on the “ staircase ” leaving the scene .
The German word treppenwitz is used to express the same idea .
The closest phrase in English to describe this situation is “ being wise after the event ” .
The phenomenon is usually accompanied by a feeling of regret at having not thought of the riposte when it was most needed or suitable .
3 Capgras Delusion
Capgras delusion is the phenomenon in which a person believes that a close friend or family member has been replaced by an identical looking impostor .
This could be tied in to the old belief that babies were stolen and replaced by changelings in medieval folklore , as well as the modern idea of aliens taking over the bodies of people on earth to live amongst us for reasons unknown .
This delusion is most common in people with schizophrenia but it can occur in other disorders .
2 Fregoli Delusion
Fregoli delusion is a rare brain phenomenon in which a person holds the belief that different people are , in fact , the same person in a variety of disguises .
It is often associated with paranoia and the belief that the person in disguise is trying to persecute them .
The condition is named after the Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli who was renowned for his ability to make quick changes of appearance during his stage act .
It was first reported in 1927 in the case study of a 27 - year - old woman who believed she was being persecuted by two actors whom she often went to see at the theatre .
She believed that these people “ pursued her closely , taking the form of people she knows or meets ” .
1 Prosopagnosia
Prosopagnosia is a phenomenon in which a person is unable to recognize faces of people or objects that they should know .
People experiencing this disorder are usually able to use their other senses to recognize people – such as a person ’s perfume , the shape or style of their hair , the sound of their voice , or even their gait .
A classic case of this disorder was presented in the 1998 book ( and later Opera by Michael Nyman ) called “ The man who mistook his wife for a hat ” .
Aspirin Causes a Drop in Erections !
Much " scientific " research is pure fiction
Additional thoughts
( Natural News )
The latest attack on vitamins A , C , E , selenium and beta - carotene comes from the Cochrane Library , a widely - read source of information on conventional health matters .
In the paper published yesterday , these antioxidants were linked with a higher risk of mortality ( " they 'll kill you ! " ) , and now serious - sounding scientists have warned consumers away from taking vitamins altogether .
But with all the benefits of antioxidants already well known to the well - informed , how did the Cochrane Library arrive at such a conclusion ?
It 's easy :
The researchers considered 452 studies on these vitamins , and they threw out the 405 studies where nobody died !
That left just 47 studies where subjects died from various causes ( one study was conducted on terminal heart patients , for example ) .
From this hand - picked selection of studies , these researchers concluded that antioxidants increase mortality .
Just in case the magnitude of the scientific fraud taking place here has not yet become apparent , let me repeat what happened :
These scientists claimed to be studying the effects of vitamins on mortality , right ?
They were conducting a meta- analysis based on reviewing established studies .
But instead of conducting an honest review of all the studies , they arbitrarily decided to They did this by " excluding all studies in which no participants died . "
What was left to review ?
Only the studies in which people died from various causes .
Brilliant , huh ?
This sort of bass - ackward science would earn any teenager an " F " in high school science class .
But apparently it 's good enough for the Cochrane Library , not to mention all the mainstream press outlets that are now repeating these silly conclusions as scientific fact .
Using this same cherry - picking method for reviewing previous studies , I could find evidence to support practically any conclusion I wanted .
For example , let 's say that I took a look at 100 studies reviewing the effects of aspirin on erections .
And let 's suppose I arbitrarily decide to eliminate all the studies involving men , leaving only studies involving women .
I could then announce -- with the evidence to back it up -- that " Aspirin Linked with Drop in Erections ! "
Why ?
Because nobody in the groups I look at had any erections at all .
Sure , they 're all women , but that 's beside the point .
By arbitrarily removing selected studies from my analysis , I can " prove " just about anything , even if it 's utter nonsense .
The antioxidant study did the exact same thing by eliminating all studies in which people were kept alive and healthy while taking antioxidant vitamins .
Or , put another way , the lead researchers on this study purposely eliminated all the studies involving healthy people , leaving only the studies involving people who were about to die anyway ( like the chronically - diseased heart patients I mentioned earlier ) .
Never mind the fact that antioxidants might have actuallythe lives of some of these people by a few days or weeks -- the fact that they died while being treated with vitamins is enough , it seems , to point the finger at the vitamins themselves .
If a suicidal stock broker leaps from a tall building , and you hand him a vitamin C tablet on the way down , then it 's obviously the vitamin C that kills him , right ?
That 's the conclusion of this ridiculous study :
Take a bunch of patients who are about to die , load 'em up with antioxidants , and tally the inevitable death toll .
Then announce , with great fanfare , your findings that " Antioxidant Vitamins Increase Mortality !
" As you can see from this particular junk science study on antioxidants , the credibility of much of what happens under the guise of " science " is now so awful that I often wonder how many pharmaceuticals the researchers are on .
These people literally have to be on drugs to come up with such poorly - designed studies ( and to have the gumption to announce their results with a straight face , too ! ) .
Turns out I 'm not off the mark .
A recent survey infound that 20 percent of science academics use mind - altering drugs for non-medical reasons to boost academic performance .
That 's one out of five researchers engaged in illegal drug use !
This is a group that takes more mind - altering drugs than a Southern California hippy parade .
And then they turn around and come up with " scientific " studies that lack such credibility , even an intelligent child could see right through them .
Actually , it 's worse .
Because what we 're seeing in this antioxidant study is not merelyscience , butscience .
Bad science is created by bumbling idiots mucking around with clinical trial data , butscience is created by people who have an agenda ; people who have .
And that 's not real science , folks :
That 's just subterfuge with an agenda .
Agenda - driven scientific - sounding trickery has now replaced real science in much the same way that politicians ' pronouncements of " the economy is great ! " have replaced any real talk about the national debt .
The truth is no longer relevant , it seems .
What matters isand get the public to believe .
The illusion of science is now being routinely used to push a particular anti-vitamin agenda .
And guess who 's behind that agenda ?
Big Pharma , of course .
There 's no better way to trap consumers in a system of lifelong pharmaceutical treatment than to convince them that vitamins are not merely worthless , but perhaps even dangerous !
The unstated conclusion behind all this , by the way , is that " Drugs are therefore safe . "
If vitamins are dangerous , drugs must be the safe way to treat disease , right ?
Riiiight .
Drugs are safe , vitamins are dangerous , sunlight will kill you , water has no health benefits , fresh spinach is dangerous ... need I go on ?
These are the pronouncements of a system of medical idiocy that has gone so far beyond the limits of reason , they 've actually fallen off the edge of their own Flat Earth .
Next , they 'll be telling us that breaking a mirror brings you seven years of bad luck , or that if you keep a lucky rabbit 's foot in your pocket , pharmaceuticals will work better .
Because let 's face it :
When facts are no longer relevant , modern " science " becomes nothing more than superstition .
I do n't mean , by the way , that all modern science is meaningless .
There 's still a lot of great science going on these days .
But when I see " scientific " studies like the one reviewed here being published in the mainstream media , I have to wonder just how low the scientific standards have become today .
One thing for sure :
The " peer review " approach to science is a complete disaster .
All peer review does is protects entrenched ideas that should have been tossed out decades ago .
Peer review is a way for defenders of outmoded ideas to reject new ideas , and thus protect their careers and egos .
Peer review does n't work .
After all , it allows junk studies like the one described here to be readily published .
All peer review means is that as long as all the peers share the same illusions ( or biases ) , the paper will be published as scientific fact !
Do n't believe what you read in the science journals , folks .
At least not without engaging your own brain and thinking for a moment about who 's behind the study and what they 're trying to accomplish .
It 's quite clear that on this particular study , the aim is to scare consumers away from taking vitamins .
Now ask yourself :
Who would that benefit ?
The answer is rather obvious .

The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Unstoppable Bathroom Reader book .
In the 1960s , some miners put a phone booth in the middle of the Mojave Desert .
Long after they left , the booth remained ... waiting for someone to call .
HELLO ?
ANYBODY THERE ?
Miles from the nearest town , the old phone booth stood at the junction of two dirt roads .
Its windows were shot out ; the overhead light was gone .
Yet the phone lines on the endless rows of poles still popped and clicked in anticipation - just as they 'd been doing for nearly 30 years .
Finally , in 1997 , it rang .
The windows were shot out and the overhead light was gone , but the phone worked !
( photo : Azfoo.net )
A guy named Deuce had read about the booth and called the number ... and continued to call until a desert dweller named Lorene answered .
Deuce wrote a story about his call to nowhere , posted it on his website ... and the word spread through cyberspace .
Someone else called .
Then another person , and another - just to see if someone would answer .
And quite often someone did .
Only accessible by four wheel drive , the lonely phone booth soon became a destination .
Travelers drove for hours just to answer the phone .
One Texas man camped there for 32 days ... and answered more than 500 calls .
REACH OUT AND TOUCH SOMEONE
Someone posted a call log in the booth to record where people were calling from : as close as Los Angeles and as far away as New Zealand and Kosovo .
Why 'd they call ?
Some liked the idea of two people who 've never met - and probably never will - talking to each other .
Just sending a call out into the Great Void and having someone answer was reward enough for most .
Unfortunately , in 2000 the National Park Service and Pacific Bell tore down the famous Mojave phone booth .
Reason ?
It was getting too many calls .
The traffic ( 20 to 30 visitors a day ) was starting to have a negative impact on the fragile desert environment .
The old stop sign at the cattle grate still swings in the wind .
And the phone lines still pop and click in anticipation .
But all that 's left of the loneliest phone on Earth is a ghost ring .
So if the urge strikes you to dial ( 760 ) 733-9969 , be prepared to wait a very , very long time for someone to answer .
How you are feeling has an impact on your routine economic transactions , whether you ’re aware of this effect or not .
In a new study that links contemporary science with the classic philosophy of William James , a research team finds that people feeling sad and self - focused spend more money to acquire the same commodities than those in a neutral emotional state .
The team ’s paper , “ Misery is not Miserly : Sad and Self - Focused Individuals Spend More , ” will be published in the June 2008 edition of Psychological Science and will be presented at the Society for Social and Personality Psychology ’s Annual Meeting on Feb .
9 .
The new study follows up on earlier research that established a connection between sadness and buying .
Researchers Cynthia Cryder ( Carnegie Mellon University ) , Jennifer Lerner ( Harvard University ) , James J. Gross ( Stanford University ) , and Ronald E. Dahl ( University of Pittsburgh ) have now discovered that heightened self - focus drives the connection — a finding that expands understanding of consumer behavior and , more broadly , the impact of emotions on decision - making .
In the experiment , participants viewed either a sad video clip or one devoid of human emotion .
Afterward , participants could purchase an ordinary commodity , such as a water bottle , at various prices .
Participants randomly assigned to the sad condition offered almost 300 % more money to buy the product than “ neutral ” participants .
Notably , participants in the sadness condition typically insist , incorrectly , that the emotional content of the film clip did not carry over to affect their spending .
Self - focus helps to explain the spending differences between the two groups .
Among participants “ primed ” to feel sad , those who were highly self - focused paid more than those low in self - focus .
Notably , sadness tends to increase self - focus , making the increased spending prompted by sadness difficult to avoid .
Why might a combination of sadness and self - focus lead people to spend more money ?
Â
First , sadness and self - focus cause one to devalue both one ’s sense of self and one ’s current possessions .
Second , this devaluation increases a person ’s willingness to pay more for new material goods , presumably to enhance sense of self .
Notably , the “ misery is not miserly ” effect may be even more dramatic in real life , as the low - intensity sadness evoked in the experiment likely underestimates the power of intense sadness on spending behavior .
The effect could extend to domains beyond purchasing decisions , causing people to engage in increased stock trading , for example , or even to seek new relationships– without conscious awareness that they are being driven by their emotions .
The study is an early step toward uncovering the hidden impact of different , fluctuating , and what would otherwise seem irrelevant emotions on our day - to - day decisions .

Cassini Spacecraft to Dive Into Water Plume of Saturn Moon

PASADENA , Calif . - NASA 's Cassini spacecraft will make an unprecedented " in your face " flyby of Saturn 's moon Enceladus on Wed. , March 12 .
The spacecraft , orchestrating its closest approach to date , will skirt along the edges of huge Old - Faithful - like geysers erupting from giant fractures on the south pole of Enceladus .
Cassini will sample scientifically valuable water - ice , dust and gas in the plume .
The source of the geysers is of great interest to scientists who think liquid water , perhaps even an ocean , may exist in the area .
While flying through the edge of the plumes , Cassini will be approximately 200 kilometers ( 120 miles ) from the surface .
At closest approach to Enceladus , Cassini will be only 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from the moon .
" This daring flyby requires exquisite technical finesse , but it has the potential to revolutionize our knowledge of the geysers of Enceladus .
The Cassini mission team is eager to see the scientific results , and so am I , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Scientists and mission personnel studying the anatomy of the plumes have found that flying at these close distances poses little threat to Cassini because , despite the high speed of Cassini , the plume particles are small .
The spacecraft routinely crosses regions made up of dust - size particles in its orbit around Saturn .
Cassini 's cameras will take a back seat on this flyby as the main focus turns to the spacecraft 's particle analyzers that will study the composition of the plumes .
The cameras will image Enceladus on the way in and out , between the observations of the particle analyzers .
Images will reveal northern regions of the moon previously not captured by Cassini .
The analyzers will " sniff and taste " the plume .
Information on the density , size , composition and speed of the gas and the particles will be collected . "
There are two types of particles coming from Enceladus , one pure water - ice , the other water - ice mixed with other stuff , " said Sascha Kempf , deputy principal investigator for Cassini 's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , Germany .
" We think the clean water - ice particles are being bounced off the surface and the dirty water - ice particles are coming from inside the moon .
This flyby will show us whether this concept is right or wrong .
"
In 2005 , Cassini 's multiple instruments discovered that this icy outpost is gushing water vapor geysers out to a distance of three times the radius of Enceladus .
The moon is only 500 kilometers ( 310 miles ) in diameter , but despite its petite size , it ’s one of the most scientifically compelling bodies in our solar system .
The icy water particles are roughly one ten - thousandth of an inch , or about the width of a human hair .
The particles and gas escape the surface at jet speed at approximately 400 meters per second ( 800 miles per hour ) .
The eruptions appear to be continuous , refreshing the surface and generating an enormous halo of fine ice dust around Enceladus , which supplies material to one of Saturn 's rings , the E-ring .
Several gases , including water vapor , carbon dioxide , methane , perhaps a little ammonia and either carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas make up the gaseous envelope of the plume .
"
We want to know if there is a difference in composition of gases coming from the plume versus the material surrounding the moon .
This may help answer the question of how the plume formed , " said Hunter Waite , principal investigator for Cassini's Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the Southwest Research Institute , San Antonio .
This is the first of four Cassini flybys of Enceladus this year .
In June , Cassini completes its prime mission , a four - year tour of Saturn .
Cassini's next flyby of Enceladus is planned for August , well into Cassini 's proposed extended mission .
Cassini will perform seven Enceladus flybys in its extended mission .
If this encounter proves safe , future passes may bring the spacecraft even closer than this one .
How close Cassini will be allowed to approach will be determined based on data from this flyby .
The Cassini -Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .

Washington White House revises post - disaster protocol WASHINGTON --
The Bush administration is writing a new plan to maintain governmental control in the wake of an apocalyptic terrorist attack or overwhelming natural disaster , moving such doomsday planning for the first time from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to officials inside the White House .
The policy requires all government agencies to have clear lines of succession if top officials are killed and be prepared to operate from a new headquarters within 12 hours of a catastrophe .
They must be prepared " to lead and sustain the nation during a crisis " -- a charge ranging from " providing leadership visible to the nation and the world " to " bringing to justice perpetrators of crimes or attacks . "
The policy replaces a Clinton - era " continuity in government " post - disaster plan .
The old plan is classified , but security specialists and administration officials said the new policy centralizes control of such planning in the White House and puts a greater emphasis on terrorism spurring the catastrophe .
Bush quietly signed the new policy on May 4 .
The unclassified portion of his " homeland security - national security presidential directive " -- a special kind of executive order that can be kept secret -- was also posted on the White House website on May 9 , without any further announcement or press briefings .
The new policy focuses on a worst - case scenario in which a terrorist nuclear bomb explodes without warning and wipes out much of the nation 's top leadership .
Older plans were instead premised on a Cold War - era long - range missile attack , presuming it would be detected in enough time to evacuate the president and other top government officials .
" As a result of the asymmetric threat environment , adequate warning of potential emergencies that could pose a significant risk to the homeland might not be available , and therefore all continuity planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received , " the new policy states .
" Emphasis will be placed upon geographic dispersion of leadership , staff , and infrastructure in order to increase survivability and maintain uninterrupted government functions . "
The unexpected arrival of the new policy has received little attention in the mainstream media , but it has prompted discussion among legal specialists , homeland security experts and Internet commentators -- including concerns that the policy may be written in such a way that makes it too easy to invoke emergency presidential powers such as martial law .
Specifically , the policy creates a new " National Continuity Coordinator " inside the White House who is charged with ensuring all executive agencies have a plan by Aug.
4 to keep functioning if their leadership perishes in an attack .
The coordinator is also directed to help Congress , the Supreme Court , and state and local leaders prepare for a worst - case scenario .
The policy designates the president 's top adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism -- currently Frances Townsend -- as the national continuity director .
It also directs Townsend to consult National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and Vice President Dick Cheney .
The public portion of the new " National Continuity Policy " contains few details about how surviving officials would invoke emergency powers , or when emergency powers should be deemed to be no longer necessary so that the elected democracy can resume .
The answers to such questions may be contained in a classified appendix which has not been made public .
The unanswered questions have provoked anxiety across ideological lines .
The conservative commentator Jerome Corsi , for example , wrote in a much - linked online column that the directive looked like a recipe for allowing the office of the presidency to seize " dictatorial powers " because the policy does not discuss consulting Congress about when to invoke emergency powers -- or when to turn them off .
In addition , specialists at both the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think - tank , and the American Civil Liberties Union said they have taken calls and e-mails from people who are worried about what the new policy may portend .
James Carafano , a homeland security specialist at Heritage , criticized the administration for failing to inform the public that the new policy was coming , and why it was changing .
He said the White House did not recognize that discussion of emergency governmental powers is " a very sensitive issue for a lot of people , " adding that the lack of explanation is " appalling . "
But White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said that because of the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the American public needs no explanation of such plans .
" It 's well known that the vice president was in a secure , undisclosed location for a period of time for continuity - of - government reasons , so these considerations are not unknown to the American people in a post - 9/11 world , " he said .
Some homeland security and legal specialists say that anxieties about the new plan may be exaggerated .
The government has had versions of a doomsday response plan dating back to the Cold War , although this is apparently the first time the White House has made a portion of the plan public .
" Any time any leaders are talking about the destruction of our government and the disruption of traditional ideas of representative government , that is something we all have to be concerned about and it should be discussed , " said Michael German , ACLU policy counsel .
" And that is one reason why I appreciate that this document has been made public . "
The Bush administration in general " is very secretive , " he added , " so I do n't think we should be entirely critical of what 's in [ the plan ] because I think we want to encourage them to release information like this . "
Nevertheless , some legal specialists say that the White House should be more specific about its worst - case scenario plans , pointing out two unanswered questions : what circumstances would trigger implementation of the plan and what legal limits the White House recognizes on its own emergency powers .
The policy broadly defines a " catastrophic emergency " -- the triggering event for the plan -- as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions . "
Sharon Bradford Franklin , the senior counsel at the Constitution Project , a bipartisan think - tank that promotes constitutional safeguards , said the policy 's definition " is so broad that it raises serious concerns about when and how this might be used to authorize unchecked executive action . "
But Johndroe said it was necessary for a loosely - worded definition because the goverment can't be sure what kind of emergency might arise .
" I do n't think you want to have anything in the directive that would tie the president 's hands from being able to implement emergency action , " he said .
The policy also does not contain a direct reference to statutes in which Congress has imposed checks and balances on the president 's power to impose martial law or other extraordinary measures .
For example , the policy does not explicitly acknowledge the National Emergencies Act , a post - Watergate law that gives Congress the right to override the president 's determination that a national emergency still exists , activating the president 's emergency powers .
The policy says that it " shall be implemented consistent with applicable law , " but it does not say which laws are " applicable . "
Because the Bush legal team has pushed a controversial theory that the Constitution gives the president an unwritten power to disobey laws at his own discretion to protect national security , some specialists said that the vagueness of the policy is troubling .
Asked if the White House believes that the National Emergencies Act is a constitutional constraint on executive power and thus would apply , Johndroe repeated only that " Anything developed would be consistent with all applicable laws . "

They say the best things in life are free .
Beyond a shadow of a doubt , the list below proves that statement to be true .
Life is filled with simple pleasures , the little satisfying effects you never really anticipate , but always take great pleasure in .
They are the gifts of life that we each subconsciously celebrate in our own unique way .
Here are 30 of the most satisfying simple pleasures life has to offer :
Sleeping
In on a Rainy Day –
As the rain beats lightly against the window , you nestle your head deeper into your pillow .
The sound is soothing and your bed feels like a sanctuary .
There is no place you would rather be .
Finding Money You Did n’t Know You Had –
You reach into your pocket and find a $ 20 bill from the last time you wore these jeans .
You are n’t rich , but you are richer than you were a second earlier .
Making Brief Eye Contact with Someone of the Opposite Sex –
You pass her on the street or in the subway .
She glances up at you momentarily , making direct eye contact in a way that seems to communicate a subtle curiosity .
For a split second it makes you think … and then it ’s gone .
Skinny Dipping –
There is something mysteriously liberating about being naked in a body of water .
You are naked , but it feels natural , a sense of unrefined freedom .
Receiving a Real Letter or Package via Snail Mail – E-mail has become the primary source of written communication .
Most snail mail these days is junk mail .
When you check the mail and find a real letter or package from someone you know , excitement overtakes you as you tear into this rare gift .
Making the Yellow Light –
It ’s one of the most common simple pleasures , the act of beating the pack .
As you blaze through the yellow light you glance in your rearview to see all the cars behind you stopping at the red light .
Yes !
You made it !
Telling a Funny or Interesting , True Story – One of the most enticing roles you lead in life is that of the storyteller .
You love to share stories , especially those that will captivate your audience with deep curiosity and humor .
There are few things more satisfying than telling a true story that others enjoy listening to .
Seeing a Friend Stumble Over Himself –
As you walk across the street with your friend , he fails to accurately address the curb on the other side .
He trips and stumbles around momentarily before regaining his footing , then swiftly attempts to play it off like nothing happened .
This can be a hilarious sight if the moment is right .
Hearing the Right Song at the Right Moment –
It does n’t matter what the setting is , hearing the right song for that moment is one of those simple pleasures in life that instantly lifts your spirits .
You could be driving home from work , hanging out at a bar with friends , or jogging .
When the right song rattles your ear drums the entire meaning of life seems crystal clear .
The First Sip of a Beverage When You ’re Thirsty – You just finished mowing the lawn or taking a long jog .
The only thing on your mind is an ice - cold glass of water .
When you are really , really thirsty , that first sip of any liquid beverage is sheer bliss .
Catching a Glimpse of Bare Skin on the Opposite Sex – For guys , it ’s when the waitress bends over a little too far .
For girls it ’s seeing that buff guy in a Speedo .
Either way , when you see a bit more skin than you were expecting on the opposite sex , you ca n’t help but to smirk on the inside .
Saying the Same Thing Simultaneously – There is a moment of silence .
Then all of the sudden you and your friend blurt out the same exact set of words simultaneously .
This rare occurrence is something to smile about .
The Pull - Through Parking Spot –
You pull into a parking spot and are delighted to see the availability of the parking spot immediately in front of you .
You pull through to the spot in front so that when you return to the car you can drive forward out of the parking spot .
Why ?
Because driving backwards is a pain in the butt .
Realizing You Have More Time to Sleep – Something abruptly awakens you and you think it ’s time to get up .
Then you squint over at your alarm clock and realize you still have 2 more hours to sleep .
A warm euphoric feeling shoots though your body as you glide gracefully back to your dreams .
People Watching – Sitting there on your bench you can see people in every direction .
Tall people , small people , thin and plump .
Blond , brunette , and redhead alike .
Each of them has a different stride and a unique expression .
As you drift from body to body you are mesmerized by what you see .
Putting On Clothes Straight from the Dryer – As soon as the dryer buzzes , you pull out your clothes and put them on .
They feel soothingly warm on your skin and emit a fresh - scented aroma into the air .
A sentiment of ease comes over you as you head out to conquer the day .
A Familiar Smell –
You just pulled into your parent ’s driveway and opened the car door .
You have n’t been home in a long while .
You smell familiarity in the air , the scent of a large pine tree in the neighbor ’s yard .
As you head through the front door , more familiar smells consume your senses .
Gosh , it feels good to be home …
The Feeling You Get When Your Idea Works –
You have been struggling to resolve a complex problem all day and you just ca n’t seem to get it right .
Filled with frustration , you decide to exercise one last idea before calling it a night .
You ’ve had many ideas before that failed miserably … but this time it works .
Fresh , Clean Bed Sheets –
You yank at the corner of the bedspread to create just enough space to slide your body under the freshly cleaned sheets .
The sheets feel cool to the touch .
Everything seems so clean , like nobody has ever slept in this bed before .
A Beautiful View –
As the car veers around the side of the mountain you gaze out the passenger window .
It ’s a clear , sunny day and you can see the entire valley below filled with wild flowers and bright green vegetation .
The scenery reminds you of something you once saw in National Geographic .
But here it is live , right before your eyes .
Reminiscing About Old Times with Your Closest Friends – Pink Floyd once said “ the memories of a man in his old age are the deeds of a man in his prime ” .
There is no simple pleasure more satisfying than recounting the greatest moments of your life with your closest friends who lived these moments alongside you .
Receiving an Unexpected Compliment –
It ’s been an average day .
Nothing really great has happened , but nothing terrible occurred either .
This monotonous day has put you in a dreary mood .
Unexpectedly , an older , attractive lady taps you on the shoulder , calls you “ handsome ” and says she loves your shirt .
The day just got a whole lot better .
Having a Good Laugh – Laughter is the greatest cure of all .
Life is extraordinary in the moments when you are laughing so hard you can barely breathe .
These moments of deep laughter are divine in the sense that they cleanse your mood and set your mind on a positive track .
The Feeling After a Healthy Workout – It ’s a giddy feeling of self accomplishment ; the one true activity that actually makes you feel better and look better simultaneously .
When you walk out the front door of the gym you are on top of the world .
The Celebration in the Instant Something Makes Sense – Even now that it has explained to you for the third time , you just do n’t understand how it works .
Everyone else seems to understand but you .
Then out of the blue the dots connect in your mind .
You finally get it , and it feels great !
Relaxing Outdoors on a Sunny Day –
As you relax sprawled out in a lawn chair , the sun warms your skin and a light breeze keeps the temperature comfortable .
Birds are chirping merrily in the trees behind you .
You are at complete peace with the environment .
Holding Hands with Someone You Love – Every time she grabs your hand you are overcome with an awareness of how much she means to you .
Holding hands is sensual and physically intimate , yet subtle .
There are few people you allow to hold your hand , so when it happens you can be sure that the moment is special .
Playing in the Water – Water marvels people of all ages .
From jumping in puddles as a child , to doing cannon balls in the pool as an adolescent , to enjoying a cocktail in the Jacuzzi as an adult … water is enjoyable .
Making Someone Smile –
You notice that your colleague has been under a great deal of stress with meeting a deadline , so you take it upon yourself to complete one of her indirect responsibilities for her .
As soon as she realizes what you did , she comes into your office with a big smile on her face .
“ Thank you ” , she says .
You just hit two birds with one stone , because making her smile just made your day .
Finishing What You Started –
You just finished up a big project you ’ve been working on for the last few months , or maybe you just finished your first marathon …
Either way , you finalized what you set out to accomplish .
The feeling of self accomplishment you get when you finish what you started is by far one of the most rewarding simple pleasures life has to offer .
A comprehensive list of life ’s simple pleasures would be quite extensive .
My list represents those which are most satisfying to a sample of people in and around my life .
With a few sporadic exceptions , I believe these simple pleasures hold universal appeal .

Luis " Al " Solari picked up his two sons from school Wednesday after a 10 - hour day installing appliances , then began the rush - hour drive south on Interstate 280 to get his wife at the end of her workday .
As the 37 - year - old Richmond resident battled traffic and the fading sunlight , he apparently cut off another motorist near Alemany Boulevard - and was fatally shot for it , police said Thursday .
His sons , seat - belted in the back of the burgundy Honda as Solari slumped over , could do nothing as the car spun from one side of the freeway to the other before stopping in some ice plants .
They were not injured , but their father was dead .
Police said the shooting , the second deadly assault on a Bay Area freeway in a week , was the result of road rage by someone in a car that pulled alongside Solari 's car and fired several shots .
Investigators said they had little to go on other than that the shooter was in a light - colored sedan with two other men .
At the family 's home on Thursday , Solari 's youngest son , 7 - year - old Lorenzo , matter - of - factly recounted what happened to his dad .
" I saw three guys in a car , " said the boy , his mother at his side .
" They were making a mean face at Daddy and Daddy made a mean face at them .
" One of the guys in the car stuck his hand out the window and shot Daddy in the tummy .
He prayed and fell down , " the boy said .
" He was breathing and then he stopped .
I looked at his stomach and he was bleeding .
And then his mouth was bleeding . "
Solari's wife , meanwhile , was on a San Francisco street corner , at Mission and Foote , waiting for him and her children .
" I called him at 6:20 and chewed him out on his voice mail .
He 's never late , " said Lilia Guzman - Solari , 30 , who recently returned to work as an administrative assistant at UCSF after taking time off to raise her children .
She became worried , calling again at 6:40 .
By 7 p.m. she was furious , thinking he had taken the boys to a baseball game and forgotten about her .
She called him a few more times , then walked to her cousin 's house , where a housemate mentioned a fatal accident on I -280 .
" After that it was chaotic , " she said Thursday , her eyes welling .
" I was yelling .
We went to the hospital and they told me he was gone . "
Solari had worked as an appliance installer and truck driver for 18 years at Cherin 's Appliance in San Francisco 's Mission District .
He had an excellent driving record and no problems with anger or road rage , his employer said .
" He was the sweetest , most pleasurable guy to be around , " said co-owner Donald Cherin , who hired Solari just after Solari graduated from San Francisco 's Mission High .
" Even under stress , he was never frazzled . "
On his days off , Solari often helped friends move or work on their house projects .
Around his neighborhood in Richmond 's Iron Triangle , he acted as a father figure to dozens of youngsters .
He played baseball and basketball with them , took them to games , barbecued hot dogs for them and always welcomed them into his home , neighbors said .
" There are a lot of single moms here , and he helped them out and helped nurture all the children , " said Audrey Antoine , who has lived down the street from the family for about nine years .
" The children will have a real void in their lives .
Al will truly , truly be missed . "
Solari was looking forward to hosting a barbecue for family and friends later this month to celebrate his 38th birthday .
After that , he and his wife were going to start looking for a new house , someplace safer to raise their children .
Now , everything 's on hold .
Guzman - Solari said her main priority is helping her sons cope with witnessing their father 's violent death .
" I have to be calm and strong for them , " she said .
" If they see me fall apart , they 'll fall apart . "
On April 3 , a woman driving a car on Interstate 80 in Pinole was shot and killed .
A suspect was arrested in that case Wednesday in Las Vegas .
On April 1 , a man driving on the same stretch of freeway was shot and injured near Hilltop Drive in Richmond .
BOSTON — Baseball fever is building this month with pitchers and catchers reporting for spring training and pitching great Roger Clemens dodging questions from members of Congress about performance - enhancing drugs .
Off the field , meanwhile , the art and science of prediction is coming of age .
Super stat - masters are getting better and better at predicting the best baseball players and even the best managers for a team .
High performing offensive players , such as home run kings and RBI leaders , tend to garner the big contracts and fan ratings .
But statisticians presenting here today at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science have figured out how to measure trickier and sometimes more important aspects of the game , such as fielding performance ( the probability of catching and throwing well enough to make an out ) and managerial decisions ( such as taking out a tired starting pitcher before he gives up a game - losing grand slam ) .
Shane T. Jensen of the University of Pennsylvania has come up with a statistical way to compare the fielding performance of every Major League Baseball player with the average performance for all players in each position .
Using stats from the 2002 to 2005 seasons and dividing the field up into smaller zones for analysis than previous modelers have done , he confirmed the opinions of many of fans and commentators about the abilities of well - known fielders .
Coco Crisp , Gary Matthews Jr. , Reed Johnson and Andruw Jones are among the best outfielders , whereas Manny Ramirez , Bobby Higginson and Wily Mo Pena are among the worst .
" Things like hitting and pitching are a little easier to quantify because they are easier to tabulate , there are a finite number of outcomes , " Jensen said .
" Fielding is a harder endeavor " to evaluate , he said , because players are ranging toward a ball in play on a continuous surface .
Jeter irony
Some revealing results came up when Jensen looked at shortstops .
Alex Rodriguez and Clint Barnes came up as top fielders , while Derek Jeter and Michael Young ranked among the top 10 worst fielders .
For the New York Yankees then , the irony is that A - Rod has one of the best fielding performances among shortstops , Jensen 's stats show , ( based on Rodriguez 's 2002 - 2003 season with the Texas Rangers ) , but he currently plays out of position at third base for the team in deference to one of the worst defensive shortstops ( team captain Jeter ) .
But Jeter might not need to watch his back now that this research is out .
" I do n't think we 're on Derek Jeter 's radar , " Jensen said .
Managing managers
Steve C. Wang of Swarthmore College said he has come up with a way to use 2007 season statistics to give a detailed picture of managers ' strategic tendencies .
For instance , do they tend to leave pitchers in or yank them quickly ?
Do they tend to signal for bunts or stolen bases ?
Do they tend to leave relief pitchers in for longer than one inning ?
Wang 's statistical approach allows a comparison of managers to see which ones cluster together in terms of managerial style .
One irony he uncovered is a comparison of former Boston Red Sox Manager Grady Little and current manager Terry Francona , who succeeded Little in 2004 , the first year the team won the World Series in 86 years .
Little was widely criticized for leaving pitcher Pedro Martinez in too long in the 2003 American League Championship Series against the Yankees .
But Francona measures about the same when it comes to tendency to leave in a starting pitcher , Wang said .
Wang 's comparative managerial analysis could be useful to teams trying to assess which manager might best fit a team 's needs , he said .
Steroids controversy
Some analysts are trying to evaluate the influence of performance - enhancing drugs on baseball players ' stats , but it 's nearly impossible to make the link stick statistically , Jensen said .
Nonetheless , statistics can suggest which players one might want to test more than others , said presenter David Pinto , a former ESPN analyst who now writes primarily for his blog BaseballMusings.com .
" I think we know that if we see someone in his 30s having a huge career surge , that should raise a red flag , " Pinto said .
" That can happen , but if it happens over two to three years , I might want to test him every month rather than twice a year . "
Pinto , Wang and Jensen said baseball fans will see more focus in the future on fielding statistics .
Some observers say the Boston Red Sox ( World Series Champions also in 2007 ) rely more heavily on statistics to guide strategy than other teams , however , baseball teams have always leaned heavily on statistics to analyze player performance , said New York Times columnist Alan Schwarz , a discussant during the presentations .
" They just do n't make quite as much a fuss of it , fans do n't make as much a fuss about it and their teams are n't the World Champions , " he said .

The economy may be on the verge of a downturn but no one seems to have told the City 's financial whizzkids .
While the rest of us struggle with stagnant house prices , slowing economic growth and soaring living costs , the Square Mile 's fat cats are bracing themselves for another bumper bonus .
More than a third of City staff received higher bonus payments than last year .
Seventy per cent said their payouts either matched or exceeded their expectations , a survey of financial services employees showed yesterday .
The bonuses could amount to an estimated £ 7 billion this year , shy of the record £ 8.8 billion paid in 2006 but still an extraordinary amount of money given the problems afflicting the banking sector .
The biggest payments are likely to go to employees of leading investment banks and hedge funds , such as Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers .
Goldman has earned the nickname " Golden Sacks " thanks to the generosity of its payouts .
Chairman and chief executive Lloyd Blankfein was paid £ 35 million last year , a record for an investment banking boss .
Barclays Capital president Bob Diamond is on track to qualify for pay and bonuses of at least £ 15 million this year .
The bonus payments are based on bankers ' performances in 2007 , when the world economy was starting to suffer from the credit crunch .
Recruitment firm Morgan McKinley , which commissioned the survey , says the City jobs market has slowed in recent months , but this has clearly not fed through to performance - related payouts .
City number - crunchers are clearly still not feeling the pain , with 71 per cent of firms surveyed saying their bonus pots were " similar or larger " than in 2007 .
Of the individuals polled , 67 per cent said they were " satisfied " with their payouts .
Around half of London 's bankers are thought to have been told about their bonuses .
The figures are usually determined in December and January and most employees are told about them by the middle of February .
The money then arrives in their bank accounts by March , often leading to a boom in sales of
high - end sports cars , yachts and luxury flats .
Estate agents estimate £ 5 billion in City bonus money was pumped into London property last year .
Predictions that this could slump to £ 2 billion this year now look pessimistic .
The news will infuriate many ordinary families who are suffering as a result of highly - paid bankers ' disastrous speculation on America 's property market .
This caused the global credit crunch , which has led to dearer loans and mortgages .
The Bank of England warned on Wednesday that lenders are being forced to ration the supply of credit to their customers because their businesses are in such poor shape .
Banks are recording losses of hundreds of billions of dollars because of the crunch .
Robert Thesiger , chief executive of Morgan McKinley 's parent firm Imprint , said : " Following a record bonus round in 2006 / 2007 , speculation surrounding this year 's bonuses was enormous .
" However , putting the impact of the credit crunch aside , 2007 was still a strong year for financial services and for the majority , bonus payouts appear to reflect this .
" These findings show that most employees received a similar or higher bonus payout than last year .
Investment banks have managed expectations well . "
The poll said basic salaries rose across all City pay levels , with the average rising 5 per cent .
Bradford & Bingley profits plunge after jump in mortgage arrears
Banks reacted with alarm last night after Bradford and Bingley reported a sharp rise in mortgage arrears and bad debts and a slump in profits .
Its shares plummeted 56 to 187 yesterday after it was revealed that profits fell by 49 per cent last year to £ 126 m .
The bank 's problems point to a crisis for millions of Britons who are struggling to cope with punishing mortgage bills and the spiralling cost of energy , food and transport .
B&B revealed £ 226 million of " exceptional " charges , some of which are linked to the failure of loans tied to the disastrous U.S. mortgage market .
Thousands of the customers of the bank , which specialises in selling buy - to - let mortgages and sub - prime home loans , are clearly under pressure .
The number who are more than three months in arrears rose from 4,337 in 2006 to 6,170 at the end of the year - up by 43 per cent .
Write - offs for bad debts on mortgages tripled to £ 22.5 million in 2007 , while the management admitted there is every chance of further losses .
Aggressive mortgage lending by B&B , which has been offering loans worth up to 130 per cent of a property 's value , appears to have backfired .
There is evidence the bank is now taking a tough line with some of the people who are struggling to make repayments with threats of court action for repossession .
Numis Securities analyst James Hamilton added : " Arrears are up 43 per cent and we expect this trend to get materially worse as the UK economy slows to below trend growth in 2008 . "
The figure of £ 226 million for exceptional charges was some three times higher than expected by the City .
Mamoun Tazi , an analyst at MF Global Securities , said : " The headline numbers are horrible . "
He suggested there had been some " unacceptable " failures by the management to minimise the bank 's exposure to the global credit crunch .
New of B&&B 's problems led share prices in other high street names , including Alliance &Leicester , to be marked down .
The troubles at Northern Rock have turned the spotlight on banks such as B&B , which borrow heavily on international money markets to fund their mortgage loans .
The day after her victories in Ohio , Texas , and Rhode Island , Sen . Hillary Clinton was scheduled to take some time off , but she went ahead and gave interviews to four major early - morning TV shows .
She started the following day at her Washington , D.C. , home with conference calls to plan the next phase of her presidential campaign .
Then she hopped into a car and headed for a 1:30 p.m. meeting with retired military officers who have endorsed her candidacy .
On the way , she spent nearly a half - hour on the phone with U.S. News and talked about politics , policy , and charisma .
Excerpts :
On how she won the last round of states March 4
We had a great operation in the three states we won .
A lot of people counted us out , but I campaigned as hard as I could , and I was in states where you know sometimes people themselves feel like they 've been counted out .
But they keep fighting and coming back .
And I think that I 'm talking about the issues in a way that makes sense to voters .
You know , we 've got so many challenges ahead of us .
And I 'm very specific in telling people what I would do as president because I want them to hold me accountable .
I think that it 's important after the seven years of President Bush 's administration that we really tell people what we mean and mean what we say to them .
On Barack Obama
Each of us has a record .
We 'll be putting out my record and where appropriate drawing the comparisons and asking questions about where he stands .
I 'm focused right now on going to Mississippi , where I 'm going to be tonight .
On the limits of charisma
I really do believe that words matter and they have the ability to inspire , which is critically important in politics and governing , and I have no doubt that that is a major part of whatever the equation is for someone winning elections .
It 's also important that there be action and experience to back up words because you 've got to be able to produce results for people .
At the end of the day , it really matters whether you have delivered on what you 've promised and whether people are better off than they were when you started .
I obviously believe that I can speak well enough to communicate to voters and to enlist their support .
But that 's not why I ask them to support me .
I ask them to support me because of what I 've done for 35 years and that I want them to hold me accountable because I believe that it does take strength and experience to make change .
And it 's not an either - or issue .
Words matter , but actions matter more .
On how the current campaign compares with past campaigns
You know , Ken , this is one of the more civil campaigns I 've been through [ laughs ] .
I mean , really .
Maybe that says something about all the campaigns that I 've been involved in , but I think the comparisons that we 're drawing , at least up until now , have been totally fair .
They 're not personal .
They 're on the issues and positions and campaign tactics .
I really look back on all of the campaigns I 've been part of , and this is probably the most civil and most positive one in my memory .
On a " do - over " in Florida and Michigan , which held nominating contests that broke Democratic Party rules
I would not accept a caucus .
I think that would be a great disservice to the 2 million people who turned out and voted .
I think that they want their votes counted .
And you know a lot of people would be disenfranchised because of the timing and whatever the particular rules were .
This is really going to be a serious challenge for the Democratic Party because the voters in Michigan and Florida are the ones being hurt , and certainly with respect to Florida the Democrats were dragged into doing what they did by a Republican governor and a Republican Legislature .
They did n't have any choice whatsoever .
And I do n't think that there should be any do - over or any kind of a second run in Florida .
I think Florida should be seated .
On saying in a TV interview that she might choose Obama as her running mate
I think that it probably did [ get more attention than she expected ] because I was responding to the great yearning in the hearts of Democrats that we be united and that we come together as soon as this nominating process is complete and really go into the fall elections with a lot of strength .
And obviously many people have talked to me about what would make that come true .
And I think that it 's presumptuous to be specific , but clearly there 's a lot of interest in that .
On appearing on Saturday Night Live and Jon Stewart 's The Daily Show
SAN DIEGO ( AP )  Border Patrol agents are firing tear gas and powerful pepper - spray weapons across the border into Mexico to repel what the agency says are an increasing number of attacks by assailants hurling stones , bottles and bricks .
The counteroffensive has drawn complaints that innocent families are being caught in the cross -fire .
Esther Arias Medina , 41 , fled her shanty in Tijuana with her 3 - week - old grandson last week in the midst of an attack .
The boy had begun coughing , Ms. Arias said , after smoke seeped through the walls of the three - room home , which she shares with six others .
“ We do n’t deserve this , ” she said .
“ The people who live here do n’t throw rocks .
Those are people who come from the outside .
But we ’re paying the price . ”
The U.S. Department of Defense announced Monday that Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , a Tanzanian captured after a gunfight in Gujrat , Pakistan , in July 2004 , would be the fifteenth Guantánamo prisoner to be tried by military commission , in connection with his alleged involvement in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 , 1998 .
Specifically , Ghailani is charged with " murder in violation of the Law of War , murder of protected persons , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and terrorism "  plus conspiracy to commit all the preceding offenses  for his alleged role in securing and transporting material used in the Tanzanian bomb , and for helping to purchase the truck that was used in the attack .
He is also charged with " providing material support to terrorism , " based on allegations that , after the bombing , he fled to Afghanistan , where he continued working for al - Qaeda " as a document forger , physical trainer at an al - Qaeda training camp , and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden . "
Ghailani is the sixth of the 14 so - called " high - value detainees "  those held in secret , CIA - run prisons , who were transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006  to be put forward for trial by military commission .
He joins Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Ramzi bin al - Shibh , Mustafa al - Hawsawi , Ali Abdul Aziz Ali , and Walid bin Attash ( plus Mohammed al - Qahtani , a notorious victim of torture in Guantánamo ) , who were put forward for trial in February in connection with the 9/11 attacks .
The novel " War on Terror " trials , conceived by Dick Cheney and his advisers in November 2001 , have yet to secure a conviction ( the closest they came was the plea bargain negotiated with the Australian David Hicks last year , who returned home to serve just seven months in prison ) and have been plagued by controversy since their inception .
Damned by their own military defense lawyers , derailed by their own government - appointed judges , dismissed by the Supreme Court and then resuscitated by a somnambulant Congress , they are currently limping toward trials in the cases of the Canadian Omar Khadr , who was just 15 years old when he was captured and whose alleged murder of a U.S. soldier is seriously contested by his legal team , and Salim Hamdan , a Yemeni who was one of Osama bin Laden ’s drivers .
The commissions have stumbled at the arraignment phase in two other cases , those of Mohamed Jawad , an Afghan who was just 16 years old when he allegedly threw a grenade at a vehicle carrying two U.S. soldiers and an Afghan translator , and Ahmed al - Darbi , a Saudi who was seized in Azerbaijan and is accused of plotting to attack shipping lanes in the Middle East .
More significantly , the commissions appear to be fatally contaminated by allegations of torture , raising doubts that they can secure a single " clean " conviction that will be regarded as legitimate anywhere beyond the administration itself and its dwindling crowd of cheerleaders .
In this , the case of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani appears to be no exception .
Ghailani did not allege , during his military tribunal last year , that he was tortured ( unlike Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Rahim al - Nashiri , whose torture by waterboarding was recently admitted by CIA director Michael Hayden ) , but during my research for The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison , I discovered a piece of information that indicated that , whether under duress or by some other method , he had made a false allegation against one of the prisoners at Guantánamo .
One of the more disturbing aspects of the gathering of evidence used against the Guantánamo prisoners is the accumulation of allegations from the initial Combatant Status Review Tribunals , convened from July 2004 to March 2005 to assess whether the prisoners had been correctly designated as " enemy combatants , " through successive rounds of annual Administrative Review Boards , convened to assess whether they still constitute a threat to the United States or still have ongoing intelligence value .
In tracing the accumulation of allegations , an enormous number of claims are attributed to " a senior al - Qaeda operative " or " a senior al - Qaeda lieutenant . "
With no names given , it has been impossible to establish the source of these claims , although they are frequently so at odds with a previously established chronology of the prisoner ’s actions  placing them at training camps and in guest houses when they were not even in Afghanistan , for example  that it ’s readily apparent that many , if not most , of these allegations were produced under duress , probably when supposed " high - value detainees " were being shown the " family album " of prisoners that was used from the earliest days of the U.S. - run prisons in Afghanistan , in late December 2001 .
On one occasion only I discovered that one of these " al - Qaeda " sources had been named and was none other than Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani .
As I explained in Chapter 20 of The Guantánamo Files , " The Yemeni Mohammed al - Hanashi admitted to his tribunal in 2004 that he arrived in Afghanistan eight or nine months before 9/11 , and that he fought with the Taliban .
By the time of his review in 2005 , however , new allegations had been added , including the claim that Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani ‘ identified him as having been at the al - Farouq camp [ the main training camp for Arabs , associated in the years before 9/11 with Osama bin Laden ] in 1998 - 99 prior to moving on to the front lines in Kabul . ’
In other words , although al - Hanashi admitted traveling to Afghanistan to serve as a foot soldier for the Taliban , a man who was held in extremely dubious circumstances in another part of the world was shown his photo and came up with a story about seeing him two or three years before his arrival in Afghanistan , which would , henceforth , be regarded as evidence against him . "
It will , of course , be some time before Ghailani ’s case comes to trial , as Col. Steve David , the commissions ’ chief defense lawyer , is already struggling to find enough military lawyers to represent those who have already been charged , but it ’s clear from just this one example , which accidentally slipped through the net , that the quality of Ghailani ’s confessions will be contentious , and that questions will be raised about the circumstances in which they were gathered .
The great irony in his case is that the main evidence against him came not from the two years and two months that he was held in secret CIA custody , but from the testimony of a number of other men , including Mohamed al - Owhali , Wadih El - Hage , Mohammed Sadiq Odeh , and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed , who , although captured abroad and " rendered " to U.S. territory in 1998 and 1999 , were transferred to face a criminal trial , rather than being held in the ad - hoc system of secret prisons run by the CIA that developed after 9/11 .
They were subsequently interrogated , charged , successfully prosecuted for their involvement in the African embassy bombings in October 2001 , and sentenced to life imprisonment , without the use of any of the torture techniques ( euphemistically known as " enhanced interrogation techniques " ) that the Bush administration introduced in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
Although there are other complications in the cases of the African embassy bombers  not least the role of double agent Ali Mohammed and the lack of communication between the CIA and the FBI  the fact that successful prosecutions could take place without the use of torture should have sent a clear message to the Bush administration , just weeks before Dick Cheney stealthily authorized the president to capture suspected terrorists anywhere in the world , designate them " enemy combatants , " hold them without charge or trial and , if required , try them before military commissions , that there were other ways to engage a terrorist threat without resorting to torture , imprisonment without charge , and dubious show trials .
I ’d forgotten just how much fun ETech is .
Not only are the talks some of the most creative and innovative you can hear in the tech community , the room full of people is one of the most congenial , smart and funny you ’re likely to encounter anywhere .
Tim O’Reilly wo n’t come out and say that it ’s his favorite conference , but he ’s willing to declare it the most important that his organization puts on .
I was only able to be in San Diego for one of the days of the conference – long enough to catch several excellent talks , but briefly enough that I ’m relying on Ryan Singel of Wired to catch talks that I ’m very sorry to miss : Larry Lessig ’s plans to change congress ; Quinn Norton , who ’s now thinking about hacking her brain as well as her body ; Joel Selanikio ’s celebration of the mobile phone as a tool for transforming Africa .
Singel did an excellent job with my talk as well , The Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism .
I was grateful to have the excuse to explore at more length some of the ideas I ’ve been writing about for the past year , and was gratified that the talk was well received .
There were several requests for me to post the slides – that ’s not really realistic , as they were 100MB and rather video - rich – what I ’m going to do instead is post my notes , a bunch of links and a few of the slides .
This wo n’t be an accurate picture of what I said – it ’s more likely to be a picture of what I meant to say .
Web 1.0 was invented to allow physicists to share research papers .
Web 2.0 was created to allow people to share pictures of cute cats .
I had a front - row seat for this transition , working with Tripod .
We sincerely believed that the purpose of the web was to give college graduates helpful information about renting apartments , applying for jobs and investing their money .
Our users rapidly told us that what the web was really about was publishing their own information … which left us with the difficult challenge of figuring out how to make money off of people ’s collections of cat pictures .
User - generated content , on average , is a lot less interesting than professional content .
But there are a lot more people creating their own content for fun than those doing so for a living , and in aggregate , that content is at least as interesting .
Based on my Tripod experience , I ’d offer the hypothesis that any sufficiently advanced read / write technology will get used for two purposes : pornography and activism .
Porn is a weak test for the success of participatory media – it ’s like tapping a mike and asking , “ Is it on ? ”
If you ’re not getting porn in your system , it does n’t work .
Activism is a stronger test – if activists are using your tools , it ’s a pretty good indication that your tools are useful and usable .
In late 1996 , we noticed that Tripod was receiving a great deal of traffic from Malaysia .
Searching through the server logs , we found lots of pages in Bahasa Malay talking about “ Reformasi ” and “ Anwar Ibrahim ” .
I had to visit the Political Science department at Williams College to figure out that we were apparently hosting much of the Malaysian opposition political movement , dedicated to helping deposed and imprisoned deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim return to power .
Malaysian media was largely closed to opposition voices , but investment in internet infrastructure meant that the opposition was able to access the internet and publish material that could n’t be disseminated any other way .
( Several of these pages still exist on Tripod . )
A more economically rational company would have likely removed the Malaysian content , as we had no way of selling ads to Malaysian advertisers .
Economic rationality was never Tripod ’s strong suit , and we ended up sponsoring Malaysia ’s olympic team instead .
( They took the silver in Men ’s team badminton . )
With web 2.0 , we ’ve embarced the idea that people are going to share pictures of their cats , and now we build sophisticated tools to make that easier to do .
as a result , we ’re creating a wealth of tech that ’s extremely helpful for activists .
There are twin revolutions going on – the ease of creating content and the ease of sharing it with local and global audiences .
There ’s been understandable excitement about use of online video by the Obama campaign .
I was in Doha , Qatar , when Larry Lessig showed the above video as an example of the way that remix culture could reinvigorate American political culture .
Others have pointed to the video as an example of “ user - generated swiftboating “ , and the potential for amateur nastiness to be even more evil than our debased professional political culture .
I was sitting next to Tunisian activist Sami ben Gharbia at the meeting in Doha , and he nudged me , saying , “ We did this years ago in Tunisia . ”
I thought he meant the idea of using video to motivate voters .
Actually , he meant that Tunisian activists – specifically a friend of his who works under the name “ Astrubal ” had remixed the 1984 Apple ad for political ends .
( See my post “ Democrats Invent the Remix , only three years after the Tunisians ” for more on this story . )
In the Tunisian video , the guy on the screen is Ben Ali , a major opponent of free speech and a long - serving dictator .
No matter how negatively you feel about Hillary , he ’s a more Orwellian figure , in part because he ’s so skilled at PR .
Tunisia is more repressive than many of its Middle Eastern neighbors , but it enjoys widespread tourism and was selected – absurdly – to host the World Summit on the Information Society conference in November 2005 .
( For more on this absurdity , you may want to refer to my posts from WSIS , perhaps starting with this one . )
Because Ben Ali is so good at PR , Sami , Astrubal and others see themselves as an ad agency , making videos designed to embarass the government on an international scale .
One of the most amazing of these videos features the peregrinations of the Tunisian presidential aircraft .
You would n’t expect to see this jet in Europe very often , as Ben Ali is famous for rarely leaving the country .
But Sami and Astrubal used planespotter sites – sites like Airliners .
net that allow amateur plane enthusiasts to post their photos – to determine that the President ’s jet travels a whole lot more than he does .
They
He used footage from Google Earth and pictures from the plane spotter sites to make a video that shows the power of the participatory web at its best .
( Sami has asked me to make it clear that the Tunisian flight video was solely Astrubal ’s work – his function was solely to publicize it , on his blog and in talks given about online activism . )
Their video raises all sorts of ethical questions – is it permissable for the country ’s first lady to take the Presidential jet , fueled and crewed on taxpayer dollars , for shopping junkets in Europe ?
Foreign Policy magazine did n’t think so , and ran an article critiquing the first lady .
They also published instructions on how you , too , can become a presidential planespotter .
Sami and Astrubal posted the video on their personal blogs … but as known activists , their blogs have been blocked in Tunisia for years .
They also posted it on DailyMotion , a video site popular in the French - speaking world .
Shortly after , the Tunisian government blocked access to DailyMotion .
This is a good thing if you ’re an activist .
Most Tunisians do n’t identify as activists and might not be engaged with politics .
But , like Americans and Europeans , they ’re interested in seeing cute cats being adorable online .
When the government blocks DailyMotion , it impacts a much wider swath of Tunisians than those who are politicially active .
Cute cats are collateral damage when governments block sites .
And even those who could care less about presidential shenanigans are made aware that their government fears online speech so much that they ’re willing to censor the millions of banal videos on DailyMotion to block a few political ones .
Blocking banal content on the internet is a self - defeating proposition .
It teaches people how to become dissidents – they learn to find and use anonymous proxies , which happens to be a key first step in learning how to blog anonymously .
Every time you force a government to block a web 2.0 site – cutting off people ’s access to cute cats – you spend political capital .
Our job as online advocates is to raise that cost of censorship as high as possible .
So why do n’t governments block only he offensive speech ?
Why would governments be stupid enough to close off these tools entirely ?
It ’s a reasonable question and one that ’s an active research topic .
One answer is that it ’s surprisingly difficult to censor the web well .
( Pakistan ’s recent shutdown of YouTube shows one remarkably stupid and dangerous way to screw up and overblock web traffic . )
If you want to prevent your users from accessing online content , you ’ve got four basic options .
You can block keywords , block URLs , pollute your DNS or block IPs .
It ’s surprisingly hard to block keywords – you need to open and examine all the packets crossing your network .
China does a bit of this , but mostly blocks keywords within URLs – it ’s prohibitively expensive to examine every packet for an entire nation and check against a blocklist .
URL blocking simply does n’t work very well – it ’s easy to rewrite a URL and access the same content .
DNS blocking is very simple , but it tends to backfire – your smarter users simply switch towards using an unpolluted DNS and you have no way to control their behavior with this technique in the future .
And so , most repressive governments block IPs , which limits access to banal as well as sensitive content .
But perhaps this is n’t stupidity on the part of nations .
When Pakistan blocks YouTube , it limits traffic to the site .
Google notices these sorts of things .
Perhaps it ’s coincidental that the video named by Pakistan has been removed from YouTube due to a terms of service violation – perhaps not .
But while advocates try to raise the price of censorship for governments , smart governments are raising the price for noncompliance for Web 2.0 companies .
My colleagues at the Open Net Initiative began documenting net censorship a bit more than five years ago .
At that point , Saudi Arabia and China were censoring widely .
Now at least two dozen nations censor the net regularly , and more may be participating in “ event - based filtering ” , blocking access to political sites before a key election , for instance .
My fear , in the medium to long term , is that every nation that constrains freedom of the press will begin filtering the net , realizing that the Internet is where important press takes place these days .
Of course , the activists win sometimes too .
When Google Maps became accessible in Bahrain , it let Bahrani activists answer a pressing question in that small , crowded nation – who owns all the land ?
From the air , it becomes pretty clear that large chunks of the nation are reserved for palaces owned by the royal family .
An anonymous Bahrani activist thought this was pretty interesting , and made a PDF document of screen captures from Google Maps , enhanced with notes comparing crowded communities with spacious palaces .
The document flew around the country from mailbox to mailbox .
The Bahrani authorities could n’t block the file – it ’s a PDF , and blocking PDFs has nasty consequences for businesspeople .
So they blocked Google Maps , which got bloggers like noted free speech advocate Mahmood Al - Youssif up in arms .
After a brief block , they simply gave up and let citizens see the site , rather than letting Mahmood and others train people to use proxy sites .
( More on this story is available on my blog . )
When governments really want to shut people up , they do n’t just block them , they imprison them .
Egypt has blocked very few websites – the Muslim Brotherhood site gets blocked occasionally , but most are uncensored .
But they ’ve jailed Kareem Soliman for his critical remarks about Islam , and they have n’t hesitated to arrest protesters seeking political reform .
This , in turn , has been known to backfire .
When Kefaya activist and open - source proponent Alaa Abdel Fateh was one of 700 activists arrested at a protest supporting the independence of the Egyptian judiciary , it was hard for government authorities to know that they were about to have a PR crisis on their hands .
Alaa began blogging from prison , passing notes to his wife , Manal , who jointly maintains their blog .
These blog posts helped attract international attention to the case , which meant that camera crews from Al Jazeera and CNN covered a situation they normally would have ignored .
It probably meant that Alaa spent much more time in jail than he otherwise would have , but it also may have meant that he was safer than if he ’d been anonymous in prison .
( A piece of advice I offer at this point in many talks – if you ’re planning on being an online activist , marry a blogger .
It ’s worked very well for me . )
The imprisonment of bloggers has taught activists some interesting lessons about advocacy in the era of Web 2.0 .
When Global Voices China editor Hao
Wu was arrested and detained in Beijing , I and other GV friends wanted to go online immediately and advocate for his release .
But that ’s not the right way to do things – you ’ve got to get permission from the detained person ’s family first .
And it took Rebecca MacKinnon a month of phonecalls to get his sister , Nina Wu , to agree to let us advocate on Hao ’s behalf .
More importantly , Nina began blogging herself .
Unsurprisingly , she knew a lot more about her brother than we did , and she wrote much more movingly than we could .
Eventually , our campaign focused on translating her posts from Chinese to English and disseminating them as widely as possible .
My conclusion from this : good advice for the advocate in a web 2.0 age – “ Do n’t speak .
Point . ” ( Bruno Giussani explains what I mean by that phrase far more eloquently than I ever have . )
Nina was n’t a professional activist .
She was a successful career woman , a young mother , living the Chinese dream in Shanghai .
She became an activist because she was forced to and she reached out for the tools she had access to – which hapened to be MSN spaces .
MSN is heavily censored in China – it ’s certainly not what we would have chosen for her .
But you do n’t get to choose the tools – activists use what ’s at hand .
It ’s fine to build tools for activists , but even better to build tools for folks who do n’t know they ’re activists yet .
( In making this point , I should be very , very careful to point out that I have deep respect for tools that have been developed successfully for activist uses , tools like Martus or FrontlineSMS .
My point is simply that there are huge numbers of web users who do n’t yet think of themselves as activists who are likely to reach for the tools they have at hand , not to look specifically for tools designed for activists . )
Most activists discover they ’re much more effective out of jail .
It ’s possible that bulk SMS tools – especially Twitter – might be useful in keeping activists out of jail .
Alaa now uses
Twitter to report on his political activities – this gives friends watching his feed the possibility of relauching the FreeAlaa site , should we see his note that he ’s going in to talk to the police , and there ’s no message letting us know he ’s out of the police station afterwards .
( Alaa tells me that tons of people are now subscribing to his Twitter feed and that they should back off because it ’s a very boring time right now in Egyptian politics … :-)
Kefaya activists were able to use mobile phone messages , some sent through Twitter , to alert activists to the impending arrest of Malek Moustafa .
As activist came to the place where Moustafa was being taken into custody , they attracted a huge crowd of police , who effectively blocked the street and prevented the police car with Moustafa from leaving the street .
He was eventually released .
Corresponding with Alaa about the situation , he raises questions of whether this was really a victory for Twitter – this is something Egyptian activists have done with SMS for a long time .
Twitter may simply be useful in confusing Egyptian authorities , who might choose to block local SMS in a crisis , but might not consider blocking an international SMS number .
Twitter is also becoming more useful in crisis reporting .
Viktor Markovic used a Twitter feed to report live on events in Belgrade after Kosovo declared independence ; Juliana Rotich has used her feed to report live from Eldoret during post-election violence .
And mobile phones are allowing people to report incidents in Kenya and include them within the map on Ushahidi .
Twitter is far from the perfect tool – it ’s centralized and easily blocked .
But it ’s also used for lots of dumb purposes , which means it passes the cute cats test .
Lots of the tools that have become most useful to activists have characteristics that un-recommend them for activist uses .
Facebook , which has helped organize major protests against the FARC in Colombia , is notoriously bad about letting users pull data out of the system .
Imran Jamal spoke about the challenge of trying to move a community of 400,000 users from Facebook to Avaaz , so they could fundraise more easily .
( See “ Pros and Cons of Facebook Activist “ . )
One challenge for activists using Web2.0 tools is figuring out when it ’s time to get real and get onto dedicated platforms .
What happens when governments begin taking Web2.0 activism seriously ?
A funny example comes from Belarus .
Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko noticed that YouTube was beginning to carry a wealth of anti-Lukashenko content , and suggested the Belarussian government might build it ’s own YouTube competitor .
Belarussian bloggers went one better and built LuNet , a set of parody sites designed to represent a Lukashenko - compliant read / write web .
Perhaps the best of the sites was a Google parody – most searches resulted in a page telling you that the KGB was on lunch break and asking you to try again later when they could watch what you were doing .
( See Global Voices Advocacy coverage of the story . )
More competent regimes have managed to exert significantly more control .
China filters the internet more effectively than any other nation , using a combination of keyword filters , IP blocks and some DNS fiddling .
The system is extremely complicated , involving filtering at a national boundary level and throughout the network , with some blocking taking place deep within the national network .
China uses some techniques not widely seen elsewhere , including sending RSET packets when certain keywords are detected to knock users offline .
But that ’s not the sinister part .
Effective as the Great Firewall may be ( and , actually , it ’s not that effective – lots of dissidents get around it using various proxy techniques ) , the most relevant Chinese censorship takes place within Chinese Web 2.0 companies – including US companies operating servers in China .
There ’s an incredible wealth of Web 2.0 startups in China .
These companies allow Chinese users to share video , post photos and write blogs .
They ’re much more useful to the average Chinese user as the tools and content are in Chinese , not English .
And , unlike most popular web 2.0 tools , they ’re not blocked in China .
And they ’ve got censorship baked in .
The above image is from research conducted by my colleage Rebecca MacKinnon .
She discovered that MSN Spaces , Microsoft ’s Chinese - localized and Chinese - hosted service prevented her from putting the terms “ democracy ” or “ human rights ” in the title of her blog .
According to a report published by RSF , the heads of web companies meet weekly with censors who instruct them on what keywords to block , allowing the system to be extremely flexible and adaptable .
Some Chinese bloggers have responded by being extremely creative in their use of images .
Some Chinese bloggers began posting images of river crabs on their blogs .
The joke is that the term for “ river crab ” sounds very similar to the word “ harmonize ” , a term that had become slang for “ censored ” – “ My blog just got harmonized . ”
The term “ harmonized ” became so popular that it became blocked .
So Chinese bloggers began to refer to their blogs as having been “ river crabbed ” .
The watches are a pun on “ the three represents “ , a political philosophy put forward by Jiang Zemin .
This is also a commonly blocked term , so has been rewritten as “ wears three watches ” … which explains the oddly dressed river crab .
Here ’s the thing – for the vast majority of Chinese internet users , they ’re encountering a much more free information environment than their parents experienced .
Michael Anti argues that Chinese society is much freer than the US in terms of personal behavior , especially around premarital sex and homosexuality .
The vast majority of young Chinese are enjoying these personal freedoms and are willing to accept a world in which political freedom is somewhat constrained .
China ’s censorship genius is that they ’ve found a way to let people have their cute cats and have censorship as well .
While China will block sites like Human Rights Watch , they wo n’t block domestic Web 2.0 sites , and hence the collateral damage from blocking banal content does n’t draw non-activists to become aware of activist issues .
Is this unique to China , or will we see this technique spread ?
It ’s hard to imagine Ethiopia , for instance , being capable of building their own Amharic internet applications and blocking all Web 2.0 tools .
It ’s also interesting to see what tools China wo n’t block .
GMail , thus far , has remained unblocked – Anti theorizes that it ’s popular with the communist party .
Skype is unblocked , and it has some intriguing holes in it – Skype voice chatrooms are tailor - made to serve as pirate radio stations .
Pipe a podcast into a chat room and you ’re broadcasting audio via an encrypted system to users around the world .
And China ’s unlikely to block MMOGs , even if people periodically stand on hills inside games and shout out the IP addresses of proxy servers .
( Lots more on China and net censorship at “ Cute Cat Theory : The China Corollary ” and “ Michael Anti and the end of the golden age of blogs in China “ . )
It seems criminal to give a talk at the ancestral home of Lolgeeks and not talk about the brave and noble Lolcat .
We did some informal research within the Global Voices community and discovered that , while our non-north American , non-European colleagues thought Lolcats were very funny , they simply did n’t exist within their own communities .
( Trading funny pictures of animals was quite common , just not the leet - speak captioning . )
Our early attempts to propogate lolcats in other cultures have been largely unsuccessul .
( That ’s a lolcat by Rachel with our cat , Thorn , saying “ Oh Hai ” … )
There ’s a real challenge within the world of lolcats – making activism viral probably means making it funny as well as political and heart - wrenching .
My single favorite comment on SUP ’s acquisition of LiveJournal is a lolcat , which sums up the situation better than any angry post could have .
It ’s typical to end these sorts of talks with a call to action , possibly a better one than “ export lolcats to repressive nations ” .
If there ’s a single message to the talk , it is that activists are going to use your tools if your tools are any good – watch them , pay attention to them , protect them and learn from them .
They ’ll make tour tools better , and they ’re one of the reasons to make social software in the first place .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States arrested an 84 - year - old American on Tuesday suspected of giving Israel secrets on nuclear weapons , fighter jets and missiles in the 1980s , in a case linked to the Jonathan Pollard spy scandal that rocked U.S. - Israeli relations .
Ben -Ami Kadish walks out of federal court , in New York April 22 , 2008 , after being arrested on charges related to giving Israel secrets on nuclear weapons , fighter jets and missiles .

The arrest of Ben - Ami Kadish indicates that Israeli spying revealed by the Pollard case , still an irritant to the U.S. alliance with Israel , may have spread wider than previously acknowledged .
“ It was bigger than we thought , and they hid it well , ” said former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova , who prosecuted Pollard .
Kadish acknowledged his spying in FBI interviews and said he acted to help Israel , according to court documents .
He was accused of reporting to an Israeli government handler who was also a main contact for Pollard , an American citizen serving a life term on a 1985 charge of spying for Israel .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey said , “ We will be informing the Israelis of this action ... 20 - plus years ago during the Pollard case we noted that this was not the kind of behavior we would expect from friends and allies , and that would remain the case today . ”
Authorities said Kadish was arrested in New Jersey on four counts of conspiracy and espionage after an investigation that began in 2005 .
The first spy charge carries a possible death sentence .
Kadish made an initial appearance at Manhattan federal court .
Looking frail and shuffling , Kadish smiled briefly at the judge who ordered his release on $ 300,000 bail and restricted his travel .
Kadish did not speak , and his lawyer made no comment upon leaving .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said of the arrest : “ We know nothing about it .
We heard it from the media . ”
Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 .
Israel gave him citizenship in 1996 and acknowledged in 1998 the former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst was one of its spies .
Israel has unsuccessfully sought Pollard ’s release .

Kadish is a Connecticut - born U.S. citizen who worked as a mechanical engineer at the Army ’s Picatinny Arsenal in Dover , New Jersey .
His spying lasted roughly from 1979 to 1985 , and his contact with the unidentified Israeli handler continued until March of this year , the federal complaint against him said .
Based on circumstances of the case , DiGenova identified Kadish ’s contact as Yosef Yagur , who has been linked in court documents to the Pollard case .
A Justice Department spokesman said he could not confirm that .
The complaint cited Kadish as saying that , unlike Pollard , he received no money from the Israelis .
‘ CC-1 ’
Kadish used his security clearance to borrow 50 to 100 classified documents from the arsenal ’s library , the complaint said .
He worked from a list provided by the handler , identified in court documents as “ CC - 1 . ”
The contact photographed the documents in Kadish ’s basement .
One classified document Kadish passed on “ contained information concerning nuclear weaponry , ” the complaint said .
Israel is believed to have nuclear weapons but has never acknowledged it .
Another document related to a modified version of an F - 15 fighter jet that the United States had sold to an unidentified other foreign country , the complaint said .
A third pertained to the U.S. Patriot missile air defense system .
The U.S. military first deployed the system in 1984 , and Israel used the system to defend against Iraqi missiles in the 1991 Gulf war .
The complaint said Kadish kept contact with CC - 1 , met him in Israel in 2004 , and spoke with him by telephone on March 20 of this year , after his first FBI interview .
It said the handler told him to lie to U.S. authorities : “ Do n’t say anything ...
What happened 25 years ago ?
You do n’t remember anything , ” CC - 1 was quoted as saying .
The complaint said the handler worked as the Israeli consul for science affairs at its Consulate General in New York from 1980 to November 1985 .
During the late 1970s , he worked for Israeli Aircraft Industries , an Israeli government contractor , the complaint said .
It said the handler left the United States when Pollard was arrested and had not returned .
The details fit Yagur ’s history .
A woman who identified herself as Yagur ’s wife , when reached by telephone in Israel , said : “ We ’re not speaking to journalists .
Goodbye . ”

Using microphone arrays and photographic methods to reconstruct flight paths of bats in the field when they find and capture prey in air using their sonar system , Annemarie Surlykke from the Institute of Biology , SDU , Denmark , and her colleague , Elisabeth Kalko , from the University of Ulm , estimated the emitted sound intensity and found that bats emit exceptionally loud sounds exceeding 140 dB SPL ( at 10 cm from the bat 's mouth ) , which is the highest level reported so far for any animal in air .
For comparison , the level at a loud rock concert is 115 - 120 dB and for humans , the threshold of pain is around 120 dB .
( 1 )
Measured call intensity and source level as bats approach the array .
Two individual approach flights of N. leporinus ( upper panel ) and N. albiventris ( lower panel ) .
The flight paths ( left panels ) with arrows indicating the flight directions are shown as seen from above as the bats approached the three microphones ( red circles on the x - axis ) .
For N. leporinus , blue circles show positions based on photos .
Source levels were estimated for the search calls marked by red in the flight path .
The last calls in this recording were approach / terminal calls of a pursuit for which source level was not estimated .
For N. albiventris , all calls were search calls and source levels were estimated for the whole sequence .
The right panels show the recorded sound level and estimated source level ( SL ) as a function of distance between bat and microphone .
At long distances the source level is constant , while at short distances the bat reduces the source level , such that the recorded level is constant as the bat gets closer .
Bats emit their echolocation calls at ultrasonic frequencies , i.e. above the human hearing range .
This is necessary to get echoes from small insects , but the draw - back of high frequencies is that they do not carry far in air as they are attenuated faster than low frequencies .
By estimating detection range for typical insect prey , Surlykke and Kalko conclude that these extreme intensities are essential for the bats as they serve to counteract attenuation .
Their examination of the echolocation behavior in 11 species of insect - eating tropical bats from Panamá is the first comparative field study of bat echolocation sounds focusing on intensity and the results revealed , very interestingly , that although signal intensities ( and frequencies ) of bats vary widely , they appear to converge on similar detection ranges , because the bats emitting the highest frequencies were also the bats emitting the highest intensities .
Thus , the study illustrates the value of an interdisciplinary approach combining bat biology , ecology , behavioral biology and acoustics .

It costs $ 482.79 to get a decent pizza in San Francisco — $ 17 for the pie , $ 85 for cab fare , and $ 378.80 for the flight to New York .
Throw in $ 1.99 for tinfoil .
I wrap each slice individually to protect the toppings and maximize what I can fit inside a regulation - size carry - on : six pies ' worth of triangular packets , arranged in an alternating pattern to create rectangular layers .
The bag attracts some attention at airport security .
Apparently , 48 interlocking aluminum - wrapped triangles are easy to mistake for an IED .
Pizza may have been invented in Italy , but it was perfected in New York City .
And whenever I go home to visit , I return with a sizable doggy bag from Arturo 's in Greenwich Village .
That 's because the pizza in San Francisco sucks : flaccid crust baked in positive energy , its cheese and tomato sauce buried under bushels of organic artichokes and salad greens .
Even when you can track down an unadorned pie — the pure , ideal form — it just does n't taste right .
" Californians do a lot of great stuff with their green - market goods , " fellow pizza nerd Mario Batali says , but " some of it 's just not pizza . "
I called the Iron Chef to help me figure out why San Francisco — a formidable food town — can't birth a respectable pie .
Part of the reason , of course , is that while Rice - A - Roni and zinfandel are native to Northern California , pizza is not .
" New York has a grand tradition of pizza making and holds it dear , " Batali says .
Which means institutions like Arturo 's have been using the same equipment for decades .
" An oven captures the gestalt of beautifully cooked pizza .
And it imparts that . "
I 'm not comfortable attributing a pizza 's quality to gestalt — it sounds like something a California pizzeria would list as a topping .
But Batali's theory makes sense to David Tisi , a food - development consultant who has spent much of his career studying pizza .
" As you cook , some ingredients vaporize , and these volatilized particles can attach themselves to the walls of the baking cavity , " Tisi says .
" The next time you use the oven , these bits get caught up in the convection currents and deposited on the food , which adds flavor . "
Over time , he says , more particles join the mix and mingle with the savory soot from burned wood or coal — the only fuels worth using — to create a flavor that you can't grow in a garden : gestalt , if you will .
That explains why the only San Francisco pizza I can tolerate is from Tommaso's , a restaurant whose wood - fired oven has been crackling since 1935 .
Still , there 's something off with the crust .
" Water , " Batali says .
" Water is huge .
It 's probably one of California 's biggest problems with pizza . "
Water binds the dough 's few ingredients .
Nearly every chemical reaction that produces flavor occurs in water , says Chris Loss , a food scientist with the Culinary Institute of America .
" So , naturally , the minerals and chemicals in it will affect every aspect of the way something tastes . "
Batali himself encounters the water problem at his upscale New York restaurant Del Posto , where he makes traditional Italian food .
The tap water in Manhattan is far different from that of the motherland .
His solution : create his own mineral - water composite .
Working from a chemical analysis of l'acqua italiana , Batali 's team basically clones the H 2 O that gives the food in Italy its — well , its gestalt .
He plans to do this at Pizzeria Mozza in LA , but the joint 's Italian - style pie is too lightweight for my taste .
Which means I 'm still waiting for some other enterprising chef to deliver my New York pizza fantasies to the Left Coast .
Hint , hint .

MCCAIN THINKS BUSH PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK WITH BAD ECONOMY , FAILED WAR
By Bill Gallagher
DETROIT -- George W. Bush 's failed presidency has produced unprecedented dissatisfaction for the battered American people .
More storms will rage this spring in a troubled economy hurtling into a serious recession .
The nation lost 80,000 jobs in March -- 250,000 in the first quarter .
Unemployment is at 5.1 percent and indications are joblessness will grow .
Real incomes are down and the junk loan crisis is affecting credit at nearly every level .
The housing sector is a disaster and foreclosures are occurring at rates not seen since the Depression .
Gasoline prices are at an all - time high , driving transportation and food prices into staggering upward spirals .
Painful inflation plagues the economy .
The American dollar has become an international joke .
The economy primarily drives the misery , but Bush 's endless war in Iraq and the lives and money squandered there certainly is an omnipresent subtext for the national mood of misery and sense of misdirection .
A New York Times / CBS
News poll shows 81 percent of Americans believe " things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track . "
The " wrong track " number has shot up from 69 percent a year ago and just 35 percent in 2002 .
More Americans are dissatisfied with the nation 's direction than at any time since the poll began measuring that sentiment in the early 1990s .
I have long argued that when people wake up and figure out what 's happening in the Bush years they will be livid .
I think we are there .
Seventy - eight percent of the respondents in the poll said the country is worse off than five years ago .
But perhaps a more telling number is the 4 percent who said it is better off .
Who are these happy 4 percent , content with the Bush world so many others find miserable ?
The 4 percent closely corresponds with the people at the income levels most benefiting from Bush 's tax policies -- borrowing money to cut taxes at the highest brackets and passing that debt obligation off to wage - earning Americans for generations to come .
Bush 's spend - and - borrow sprees created a fiscal mess and did nothing to improve the broad economy .
But some narrow segments of the economy -- oil companies and military contractors , for instance -- are doing just dandy .
Fat cats from those companies -- the martini - sippers at the Petroleum Club in Houston , Bush family members and intimates and the big campaign donors among them -- have never had it better .
The continuing bloodshed in Iraq is a dream come true for war profiteers , and the violence and instability there pushes oil prices even higher .
For these few , Bush 's " guvment " has been great for " bidness , " as they say in Texas .
Among them , we can find the charter members of Bush 's " Happy 4 Percent Club . "
This week , Gen. David Petraeus , the U.S. military commander in Iraq , will report to congressional committees , sure to say the escalation is working and , although there have been a few bumps along the way , we must slog on .
Petraeus will have to do some clever dancing to explain why more than 1,000 Iraqi soldiers and police officers went AWOL or simply refused to fight when the government in Baghdad ordered them to attack Shiite militia in Basra .
That episode underscores the lack of readiness in the Iraqi forces and the failure of the U.S. troop surge to meaningfully foster any political reconciliation in the nation still torn in sectarian fighting .
The violence in recent weeks is the worst in 18 months , and the near - daily rocket attacks on the Green Zone has made the previously cozy and protected residents of the " Emerald City " face the grim reality of the bloody war .
Iranian backed cleric Moqtada al - Sadr is planning a demonstration with his Mahdi militia that will likely bring over 1 million people converging on the streets of Najaf , demanding a U.S. withdrawal .
The anti-U.S. demonstration is set for Wednesday , coinciding with the fifth anniversary of American soldiers marching into Baghdad .
The image of the staged lopping of Saddam Hussein 's statue lives in many minds .
Yet it should be remembered as the first day of lawlessness and looting , and for the absence of planning for post - Saddam Iraq and an exit strategy .
The protesters heading for Najaf , a Shiite holy city , are being asked in a statement from Moqtada al - Sadr to wave Iraqi flags " to cement the unity of Iraq and demand its independence . "
The demonstrators are urged to " raise your voices high in the skies of Iraq against the oppressing occupier . "
But Petraeus is sure to say -- to the delight of Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and their neoconservative amen chorus -- that staying the course and keeping U.S. soldiers there indefinitely is the best way to assure " victory , " whatever the hell that means .
Petraeus will also beat war drums with Iran , according to a report in Britain 's Telegraph , using his congressional testimony as a platform that " could set the stage for a U.S. attack on Iranian military facilities . "
A British diplomatic source told the Telegraph , " Petraeus is going to go very hard on Iran as the source of attacks on the American efforts in Iraq . "
The diplomat sees broadening violence and an effort to get Americans to rally around the flag : " Petraeus has put emphasis on America having to fight the battle on behalf of Iraq .
In his report he can frame it in terms of our soldiers killed and diplomats dead in attacks on the Green Zone . "
Do n't expect Petraeus to say much about the role of Iran in brokering a ceasefire between the Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces .
Iran always has to be portrayed as a diabolical , evil force in the region .
Iran must be dealt with to achieve any pacification in Iraq .
Among the many recommendations of The Iraq Study Group Report the Busheviks have completely ignored was the call for diplomatic efforts " to persuade Iran that it should take specific steps to improve the situation in Iraq . "
The study group saw the opportunity where " Iran can use its influence , especially over Shia groups in Iraq , to encourage national reconciliation , " and " Iran can also , in the right circumstances , help the economic reconstruction of Iraq . "
While Petraeus has said Iraq cannot be pacified through military means alone , he still ducks the obvious questions :
When do we say no more can be done militarily with U.S. troops ?
When do we say that , without Iraqis taking charge of their own affairs , continuing occupation only sustains political uncertainty and costs lives ?
Is the escalation just a bandage , and violence and bloodshed can erupt again at any time ?
The bill for Bush 's war in Iraq is now up to $ 12 billion a month , according to Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz .
That money is not budgeted for .
How many peoples ' unemployment benefits could we extend with $ 12 billion a month ?
How many foreclosures could be prevented ?
How much crumbling U.S. infrastructure could be rebuilt ?
The cost of the war in the moral degradation of our nation is incalculable .
The release last week of an 81 - page torture memo from a former deputy assistant attorney general shows an administration craving for an endorsement of lawlessness .
John
Yoo , now a law professor at the University of California in Berkeley , should be charged as the war criminal he is .
Yoo essentially wrote that the president can do anything he wants in time of war , and statutes and international treaties banning torture be damned .
Yoo 's analysis declared that if the president authorizes it , it 's not illegal .
With legal opinions alien in democracies and more suitable for kings and tyrants ,
Yoo 's memo should make every defender of the rule of law shudder .
Nothing can restrain the commander in chief in Yoo 's distorted views , crafted to please the White House .
Yoo also found a way to exonerate those engaged in torture who might be charged with violating U.S. or international laws .
Do n't worry about criminal prohibitions on torture and the use of interrogation methods that might violate those prohibitions ,
Yoo assured , " necessity or self - defense could provide justifications for any criminal liability . "
Yoo 's memo was rescinded nine months later , but he had already sent it on to the Pentagon 's top lawyer , William J. Haynes , and prisoner abuses at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad were in high gear .
Torture became U.S. policy .
The unprecedented government assaults on fundamental freedoms , the wretched war and rotten economy -- the hallmarks of George W. Bush 's presidency -- leave most Americans cringing in anxiety , convinced the nation is on the wrong track .
The election conversation the Republicans want is to focus on the condensed ranting of Sen. Barack Obama 's former pastor and Sen. Hillary Clinton 's " under sniper fire " fantasies .
Instead it should be about Sen. John McCain 's commitment to keeping the nation on the Bush track .
Oscar Levant , a mid-century pianist , film star and wit , once watched noted keyboardist and composer George Gershwin spend an evening playing his own music at a party and clearly having a great time .
" Tell me , George , " Levant said , somewhat jealously , " if you have it to do all over again would you still fall in love with yourself ? "
Increasingly , psychologists are looking at such behavior and saying out loud what may go against the grain of how many people act : high self - esteem is not the same thing as healthy self - esteem .
And new research by a psychology professor from the University of Georgia is adding another twist : those with " secure " high self - esteem are less likely to be verbally defensive than those who have " fragile " high self - esteem .
" There are many kinds of high self - esteem , and in this study we found that for those in which it is fragile and shallow it 's no better than having low self - esteem , " said Michael Kernis of University of Georgia .
" People with fragile high self - esteem compensate for their self - doubts by engaging in exaggerated tendencies to defend , protect and enhance their feelings of self - worth . "
Amid the complexity of perspectives on the human psyche , a slow but relentless change is occurring in how psychologists view self - esteem , said Kernis .
It was once thought that more self - esteem necessarily is better self - esteem .
In recent years , however , high self - esteem per se has come under attack on several fronts , especially in areas such as aggressive behavior .
Also , individuals with high self - esteem sometimes become very unlikable when others or events threaten their egos .
While high self - esteem is still generally valued as a good quality that is important to a happy and productive life , more researchers are breaking it down into finer gradations and starting to understand when high self - esteem turns from good to bad .
In fact , it is now thought that there are multiple forms of high self - esteem , only some of which consistently relate to positive psychological functioning .
One of the ways in which high self - esteem can turn bad is when it is accompanied by verbal defensiveness -- lashing out at others when a person 's opinions , beliefs , statements or values are threatened .
So Kernis and his colleagues designed a study , reported in the current article , to see if respondents whose self - esteem is " fragile " were more verbally defensive than those whose self - esteem was " secure . "
Using 100 undergraduates , they set up a study in three phases .
In the first part , students completed a basic demographic questionnaire and other measures to evaluate their levels and other aspects of self - esteem .
In phase 2 , the team assessed the students ' stability of self - esteem because the more unstable or variable one 's self - esteem , the more fragile it is .
And finally , in the last phase , the researchers conducted a structured " life experiences interview " to measure what they call " defensive verbalization . "

" Our findings offer strong support for a multi- component model of self - esteem that highlights the distinction between its fragile and secure forms , " said Kernis .
" Individuals with low self - esteem or fragile high self - esteem were more verbally defensive than individuals with secure high self - esteem .
One reason for this is that potential threats are in fact more threatening to people with low or fragile high self - esteem than those with secure high self - esteem , and so they work harder to counteract them . "
On the other hand , individuals with secure high self - esteem appear to accept themselves " warts and all , " and , feeling less threatened , they are less likely to be defensive by blaming others or providing excuses when they speak about past transgressions or threatening experiences .
One reason the study 's findings are important , Kernis said , is that it shows that greater verbal defensiveness relates to lower psychological well - being and life satisfaction .
" These findings support the view that heightened defensiveness reflects insecurity , fragility and less - than - optimal functioning rather than a healthy psychological outlook , " said Kernis .
" We are n't suggesting there 's something wrong with people when they want to feel good about themselves .
What we are saying is that when feeling good about themselves becomes a prime directive , for these people excessive defensiveness and self - promotion are likely to follow , the self - esteem is likely to be fragile rather than secure and any psychological benefits will be very limited . "
And what of Oscar Levant and George Gershwin " While Levant may now be largely remembered for his acid opinions , Gershwin left us Rhapsody in Blue , An American in Paris , and Porgy and Bess , three of the most memorable compositions of the 20th century .
So the score for that fabled encounter on the secure self - esteem scale could be Gershwin 1 , Levant , 0 .
Maybe it 's a reminder of how complicated self - esteem really is .
The research was published April 28 in the Journal of Personality .
Kernis 's co-authors are Chad Lakey and Whitney Heppner , both doctoral students in the UGA social psychology program .
Michelle Obama -- the wife of Democratic presidential front - runner Barack Obama -- caused a bit of controversy recently when she remarked : " for the first time in my adult lifetime , I am really proud of my country . "
This remark got a number of pundits in a collective snit , because they apparently believe that it 's un-American or just plain wrong to be anything but undyingly proud of the United States .
My question to those folks who were offended by Michelle Obama 's comment :
Why do you think it 's impossible to love your country , yet still be ashamed of it ?
Take me .
I really , really love this country .
I love it that I can , for the most part , live my life however I choose to do so ( within proper legal bounds , of course ) .
I love the fact that I am allowed a job at a newspaper in a country where the media can print whatever opinions we choose .
I honestly love baseball , my mom and apple pie .
I love the fact that we have a brave , all - volunteer military force filled with people willing to put their lives on the line in whatever actions our government asks them to take .
However , today , I am also ashamed - - deeply - - about some aspects of my country .
For example , I am mortified by the Iraq war and its costs , in terms of lives , money and the United States ' worldwide reputation .
And I am ashamed that my country now , as a matter of policy , does n't always believe in habeas corpus but does believe in torture .
My feelings for my country are kind of like the feelings of a child with a beloved parent who , for whatever reason , did something horrible : I love it with all my heart -- but that does n't mean I am not ashamed of it sometimes .

Note the conspicuous absence of any cellulose or sugars on the surface of these cells .
Right : A genetically altered cyanobacterium that produced highly visible cellulose ( marked by cellulase coupled with an electron dense gold marker ) .

A newly created microbe produces cellulose that can be turned into ethanol and other biofuels , report scientists from The University of Texas at Austin who say the microbe could provide a significant portion of the nation ’s transportation fuel if production can be scaled up .
Along with cellulose , the cyanobacteria developed by Professor R. Malcolm Brown Jr. and Dr. David Nobles Jr. secrete glucose and sucrose .
These simple sugars are the major sources used to produce ethanol .
“ The cyanobacterium is potentially a very inexpensive source for sugars to use for ethanol and designer fuels , ” says Nobles , a research associate in the Section of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics .
Brown and Nobles say their cyanobacteria can be grown in production facilities on non-agricultural lands using salty water unsuitable for human consumption or crops .
Other key findings include :
--
The new cyanobacteria use sunlight as an energy source to produce and excrete sugars and cellulose
-- Glucose , cellulose and sucrose can be continually harvested without harming or destroying the cyanobacteria ( harvesting cellulose and sugars from true algae or crops , like corn and sugarcane , requires killing the organisms and using enzymes and mechanical methods to extract the sugars )
-- Cyanobacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen can be grown without petroleum - based fertilizer input
They recently published their research in the journal Cellulose .
Nobles made the new cyanobacteria ( also known as blue - green algae ) by giving them a set of cellulose - making genes from a non-photosynthetic “ vinegar ” bacterium , Acetobacter xylinum , well known as a prolific cellulose producer .
The new cyanobacteria produce a relatively pure , gel - like form of cellulose that can be broken down easily into glucose .
“ The problem with cellulose harvested from plants is that it ’s difficult to break down because it ’s highly crystalline and mixed with lignins [ for structure ] and other compounds , ” Nobles says .
He was surprised to discover that the cyanobacteria also secrete large amounts of glucose or sucrose , sugars that can be directly harvested from the organisms .
“ The huge expense in making cellulosic ethanol and biofuels is in using enzymes and mechanical methods to break cellulose down , ” says Nobles .
“ Using the cyanobacteria escapes these expensive processes . ”
Sources being used or considered for ethanol production in the United States include switchgrass and wood ( cellulose ) , corn ( glucose ) and sugarcane ( sucrose ) .
True algae are also being developed for biodiesel production .
Brown sees a major benefit in using cyanobacteria to produce ethanol is a reduction in the amount of arable land turned over to fuel production and decreased pressure on forests .
“ The pressure is on all these corn farmers to produce corn for non-food sources , ” says Brown , the Johnson & Johnson Centennial Chair in Plant Cell Biology .
“ That same demand , for sucrose , is now being put on Brazil to open up more of the Amazon rainforest to produce more sugarcane for our growing energy needs .
We do n’t want to do that .
You ’ll never get the forests back . ”
Brown and Nobles calculate that the approximate area needed to produce ethanol with corn to fuel all U.S. transportation needs is around 820,000 square miles , an area almost the size of the entire Midwest .
They hypothesize they could produce an equal amount of ethanol using an area half that size with the cyanobacteria based on current levels of productivity in the lab , but they caution that there is a lot of work ahead before cyanobacteria can provide such fuel in the field .
Work with laboratory scale photobioreactors has shown the potential for a 17 - fold increase in productivity .
If this can be achieved in the field and on a large scale , only 3.5 percent of the area growing corn could be used for cyanobacterial biofuels .
Cyanobacteria are just one of many potential solutions for renewable energy , says Brown .
“ There will be many avenues to become completely energy independent , and we want to be part of the overall effort , ” Brown says .
“ Petroleum is a precious commodity .
We should be using it to make useful products , not just burning it and turning it into carbon dioxide . ”
Brown and Nobles are now researching the best methods to scale up efficient and cost - effective production of cyanobacteria .

Whom not to blame
We should be very clear from the outset that the subprime crisis is not an indictment of subprime loans as such .
These mortgage loans are higher risk loans and there is nothing wrong with higher risk loans as such .
We know in advance that such loans will have higher default rates .
Lenders knew this , and they charged higher interest rates accordingly .
The question is why these default rates soared well above expectations beginning in the year 2006 .
The current Secretary of the Treasury , Henry M. Paulson , Jr. , is quoted as saying that the subprime crisis " came about because of some bad lending practices . "
This explanation sounds plausible .
After all , the crisis arose because lenders like banks and mortgage companies made bad mortgage loans that led to a startling increase in defaults and foreclosures .
Banks and mortgage companies made many loans that soured .
If we leave aside the issue of fraud , we can say that they did not intend to make bad loans .
Their expectations were that the loans would be paid off , but these expectations were frustrated .
The key factor is that they expected home prices to continue to rise and instead prices reversed and fell .
Lenders then had egg on their faces .
They looked as if they had adopted bad methods of making loans .
But Paulson ’s story is shallow and superficial .
Why , after hundreds of years of accumulated experience evaluating borrowers and making loans , would lenders suddenly began making what they thought were good loans that turned out really to be bad loans ?
Why would they do this not only across the United States but also in several other countries ?
Why should their methods of assessing risk have suddenly turned sour in 2006 and 2007 ?
Why would loans in some states turn out to be much worse than in other states ?
And can Paulson ’s story possibly explain real estate booms and busts that have occurred worldwide for centuries ?
It cannot .
Mr. Paulson blames the subprime crisis on banks and other lenders .
He blames the regulated market , but he does n’t explain why bad lending practices suddenly came to the fore in 2006 .
He explains neither why such a large volume of these bad mortgage loans occurred , nor why they were concentrated in the subprime category , which is the category of higher risk loans to people with lower quality credit records .
Blaming bad lending practices and blaming the market is really no explanation at all .
It is like blaming the greed of the lenders .
Why should an epidemic of greed and stupidity suddenly occur ?
Why should it be worse in Colorado than in adjacent Wyoming ?
We need to go deeper than bad lending practices or market failure to understand the subprime crisis .
The housing bubble
The subprime crisis is manifested in three related phenomena .
These are ( a ) declines in the prices of houses , ( b ) increased numbers of foreclosures , and ( c ) declines in the values of mortgage loans purchased as investments .
The subprime crisis has several other interesting aspects to it such as fraud that are worthy of examining in separate articles , but these three are central .
If we understand why and how each of these occurs , then we understand a great deal about the subprime crisis .
The drops in housing prices occur after steep rises in home prices .
The declines are most severe in those states where the preceding price rise has been the steepest .
In other words , where there have been housing price bubbles , they burst .
Housing prices reverse downwards .
The impelling force behind the subprime crisis is the housing price rise — the bubble — followed by the housing price decline .
The rise in house prices is critical , for when that stops and reverses , it increases foreclosures .
The price peak of housing was late 2005 for some areas in the U.S. and by June 2006 occurred on average over all regions .
A great deal can be said about the manifold workings of bubbles .
For our purposes , we need only note that the Federal Reserve thoroughly primed the bubble machine .
Between 1975 and 1995 , the growth rate of the narrowly - defined money supply was a very high 7.2 percent per year .
Stock market returns , already strong , were propelled higher .
The year 1995 was a year in which the stock market marched upwards with virtually no setbacks .
It rose 35 percent .
The next year saw a 21 percent rise .
In the next 3 years , 1997 — 1999 , the market doubled .
The housing market has had a large number of direct government stimulants .
They include the government - sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and the FHA .
They include removing the tax deductibility of auto and credit card interest while retaining it for mortgage interest .
They include ending the capital gains taxation for house sales of less than $ 500,000 while retaining higher rates for stocks .
The Fed ’s largest contribution began just before the U.S. entered a recession in March 2001 .
In February 2001 the money supply , which had been stable for several years suddenly began a steep ascent .
It rose until early 2005 , the overall rise being 26 percent .
This rise coincided with a steep rise in real estate prices .
The rise in money had many effects .
It stimulated some parts of the economy as was its intent .
It fostered a good times mentality .
Investors thought it more likely that returns would be realized in good states of the economy .
That is why they began to use more borrowing ( or financial leverage ) in buying homes , stocks , and other assets .
They expected rather more returns to be realized in good states of the economy , and returns are higher in these good states .
Investors did not know when the monetary expansion would cease , nor how strong its effects would be .
The monetary expansion therefore engendered both speculation and leveraging .
The expectation that prices will continue rising is hard to resist , because betting against it is a losing proposition as long as a monetary expansion continues .
Conservative appraisals of home values began to be tossed aside in favor of higher valuations .
This seemed only right since prices had been rising and continued to rise .
Meanwhile , the 2001 — 2005 expansion made it possible for more marginal borrowers to look like better credit risks .
The lenders began making loans with lower collateral values ( or higher loan - to - value ratios ) .
Some of these practices , such as liberal appraisals , higher loan - to - value ratios , greater leverage , and lending to higher risk borrowers may be rational during an inflation , but they can , in retrospect and without justice , be termed bad lending practices .
They are induced , however , by the money creation that the central bank has caused .
Those who cry wolf
Many warning voices were raised that the bubble would break .
But a large number of these warnings were early .
They were like the boy that cried wolf .
During the boom , many people always wonder when it will end and are always predicting the game is about to end .
The " bears " begin their wondering early in the boom , and they always look wrong as the boom keeps going for years .
After awhile , no one listens to them .
For example , several Fed officials ( Susan Bies and Donald Kohn ) warned in mid-2002 of their concerns about the subprime sector .
They were 5 years early .
Peter Fisher , a Treasury official warned at the same time .
On June 23 , 2003 , Christopher Byron published a stunningly accurate article in the New York Post .
He wrote :
" Instead of giving the overall economy a sustainable boost , the Fed ’s increasingly cheap money keeps pouring into just two sectors — the housing and home mortgage refinance markets — and it is creating what is shaping up as one of the most spectacular sector bubbles in memory .
" But first a thought or two on the Washington official whose endless supply of hot air has created not only this bubble but the dot - com mess before it , and who long ago deserved to be fired from his job : Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan .
" No serious student of the economy any longer doubts that Mr. Greenspan ’s cheap - money policy of the 1990s led directly to the stock market bubble that popped in the spring of 2000 , pushing stocks and the economy into the downturn from which they have yet to recover .
" Meanwhile , his rhetorical waltzing has become utterly shameless , as he intones , in that ponderous way he has perfected , that the housing market has not swelled into a bubble — because , when it pops , the result wo n’t be a u2018negative ’ for the economy but the disappearance of a u2018 positive . ’
Oh , puhleeze , Mr. Greenspan , do you take the whole world for fools ?
" It is the speculative bubble in the housing market , fueled by lower and lower mortgage rates , that is alone propping up the economy , and everyone knows it .
In this summer of 2003 , the national pastime is no longer baseball or going to the beach — it ’s going to the bank to refinance the mortgage .
" When the bubble will pop is hard to say , just as it is hard to guess the moment when the nation ’s patience will at last be exhausted with Washington ’s czar of financialoney .
But one senses that time is starting to run out for both . "
Byron ’s brilliant article was 4 years early .
He pinpointed where the blame should be placed .
But more than that , the fact that he and others were so early virtually proves that one cannot blame bad lending practices for the subprime crisis .
During the money inflation , many practices are quite rational that subsequently , after the bubble has burst , look ill - advised and bad .
But since the inflation may go on for years , it is not foolish to indulge in them .
One takes a calculated risk that there is more money to be made during the boom than to be lost once it breaks .
The inflation is such that one might say " We are all speculators now . "
Why foreclosures rise
A critical step in the subprime crisis is the one that leads to more foreclosures .
The causation runs from the drop in house prices to the subsequent foreclosures .
The key papers that document this process are here and here .
When house prices fall , borrowers discover that the amounts they have promised to pay ( via mortgages ) for their houses exceed the worth of their homes .
Under certain conditions , this sets in motion defaults on loans and foreclosures .
More borrowers fail to make their mortgage payments and are foreclosed .
When the value of a house , which is the mortgage loan ’s collateral , falls below the amount owed on the loan , the borrowers have an incentive to walk away from the loan and deliver the house back to the lender .
Defaulting on a mortgage is always an option .
The borrower can " put " the house back to the lender .
This incentive is powerful .
Why should a borrower pay off a loan for $ 200,000 and end up with a house worth $ 150,000 ?
He loses $ 50,000 by doing this .
If he can walk away from the loan , and he can , then he has a strong incentive to do so .
Borrowers began defaulting on their loans , and this was a rational response to the decline in housing prices .
When the home value drops below the promised loan payments , the borrower has negative equity .
That is a necessary condition for walking away from the house because if the equity is positive , the homeowner is better off selling the house .
But negative equity is not a sufficient condition for putting the house back to the lender .
Other factors enter into this decision .
If the interest rate on a variable rate loan resets higher , then the borrower has a greater incentive to default .
If a person ’s income is lower , a loss of $ 50,000 means more to him and he is more likely to default .
If the borrower thinks that the housing market will recover and house prices rebound , he may keep the house .
But in fact these factors were working to increase foreclosures .
In May 2004 the short - term interest rate on 3 - month Treasury bills was 1 percent .
It had been in that neighborhood for 19 months .
It then commenced a steady rise to over 5 percent , reaching that level in June 2006 .
The subprime loans were concentrated on persons with low incomes , so that when housing prices began to decline in late 2005 , that factor worked to increase defaults .
And because housing prices were declining , the outlook for a rebound in prices was dim .
Foreclosures began to rise in 2005 , which was the peak year of housing prices .
They then soared .
Rises of 100 — 200 % in various localities in 2006 occurred , and further doublings and triplings were the rule in 2007 .
Nationwide , the average increases each year were somewhere around 50 — 100 % .
Why investors lose
The bubble had burst and foreclosures rose rapidly , concentrated in the subprime loans .
Meanwhile , financial institutions and others that held these loans ( as lenders ) lost huge amounts on their investments .
This led to a deeper and more general credit crisis when borrowers turned away from all sorts of other loans , such as credit card and automobile loans , that had been packaged up and sold as securities .
This too is a separate story that should be told in more detail .
When the bubble burst , investors who buy and sell mortgage loans recognized that the houses as collateral were no longer enough to cover the loan value .
They viewed the loans as more risky for several reasons , which is why the securities backed by these loans dropped in price .
In the first place , there would be more foreclosures so that the cash flows servicing the securities would fall .
Secondly , the worth of the securities now depended far more on the ability of the borrowers to keep making the payments .
But since subprime mortgage loans had been specifically made to people who do not have a strong ability to pay off their mortgage debts ( people who are poor credit risks ) , the security risk rose dramatically .
The value of the securities backed by mortgage loans plummeted , and those who held these loans as investments ( the lenders ) suffered the value losses .
Paulson ’s call for more regulation
In February of 2008 , Mr. Paulson testified before the Senate Banking Committee .
He said of the subprime crisis : " I do n’t come from the school that says the private sector itself will deal with it .
I believe there needs to be a regulatory response , a policy response . "
Paulson thinks there were bad lending practices and that regulation can cure them .
What is regulation but what the Russians tried for 70 years and could n’t make work ?
What is regulation but what the French kings imposed for hundreds of years ?
We are told in Clive Day ’s History of Commerce , which Mr. Paulson can download for free from Google books , of the manner in which Colbert ’s regulations held back French manufacturing .
" His instructions for dyeing contained 317 articles , to which dyers must conform … These regulations grew constantly more complicated ; an official said in 1787 that the regulations on manufactures filled eight volumes in quarto . "
Colbert " sent out agents everywhere to study industries and to talk with the manufacturers , that he might legislate to the best advantage . "
Today our Congress holds hearings and solicits testimony .
" One man , however , cannot know a hundred businesses better than the men who are carrying them on .
Colbert and his successors were ignorant of many points , were deceived in many others .
The result was a mass of regulations of which many were utterly bad , injuring both producer and consumer . "
This perfectly well describes Congress .
It ’s the situation that Americans face today .
Paulson in the Paulson Report blames government regulation for some part of the subprime difficulties , and as a solution he proposes to modernize regulation .
This means he proposes to add to it , centralize it , and augment federal government power .
For example , the report calls for a federal commission to regulate mortgage originations .
There are probably already 317 articles to which banks that originate mortgages must conform .
Apparently we need 317 more .
The patchwork of federal regulatory agencies comes in for scolding .
The solution there , we are told , is to consolidate them .
The Paulson Report recommends that the Federal Reserve should have important new powers as " Market Stability Regulator . "
The Fed would become virtually a financial system czar , with oversight over all sorts of financial market institutions , from banks to insurers .
There is a market stability regulator that Paulson never mentions , and that regulator is gold , or more generally market - produced money .
The report manages to blame the individual states for doing too little and for not doing what they do do uniformly enough .
I quote :
" The high levels of delinquencies , defaults , and foreclosures among subprime borrowers in 2007 and 2008 have highlighted gaps in the U.S. oversight system for mortgage origination .
In recent years mortgage brokers and lenders with no federal supervision originated a substantial portion of all mortgages and over 50 percent of subprime mortgages in the United States .
These mortgage originators are subject to uneven degrees of state level oversight ( and in some cases limited or no oversight ) . "
All of this is highly misleading .
Those at the state level complain that the federal authorities already have enough statutes and rules .
They fail at enforcement even when it comes to matters of fraud .
Listen to Bart Bartholomew , president of the Colorado Association of Mortgage Brokers :
" HUD enforces federal statutes , but there are only 30 investigators for the country .
That ’s one HUD investigator per 1.6 states , Mr. Bartholomew added .
u2018 The cavalry is not coming .
There are no mortgage police , ’ he said .
u2018 There were over 2,000 purchase transactions alone last year in Colorado .
" u2018 That does not include the refi transactions .
The truth is , there is no way one person can possibly be expected to review that amount of transactions .
" u2018 And we all know the federal government is not going to spend the funds necessary to enforce the rules and regulations that they have placed upon our industry , ’ he declared . "
Chris Holbert , president of the Colorado Mortgage Lenders Association , has hit upon some common sense and free market solutions to the problem of fraud in mortgage lending :
" Mr. Holbert raises the idea of forming a new position for a private attorney general , deputized in the justice system , to go after criminals who break the law , including RESPA and HMDA .
u2018 It ’s a Wild West solution , but we think it ’s intriguing , ’ he said .
u2018
In the old days , they used to go hunt down the bad guys .
Our legislatures have become very good at passing laws .
What good does it do if it ’s not enforced ?
It ’s time to hold the state legislatures and Congress accountable . ’ "
Instead of hunting down drug dealers , imagine the novelty of making a significant dent in real crimes such as fraud .
This is too much to expect of government , which is why a return to the Wild West ( which was not so wild ) solution is attractive .
Summary and conclusions
The proponents of greater government power are busily absolving government of any blame in the subprime crisis , deflecting criticism from government , and taking the opportunity to propose that greater government will prevent future such crises .
And in doing all of this , they are busy blaming as culprits the greed of market participants , lenders , the market , the free market ( even though it is heavily regulated ) , the capital markets , securitization , market instability , capitalism , illiquidity , bond raters , state regulation , and insufficient federal regulation .
It is rather easy to spread the blame and confusion around because the financial structures involved are novel and complex .
There are many targets .
But we should place the blame squarely where it belongs , which is on government failure , that failure being in the fiat money inflation brought about by the Federal Reserve .
How are we to explain and understand the details of the subprime crisis ?
Is it a sudden outcropping of market madness ?
Is this an instance of a free market gone haywire ?
Is it a case of mass lender stupidity ?
Is it a case of greed and corruption ?
Is it a case of inefficient regulation by the states ?
The subprime crisis is none of these .
Its origin lies in a housing price bubble brought about by excessive central bank money creation and the subsequent puncturing of this bubble .
The price declines in housing then induced the large rise in foreclosures of the recent past and present .
Fiat money inflations often bring on real estate booms followed by busts .
These inflations are the common element in real estate cycles that span many countries and many centuries , and they put the lie to the hypothesis that bad lending practices are the culprit .
Fraudulent money creation is the culprit , not faulty evaluation of the credit risks of borrowers .
Jesús Huerta De Soto ’s book Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles provides documentation of cases .
For example , real estate prices fell by 50 percent by 1349 in Florence when boom became bust .
That boom was fed by bank money creation :
" Evidence shows that from the beginning of the fourteenth century bankers gradually began to make fraudulent use of a portion of the money on demand deposit , creating out of nowhere a significant amount of expansionary credit .
Therefore , it is not surprising that an increase in the money supply ( in the form of credit expansion ) caused an artificial economic boom followed by a profound , inevitable recession . "
In the face of excessive money , lenders tend to adopt laxer standards for making loans .
Borrowers and investors tend to use higher amounts of leverage .
Asset prices rise .
When the rate of money creation slows or halts and asset prices begin to decline , those who have bought houses at high prices , perhaps with little or no equity of their own , quickly find themselves in a position of negative equity , with their promised loan payments exceeding their house values .
This induces default and foreclosures .
That is how the subprime crisis began .
It then spread to other sorts of securitized loans and to capital losses of investors , including major banks , in all sorts of loans .
It is impossible for regulation of loans and lending to prevent future crises of the same sort from happening if central banks create excessive money .
If loans are shut down , that is tantamount to not creating excess money , contrary to the premise .
That will not happen .
Instead , increased regulation will divert loans into channels that the authorities think will be safe from price decline .
That will involve increased centralized control over the economy , which will stifle growth .
And it will only shift the price pressures into some other markets .
The crisis brought about by excess money will simply take on new forms if loan regulations are multiplied and made effective .

Low - paid workers and villa gripes cast a cloud over ' eighth wonder of the world ' in Dubai
Pitfalls in paradise : why Palm Jumeirah is struggling to live up to the hype
Dubai's sheikhs have claimed it is " the eighth wonder of the world " , and seen from space the tree - shaped sand and rock formation of the Palm Jumeirah looks exactly that .
But after the hype about David Beckham buying a mansion here and the novelty of living four miles out to sea has faded , that claim is starting to look shaky .
It seems there is a little trouble in paradise .
Four thousand " Palm pioneers " have moved in and are getting to grips with life in the sweltering Arabian Gulf .
This week , when the Guardian visited , the gripes were as common as the plaudits among the Brits who are in the vanguard of this new community .
Multimillion - pound villas have been squeezed together " like Coronation Street " , air - conditioning bills are hitting £ 800 a month and persistent snags have led some to joke it is more " eighth blunder " than " eighth wonder " .
The villas were developed by the government - owned Nakheel Properties , and many residents believe the company 's slogan , " Our vision inspires humanity " , which flutters on flags around the place , is beginning to look over - egged .
It is not all bad news .
The blue seas which lap the man -made shores are teeming with rays , hermit crabs and baracudas .
Away from the ongoing construction , which has four years to run , life in the middle of the ocean is incredibly peaceful .
But for Rachael Wilds , 42 , an exhibition organiser from Surrey who moved in with her family to a palatial villa on one of the Palm's " fronds " a year ago , it was not what she expected .
She found her £ 3 m property squashed against a neighbour 's and set in a barren , almost treeless , landscape .
" It was absolutely nothing as it was depicted in the brochure , " she says .
" There was a massive gap between the villas and it was full of lush tropical gardens .
We were totally shocked at the closeness of the villas . "
Despite summer temperatures of 48C and high humidity , access to centralised air conditioning was not included in the purchase price of apartments , and residents are rebelling against plans to ask them to pay extra .
More seriously , there is evidence the low - pay and hard conditions endured by the thousands of migrant workers who built the area are driving many into despair and debt .
It has made for an awkward start for a development that is far more than a whim of the Dubai royal family .
Palm Jumeirah is the testing ground for the United Arab Emirates ' strategy for life after oil - big - scale tourism .
Once complete , there will be homes and hotel rooms for 65,000 people .
Crucially , the Palm adds 40 miles to Dubai 's coastline .
The sheikhs are gambling this will keep the visitors coming back .
Two even bigger man-made islands are under way along the coast : a replica of an existing island called The World and another called The Universe .
The lab rats in this experiment are a strange mix .
They include England footballers , a battalion of middle - class Britons from places such as Salisbury and Weybridge , and even , it is said , Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan , who is thought to have a house opposite Kieron Dyer , the West Ham midfielder .
Raffaele Cannas , 47 , a British property consultant , was one of the first to pick up his keys in late 2006 and found himself squeezing a couple of England players into his Mini after they 'd asked to see how he had decorated his apartment .
" I did n't know who they were at first , but I had David James doubled up in the front seat and Andy Cole tucked in the back , " he says .
After the Brits came the Russians , and a growing number of rich Iranians .
Many aspects to life here are undeniably good .
Residents can soak up an incredible amount of sunshine - some years it never rains - and the beaches are groomed at least twice a week .
But this is no picture - book desert island .
Its size is the most arresting characteristic for newcomers .
An eight - lane motorway is at the Palm 's trunk , and each frond is a mile long .
Meanwhile , there is yet more expansion , with 40 hotels being built on the breakwater .
At times it is also a harsh environment .
Lawns routinely wither without intense watering and the tallest trees are , in fact , mobile phone masts dressed up to look like palms .
Just 18 months after moving in , Cannas is thinking of leaving for New Zealand .
" The marketing machine was so powerful , calling the Palm the eighth wonder of the world , that people 's expectations went through the roof , " he says .
" It has n't turned out like that . "
For many soaring property prices have softened any discomforts .
A " signature villa " which went for £ 750,000 in 2002 is now worth £ 3 m .
A nagging guilt for some is the quality of life of the migrant construction workers who built all this .
Most are from India and Bangladesh and they travel in bus convoys from labour camps in the desert each morning .
A typical labourer earns £ 25 a week , and many are in debt to agents in their home countries who paid for their passage .
KV Shamsudheen , a workers ' rights activist in Dubai , says interest rates can be as high as 120 % a year .
One hundred migrant workers killed themselves in the Emirates in 2006 , and the trend is rising , he says .
Alcohol is a growing problem , with workers racking up debts to buy drink .
In Jebel Ali , a dusty camp almost 10 miles from the Palm , 30,000 male workers live up to 12 a room in prefabricated blocks .
" I am not happy , " says a Bangladeshi carpenter known locally as Sofiull , 52 .
" The company said I would earn £ 60 a week , but I am getting £ 30 .
They have delayed my pay two months and it's a great problem . "
Mohamed Mahboub , 30 , has been in Dubai for three years .
He has n't seen his daughter since she was a baby , but sends £ 30 of his £ 45 - a - week supervisor 's salary home .
" I miss her , but I am a poor man and I owe money , so I can not go back yet , " he says .
It is a world away from the exclusive gated fronds back on the Palm , where the only sound is often the splash of a paddle from a kayak , the favourite pastime of Palm dwellers .
" Life here is 150 % better than in the UK , " says Donna Dempsey , 46 , a ballet teacher from Kent .
" We have our garbage collected every day , we have clean streets , we have low crime .
You can really chill here .
Sometimes it 's hard to go to work . "

We asked a futurist , a MoJo writer , a No Nukes activist , and a weapons security expert :
What is nuclear energy ’s place in the future mix of energy sources ?
They ’ll be checking in on this Blue Marble entry starting Monday to discuss their controversial answers with readers — and each other .
Want to talk to Stewart Brand , Judith Lewis , Jonas Siegel , or Harvey Wasserman about their take on nukes ?
Now ’s your chance .
Leave a comment below for one of the four guest Blue Marble moderators and they ’ll respond .
Stewart Brand is a futurist with the Global Business Network and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog : I expect that nuclear will grow slowly but steadily in the mix for a couple decades , because it ’s a mature technology that provides baseload electricity with minimum carbon emissions .
Where it goes after that depends on the rapidity of climate change ; the rapidity of other high capacity energy technologies such as space solar , massive electrical storage , high - tech microbe farming , etc ; and the usefulness of further nuclear technology , such as decentralized nuclear “ batteries , ” cheaper reprocessing , fusion , etc .
By mid-century or later , depending on how all those work out , nuclear could be heading toward a majority role , like in France now ; or it could be headed toward a phase - out by the end of the century , replaced by better things ; or the question could seem irrelevant in the face of drastic climate events forcing huge - scale geo-engineering and / or enormous human dieback in the face of collapsing carrying capacity .
Judith Lewis wrote “ The Nuclear Option ” for the May / June 2008 issue of Mother Jones : Nuclear energy is far from environmentally benign , but it does have one significant advantage over coal - fired electricity generation :
It does not emit carbon dioxide .
Even taking into account nuclear ’s entire lifecycle , from mining to refining to enrichment of uranium , from plant construction to startup to waste , it adds far less carbon to the atmosphere than coal or natural gas do , and sometimes even beats solar generation .
If we accept that catastrophic climate change caused by a buildup of carbon in the atmosphere is our most urgent environmental problem , we should at least consider replacing the coal - fired power that provides half the nation ’s electricity with nuclear energy ( which currently provides only a fifth ) .
But while we consider it , we also have to understand that the nuclear industry also has a lot of problems associated with it , including a compromised federal monitoring agency , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
And then there ’s the waste :
It ’s becoming ever more clear as the Department of Energy moves ahead with its plans to build a nuclear waste repository in a mountain of porous volcanic rock on earthquake fault that the DOE and Congress made a very bad decision when it chose Yucca Mountain .
There needs to be much more public involvement in the process of choosing such sites .
The same goes for just about every part of the nuclear industry ’s operations .
The industry does seemed poised for a renaissance , and it might deserve one .
But if the renaissance happens , people in the U.S. need to get as much information as they can handle about nuclear power ; only public participation can force industry and government regulators to do their jobs right .
Jonas Siegel is editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , a media organization that focuses on the intersection of science and security , and has covered nuclear weapons and energy issues for the past five years :
Since its inception , nuclear energy has earned legions of supporters .
The enormous amount of energy contained in a small amount of nuclear fuel — a pound of uranium 235 has more than 2 million times the energy content of a pound of coal — alone inspired visions of grandeur .
Despite its potential , nuclear energy has not overcome a range of risks — safety , nuclear proliferation , and waste — to sustain its growth in the marketplace .
If nuclear is going to be a part of the world ’s future mix of energy sources , it needs to address these risks head on — and compete economically with other sources .
Harvey Wasserman is a No Nukes activist , the author of Solartopia !
Our Green Powered Earth , and edits Nukefree.org : Nuclear power has no place in our future mix of energy sources except as a costly and dangerous curse from previous bad decision - making .
The Peaceful Atom is humankind ’s most expensive technological failure .
To “ revisit ” this corporate boondoggle is to ignore 50 years of staggering losses .
Economically , there is no reason to believe a “ new generation ” of reactors will be any less disastrous than the last one .
The radioactive fuel chain is a major cause of global warming .
The ecological , public health and safety aspects of unsolved problems with terrorism , human design and operator error , “ routine ” radioactive emissions , impossible spent fuel transport and management , weapons proliferation and much more make atomic energy the “ Titanic ” of energy generation .
A dollar invested in efficiency saves seven times the energy a dollar invested in nukes can produce .
Wind and solar are already proven and cheaper .
Let ’s do that instead of re-running the same radioactive horror show .
French soldiers are helping with the evacuation of French citizens
But Chad 's ambassador to Ethiopia said the city had not fallen and President Idriss Deby was " fine " in his palace .
There are unconfirmed reports from Libya that rebels have agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Colonel Gaddafi .
On Saturday evening , France , which has 1,500 troops in Chad , began evacuating some foreign nationals .
The French foreign ministry has condemned the rebel attack , blaming " armed forces from outside " .
Both the Chadian and Sudanese governments support rebels in each others ' territory .
But a French military spokesman , Col Thierry Burkhard , told AP news agency it appeared that Mr Deby had succeeded in containing the rebels at his palace and was " even in the process of pushing them back " .
Looting
There was heavy fighting throughout Saturday after thousands of rebels entered N'Djamena in the morning , after beginning their advance on the city from near Chad 's eastern border with Sudan earlier this week .
Intense gunfire was heard in the city centre .
A witness told the BBC that 30 army tanks were burning in the streets .
There were reports of outbreaks of looting , and of residents cheering on the rebel forces in some areas of the city .
President Deby sparked anger by changing the constitution
A bomb hit the residence of Saudi Arabia 's ambassador to Chad , killing the wife and daughter of an embassy employee , the Saudi foreign ministry said .
But witnesses report that as night fell the fighting subsided , with just sporadic gunfire now being heard .
Gabriel Stauring , a US aid worker trapped inside a hotel in the centre of N'Djamena , told the BBC news website that he and the other guests were spending the night together in the hotel 's dining room .
He said that some people had already been evacuated , but that he had been advised by the US embassy to remain in the hotel until morning .
He said that there had been a heavy attack on the building earlier in the afternoon , but that it has been relatively quiet since .
Ceasefire claim
The Libyan news agency said that rebel leader Mahamat Nouri had agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the Libyan leader , Colonel Muammar Gaddafi .
The African Union has charged Libya with overseeing the response to the rebellion in Chad , which was condemned at the end of the organisation 's summit in Ethiopia .
CHAD TIMELINE
June 2005 - Constitutional changes approved allowing president to stand for third term April 2006 - Hundreds killed as rebels fight government troops on outskirts of N'Djamena May 2006 - President Deby wins election boycotted by opposition January 2008 - EU approves peacekeeping force to protect Darfur refugees from violence in Chad
' Revolution 's going on ' Profile : Idriss Deby
The Union 's new head , President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania , warned that if the rebellion succeeded , the country would be suspended from the AU until normality was restored .
The BBC's Stephanie Hancock , recently based in Chad , says insecurity has been the hallmark of Mr Deby 's 17 - year rule .
In 2005 , he changed the constitution so that he could run for a third term in office , which sparked mass desertions from the army .
The situation was made worse by the accumulation of oil wealth by Mr Deby and his entourage .
Friction with Sudan
There is also tension with Sudan .
Chadian officials say Khartoum is nervous about the deployment of EU troops in Chad and a joint AU / UN force in Sudan 's western region of Darfur - both with the mandate of protecting civilians affected by fighting in Darfur .
France dominates the EU force bound for Chad , whose deployment has been delayed because of the fighting .
Some 100 troops Austrian and Irish troops had been due to arrive last Thursday .
THE REBEL COALITION Unified Military Command includes : Union of Forces for Democracy ( UFDD ) led by Mahamat Nouri Rally of Forces for Change ( RFC ) led by Timane Erdimi UFDD - Fundamental led by Abdelwahid Aboud Mackaye
' Living in fear in N'Djamena '
But late last year , one of the rebel groups , the UFDD , declared a " state of war " against French and other foreign forces because it said they were " bringing diplomatic , strategic and logistical aid " to the president .
Chad 's Foreign Ministers Ahmat Allami has accused Sudan of instigating the rebel advance in order to stop the deployment of the EU force :
" Sudan does not want this force because it would shine a light on all the genocide that is taking place in Darfur orchestrated from Chadian territory , " he told the BBC .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A foul smell permeating London and parts of England over the past two days is due to farmers on the European continent spreading manure in their fields , forecasters and British farmers said Saturday .
Experts say the inescapable farmland smell permeating London will stick around for a couple of days .
The agricultural odor is inescapable in central London and smells vaguely of farmland or even garbage .
Forecasters said a stiff breeze from the east is carrying the smell across the North Sea from Belgium , the Netherlands and even Germany .
They said the smell is likely to hang around through the weekend as the easterly wind continues .
" You can't say it 's going to smell for two days , but the wind is coming in from the same direction , " said Chris Almond , a forecaster with the Met Office , Britain 's weather service .
" It 's not really until Monday , Tuesday that we 'll see a change in the wind direction , with a more marked improvement in air quality . "
He said the smell had probably been stagnating in those countries for a few days , resulting in a more pungent aroma once the winds brought it to England .
The National Farmers ' Union blamed the smell on the muck - spreading by Dutch farmers , who it said are banned from the practice in the winter and are now spreading it " en masse . "
Although the smell may be unusual , the phenomenon of European air spilling its contents over England is not , forecasters have said .
" We quite often get pollution in the form of haze coming over when we 've got these winds from [ an ] easterly direction , particularly when the winds are coming off the near - continent , " he said .
Almond said the smell is in much of central and eastern England , and has reached as far west as Devon , on the southwestern tip of England , where his office is located .
London newspapers reported the smell on their front pages Friday afternoon , with one paper branding it " Le Stink . "
The farmers ' union used the odor to make its case against a similar winter ban proposed on muck - spreading in Britain .
" This is what happens when farmers are forced to empty their slurry store all in one go at the same time instead of being able to apply it little and often during the winter , " spokesman Anthony Gibson said .
" While we are obviously very sorry for any unpleasantness caused to people living in the South East , we are grateful to the Dutch farmers for laying on such a pungent demonstration of what could happen every spring here in the UK if the government presses ahead with its ill - conceived proposal to implement a blanket ban on winter slurry spreading across most or all of the country .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Some dinosaur dung was snapped up at auction in New York even as a 4.5 billion year old meteorite which was supposed to top the sale went unsold .
The two chunks of 130 - million - year - old coprolite , otherwise known as fossilized dinosaur dung , fetched $ 960 at Bonhams in New York on Wednesday , the auction house said .
The Jurassic - era rocks were sold for more than double their maximum estimate , said spokeswoman Staci Smith .
A 4.5 billion - year - old meteorite , on which a Chinese desert hiker habitually ate lunch before he discovered it was valuable , failed to meet the minimum reserve however .
Bonhams had expected the space rock to sell for $ 2.25 million to $ 2.75 million .
Smith said negotiations over the meteorite continued after the auction and that a deal could be struck in days .
The owner of the meteorite , Marvin Kilgore , the curator at the University of Arizona ’s Southwest Meteorite Center , was mystified by the sale of the fossilized dung which is much more common than rocks that have fallen from space .
“ Some people want it on their shelves , I guess , ” he said .
The dung was bought by a phone bidder which the auction house declined to identify .
MONTGOMERY , Ala . 
The former governor of Alabama , Don Siegelman , was ordered Thursday to be released from prison on bond by a federal appeals court , pending his broader appeal in a bribery conviction last June .
Mr. Siegelman , a Democrat , had been taken to prison immediately following his sentencing last year , an unusual move by federal authorities in a white - collar case .
His lawyers said Thursday that he never should have been imprisoned while he appealed his conviction .
Thursday ’s ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta said Mr. Siegelman ’s larger appeal had raised “ substantial questions , ” and so the former governor should be released from the federal prison where he has already served nine months of a seven - year sentence .
The politically charged case has been cited by Democrats here and in Washington as an example of politics influencing decisions by the Department of Justice , a charge Republicans have angrily denied .
Add this to the pile of monumental screw - ups committed by the Bush administration .
Raw Story :
A lengthy investigation published Thursday reveals that the Pentagon gave an inexperienced 22 - year - old a $ 300 million contract to provide ammunition to Afghanistan .
The shady deal resulted in decades old , substandard munitions being delivered to US and Afghan troops fighting on the front lines of the war on terror .
So to recap : During the free - cash - giveaway that is defense contracting , the Pentagon awards $ 300 million to the company of a clueless 22 year old , resulting in our soldiers having to use substandard weaponry .
The bright side ?
According to his MySpace page , he 's a " super nice guy . "
That 's nice to know , at least .
Thank God Waxman is on the case .
We 'll definitely be following this one .
Free Speechless in Turkey Ankara To Change One Law , But Others Still Muffle Dissent
Turkey has said it will soon move to amend a controversial law that makes " insulting Turkishness " a crime punishable by up to three years in prison .
But a number of laws that will remain on the books also represent a threat to free speech .
Von Stefanie von Brochowski
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Some people think Henry Paulson 's backing the wrong horse in the race to rework financial regulation .
The Treasury secretary on Monday formally unveiled his Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure .
The plan , which had been in the works for almost a year , envisions an expanded role for the Federal Reserve in preserving market stability and overseeing the financial services industry .
Defining those responsibilities has taken on new urgency in the wake of a credit crunch that has led to some $ 200 billion in writedowns by big firms and now threatens to exact a toll on the economy .
" The Federal Reserve 's responsibilities would be broad , important and difficult to undertake , " Paulson concedes in Treasury 's blueprint .
But while episodes of market instability are difficult to predict , let alone counter , " The Federal Reserve 's enhanced regulatory authority along with clear regulatory responsibilities would complement and attempt to focus market discipline to limit systemic risk . "
Yet Paulson 's proposal leaves some observers wondering whether the Fed - which currently oversees the nation 's banks as well as setting interest rate policy - is up to that task .
" The Fed as a bank regulator has done a very poor job overall , " says Joseph Mason , a professor at Drexel University 's LeBow College of Business in Philadelphia .
" There are tremendous risks of using [ the credit crunch ] as an excuse ... for an umbrella regulatory structure . "
Skeptics contend that under former chief Alan Greenspan , the Fed played two roles in inflating the housing bubble that has since burst with such serious consequences for the financial sector .
It 's well accepted that Greenspan helped to fuel the housing bubble by cutting interest rates as low as 1 % back in 2003 , and keeping them there even as the economy began to recover .
But beyond that , some criticize Greenspan 's Fed for failing to curb a sharp decline in mortgage underwriting standards that helped fuel the price run-up , particularly in hot markets such as California and Arizona .
Indeed , Greenspan appeared at times to be defending some of the high - risk loans that were being abused by lenders and mortgage brokers .
" American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage , " Greenspan said in a February 2004 speech to the Credit Union National Association in Washington .
Since then , Greenspan has retired , making way for Ben Bernanke to take the reins at the Fed .
But the newfangled loans remain with us , in an unpleasant reminder of regulators ' laxity .
To be sure , many of the biggest issuers of aggressive , newfangled mortgages are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision , not the Fed .
Big issuers of option adjustable rate mortgages - loans that let the borrower choose to make minimal payments in early years before the interest rate resets - include thrifts Countrywide ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) , which agreed to sell itself in January to Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) amid questions about its liquidity , and Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) .
The problems in those loans are amply illustrated by the difficulties at another thrift , Downey Financial ( DSL ) , of Newport Beach , Calif .
Downey reported two weeks ago that delinquent loans accounted for nearly 11 % of the bank 's assets at the end of February , up from 6 % at Nov. 30 .
Still , it is the Fed - along with the Securities and Exchange Commission - that shoulders the burden of being the most visible regulator .
Indeed , Bernanke told Congress back in September that the Fed has been acting to protect consumers from abusive lending practices .
" The Federal Reserve takes responsible lending and consumer protection very seriously , " Bernanke told the House Committee on Financial Services back on Sept. 20 .
" Along with other federal and state agencies , we are responding to the subprime problems on a number of fronts .
We are committed to preventing problems from recurring , while still preserving responsible subprime lending . "
But by then billions of dollars of bad loans were already on the books .
And though the contrary view was n't popular at the time , there were those who foresaw problems in the mortgage industry even before house prices crested .
Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington , called option ARMs " the latest and most pernicious financial innovation of the current bubble " in a piece back in September 2006 .
" It 's too bad , " he wrote , " that no one in a position of authority was awake before the bubble grew to such proportions . "
That observation helps to explain why Paulson 's Fed plan is raising eyebrows in some quarters .
Gregory Valliere , political strategist at Stanford Financial Group , told CNBC Monday that charging the Fed with maintaining market stability " is like putting Eliot Spitzer in charge of the morals division . "
Migrants : Committee says migrants compete with UK workers Record levels of immigration have had " little or no impact " on the economic well - being of Britons , an influential House of Lords committee has said .
It says competition from immigrants has had a negative impact on the low paid and training for young UK workers , and has contributed to high house prices .
The peers want a limit on immigration levels - a view backed by the Tories .
Minister Liam Byrne says migration has added £ 6bn to the economy and a points system is preferable to a cap .
In their report , The Economic Impact of Immigration , the peers said the government " should have an explicit target range " for immigration and set rules to keep within that limit .
' Inconsistencies '
They raised the prospect of cutting the rights of people to follow relatives who have settled in the UK .
UK MIGRATION IN 2006
An estimated 400,000 people left the UK for a year or more - up from 359,000 in 2005
This is the highest figure since the estimates began in 1991
Of those , just over half - 207,000 - were British citizens Some 591,000 people arrived in the UK to live for a year or more .
The previous highest was 586,000 in 2004
Net immigration was 191,000 , some 53,000 lower than the record estimate of 244,000 in 2004
There were 316,000 more non-British citizens and 126,000 fewer British citizens in the UK
And they rejected claims by ministers that a high level of immigration was needed to prevent labour shortages as " fundamentally flawed " .
The peers also warned that the government 's new Australian - style points - based immigration system carried a " clear danger of inconsistencies and overlap " .
The Lords Economic Affairs Committee , whose members include two ex-chancellors and other Cabinet members , took eight months to consider government immigration policies .
Inquiry chairman Lord Wakeham said : " Looking to the future , if you have got that increase in numbers and you have n't got any economic benefit from it , you have got to ask yourself , is that a wise thing to do ?
" That is why we want the government to look at it . "
House price rises Committee chairman Lord Vallance of Tummel , a former CBI president , said the government 's analysis of the economic impact from immigration was " very shaky " .
They show unequivocally that the benefits of the current immigration policy to ordinary UK citizens are largely non-existent
David Davis ,
Shadow home secretary
Record trends in UK migration
In quotes : Migration reaction But Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said the report confirmed the government 's assessment that migration had added £ 6bn to the economy in 2006 .
" That 's important in anyone 's book , " he said .
It also " echoed " the government 's belief that migration had to benefit the wider community and not just business , he said .
" The key question we have got to answer is how do we make sure we only get the skills we need in this country and no more ?
That 's why we need the points system , " he told the BBC .
He said newcomers would also be asked to contribute " a little bit extra " to public services before they became British citizens and unskilled workers from outside the EU would be banned .
' Clear danger '
The report claims that if net immigration of 190,000 people per year continued over the next 20 years , it would contribute to a 10 % increase in house prices .
FOREIGN WORKERS IN UK 2005 Home Office worker registration scheme - 194,953 UK work permits - 86,191 EU and EFTA * - 35,200 Working holidaymakers - 20,135
Highly skilled migrant programme - 17,631 Seasonal agricultural workers scheme - 15,455 Domestic servants - 10,100 UK ancestry - 8,260 Sector based schemes - 7,401 Au pairs - 2,360 Science and engineering graduates scheme - 2,699 Ministers of religion - 530 Total - 400,915 Excludes students ; *EFTA - European Free Trade Association
It adds : " The available evidence suggests that immigration has had a small negative impact on the lowest - paid workers in the UK and a small positive impact on the earnings of higher - paid workers . "
And there was a " clear danger " immigration had hit training and apprenticeships offered to British workers .
Of the government 's new points - based system , which breaks immigration into five new tiers based largely on earning power , the report says : " It is not clear whether the new system will in fact constitute the radical overhaul of the UK 's immigration system suggested by the government . "
The use of GDP as the measure of immigration 's economic contribution was " irrelevant and misleading " .
Instead , GDP per capita - or income per head of the population - would be a better measure , the report said .
" Our general conclusion is that the economic benefits of positive net immigration are small or insignificant , " it said .
' Lost track ' Sir Andrew Green , of pressure group Migrationwatch , said the report had " torn to shreds the government 's economic case for the massive levels of immigration which they have actively encouraged " .
And shadow home secretary David Davis said the peers had shown " unequivocally that the benefits of the current immigration policy to ordinary UK citizens are largely non-existent " .
HAVE YOUR SAY Immigrants should be allowed entry only if they have a highly skilled talent that is in short demand in this country Peter Carstairs " We are delighted they say there should be an explicit target range for immigration through controls on non-EU applicants , " he said .
" This is a policy that we have been arguing for , for years and which the government has consistently rejected . "
Chris Huhne , the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman , said the report made clear that " the government has completely lost track of the number of people who live in this country " .
" No wonder there is a total inability to manage immigration or create policies that deal with its effects . "
' Motivated workers ' Ex -Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson said : " Population increases make countries bigger , but they do n't make countries more prosperous .
" The increased size of the economy is neither here nor there if it does n't bring increased prosperity .
And the reason it does n't is because there are more mouths to feed , more people there . "
But Dr Danny Sriskandarajah , head of migration at the Institute for Public Policy Research , said that to say there were no economic benefits was " simplistic and misleading " .
" Recent immigration has brought immense benefits to the UK in terms of economic growth , increased competitiveness and the delivery of public services , " he said .
Supermarket chain Sainsburys was among those to praise foreign workers in evidence to the committee .
It said it had found foreign - born workers to be highly motivated with a strong work ethic which rubbed off on the British - born staff .

The Eugene Register - Guard of Eugene , OR today published a ringing endorsement of Barack Obama .
The paper pointed out that the choice facing Democrats should be a happy one , “ The historic choice facing Democrats ought to be a happy one :
Their nominee either will be the first woman or the first African - ¬American to head a major party ’s presidential ticket , and both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are candidates of extraordinary talent .
Yet the Democratic campaign has turned ugly … ”
The editors wrote that Obama offered a chance at a fresh political chapter , “ Voters should grasp the opportunity to open a new chapter — a chapter with a fresh political vocabulary , elevated discourse and rekindled hopes .
Obama offers that opportunity , and Oregon Democrats should support him in the May 20 primary election .
Clinton has the misfortune of being inextricably associated with the politics of the past — a misfortune not entirely of her own making . ”
An interesting point was brought up about Clinton always being haunted by the ghosts of her husband ’s administration , “ Clinton has a well - developed plan for health care reform , but if she sent it to Congress as president , her proposal surely would be examined through the lens of the failed plan she crafted in 1993 .
Clinton ’s positions on issues of trade have evolved , but no one would forget that the North American Free Trade Agreement was a product of her husband ’s administration .
Name any issue — from taxes to Cabinet appointments , from public lands management to defense — and the ghosts of the 1990s would be standing over Clinton ’s shoulder . ”

The endorsement concluded , “ He ( Obama ) is the best orator to seek the presidency in a generation .
His candidacy has captured the imagination of young Americans and has reached far across the partisan divide .
He would represent to the world a new face of America .
The themes of his campaign — hope , unity , optimism — are right for darkening times .
Oregon has a rare moment of relevance in the nominating process .
Oregon Democrats should use it to give Barack Obama the chance to become the first Democratic president of the 21st century . ”
The editorial board of this paper really put its finger on the national pulse .
If there is one sentiment that I hear most often it is that people are tired of Clintons and Bushs .
Many feel like the nation needs a fresh face and voice , so while Hillary Clinton is picking up the insignificant endorsement of the far right wing Pittsburgh Tribune Review , Barack Obama continues to build the national momentum to propel him to the White House .

Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about the topic , he wants to hear from you .
Roland Martin says the three presidential candidates will never be " regular folks . "
( CNN ) --
Can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an " average American " will occupy the White House ?
Listening to the punditry today , you would think folks who revel in the comedy of Larry the Cable Guy or Katt Williams really would have a shot at the White House .
It 's totally absurd .
So , Sen. Barack Obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to Columbia and Harvard ?
And Sen. Hillary Clinton is an elitist because she went to Yale ?
Do you actually think Sen. John McCain is n't an elitist ?
He went to an exclusive college -- the Naval Academy , and that is one of the hardest places to get into .
( You can't even apply unless a member of Congress recommends you . )
Karl Rove , who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich Republican , has called both Democratic candidates elitists .
Well , his former boss , President George W. Bush , went to Yale .
So did Bush 's dad , former president George H.W. Bush , and his granddaddy , former Sen. Prescott Bush .
All three Bushes also were members of the super elite organization Skull and Bones .
The younger Bush later went to Harvard .
He walked into the governor 's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad 's money and connections .
Sounds like an elitist to me !
But no , we 're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots , folksy charm and him removing brush at his Crawford , Texas , ranch ( do n't forget the family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine , where all the " regular " folks hang out ) .
Surely you recall when Bush nominated Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court ?
Those same conservative voices decrying the elitist Democrats were blasting her because she went to little old Southern Methodist University , that unremarkable -- their view -- university in Dallas , Texas .
( By the way , that will be the home of the George W. Bush Library . )
You can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from Harvard , Yale or Princeton , she would n't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the Republican Party .
And let 's stay with the Supreme Court for a moment .
Where did its members go to school ?
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. --
Undergrad and law school , Harvard .
Justice John Paul Stevens -- Undergrad : University of Chicago .
Law school : Northwestern .
Justice Antonin Scalia -- Undergrad : Georgetown University and the University of Fribourg , Switzerland .
Law school : Harvard .
Justice Anthony Kennedy -- Undergrad : Stanford University and the London School of Economics .
Law school : Harvard .
Justice David Souter -- Undergrad : Harvard ; Magdalen College , Oxford ; Oxford University .
Law school : Harvard .
Justice Clarence Thomas -- Undergrad : Holy Cross .
Law school : Yale .
Justice Ruth Ginsburg -- Undergrad : Cornell .
Law school : Harvard ( attended ) ; finished at Columbia .
Justice Stephen Breyer -- Undergrad , Stanford ; Magdalen College , Oxford .
Law school : Harvard .
Justice Samuel Alito -- Undegrad : Princeton .
Law school : Yale .
That 's pretty much an elite list of schools .
We have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the White House is really and truly like the rest of us .
All three candidates do n't know what it 's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of Americans are confronted with daily .
Each are members of the U.S. Senate , and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it !
While your pension plan is shot to hell , their plan will NEVER be underfunded .
The members will see to that , courtesy of taxpayer dollars .
Forget how many times Obama bowls gutter balls , Clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and McCain talks about how he 's a regular guy .
Each , courtesy of their $ 169,300 annual salary , makes far more than the average American .
And when it comes to wealth , Clinton gets to enjoy the $ 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the White House ( even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors ) .
McCain 's wife , Cindy , runs one of Anheuser Busch 's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $ 100 million .
They will never be living paycheck - to - paycheck .
Obama is the poorest of the three , but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best - selling books , " The Audacity of Hope " and " Dreams from My Father " after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention .
How many average Americans would n't mind having a million dollars in their savings account ?
Bottom line :
The narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day .
And their efforts to show that they are " just like us " are really pathetic .
You do n't have to go duck hunting , be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you 're " one of us . "
Just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics :
Advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home .
One more thing :
Do n't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television , radio and in print who decry these " elitists " and trumpet that they are for the blue collar , middle - class worker in middle America .
Many of them pull down multimillion - dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on Martha 's Vineyard and in the Hamptons when they all vacation .
They , too , will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and Ivy League institutions .
Yes , we even have elitists in the media .
Who would 've thunkit ?

The linear flight formations of migratory birds are called echelons .
The V and the J structures are typical and are the most readily recognized flock echelons , but other variations also occur .
Studies of several species have shown that a true V - shaped echelon is , in fact , less common than a J formation is .
There are two well - supported and complementary explanations for why birds fly in formation .
One is to conserve energy by taking advantage of the upwash vortex fields created by the wings of the birds in front .
The other is to facilitate orientation and communication among the birds .
These explanations are not mutually exclusive , and both have been backed by a variety of studies .
The relative importance of each undoubtedly shifts as various factors , such as the season of the year or the purpose of individual flights , change .
During local feeding flights , for example , energy conservation is probably much less important than careful orientation and collision avoidance are .
During long - distance migration , orientation and communication remain necessary , but there is also much to be gained for each bird in the flock by optimizing its position to conserve energy .
Fluid dynamics and energy wave configuration calculations have been used to test predictions of where birds should position themselves in relation to others to conserve the most energy as they travel through the air .
Analyses of flock formations using photography have measured bird positions and found them to almost always be located such that they gain some energetic advantage .
The animals are not very often in the expected optimal location , however , indicating that other factors also influence position in the formation .
Knowledge of birds visual axes , " blind spots " and field of vision have allowed researchers to pinpoint the best locations for birds within a flock to maintain optimal visual positioning .
Actual positions of the animals are usually positively related to these predictions but are , again , not always optimal .
Studies have categorized the positions of birds and found that some individuals take positions that are most closely predicted to satisfy the energy conservation hypothesis ; others are in better visual contact positions ; and still others are not apparently responding to either benefit or are in a position that should gain some advantage from both benefits .
The leaders of formations change from time to time , but the causes , frequency and characteristics of these changes have not yet been determined .
Sustained observation from the ground of flocks covering great distances in the air is very difficult .
There are plenty of intuitive predictions about leader choice that quickly come to mind relative to the age , experience , sex , condition and social status of the leaders , but researchers have not figured out how to overcome the prohibitive logistic issues to test them .
Some scientists have trained birds to fly in formation with small aircraft ; perhaps their experiences will yield opportunities to test these ideas .

In response to a recent post , an anonymous commenter wrote that
It would be scientific misconduct … to make statements based on someone else ’s unpublished work …
Scientific results do n’t exist until they have been peer reviewed and published .
Peer review has become the gold standard of the scientific community .
Bring up a scientific finding , and the first thing you may be asked is , “ Ah , well , is this peer reviewed ? ” ( For those who do n’t know , peer review means that , before the journal will publish a paper , one or more other scientists who study similar topics ) .
There is now even a popular blog aggregater that focuses exclusively on blogging about peer reviewed research .
In the age of the Discovery Institute there are some good reasons to focus on peer reviewed research as a way of excluding quacks .
It ’s a way of saying that this research has been vetted .
That said , when I read comments like the one above , I think the time has come to push back , and point out that peer review is not the arbiter of truth .
Truth is the arbiter of truth , and peer review is merely a flawed tool we use to help get there .
Peer reviewers do n’t check to make sure the results are true .
Peer reviewers do not typically replicate the experiment in question .
They do not check the math .
Most of what they do is check that the arguments are reasonable and that the experiment (s ) were well designed .
Peer reviewers do not necessarily even have to agree with a paper they accept .
They may simply think the data are compelling and the arguments are worth hearing , even if they may be wrong .
Thus , peer review does a reasonable job of weeding out quacks .
Luckily , most scientists are not quacks , so what does it do for the rest of us ?
I ’m not sure , but I think a partial answer is that two minds are better than one .
Reviewers often notice things that the authors missed — not because the authors were n’t smart , but because research is damn complicated and you can never think of everything .
Typically what happens , at least in psychology , is that the reviewers suggest additional analyses or additional experiments that would make the paper stronger .
Based on those comments , the authors may run new experiments then revise the paper and resubmit .
Peer reviewers , in this sense , are n’t so much vetters or fact - checkers as editors .
Peer review is a way of improving — not perfecting — an article .
So is it scientific misconduct to refer to unpublished work ?
I do n’t think so .
It is dangerous , though , because there are good reasons ( above ) to be more confident of something that has gone through peer review .
It is a bit impolite to refer to something that has not been published , because then your audience ca n’t go look at it themselves .
And that ’s the main point .
Peer reviewers are not the judges of truth , but all of us are on the jury .
( I should say that I primarily have experienced peer review within psychology .
People from other fields may have different experiences , so comment away . )
Rudy ’s campaign manager praises Hillary ’s wait for Ohio and Texas strategy …
Mike DuHaime , a Republican consultant who managed Rudolph W. Giulianiâs campaign , said Mrs. Clinton was making the right decisions in trying to make the most of her strengths .
â Clearly , she has had success in larger states and there are a whole bunch of delegates at stake on March 4 , â  Mr. DuHaime said .
â
They are not trying to figure out who can win the most states ; they are trying to figure out who can win the most delegates.â 
COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo. , March 31 , 2008 — Two students at Colorado College were found guilty of violating the school ’s conduct code regarding “ violence ” after they distributed a satirical flyer mocking a publication of the Feminist and Gender Studies program .
As part of their punishment , student Chris Robinson and a second student have been required to hold a campus forum discussing issues brought up by their satirical publication .
The students have turned to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help .
“ One flyer that mentions ‘ male castration ’ is not violence , but a flyer that makes fun of it by mentioning ‘ chainsaws ’ is prohibited ?
Both should be protected , but the double standard and lack of respect for freedom of speech in this case is simply staggering , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ Colorado College is brazenly violating its own promise of freedom of expression , as well as both fairness and common sense .
Colorado College should reject both double standards and censorship . ”
In early 2008 , Colorado College ’s “ Feminist and Gender Studies Interns ” distributed a flyer called “ The Monthly Rag . ”
The flyer included a reference to “ male castration , ” an announcement about a lecture on “ feminist porn ” by a “ world - famous prostitute and porn star , ” an explanation of “ packing ” ( pretending to have a phallus ) , and a quotation from The Bitch Manifesto .
As a parody of “ The Monthly Rag , ” Robinson and a second student , who wishes to remain nameless , distributed a flyer in February called “ The Monthly Bag ” under the pseudonym “ The Coalition of Some Dudes . ”
The flyer included references to “ chainsaw etiquette , ” the shooting range of a sniper rifle , a quotation regarding a sexual position from the website menshealth.com , and a quotation about “ female violence and abuse ” of men from the website batteredmen.com .
Shortly thereafter , Colorado College President Richard F. Celeste sent out a campus - wide email about “ The Monthly Bag , ” stating that “ The flyers include threatening and demeaning content , which is categorically unacceptable in this community …
Anonymous acts meant to demean and intimidate others are not [ welcome ] . ”
The e-mail asked the authors of “ The Monthly Bag ” to come forward .
When they did less than an hour later , they were charged with violating the college ’s values of respect and integrity .
FIRE wrote to Celeste on March 21 , 2008 , pointing out that any punishment would contradict Colorado College ’s own policies and advertised commitments to free expression .
The school ’s Diversity & Anti-Discrimination Policy states that “ On a campus that is free and open , no idea can be banned or forbidden .
No viewpoint or message may be deemed so hateful that it may not be expressed . ”
Celeste , a former governor of Ohio , is abroad , and other administrators receiving the letter have not responded .
Two weeks after their hearing before the student conduct committee , Vice President for Student Life / Dean of Students Mike Edmonds finally wrote to the “ Coalition of Some Dudes ” students on March 25 , stating that they had been found guilty of “ violating the student code of conduct policy on violence ” and that as a punishment , they would be required to hold a forum to “ discuss issues and questions raised ” by “ The Monthly Bag . ”
Although Edmonds acknowledged that the intent of the publication was to satirize “ The Monthly Rag , ” he wrote that “ in the climate in which we find ourselves today , violence — or implied violence — of any kind cannot be tolerated on a college campus . ”
Apparently , according to Edmonds , “ the juxtaposition of weaponry and sexuality ” in an anonymous parody made students subjectively feel threatened by chainsaws or rifles .
“ Not only has Colorado College wrongly punished students for expression that any reasonable person would easily recognize as parody that threatens no one , but according to Edmonds ’s standard , countless movies , songs , and other artistic endeavors that ‘ juxtapose weaponry and sexuality ’ are inappropriate for the adult students of Colorado College , ” Adam Kissel , Director of FIRE ’s Individual Rights Defense Program , said .
“ Colorado College must live up to its own promises of free expression and allow its students to engage in robust debate and satire — even when some members of the campus community may feel offended . ”

It is hardly a revelation that teenagers like to sleep late .
But more and more research is showing that this is not just a preference  or even the result of late - night studying or instant messaging  but is rooted in their biological rhythms .
All of this would be little more than an interesting observation except that most high schools start so early , and so many teenagers are having a hard time staying awake .
A recent Op - Ed article in The Times cited a National Sleep Foundation survey in which more than a quarter of the students reported that they fell asleep in class at least once a week .
Researchers say this is true because youngsters  beginning around age 12 until they reach their mid-20s  only start producing melatonin , the sleep - inducing hormone , around 11 p.m. and that production peaks until about 7 a.m .
In adults , melatonin peaks until around 4 a.m .
Trying to wake up a teenager before 7 o’clock is like trying to awake an adult before 4 a.m .
The obvious remedy would be for high schools to start later  well after 8 a.m .
A handful of schools that have switched have reported beneficial results .
School officials in Minneapolis say that attendance improved and students ’ grades rose slightly after they changed to an 8:40 a.m. start several years ago .
In Wilton , Conn. , where the high school start time was pushed back to 8:20 a.m. from 7:35 , teachers and parents reported improved student behavior and greater alertness .
Surveys of students in both districts indicated that they did not use the later starts as an excuse to go to bed later .
Numerous districts have considered the idea of later high school hours , only to drop it because of fierce adult opposition .
Coaches complain that the later classroom hours in the afternoon would take time from their training programs and teams ’ success .
School bus companies would be forced to change their schedules .
And many parents complained that they would have to adjust their own schedules .

Recently on the SGU podcast we have discussed the martial arts masters who claim they can use chi , the mysterious undetectable life force of Eastern mysticism , to make themselves invulnerable to blows or to knock out opponents without even touching them .
It ’s all very impressive – in that it is an amazing demonstration of the power of suggestion and self - deception .
Belief in chi is also telling us something about human psychology .
That there is a psychological motivation to believe in the magic of chi does not mean that chi is a fiction , but since we can say scientifically from independent lines of evidence that there is no credible evidence for the existence of anything like chi or any life energy , that does lead to the question of why people believe in it .
SGU listener , Matt Snodgrass , wrote us an e-mail saying the following :
I understand how people fall for a lot of the junk that ’s out there , as I said I ’ve tried some of it , and gone into more depth with things like the herbal concoctions .
The only real way of advancing in martial arts though , is hard work .
It ’s like dieting in many ways , those who I ’ve ever seen that become very good do so by make lifestyle changes such as going to the gym regularly , practicing drills and fighting moves constantly , keeping up on the cardiovascular training , etc .
This becomes tedious to many people though , and the magic becomes very alluring , much like fad diets .
I think Matt is exactly correct , and his analogy is very apt .
Belief in magic in many forms is about wanting an easy solution to life ’s problems .
Numerous industries exist solely to peddle easy or magical answers to complex problems .
Easy answers sell well .
We see this clearly with weight loss .
Changing one ’s habits to limit caloric intake and increase exercise is hard work .
What people want is to lose weight without diet or exercise , and so almost weekly we are promised a new miracle solution , a secret to accomplish just that .
And speaking of secrets , the recent self - help book , The Secret , is another manifestation of the exact same thing – the desire for easy answers .
The Secret is , in a way , a perfectly marketed example of this phenomenon .
It promises that all of life ’s problems can be fixed just by wishing it so .
Believe and your belief will become manifest , the universe will listen .
It ’s an all purpose easy answer .
It also includes another component – that you have to take some specific action to cause the desired result to come about .
This is slick – wish for an outcome , then do something to create the outcome , and the outcome will manifest .
Of course , you could skip the whole wishing part , but that ’s the marketing genius of the book .
They are selling the wishing , the magic , the illusion of an easy answer .
Self - help and pop psychology books in general fall into the wish - fulfillment and easy answer genre .
By and large such books claim to distill all of human psychological complexity down to one easy system .
The simple system can then be applied to you to create simple steps to achieve whatever your goals happen to be .
With regard to martial arts ( and in other examples ) I think there are two phenomena at work .
Certainly there is the desire for the easier or simpler path to prowess , denying the more unforgiving reality that there is no substitution for sustained hard work .
But many martial artists who believe in the magic of chi also put in the hours of hard physical work .
In these cases I think the draw is more for personal empowerment – the typical male power fantasy .
Belief in chi creates the possibility of going beyond martial arts skills to actual super powers .
There is definitely something very seductive about the possibility of making an opponent collapse just by gesturing at them .
It ’s why Jedi are so cool , and it ’s a major driver of the video - game industry .
What I am discussing are the psychological motivations that drive belief in chi and other magical nonsense .
How people deceive themselves into believing chi is real is a separate question , perhaps for another post ( although I have certainly discussed components of self deception in many previous posts ) .
Watching a chi master , after felling all his own students with the wave of a hand , getting the crap beat out of him by a martial artist free from such delusions , and watching a chi master cut his own arm with a sword , slicing himself down to the bone , should certainly serve as a cautionary experience .
The lessons we should derive from their folly is to be knowledgeable of the mechanisms and power of self deception , be wary of reaching conclusions you really want to be true , be distrustful of easy answers to complex problems , and be aware of your own desires for super powers and therefore any claims that you can actually possess them .
Reality may be harsh but it has the distinct advantage of being real .
This seems to be a 12V DC carbon arc lamp .
Rather nice idea in some ways , but carbon arc lights give off significant UV light .
It probably burns little bits of your retina to look directly at this light .
Also , it may get hot enough to use as a small welder .
Here is a link to a short page on carbon arcs .
I agree with the consensus that a flashlight or LED light is a good thing to carry with you or have stored in your car .
Since I typically carry a PDA and a cell phone , I have semi-reasonable lighting available to me all the time .
I think it is better to be reasonably prepared for foreseeable emergencies ( is it really spelled like that ? ) .
A solution like this one is rather like " how to make an emergency jack out of a pair of shoes and the springs from your back seat " .
Better still to keep a jack in the trunk .
That being said , I recall the scene in " The African Queen " in which Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn use a charcoal forge to repair the propeller for their boat .
A carbon arc welder might have been handy right then .

But it has only been in this campaign cycle that we have seen the liberal echo chamber — from websites like The Huffington Post and cable commentators like Keith Olbermann — be able consistently to drive a campaign story line .
In the past , it was only the conservative echo chamber — Matt Drudge , Rush Limbaugh — who regularly drove stories in new media and old media alike .
This is a huge shift .
3 . The blurring of lines between journalist and advocate .
The Huffington Post is an admirable enterprise , staking a flag in a new media landscape .
Its success this year was made possible by the openness of the Web and the decline in what was once the near - monopoly power of old media institutions like The New York Times to set the agenda on national politics .
( Politico is itself an experiment in that new media landscape — one reason we admire Huffington . )
But it covers politics with a mix of traditional reporters and analysts , like Tom Edsall , and with people who define themselves principally as advocates .
Many of these advocates , like The Huffington Post as a whole , are proudly cheering for Obama .
( This is true even though the site , almost apologetically , broke the story about Obama ’s recent remarks saying small - town Pennsylvanians turn to guns and God because they are bitter . )
Obama benefits also from probably the strongest bias of traditional , old media reporters : Against partisan combat and for a brand of politics that would transcend differences in favor of cooperation and centrism on elite issues like entitlement reform .
Many of these reporters see Clinton representing bad , angry , contrived old politics and Obama bravely leading the way for good , civil , authentic new politics .
4. Covering politics as it is versus as it should be .
Many of the people complaining about ABC ’s coverage , even some Clinton supporters , disliked the questions and the tone because they felt they were serving as a warm - up act for Republican attacks in the fall .
It is not an easy balance .
It is not reporters ’ job to promote the opposition ’s story lines — especially dubious ones like the suggestion that because Obama does not favor flag pins on his lapel it reflects adversely on his patriotism .
But nor can serious reporters avert their gaze from the fact that questions about how well candidates connect personally and culturally with voters matter a lot — they were decisive factors in both the 2000 and 2004 elections .
Gibson and Stephanopoulos handled this balancing act responsibly .
They asked tough questions of both candidates .
In the wake of the debate , it is time for Obama ’s cheerleaders in the media to ask some questions of themselves .
[ reddit - me ]
Alexander Smoltczyk of Der Spiegel , an influential European newsmagazine , writes of Silvio Berlusconi ’s challenger , Walter Veltroni , a dour and uninspiring liberal who lost in yesterday ’s Italian elections :
“ It is difficult to give them hope .
But we can do it , ” says Veltroni .
“ Obama has also done it . ”
Veltroni ’s campaign slogan is : “ Si può fare , ” or “ Yes , we can ” in Italian .
“ I met Obama in Washington , ” says Veltroni .
“ He was different .
Modern and inspiring .
I wrote the foreword to the Italian edition of his book . ”
Perhaps it was intended as an attempt to influence Veltroni ’s own destiny .
“ Si può fare ” are the words printed on the cardboard signs that Veltroni ’s audiences wave when he speaks on their piazzas .
But there is something unreal about the slogan , especially in light of the stonewalling and bureaucracy and ineptness Veltroni himself has complained about , and in light of the Italian sickness .
There is no Obama in Italy .
The article makes very clear that Mr. Veltroni was not as skilled of a politician Obama .
But read the last sentence of that piece again :
“ There is no Obama in Italy . ”
It seems to say more , to hint at something that “ Obama ” means – something that we in America easily lose sight of as the bickering and knee - capping among the candidates obscures it .
“ Obama ” represents – to much of the world – a restoration of America , a correction to George W. Bush ’s strategy , a hope that things can change , a sense that the world is righting itself .
The opportunity we have in this coming election is unique .
Which is something we can too easily forget .

In Pennsylvania as elsewhere , Hilary Clinton does much better than Barack Obama among older voters .
Obama 's tentative explanation is that " they 've got a track record of voting for not just Sen. Clinton but also her husband . "
I have a different theory , one that also helps explain the mirror image problem — the reason so many people dislike Hilary .
To me , at least , she comes across as bossy , cautious , conservative , someone who knows what is good for other people and will firmly make them do it , whether or not they want to .
The feel , the gestalt , fits my description above of the old .
So it is n't surprising if she appeals to many older people .
Obama appeals to young people .
Part of the reason may be the impression that he is willing to take risks , to bet on luck and human goodness — the sort of political risks that might heal some of the rifts in modern American society and , in the process , establish a long term Democratic majority .
The sort of risks that , if something goes seriously wrong , might snatch electoral defeat from the jaws of victory in what should be a Democratic year .
I am , by the relevant measure , old , but also an optimist .
Which may be part of why I find Obama appealing , despite the small detail that he is a liberal Democrat and I an extreme libertarian , and Hilary anything but appealing .
Via USA Today :
At least 20,000 U.S. troops who were not classified as wounded during combat in Iraq and Afghanistan have been found with signs of brain injuries , according to military and veterans records compiled by USA TODAY .
The data , provided by the Army , Navy and Department of Veterans Affairs , show that about five times as many troops sustained brain trauma as the 4,471 officially listed by the Pentagon through Sept. 30 .
These cases also are not reflected in the Pentagon 's official tally of wounded , which stands at 30,327 .
Soldiers and Marines whose wounds were discovered after they left Iraq are not added to the official casualty list , says Army Col.

I love that phrase " re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic " .
It accurately portrays the American political process as we have known it .
Conservatives argue about the rights of a fetus and gay marriage , and liberals argue about social programs and health care .
These are all deck chairs , folks .
A long time ago , 1693 to be exact , some really smart and ruthless people figured out that you could take over an entire country without firing a shot .
That was accomplished that year when the Bank of England effectively went into partnership with the government .
That was accomplished here in the USA in 1913 when the federal reserve act was passed .
For those who do not know , the federal reserve is a cartel of privately owned banks that are in control of EVERYTHING in our country , because they control the issuance of our currency .
In effect , through wars and the social programs needed to deal with the consequences of wars , our government was completely enlaved almost 100 years ago .
How ?
Through the debts wars and social programs create .
Of course , if you 're going to turn a nation 's government into a junkie , it would be a great idea to make sure the junkie can pay his bills .
Enter the progressive income tax , allegedly passed into law in 1916 .
In feudal Europe , the serfs who worked the land were " allowed " to keep half of everything they could take from the land .
In modern America , the worker is " allowed " to take home about half of what he makes .
So what 's the difference between an American worker and a feudal serf ?
Only this .
The feudal serf knew he was a slave .
The barons and earls of modern times are the corporations and the banks , and they have been in partnership with our government for almost 100 years , and everyone alive today lives under a form of economic slavery because of this .
Everyone here loves our country and wants the best for it , but can we please stop fretting over the positioning of the deck chairs ?
We 're sinking !
We 're moaning about losing progressive candidates and trying to decide which establishment candidate we 're going to choose when for the first time in any of our lives we have a candidate who is speaking to the core issue of our economic enslavement ; control of our money .
This is our chance !
There are only a few thousand elites who run this country , and control it 's vast wealth , and there are 300 million of us who do not .
They can not stand against us if we stand together .
So I write today to my fellow Americans , patriots and slaves every one , to unite behind the one guy who has shown the courage to really speak truth to power by advocating the repeal of the federal reserve act , taking control of our currency , and abolishing the IRS .
Unplugged McCain sings ' bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran ' David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday April 19 , 2007 Print This Email
This ( Updates at bottom : McCain says ' lighten up , ' MoveOn launches ad campaign )
At a stop on Senator John McCain 's " Straight Talk " tour , the 2008 presidential candidate decided to respond to a question with some bars of a song , but it is unlikely that Arizona 's Republican senator will be reaching the final rounds of Fox 's " American Idol . "
Speaking at Murrells Inlet VFW
Hall in South Carolina , McCain was asked when he thought the US Military might " send an air mail message to Tehran . "
" McCain began his answer by changing the words to a popular Beach Boys song , " the Georgetown Times reports .
" ' Bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran , ' he sang to the tune of Barbara Ann , " the paper notes .
McCain then added , " Iran is dedicated to the destruction of Israel .
That alone should concern us but now they are trying for nuclear capabilities .
I totally support the President when he says we will not allow Iran to destroy Israel . "
The paper notes that McCain stopped short of answering the actual question and did not say if he supports an invasion of Iran . "
Later , McCain campaign spokesman Kevin McLaughlin told ABC
News that the senator " was just trying to add a little humor to the event . "
ABC 's report adds , " On a more serious note , however , McCain has long been an advocate of dealing with rogue states aggressively .
Back in 2000 when then - Gov. George W. Bush was wary of nation building and talking about a foreign policy based on humility and restraint , McCain was advocating a policy of ' rogue - state rollback , ' which he described in a 1999 speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies as a ' 21st century interpretation of the Reagan doctrine . ' "
Video clip of McCain singing : McCain says ' lighten up '
McCain defended his singing on Thursday , telling his critics to " lighten up , " just as a liberal group announced that it would be launching an ad campaign about the incident .
" The liberal group MoveOn.org is launching an ad against Republican John McCain and his joke about bombing Iran , arguing that the nation ' ca n't afford another reckless president , ' " the Associated Press reports .
" The group plans to spend about $ 200,000 to air a commercial on network and some cable television stations in Iowa and New Hampshire , states that hold early contests in the presidential nomination process , spokesman Alex Howe said Friday . "
On Fox News Channel Friday morning , one political commentator wondered if the MoveOn commercial might actually move some of the " far right " back into McCain 's corner .
During a " Straight Talk Express " stop in Nevada , McCain claimed that his joke was meant to amuse his " old veterans friends . "
" Please , I was talking to some of my old veterans friends , " McCain said .
" My response is , Lighten up and get a life . "
The AP article continues , " Asked if his joke was insensitive , McCain said : ' Insensitive to what ?
The Iranians ? ' "
MoveOn 's ad , as posted at YouTube follows .
A note accompanying the ad states " MoveOn made an emergency TV ad to expose McCain 's reckless remarks .
Help get this ad on the air . "
Transcript of ad : # America has lived through six years of a reckless foreign policy .
We 're stuck in Iraq .
More than 3,000 Americans are dead .
And thousands more wounded .
Now comes John McCain with his answer to what we should do about Iran .
John McCain ?
We can't afford another reckless president .
#
The following is a transcript of a fund - raising letter sent to MoveOn members : # Dear MoveOn member , Have you seen the video ?
At a campaign stop on Wednesday , Sen. John McCain was asked what to do about Iran .
His response ?
He sang " bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of the Beach Boys ' " Barbara Ann . "
Seriously .
He says it was a joke , but the bottom line is that it is reckless saber - rattling against Iran at a time when tensions are high .
Will you help us counter his message on TV ?
War with Iran would be a disaster .
The best way to stop this idea in its tracks is to make sure politicians who talk loosely about war pay a political price .
We 've made an emergency TV ad to call out McCain on his reckless remarks .
Click here to watch the ad , and then please donate $ 25 to get it up on the air : http://pol.moveon.org/donate/dontbombiran.html?id=10226-3440906-RwUXvO&t=3
If we can raise $ 200,000 today , we 'll be able to run the ad starting next week .
We want to put it on the air in early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa .
It 'll send the message that Americans want a president who gets us out of the war we are in , not one who recklessly opens another front .
Even under normal circumstances , it 's unusual for a presidential candidate to casually call for bombing another country .
But this behavior is really out of line now when tensions with Iran are so high .
McCain 's song gave us a glimpse of what we can look forward to if we do n't draw the line now .
That 's why , overnight , we 've put together a powerful ad that calls out Sen.
McCain for his statement and reminds people that this kind of recklessness is what got us into the war with Iraq .
Can you help ?
Take a look at the ad ( which includes the footage of McCain ) , and chip in $ 25 to put it on the air at : http://pol.moveon.org/donate/dontbombiran.html?id=10226-3440906-RwUXvO&t=4
Now the time to stop this war before it starts .
Thanks for all you do .

For years consumers struggled to fit the large round fruit in their refrigerators .
And then there was the problem of trying to cut the fruit when it kept rolling around .
But 20 years ago a forward - thinking farmer on Japan ’s south - western island of Shikoku solved the problem .
The farmer , from Zentsuji in Kagawa prefecture , came up with the idea of making a cube - shaped watermelon which could easily be packed and stored .
To make it happen , farmers grew the melons in glass boxes and the fruit then naturally assumed the same shape .
The square boxes are the exact dimensions of Japanese refrigerators , allowing full - grown watermelons to fit conveniently and precisely onto refrigerator shelves .
Want to tell your strange story ?
Tell us about it and it could be featured on Oddee .
You can remain fully anonymous .
Submit Story
Today the cuboid watermelons are hand - picked and shipped all over Japan .
But the fruit , on sale in a selection of department stores and upmarket supermarkets , appeals mainly to the wealthy and fashion - conscious of Tokyo and Osaka , Japan ’s two major cities , since the fruit comes with a caveat : Each square watermelon costs 10,000 yen , the equivalent of about $ 82 .
Regular watermelons in Japan cost from $ 15 to $ 25 each .
Could dj vu be explained by grid cells ?
— Robyn Ganeles , San Francisco
Neuroscientist Edvard I. Moser of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology responds :
THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION , because grid cells , which are involved in processing spatial information about our surroundings , are located in a brain region that is part of a larger memory system thought to be responsible for the feeling of familiarity .
After considering their function in detail , however , I think it seems more likely that a different system of neurons , place cells , plays a stronger role in providing us with the sense that a new locale is familiar — a feeling called “ dj visit . ”
In any environment , the brain must keep track of the distinct locations within the surrounding area ( say , at the kitchen table versus in front of the refrigerator ) .
It also must note how these different locales relate to one another ( the table is three feet to the right of the fridge , for instance ) .
Place cells are involved in the former type of processing ; each place cell corresponds to a specific location in an environment and fires when you pass through that spot .
In contrast , grid cells work in a network to produce a kind of internal coordinate system , noting information about distance and direction .
These neurons do not correspond to a specific location but become active across several regularly spaced points in any setting .
The geometric arrangement of these cells , relative to one another and to the external setting , ultimately helps us form a mental map of a certain environment .
Grid cells are located in the entorhinal cortex , a brain region that processes information before sending it to the hippocampus , the area where place cells are located .
Because we know that place cells have a unique firing pattern for nearly every experience , it is likely that the hippocampus , and not primarily the entorhinal cortex , decides whether a location is novel or being revisited .
When a strange place is experienced as familiar , it may be because the activated ensemble of place cells at that location happens to be similar to a pattern of activity that was elicited by a previous locale .
Do the typical sleep schedules of elderly people have a physiological benefit , or do they simply reflect generational trends ?
— Shannon Atkinson , Raleigh , N.C .
Michael V. Vitiello , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington , replies :
IT IS UNLIKELY that the “ typical sleep schedules of elderly people ” either reflect generational trends or convey any physiological benefit .
There is no evidence to support the idea that the typical sleep schedules of older adults in developed countries — marked by earlier sleep and rise times , less total sleep and more nighttime wakefulness — are cohort effects ( that is , result from having grown up or lived during a specific time period ) .
The few studies that have looked at how sleep patterns change as people age show slow and progressive changes in sleep patterns across the human life span .
If there were specific cohort or generational differences , this pattern of regular , progressive change would be much less predictable .
Given that the sleep patterns of older adults appear long after these individuals are capable of reproduction , they probably do not confer any physiological benefit .
It is much more likely that they reflect biological and social changes that occur as people age .
Biological changes include alterations in the body ’s underlying circadian rhythm , which helps to regulate the timing and depth of sleep , and age - related reductions in the homeostatic sleep drive , the metabolic process that causes the inclination to sleep after a period of wakefulness .
Other factors likely to influence the quality and timing of sleep in older adults include the increased prevalence of illnesses , such as osteoarthritis , that can directly disrupt sleep , and the presence of primary sleep disorders , such as obstructive sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome .
Various behaviors and environmental factors can also disrupt sleep .
Many of these variables , such as irregular sleep schedules , staying in bed too long , and bedding or a bedroom that is not conducive to sleep , can be adjusted for improved slumber .
A comprehensive review of the impact of aging on sleep , including suggestions for maximizing sleep quality , can be found at the National Sleep Foundation : www.sleepfoundation.org.
Our Ass - Backwards Banking System
As the credit crunch metastasizes its way through the financial system , its worth recalling its simple origins :
The lending of money to people who could not afford to pay it back .
That error was then compounded , by failing to maintain security for loans by traditional metrics , i.e. , insufficient loan - to - value ( LTV ) measures .
The banking sector 's solution to this problem ?
Cancel loans to the most credit worthy borrowers , including those whose loan - to - value exceeds traditional historical requirements .
Such was today 's shocker , as examined in Gretchen Morgenson 's column in the Sunday Times :
" The latest example of this is in the mass freezing of home equity lines of credit going on across the country .
Reeling from losses on their wretched loan decisions of recent years , lenders are preventing borrowers with pristine credit and significant equity in their homes from tapping into credit lines that they paid dearly to secure .
In the last 30 days , lenders have sent several hundred thousand letters advising borrowers that their home equity lines of credit are frozen , estimated Michael A. Kratzer , president of FeeDisclosure.com , a Web site intended to help consumers reduce fees on home loans .
Major lenders — including Washington Mutual , IndyMac Bank and the Greenpoint Mortgage Unit of Capital One — say that declining property values are prompting the decisions to cut off credit . "
While it certainly is in the interest of lending institutions to be cautious with loans where home prices are falling and the LTV no longer protects them against additional loss exposure .
What of regions of the country where property values are rising ?
" But these actions are being taken even in areas where property prices are rising , Mr. Kratzer said .
What ’s worse , the letters provide no explanation for how the lenders determined that the property values underlying the equity lines had fallen .
Frozen home equity lines will surely intensify the consumer spending downturn and put added pressure on an already weak economy .
Indeed , on Friday , consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan plummeted to its lowest level since 1982 .
The drop was attributed mostly to higher fuel and food costs , but consumers ’ views on their current and expected personal financial situations dropped to their lowest readings since November 1982 and April 1980 , respectively . "
The timing is perfect : cutting back lending to people who can repay loans just as the economy slips below the waterline .
I should pitch that business idea as a start up to my VC friends : Getting fees from clients for providing no products or services .
" And , as you can see in slide 12 , this model has an excellent profit margin ... "
Here 's the sickest part of the entire affair : Borrowers with an excellent credit rating will see their FICO score dinged when their home equity line is frozen .
Why ?
When a lender suddenly caps a $ 50,000 line at $ 25,000 , it appears that the borrower tapped out the entire amount of the loan .
This reduces their score .
The lawyers are -- rightfully -- gonna have a field day with this one !

Barry :
Far be it from me to defend the banks ; they can reliably be counted on to lend to excess into every hot market , and then assiduously nail shut the barn door after all the horses have left .
But I 'm not sure GM 's article is quite the indictment she intends , or you interpret it , to be .
First , the citing of Yakima , Appleton , and Raleigh - Cary 's rising Q4 property values aside , I think it 's fair to say , as fair as a blanket statement can be , that property values are rising virtually nowhere in the United States at the moment .
And secondly , GM cites the many small business owners who use their HELOCs to fund their business ventures .
Is n't that what business lines of credit are for ?
And if these businesses do n't show the cash flow or profitability to justify lending to them directly , then are n't banks correct to take a cautious stance with regard to loans to those businesses ?
This is , after all , how a credit crunch builds : individual businesses making decisions which are , at ground level , rational and correct in the assessment of self - interest involved ( Why lend to a small business into the teeth of an economic slowdown , if that business ' prospects are expected to turn down as well ? ) , but which are collectively deleterious to the national economy -- animal spirits in retreat .

To be honest , I wish that I never learned of the Josef Fritzl story in the first place — but it was hard to avoid given the severity of the crimes committed .
However , the fact that a man could imprison his daughter in a basement for 24 years and father her seven children is too horrifying and baffling to ignore .
Over the last few days we have learned the full magnitude of the events that transpired — three of his incestuous offspring ( aged 19,18 and 5 ) had never seen the sunlight until their release and one of the seven children died due to inadequate care .
We also learned that he managed to keep the whole thing a secret — even from his wife .
The question is ... how ?

According to police reports , Fritzl was a retired electrical engineer who used his skills to construct a basement dungeon that measured less than six feet high in some areas with a total living space composed of three " cells " measuring around 650 square feet in total .
In order to prevent his family living on the outside from gaining access to the room , Fritzl constructed a gigantic 660 lb. concrete door fitted with an electronic lock behind a shelf in his workshop .
The lock could only be opened by a remote control that he carried with him at all times .
It was n't until the 19 - year - old fell gravely ill that Fritzl sought medical attention and was subsequently exposed .
Currently , the authorities are still investigating the details of the case — including whether or not Fritzl had help in constructing the hidden rooms .
At the very least , it seems likely given the fact that it would be exceedingly difficult , if not impossible for one man to handle a 660 lb. door .
All that aside , perhaps the most shocking aspect of the case is that Frtizl is looking at a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted of rape .
At 73 , he would probably not live out the term — but the punishment does n't come anywhere near fitting the crime if you ask me .
Even a quick death would n't fit the bill .

April 25 , 2008  --
All 462 children taken from a polygamous ranch in West Texas have been placed into temporary foster homes , state officials said , after a dramatic plea from some of their mothers to be kept together .
" SOS Mothers separated Help , " read a sign hung from a bus that took some of the mothers from the San Angelo Coliseum , where they have been staying with the children , back to the sect 's ranch .
State Child Protective Services officials said Thursday that they believe another 25 mothers from the group are under 18 , bringing the total number of underage mothers from the sect to approximately 30 .
Those mothers had been staying with their children at the Coliseum voluntarily , but are now in state custody , bringing the total number of children in custody to 462 , said department spokesman Chris Van Dusen .
The women who were removed Thursday were mothers to some of the youngest children in state custody .
The court previously had removed all the mothers except those who had children under the age of 5 .
After Thursday , the only mothers allowed to remain with their kids were those whose children were under one year old and nursing , or mothers who were minors themselves .
A state appeals court has agreed to hear arguments next week about whether the state can place the children into temporary foster care without giving each family an individual hearing .
" These families have the right to have their voices heard in the legal process , " said Robert Doggett , an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid , which filed the appeal .
" The idea that these children can be taken away without giving their families the opportunity to address allegations and fight to stay together is absurd . "
But , despite the court 's decision to hold a hearing , the state appeared to be proceeding with its plan to place the children in temporary homes by the end of the week .
As the children settle into their new foster homes , their temporary caregivers are careful how they introduce them to a whole new world .
First rule : no TV yet .
Foster homes and shelters across the state are scrambling to accommodate 437 children who have until now lived a largely isolated life on the Yearning for Zion Ranch , a sprawling 1,700 - acre compound in West Texas .
" These kids do n't know who the president is .
Do n't know that we 're at war .
Do n't know who Elvis was , do n't know who the Beatles were , " said Bobby Gilliam , director of the Methodist Children 's home in Waco , Texas , where some of the children will be staying .
Many of the children have lived a radically different life from the other kids in the state 's foster homes .
The state Child Protective Services program has said it chose foster homes where the youngsters can be kept apart from other children for now .
The 50 girls who will be coming to the Methodist home in Waco will be woken up at the crack of dawn and given chores similar to what they did on the ranch .
It will take time before they are ready to mix with other children and watch TV , Gilliam said .
Social workers are also being given a list of dos and don'ts for how to deal with children who may never have seen television and who were raised in a culture that the state says encourages underage girls to marry older men .
Sect members deny the allegation .
Among the rules :
Do n't ask about their religion , do n't press if the children avoid eye contact , and do n't allow them to use cell phones .
Judge Barbara
Walther , who ordered the children kept in temporary state custody , said that siblings should be kept together , that babies younger than one year old should stay with their mothers and that breast - feeding mothers with children between the ages of one and two should be allowed to live near their toddlers .
But the logistics of placing more than 400 children into foster homes are proving to be a nightmare .
Mary Golder , an attorney for five sisters from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , said one was left behind .
" It would be devastating for this 4 - year - old to be separated from her sisters and sent to live in Houston with strangers , " she said .
State officials admit this will be difficult but insist it is necessary .
" No matter how badly a child is abused they always want to be with their parent .
Unfortunately that is not always in their best interest , " said Darrell Azar , a Child Protective Services spokesman .
The children were taken into state custody by Texas authorities , who raided the FLDS ranch after they said a person claiming to be a 16 - year - old girl called a hotline to report that she was being abused by her 49 - year - old husband .
The children are being housed until they have individual status hearings .
Some children could be placed in permanent foster care .
Some parents who have left the sect may win custody , while some kids may be allowed to return to the ranch in Eldorado .
In a related development , court documents unsealed Wednesday revealed that a phone number used to allege abuse at the ranch is associated with a woman in Colorado who has been accused of making several unrelated false abuse claims in calls to authorities .
An arrest warrant affidavit said 33 - year - old Rozita Swinton had previously used a phone number to call the crisis hotline in Texas that received the calls prompting the raid .
The calls came before authorities raided the Yearning for Zion Ranch on April 3 , but it was not clear whether authorities believe Swinton made the calls that triggered the raid .
Swinton has not been arrested for allegedly making calls to the Texas shelter .
She was arrested last week on charges of making a false report in an unrelated case .
The affidavit details dozens of calls from late 2006 through April 2008 to abuse centers and police departments in Washington , Colorado and Texas .
The callers always identified themselves as a young girl , at various times calling herself Dana , April , V , Jennifer and Sarah Barlow .
Sarah Barlow is the name of the 16 - year - old who called the Texas crisis center .
The Colorado court documents say that a phone number associated with Swinton , who has been named by Texas Rangers as a " person of interest " in their investigation , was " possibly related to the reporting party for the YFZ ranch incident . "
The affidavit says that in one call to a safe house in Colorado a person calling herself Dana said she had been sexually abused .
Dana told the safe house counselor in February 2008 that she and Rozita were different personalities who lived in the same body , according to the affidavit .
Dana then told the counselor to call back on Rozita 's number and gave Swinton 's home phone number , the affidavit says .
Another number that was used to call the Texas abuse hot line has been linked to a man named Courtney Swinton , who lives in the same apartment building with Rozita Swinton , according to the affidavit .
During some of the 28 calls made to a Washington shelter using the Courtney Swinton phone number , the caller claimed to be 16 - year - old Sarah Barlow and said she was being held at the YFZ ranch .
The caller said she had gotten married at age 14 to Dale Barlow , the same man identified by the Sarah Barlow who called the Texas shelter , as her husband .
She also said she feared her " sister wives " at the ranch would take her baby away if she revealed her real identity , the affidavit says .
Ithought Francis Ford Coppola was being cranky last fall when he badmouthed Al Pacino and Robert De Niro -- the stars of Coppola ’s immortal “ Godfather ” films -- for taking parts for the money and losing their passion for doing great work .
“ I met both Pacino and De Niro when they were really on the come , ” Coppola told GQ magazine .
“ Now Pacino is very rich , maybe because he never spends any money ; he just puts it in his mattress .
. . .
They all live off the fat of the land . ”
Coppola was right on the money .
The two icons of ‘ 70s New Hollywood , heroes to a generation of young actors and filmmakers , have become parodies of themselves , making payday movies and turning in performances that are hollow echoes of the electrically charged work they did in such films as “ Serpico , ” “ Dog Day Afternoon , ” “ Mean Streets ” and “ Taxi Driver . ”
Of the dozen or so movies that opened in Los Angeles on Friday , only one had a lead actor Oscar winner in the starring role -- and it was the worst in the bunch , which is really saying something , considering the competition included a scarefest called “ Zombie Strippers ” ( with adult film star Jenna Jameson ! ) and a gruesome murder - mystery about a gang of psycho medical students called “ Pathology . ”
“ 88 Minutes , ” a hapless thriller , stars Pacino as a hotshot forensic psychiatrist stalked by a mysterious killer .
The critics have had a field day -- when I last looked , it was the lowest - rated movie of the year on Metacritic.com .
While the critics pounced on Jon Avnet for his inept pacing -- despite its title , the film actually runs for a seemingly endless 107 minutes -- it ’s Pacino who got a real drubbing .
Advertisement
The New York Times ’ Manohla Dargis zeroed in on what might be Pacino ’s most glaring failing , his vanity , describing the actor as having “ a dusky orange tan that suggests a charbroiled George Hamilton and an elevated poof of hair that appears to have been engineered to put Mr. Pacino within vertical range of his female costars . ”
Throughout the film , Pacino , who turns 68 on Friday , is surrounded by nubile young actresses who play students lusting after or enamored by him .
One of the film ’s bizarre moments occurs when Pacino and a comely student rush back to his apartment , where , in the midst of their desperate efforts to locate the killer , she takes off her blouse and tosses it on his stairs .
It ’s not as if this film were a rare misstep in an otherwise unblemished career .
Pacino has made a string of bad films lately , including the famously awful “ Gigli , ” “ The Recruit ” and “ Two for the Money , ” where he hams it up as an unscrupulous football oddsmaker .
If anyone has made more movies for the money than Pacino , it would be De Niro , who has largely abandoned serious dramatic work for a spate of forgettable horror and crime thrillers ( try sitting through “ Hide and Seek ” or “ Godsend ” ) and lowbrow comedy high jinks like “ Meet the Fockers ” and “ Analyze That . ”
De Niro ’s most recent film , “ What Just Happened ? , ” an inside - the - movie - biz comedy , got such an abysmal reception at Sundance that it limped out of the festival without a sale ( it ’s expected to close the Cannes Film Festival this year ) .
De Niro cut his longtime ties with CAA last week , defecting to Endeavor , inspiring a venomous response purportedly from one CAA agent that was e-mailed all over town .
Claiming that De Niro asks for a $ 1 - million production fee on his pictures to help fund his Tribeca empire in New York , it minces few words , saying , “ Bobby held us responsible for his own greed , his own avarice and his own megalomania .
And it ’s just like the studios now ask us :
Why should we pay this guy -- who does n’t open a movie -- the payoff to his production company , just so he can add his name as a producer ? ”
The e-mail makes a subtler point about De Niro ’s career choices , pointing out that he could ’ve “ gone the [ Jack ]
Nicholson route -- very selective , very particular , protect the brand -- or go out sending himself up in tripe like ‘ Analyze This , ’ which made money but turned him into that ‘ old psycho guy . ’ ”

Not every aging actor in Hollywood has to embarrass himself .
While Pacino and De Niro grab the dough , working for hacks and nonentities , Nicholson , with rare exception , has picked his spots , doing movies with Martin Scorsese , Alexander Payne and Sean Penn .
Clint Eastwood , who ’s even older than Nicholson , has remained an iconic figure by working with the best director of all -- himself .
( It ’s been almost 20 years since he acted in a movie he did n’t direct . )
Other older actors , like Gene Hackman and Warren Beatty , have preferred to drop out of sight rather than embarrass themselves .
After the debacle of “ Town and Country , ” Beatty has devoted himself to raising his kids and giving interviews about “ Bonnie and Clyde . ” Michael Caine , who once chased paychecks himself , has turned himself into a respected character actor , doing such classy fare as “ The Prestige , ” “ Children of Men ” and “ The Quiet American . ”
It ’s not easy being an older actor in Hollywood , where the juiciest roles are written for a narrow age range that pretty much begins with Will Smith and ends with George Clooney .
But if Pacino and De Niro are bedeviled by vanity , they are equally guilty of ego - stoked delusion .
They still want to be treated like big - league stars , when they are , sadly , past their prime .
Seeing Pacino in “ 88 Minutes ” evoked memories of Willie Mays playing for the Mets at career ’s end , stumbling in the outfield he once glided across with effortless abandon .
Sadly , Pacino knew exactly what he was getting into making “ 88 Minutes . ”
Despite the presence of 19 producers on the credit scroll , the real auteur of the film is Avi Lerner , the colorful Israeli producer who has made hundreds of B movies over the last 20 years , having recently stepped up in budget class -- thanks to an influx of money from German film investment funds -- from direct - to - video thrillers with Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal and horror fare like “ Shark Attack ” to star vehicles with Sly Stallone ( “ Rambo ” ) and Bruce Willis ( “ 16 Blocks ” ) .
Advertisement
Insiders familiar with the project say Lerner paid Pacino $ 9 million to do the picture , knowing Pacino ’s presence in a commercial thriller would allow Lerner to offset the cost of the film by selling it overseas .
Lerner pocketed $ 6 million more by selling domestic distribution rights to Sony Pictures .
Pacino declined to talk to me about the film .
But Lerner got on the phone Friday to defend the picture .
“ I like it -- it ’s exactly the movie I wanted it to be , ” he says .
“ The critics can say what they want .
That ’s the great thing about America .
Everyone gets to have their opinion .
It hurts when people call and say the reviews were terrible .
But I do n’t read reviews .
I hardly read anything . ”
( Lerner is famous for not reading scripts either , though he insists he read “ 88 Minutes . ” )
Lerner insists Pacino deserves every cent he paid him .
“ He ’s a great guy -- on time , professional , hard - working , always willing to do another take . ”
Lerner has another big bet down on Pacino , who returns this fall in “ Righteous Kill , ” a serial killer thriller that teams Pacino with De Niro as New York City cops on the trail of an unsolved murder .
With Avnet at the helm again , expectations for quality are low -- it has the get - out - your - checkbooks feel of the latest Eagles tour .

Lerner sees it differently .
When I asked if the scathing reviews for “ 88 Minutes ” could damage the film ’s commercial chances , he joked : “ Hey , it ’s two different movies , two different sets of 17 producers . ”
Turning serious , he said : “ They are still two icons .
If you get out of Beverly Hills , to Ventura Boulevard , every person you ask will say -- we want to see them together .
Just like people did for Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in ‘ The Bucket List . ’
And they ’re even older ! ”
I do n’t envy Pacino or De Niro .
They ’re in a bind , having come of age at a time when actors could still get provocative dramas made without everyone having to work for peanuts .
Today they ’re grumpy old men , relegated to raking in loot from cartoonish comedy and generic thrillers .
It ’s no wonder De Niro ’s now in the hotel business .
He and Pacino should take a tip from Woody Allen , who once joked that he made more money from selling his Manhattan apartment than from all his movies combined .
Apartments come and go , but “ Annie Hall ” comes along only once in a lifetime .

This animation from BBC Timewatch reveals the 4,500 years of history behind Stonehenge .
As of the end of 2005 there were something like 2 billion cell phones in service worldwide .
Certainly there are more than that now .
Without lithium batteries cell phones would be a completely different animal .
Bigger and heavier , you wouldnâ€™t be stuffing one into a pantâ€™s pocket .
Now that the standard is set the cell phone industry is reliant on lithium for its existence .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Cell phones are , of course , not the only high technology reliant on lithium .
Laptop computers ( with much , much larger lithium batteries than cell phones ) , a wide array of personal electronic devices like iPods , and increasingly power tools are coming equipped with lithium batteries as large as laptop batteries .
And , eventually , in the grand daddy of all lithium usage , electric , hybrid , and plug - in hybrid vehicles , are nearly all being developed with lithium for clean energy storage in mind .
The future of zero and ultralow emission vehicles is reliant upon one of the planetâ€™s scarcer resources .
Lithium is the 33rd most abundant element on the planet .
If it werenâ€™t for lithium Tesla Motorâ€™s all - electric roadster wouldnâ€™t have gone into full scale production this week .
For the most part lithium is extracted from brine lakes ; until recently most of it from lakes in the Andes Mountains .
Chabyer salt lake , in the Tibet Autonomous Region , at an elevation of 14,400 feet ( 4,400 meters ) is not only the largest lithium mine in China but also one of the three largest salt lakes in the world .
Chabyer now makes Tibet the No. 1 area in the world in terms of prospective lithium reserves , according to the China Tibet Information Center .
According to a report from Market Research.com , China has now become the largest producer and consumer of lithium - ion batteries .
The average annual production capacity of mainland China has reached 19 billion pieces , making itself a super manufacturer of the battery chemistry .
And it seems likely that the lithium for those batteries comes from Tibet .
The laptop computer you might be using to read this might have a little bit of Tibet in it .
Is this implying that the police action by the Chinese government currently taking place in Tibet is over lithium for batteries ?
Of course not .
But throughout history - distant past and into current times - nations have shed blood in a quest to secure resources â€ “ all too frequently .
Tibet is rich in more natural resources than just lithium :
--- Chromium iron deposits cover a total area of 965 square miles ( 2,500 square km ) .
---
In 2005 , 100 - 150 million tons of prospective oil and gas reserves were found from Lhunpola Basin in the western part of northern Tibet .
---
Of Tibet 's total area of 471,000 square miles ( 1.22 million square km ) , 1.6 million acres ( 650,000 hectares ) are pastureland and 890,000 acres ( 360,000 hectares ) are cultivated land .
---
Tibet has 23 million heads of livestock , annually producing 9,000 tons of wool , 1,400 tons of cashmere , and 4 million pieces of cowhide and sheepskin .
---
For renewable electric power generation , Tibet is rich is resources too .
Its potential for hydroelectric power is about 200,000 megawatts , 30 percent of Chinaâ€™s total .
There are more than 100 sites with geothermal energy possibilities .
Solar energy is hot also with most parts of the region averaging annual sunshine of between 3,100 - 3,400 hours per year at about nine hours a day .
Annual wind energy reserves are estimated at 93 billion kilowatt hours , ranking the seventh in all China .
In 2005 China completed the Qinghai - Tibet Railway line .
The 1215 mile ( 1,956 km ) railway link begins in Xining , capital of Qinghai Province and goes to Lhasa , capital of the Autonomous Region .
Itâ€™s both the highest and longest railway in the world .
At itâ€™s highest point itâ€™s more than 3 miles ( 5,072 meters ) above sea level .
Think the railway is just to bring tourists to the region ?
Think again .
It has a monthly cargo handling capacity of 150,000 tons .
Thatâ€™s a lot of lithium for batteries

Wheelchair ramp will cost $ 100,000 a foot
The Board of Supervisors is weighing a $ 1 million wheelchair ramp to make the board podium accessible .
The Board of Supervisors is weighing a $ 1 million wheelchair ramp to make the board podium accessible .
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Wheelchair ramp will cost $ 100,000 a foot 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Where else but San Francisco City Hall could a 10 - foot - long wheelchair ramp wind up costing $ 1 million ?
Thanks to a maze of bureaucratic indecision and historic restrictions , taxpayers may shell out $ 100,000 per foot to make the Board of Supervisors president 's perch in the historic chambers accessible to the disabled .
What 's more , the little remodel job that planners first thought would take three months has stretched into more than four years - and will probably mean the supervisors will have to move out of their hallowed hall for five months while the work is done .
" It 's crazy , " admits Susan Mizer , director of the mayor 's Office on Disability .
" But this is just the price of doing business in a historic building . "
Supervisor Jake McGoldrick said Tuesday that the issue went to the heart of liberal guilt that often drives the city 's decision making .
He also choked on the price tag , and asked that the board take some more time to come up with an alternative , like maybe just getting rid of the president 's elevated seat .
The root of the problem dates back to when City Hall got a $ 300 million makeover in the 1990s that made just about every hallway , bathroom and office accessible to the disabled .
The exception was the board president 's podium , which is reachable only for someone who can climb the five steps from the chamber floor .
The understanding was that the room would eventually be made fully accessible .
But no one worried about the podium until 2004 when Supervisor MichelaAlioto - Pier , who uses a wheelchair , joined the board .
City architect Tony Irons and representatives of the state Office of Historic Preservation - which had to be consulted to make sure the city was sensitive to the building 's designation as a state landmark - were called in to take measurements .
Then preservation architects from the San Francisco firm Page and Turnbill worked up no fewer than 18 design options - at a cost of $ 98,000 - with ideas ranging from an electric lift to abandoning the president 's lordly podium altogether .
No one could decide which design to use , so after a year of arguing , the Department of Public Works was ordered to make 3 - D computer models of all the options .
The ramp won , which means lowering the president 's desk , which means eliminating three of the " historic " stairs and tearing out Manchurian oak panels that are no longer available , which in turn will mean finding a historically correct replacement .
And because the ramp was going to encroach on the room 's sound equipment , officials decided they might as well use the opportunity to upgrade the board chamber 's entire audio- visual system , to the tune of $ 300,000 .
Here 's what else is going into the million - dollar ramp :
-- $ 77,000 for the city 's Bureau of Architecture project manager , design and construction fees .
-- $ 455,000 for the actual construction , plus asbestos removal .
-- $ 28,000 for a construction scheduling consultant .
-- $ 3,500 for an electrical consultant .
-- $ 68,000 for the Bureau of Construction Management to oversee the construction and various consultants .
-- $ 12,000 for Department of Technology and Information Services oversight .
-- $ 16,500 for permits and fees .
( Yes , believe it or not , the city charges itself . )
-- And as much as $ 65,000 for bid overruns .
All for a total of : $ 1,123,000 .
And counting .
The supervisors considered signing off on the work Tuesday but put it over for another week .
Even if the board gives its final blessing , however , construction of the ramp wo n't be completed before the end of the year - midway through Alioto - Pier 's second and final term .
" I deserve equal access to every part of the chamber , " Alioto - Pier told her colleagues , adding that ending discrimination is worth the $ 1 million .
Water war :
The surprise discovery that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger provided funding for eight positions in his budget to begin work on the revived Peripheral Canal has state Senate President Pro Tem DonPerata predicting the renewal of an all - out north - south water war .
" This is shocking - it's the Dodgers vs. the Giants , " Perata said Tuesday after hearing rumors that the governor had also signed an executive order to start planning for a canal .
Bill Maile , a spokesman for the governor , said no such order had been issued .
But he acknowledged that Schwarzenegger included $ 1.4 million in his budget for the environmental work in hopes of getting a water bond on the November ballot .
The centerpiece of the bond would be a canal that would divert water from the Sacramento River to Southern California , skirting the delta altogether .
Just last Thursday , the governor sat down with key legislative Democrats and Republicans - as well as Sen.
Dianne Feinstein - to try to hash out a comprehensive water plan that would protect the delta and its quake - endangered levees .
But no agreement was reached .
" It looks like there is a stealth deal going on now , " Perata said .
Hot wheels : State Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata 's hot , hot , candy - red Dodge Charger - complete with its 20 - inch chrome wheel rims - is up for sale on eBay .
Starting bid : $ 19,000 .
Or you can pay $ 22,800 outright and drive it away .
Seems Perata lost his taste for the stud - rimmed look after he was carjacked at gunpoint over the holidays in Oakland in broad daylight .
At the time , it was thought the carjackers were after the rims , though no one knows for sure because no arrests were ever made .
When the 2006 Charger turned up in one piece in Richmond a few days later , Perata had already decided his sporting days were over .
The state Department of General Services recently sold the Charger to an unnamed private buyer at its monthly public auction for $ 17,800 .
And now the buyer is trying to make a couple of bucks with a quick turnaround .
As the sale posting notes , this car has " a great story ( maybe not so great ) to go along with it ! "

As the videos here demonstrate , at least certain members of the corporate media are paying attention to Jesse Ventura ’s appearance earlier this week on the Alex Jones Show .
As should be expected , they are making him out to be a nut , primarily for going public “ with a radio host who believes the U.S. government was behind the attacks . ”
In order to diminish the impact of Ventura ’s assertion the official 9/11 version is little more than a fairy tale , the talking heads here pull out all the stops , even allude that his book , Do n’t Start the Revolution Without Me , is more fiction than fact , in short that Ventura is a liar .
After they characterize him as a fiction writer and eccentric nut case , it is hoped people will consider his opinions about the events of September 11 , 2008 , as the ravings of a mad man .
It wo n’t work , of course .
Millions of people are now awake to the fact the government had something to do with the events , although many are still unable to accept the possibility the government would so such a thing , so deep and severe is the propaganda .
Even so , since 2006 , only a mere 16 % of Americans believe the official version .
An online CNN poll conducted in March , 2006 , revealed “ that over four - fifths , or 82 per cent , agree with actor Charlie Sheen that the U.S. government covered up the real events of the 9/11 attacks , ” write Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones .
“ Every establishment media mouthpiece aside from CNN tried to hang Sheen on his own words but it simply did n’t work because those same questions are firing the synapses in the heads of millions upon millions of other taxpaying American citizens . ”
Ditto with Jesse Ventura .

Why the Testimony of General Petraeus Will Be Delusional
Yes , their defensive zone is the planet and they patrol it regularly .
As ever , their planes and drones have been in the skies these last weeks .
They struck a village in Somalia , tribal areas in Pakistan , rural areas in Afghanistan , and urban neighborhoods in Iraq .
Their troops are training and advising the Iraqi army and police as well as the new Afghan army , while their Special Operations forces are planning to train Pakistan ’s paramilitary Frontier Corps in that country ’s wild , mountainous borderlands .
Their Vice President arrived in Baghdad not long before the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki launched its recent ( failed ) offensive against cleric Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army militia in the southern oil city of Basra .
To “ discuss ” their needs in their President ’s eternal War on Terror , two of their top diplomats , a deputy secretary of state and an assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs , arrived in Pakistan — to the helpless outrage of the local press — on the very day newly elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani was being given the oath of office .
( “ I do n’t think it is a good idea for them to be here on this particular day … right here in Islamabad , meeting with senior politicians in the new government , trying to dictate terms … ” was the way Zaffar Abbas , editor of the newspaper Dawn , put it . )
At home , their politicians have nationally televised debates in which they fervently discuss just how quickly they would launch air assaults against Pakistan ’s tribal areas , without permission from the Pakistani government but based on “ actionable intelligence ” on terrorists .
Their drones cruise the skies of the world looking for terrorist suspects to — in the phrase of the hour — “ take out . ”
Agents from their intelligence services have , these last years , roamed the planet , kidnapping terrorist suspects directly off the streets of major cities and transporting them to their own secret prisons , or those of other countries willing to employ torture methods .
Their spy satellites circle the globe listening in on conversations wherever they please , while their military has divided the whole planet into “ commands , ” the last of which , Africom , was just formed .
As far as they are concerned , nowhere do their interests not come into play ; nowhere , in fact , are they not paramount .
As their President put it recently , “ If [ our ] strategic interests are not in Iraq — the convergence point for the twin threats of al Qaeda and Iran , the nation Osama bin Laden ’s deputy has called ‘ the place for the greatest battle , ’ the country at the heart of the most volatile region on Earth — then where are they ? ”
( And you could easily substitute the names of other countries for Iraq . )
Their President makes a habit of regularly telling other countries what they “ must ” do .
“ At the same time , ” he said recently , “ the regimes in Iran and Syria must stop supporting violence and terror in Iraq . ”
It ’s especially important to him and his officials that other nations not “ interfere ” in situations where , as in Iraq , they are so obviously “ foreigners ” and have no business ; no fingers , that is , are to be caught in other people ’s cookie jars .
Their Vice President made this point strikingly in an exchange with a TV interviewer :
“ Q: So what message are you sending to Iran , and how tough are you prepared to get ?
“ Vice President : I think the message that the president sent clearly is that we do not want them doing what they can to try to destabilize the situation inside Iraq .
We think it ’s very important that they keep their folks at home . ”
A range of other countries , all with a natural bent for “ interference ” or “ meddling , ” must regularly be warned or threatened .
After all , what needs to be prevented , according to a typical formulation of their President , is “ foreign interference in the internal affairs of Iraq . ”
None of this advice do they apply to themselves for reasons far too obvious to explain .
Wherever they go — sometimes in huge numbers , usually well - armed , and , after a while , deeply entrenched in bases the size of small towns that they love to build — they feel comfortable .
They are , after all , defending their liberties by defending those of others elsewhere .
Though there are natives of one brand or another everywhere , they consider themselves the planet ’s only true natives .
Their motto might be :
Wherever we hang our hats ( or helmets ) is home .
Others , who choose to fight them , automatically become aliens , intent as they are on destroying the stability of that planetary “ home . ”
So , for years , their military spokespeople referred to the Sunni insurgents they were battling in Iraq as “ anti- Iraqi forces . ”
It mattered little that almost all of them were , in fact , Iraqis ; for the enemy is , by nature , so beyond the pale as to be a stranger to his or her own country or , just as likely , a cat ’s - paw of foreign forces and powers .
Only when the very same “ anti- Iraqi forces ” suddenly decided to become allies were they suddenly granted the title , “ concerned citizens , ” or even , more gloriously , “ Sons of Iraq . ”
When off duty , their luckier soldiers have the option of taking “ rest and recreation ” in “ the homeland ” at places like the Hale Koa ( “ House of the Warrior ” ) Hotel in Honolulu , Hawaii , or in the extended homeland at , say , the Edelweiss Lodge and Resort in the Bavarian Alps or the Dragon Hill Lodge near thrilling downtown Seoul , South Korea — all part of their global system of Armed Forces Recreation Centers .
This is their world — and welcome to it .
It ’s not exactly a mystery what country I ’m talking about .
You knew from the beginning .
Since the Soviet Union vanished in 1991 , only one nation has made itself at home everywhere on Earth ; only one nation has felt that the planet ’s interests and its own interests were essentially one ; only one nation ’s military garrisons and patrols our world from Greenland to the tropics , from the sea bed to the edge of space ; only one nation ’s military talks about its vast array of bases as its “ footprint ” on the planet ; only one nation judges its essential and exceptional goodness , in motivation if nothing else , as justification for any act it may take .
Putting an Iraqi Face on Iraq
Soon , U.S. surge commander General David Petraeus will return to Washington to report to Congress on our “ progress ” in Iraq — and he ’ll do so with the worst crisis in that country in almost a year still unresolved .
He ’ll do so , in fact , shrouded in yet another strategic disaster for the Bush administration .
With that in mind , let ’s take a moment to look back at just how , militarily at least , the Bush administration first made itself at home in Iraq .
In the U.S. , the administration ’s lack of planning for the occupation of Iraq — starting with the wholesale looting of Baghdad after American troops had taken the capital — has been the subject of much debate and discussion in Congress and the media .
While it ’s usually noted in passing that , amid the chaos , orders had in fact been issued to American troops to guard the Oil Ministry , little is made of that .
In fact , orders for U.S. troops to guard that ministry and the Interior Ministry , and nothing else , were indeed given , which simply indicates that administration planning was extremely focused — on oil and the secret police ( and perhaps Saddam Hussein ’s secret archives ) .
In addition , we know that the administration ignored the 13 - volume “ Future of Iraq ” project put together by the State Department to guide an occupation — largely because its neocon officials were so intent on sidelining the State Department more generally .
On the other hand , the Pentagon did plan for what it thought would matter .
Specifically , from a front - page April 19 , 2003 New York Times article , we know that , by the time the invasion began , the Pentagon already had on the drawing boards plans for building four permanent mega - bases in Iraq .
( They were meant to replace our bases in Saudi Arabia . )
And these were indeed built ( along with others and the largest embassy on the planet ) in more or less the locations originally described .
From the beginning , whatever planning it did n’t do , the Bush administration was certainly planning to make itself at home in Iraq in a big way for a long , long time .
Much has also been made of the disastrous , seat - of - the - pants decision by the administration , in the person of L. Paul Bremer III , head of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) then ruling Baghdad , to disband the Iraqi army .
But few now recall what the administration , the CPA , and the Pentagon had in mind ( and leaked to the press soon after the invasion ) for a future Iraqi military of their dreams .
They had , in fact , reconceived the Iraqi army as a force of perhaps 40,000 lightly armed , largely border - guarding troops .
Keep in mind that Saddam Hussein had a military of 400,000 heavily armed troops and — until the First Gulf War in 1990 — a powerful air force ( as well as copious supplies of chemical weapons ) .
In the Middle East , for a country to have only a 40,000 man military without tanks , artillery , or an air force to call on meant but one thing : that the U.S. military and the U.S. Air Force , from bases in Iraq and in the region , were to be Iraq ’s real fighting force in any crisis .
This was the true planning message of the Bush administration and it indicated just how “ at home ” its officials thought they would be in occupied Iraq .
By the time it became obvious that such thinking was fantastical and George Bush was starting to repeat the mantra , “ As Iraqis stand up , Americans will stand down , ” the idea of a 40,000 - man force had been long forgotten .
By then , the U.S. military was at work creating a large Iraqi army and national police force .
But the effects of such planning remain debilitatingly present , even today .
After all , the “ crack ” Iraqi units sent into Basra by Prime Minister Maliki were still relatively lightly armed .
( Hence , their complaints that the Sadrist militia they came up against were often better armed than they were . )
They still had no significant Iraqi air force to call on , because as yet it hardly exists .
When they got desperate , they had to call on U.S. and British air support as well as U.S. Special Forces units .
And , of course , in the fighting in Basra , as in Baghdad where American units quickly entered the fray , they showed no particular flare for “ standing up . ”
In fact , according to the Associated Press ’s fine reporter Charles J. Hanley , the chief American trainer of Iraqi forces , Lt. Gen. James Dubik , now estimates that Iraq ’s military will not be able to guard the country ’s borders effectively until , at the earliest , 2018 .
There was a period , back in 2004 - 05 , when the Bush administration regularly wielded a telling image .
They talked often about the importance of putting “ an Iraqi face ” on various aspects of the situation in that country .
Here ’s a typical passage from the New York Times from that period : “ By insisting that they not be identified , the three officers based in Baghdad were following a Pentagon policy requiring American commanders in Baghdad to put ‘ an Iraqi face ’ on the war , meaning that Iraqi commanders should be the ones talking to reporters , not Americans . ”
This caught something of the strangeness of that moment , a strangeness that has yet to disappear .
After all , as an image , to put a “ face ” on anything actually means to put a mask over an already present face , which was ( and , even today , in military terms largely remains ) American power in Iraq .
The presentation of the recent Maliki government offensive , launched on the eve of Petraeus ’s return , also represented , in part , an attempt to put an Iraqi face on American at - homeness in that country .
The fictional story put out as the “ Iraqi ” offensive was launched — printed up quite seriously in our media — was that Maliki had only informed the American high command ( and the British in Basra ) of his prospective move in the hours just before it was launched .
This was , on the face of it , ludicrous .
The “ Iraqi ” army has been stood up — trained , that is — by U.S. advisors ; some of its units have U.S. advisors embedded in them ; it is almost totally reliant on the logistical support of the U.S. military .
It could not move far offensively without the significant prior knowledge of U.S. commanders ( and this was later admitted by the President ’s National Security Council Advisor Stephen J. Hadley ) .
While Maliki had his own reasons for launching his forces ( and allied militias ) against Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Basra , the Americans certainly imagined a triumphant moment for Petraeus in his upcoming hearings , thanks to new evidence that the Iraqi government was finally , in George Bush ’s words , “ in the lead ” and its military shaping up well .
As Leila Fadel of the McClatchy Newspapers reported , “ Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said the Iraqi operation was a ‘ byproduct of the success ’ of the year - old U.S. troop surge . ”
This was a fantasy , of course .
And the result was the success of Sadr ’s forces from Basra to Baghdad — and ongoing American attempts to disavow any real involvement in the planning of the offensive .
Grand Delusions
The United States is hardly the first empire whose representatives have felt at home anywhere in its world ( if not , in past times , in the world ) .
When you are at the peak of your imperial powers , you can ignore the problems and contradictions that such a feeling , such an attitude , naturally calls up .
This is no longer the situation for the United States and so the contradictions ripen , the problems only grow , and the plunge into delusional thinking deepens .
Take just the seeming conundrum of the recent battle in Basra .
On one side , you have an Iraqi army , trained for years by the Americans , to the tune of approximately $ 22 billion in U.S. funds .
On the other side , you have an ( at best ) partially trained “ militia ” — an “ army ” in name only .
It may be that the Iranians have put some effort or money into equipping the Mahdi Army — though the evidence for this is slim indeed — but , if so , this would be minor by comparison .
When the two forces clashed , what was the result ?
Some Iraqi soldiers and policemen simply put down their weapons and , in certain cases , surrendered or went over to the other side , or deserted , or fought half - heartedly ; while the Mahdis fought fiercely , cleverly , and , in the end , successfully , until called off in triumph by their leader .
They “ stood up ” ( just as they had against the full might of the American military in the southern holy city of Najaf back in 2004 ) .
Could there , then , be two different races of Iraqis , one set willing to fight with or without training or outside help , the other unwilling , no matter the support ?
The American military faced a similar situation four decades ago in Vietnam , where American advisors training the South Vietnamese military regularly swore that they would turn in their brigades of Vietnamese troops for just a few platoons of Vietcong , who would stand and fight as if their lives depended on it .
Of course , the answer here is anything but mysterious .
On the one hand , you have a foreign - trained , foreign - advised , foreign - supplied force with confused and divided loyalties that is only partially an “ Iraqi ” army ; on the other , you have a local force , fighting in a community , for the safety and wellbeing of its own sons and wives , friends and relatives .
The Mahdi Army members know why they fight and who they fight for .
They have “ faith , ” and not just in the religious sense .
They are , in a word , at home .
The history of the last 200 years has regularly piled up evidence that this matters far more than firepower .
Human beings , that is , regularly “ stand up ” for something other than shiny weapons or the interests of a foreign power , no matter how at home its leaders may think they are in your country .
The inability to see this obvious point — repeatedly and over decades — represents delusional thinking stemming , at least in part , from an inability of Americans to imagine their own foreignness in the world .
In such cases , you misperceive who is on your side , why they are there , and what , exactly , they are capable of .
You misunderstand what the actual natives of a place think of you .
You do n’t grasp that , whatever the brute force and finances at your command , you , as a foreigner , may never understand the situation you believe you should control .
Even the Maliki government itself , after all , is only “ on our side ” thanks to its abysmal weakness .
( Otherwise , it would be far more closely allied with that other foreign power , Iran . )
Sooner or later — usually sooner — you simply delude yourself .
You mistake your trained army for an “ Iraqi ” or a “ Vietnamese ” one and so come to believe that , if only you adjust your counterinsurgency tactics correctly , it will fight like one .
Then you act accordingly , which is , of course , disastrous .
Whatever General Petraeus says before Congress next week , however sane and pragmatic he sounds , however impressive looking his charts and graphs , it ’s worth keeping in mind that his testimony cannot help but be delusional , because it stems from delusional premises and it can lead only to further disaster for Americans and Iraqis .
Yes , of course , American planes and drones will continue to cruise the skies of the globe “ taking out ” enemies ( or missing them and taking out citizens elsewhere whom we could care less about ) ;
American diplomats and high military officials will continue to travel the planet in packs , indicating , however politely , what politicians , military men , and diplomats elsewhere “ must ” do ; and American military men will continue to train the Iraqi army in the hopes that , in 2018 if not sooner , it will stand up .
And yet , as long as we mistake ourselves for “ the natives , ” as long as we are convinced that our interests are paramount everywhere , and feel that we must be part of the solution to every problem , our problems — and the world ’s — will only multiply .

London has to provide housing for a million more people by 2016 , taking into account new arrivals , plus old - timers who need an upgrade .
Since space is limited , UK company Popularchitecture is proposing a 5,000 - foot high tower that would house pretty much everybody all in one shot — and reduce four city neighborhoods to a single cylindrical building .
See the whole thing below .

The tower , which at this point remains simply a novel idea , would take up little actual ground space and run like a proper democracy .
It is literally broken up into municipal areas — the " neighborhood " is a singe floor of 600 ; the village is 20 floors and houses 6,000 .
There are also three super - districts that house 33,000 people each .

Elected reps serve in a local government and have regular meetings to decide what to do with common areas , which would include an ice skating rink , a botanical garden , an open - air theater , and tennis courts .
Circular openings in sections of the tower will provide nature -y parks and gardens for citizens .
Five circulation cores with massive elevators — think the Tube , except it goes up and down instead of weaving underground — transport residents from neighborhood to neighborhood .
Water and waste will be recycled , and fresh water harvested from the clouds , which pretty much start right around where the tower 's peak ends .
Since your workplace , your local movie theater , and all your friends will be in the same building , you 'll ever have to leave .

U.S. consumer confidence in April fell to its lowest level since March 1982 , according to a report Friday .
The Reuters / University of Michigan consumer - sentiment survey declined to 62.6 in April from 69.5 in March .
Nine out of 10 respondents said they believed the economy is now in recession , and many said they expect to use government rebate checks to pay down debt or increase savings .
That could keep consumer spending , a main engine of economic growth , sluggish .

GALLUP NEWS SERVICE
PRINCETON , NJ --
Thanks to the Internet and other trappings of the Information Age , facts and figures now come cheaper and faster than ever before .
But where does that leave good , old - fashioned general knowledge , the kind people carry around in their heads ?
A new Gallup poll includes three questions that tap Americans ' level of general knowledge .
Overall , most Americans did well , answering these questions correctly .
In anticipation of Independence Day , Americans were asked if they could identify the specific historical event celebrated on July 4th .
Fifty - five percent say it commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Independence ( this is a common misconception , and close to being accurate ; July 4th is actually the date in 1776 when the Continental Congress approved the Declaration , which was officially signed on August 2nd . )
Another 32 % give a more general answer , saying that July 4th celebrates Independence Day .
When Americans are asked to identify the country from which America gained its independence , 76 % correctly name Great Britain .
A handful , 2 % , think America 's freedom was won from France , 3 % mention some other country ( including Russia , China , and Mexico , among others named ) , while 19 % are unsure .
Groups that have higher degrees of self - reported patriotism ( see Gallup 's Fourth of July release ) , such as older people and whites , are also more likely to correctly name the country from which America gained its independence .
Only 66 % of those aged 18 - 29 know that America gained its independence from England , compared to 79 % of those aged 30 and older .
The knowledge gap is even wider on the basis of gender and race :
85 % of men compared to only 69 % of women know that America 's freedom was won from England
80 % of whites vs. 54 % of blacks answered correctly
Four out of Five Americans Know Earth Revolves Around Sun
Probing a more universal measure of knowledge , Gallup also asked the following basic science question , which has been used to indicate the level of public knowledge in two European countries in recent years : " As far as you know , does the earth revolve around the sun or does the sun revolve around the earth ? "
In the new poll , about four out of five Americans ( 79 % ) correctly respond that the earth revolves around the sun , while 18 % say it is the other way around .
These results are comparable to those found in Germany when a similar question was asked there in 1996 ; in response to that poll , 74 % of Germans gave the correct answer , while 16 % thought the sun revolved around the earth , and 10 % said they did n't know .
When the question was asked in Great Britain that same year , 67 % answered correctly , 19 % answered incorrectly , and 14 % did n't know .
The results below are based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected national sample of 1,016 adults , 18 years and older , conducted June 25 - 27 , 1999 .
For results based on this sample , one can say with 95 percent confidence that the maximum error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
As far as you know , what specific historical event is celebrated on July 4th ?
Signing of the Declaration of Independence / day it was signed 55 % Independence Day 32 Birth of United States 1 Other 6 No opinion 6 100 %
As far as you know , from what country did America gain its independence following the Revolutionary War ?
England / Great Britain / United Kingdom 76 % France 2 Other 3 No opinion 19 100 %
As far as you know , does the earth revolve around the sun , or does the sun revolve around the earth ?
I think I ’ve said this a hundred times , as have many others .
But this article in Thursday ’s Times is a good moment to revisit the point .
As Patrick Healy explains , it is simply a fallacy to claim that winning a state ’s Democratic primary means you ’re more likely to win that state in the general election or that your opponent can’t win it .
The dynamics are simply different between general elections and primaries .
You have on the one hand patterns and preferences that Democratic voters show for different candidates in Democratic primaries .
Then you have the separate question of whether these same voters will vote for the Democratic or the Republican nominee in the general .
One is simply not predictive of the other .
It could be — if one candidate ’s voters simply refuse to vote for the other candidate .
But who wins a primary does n’t tell you that .
And it ’s really not a big mystery that the argument does n’t hold up because it was n’t devised or conceived as an electoral argument .
It ’s a political argument — one that only really came into operation at the point at which the Clinton campaign realized that it was far enough behind that it ’s path to the nomination required making the argument to superdelegates that she ’s electable and Obama is not .
That ’s not to say there is n’t a difference between the two as general election candidates — at least in their current incarnations .
There is .
It ’s just not this big state nonsense .
Peter
Hart who , for what it ’s worth is actually part of the same polling firm as Hillary ’s new pollster / strategist Geoff Garin ( though himself not working with either candidate ) , comes much closer to the mark when he says in the Times article , “ Hillary goes deeper and stronger in the Democratic base than Obama , but her challenge is that she does n’t go as wide .
Obama goes much further reaching into the independent and Republican vote , and has a greater chance of creating a new electoral map for the Democrats . ”
That ’s the essence of it .
But there ’s actually a little more than that too when you combine that partisan analysis with a geographical one .
There ’s not a lot of good or consistent polling state by state yet .
But we were looking today at what polling data is out there .
Clinton is running a bit better against McCain in the rustbelt states that sit just above the Mason - Dixon line .
That ’s principally Ohio ( see Ohio polls ) and Pennsylvania ( see PA polls ) .
The state where you see this pattern more wildly than anywhere is in Kentucky .
( See KY polls ) .
Clinton loses to McCain there but respectably , whereas Obama simply gets slaughtered .
SurveyUSA has polled the state three times in the last eight weeks and the last two times McCain beats Obama better than two to one .
Kentucky is n’t really an issue in itself .
It ’s highly unlikely either Democrat would win it .
But it ’s the best example I ’ve seen where Clinton appears to run dramatically stronger than Obama .
But this is n’t the whole story .
In a whole arc of territory stretching from the Great Lakes through the upper Midwest down into the inter-mountain West Obama consistently runs stronger than Hillary .
Some of these states are ones Democrats really must win in order to win a general election — states like Iowa , Wisconsin and Michigan .
Others are states red states that have been trending blue but which Obama appears able to put in play while Hillary can ’t .
Colorado is a good example .
The last four polls of the state show Obama tied or ahead of McCain while McCain beats Hillary handily .
The most recent poll — April 21st — has Obama beating McCain by 3 points while McCain is beating Hillary by 14 points .
Given the spottiness of state by state polls , for now it ’s best to watch the national popular vote polls , which show the two Democrats basically even in how they ’d face McCain .
But there are differences .
They run better in different parts of the country .
But the ‘ big state ’ argument is just malarkey , an artifact of the spin necessities of the post - Super Tuesday campaign .
Deep inside this mound there is an ex- to - be- very - secret Russian neutrino lab .
It belongs to the Russian Nuclear Research Center and was build to explore the neutrino particle properties .
It is a multi stored underground lab which is on 1000 ft ( 330 meters ) deep mark inside this hill .
It is also 11,000 ft ( 3600 meters ) long and contains hundreds of rooms with the equipment , mainly the neutrino detection radars .
This radars are big metal tanks filled with white - spirit that has a light emission detectors and multipliers .
They register neutrino mini-blasts in this white spirit environment and sent the real time reports to the main computer you would see its terminal below .
These tanks with radars occupy many many rooms on different floors so that none of the neutrino folk could pass unnoticed here .

FALLUJAH – Fallujah remains a crippled city more than three years after the November 2004 U.S. - led assault .
Unemployment and lack of medical care and safe drinking water in the city 35 mi. west of Baghdad remain a continuous problem .
Freedom of movement is still curtailed .
The city suffered two devastating U.S. military attacks during 2004 .
Many of the buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged .
Several collapsed under the heavy bombing and were never rebuilt .
The heaps of concrete slabs and piles of rubble remain where they were .
“ We wonder why we have been targeted by Americans since the first days of the occupation , ” Dr. Mohammad Abed from al - Anbar University told IPS .
“ This city sacrificed thousands of its citizens through five years of occupation just because they said ‘ no ’ to a project that threatens their country ’s future . ”
Now a less visible form of destruction is being spread , he said .
“ The new wave of destruction is represented by tearing the social tissue apart .
The Americans are paying tremendous amounts of money to get people of Fallujah to fight each other . ”
The road into Fallujah from the main Amman - Baghdad highway is safer today , but nobody is allowed into Fallujah who is not from the city and cannot provide elaborate identity documentation .
That can only be obtained by undergoing biometric identification by the U.S. military – a process that includes retina scans , body searches , and fingerprinting before issuance of a bar - coded ID badge .
The city remains sealed .
Many residents refer to it as a big jail .
“ Being sealed for five years , Fallujah has lost all aspects of natural life , ” Ahmad Hamid , a former member of the city council , told IPS .
“ A man who has lived most of his life mixing with British and American people told us in 2003 that we could not reach any agreement because they [ Americans ] look at Fallujah as a center of Iraqi people ’s unity .
He told us Iraq would be divided into regions , provinces , and even tribes , but we in the council did not listen to him . ”
The city remains tense in the face of power struggles and turf wars between tribal chiefs and Awakening group commanders in Fallujah and in other areas of the volatile Anbar province .
Disputes between the Iraqi Islamic Party and Awakening groups are also creating security tensions .
The Awakening forces are former resistance fighters whom the U.S. now pays to be on its side .
Beyond security , the health situation in the city is particularly difficult .
A study conducted by two civil society organizations and the administration of Fallujah General Hospital over a two - year period was submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on March 4 .
The hospital administration and the two groups , the Conservation Center of Environment and Reserves in Fallujah and the Monitoring Net of Human Rights in Iraq , say that in 2006 they found “ 5,928 new illness cases that were unknown before in Fallujah , ” over 70 percent of which were “ cancers and abnormalities ” in children below 12 years of age .
“ In the first six months of 2007 there were 2,447 cases , more than 50 percent of these cases were children .
Simply , this means that most of the victims are children , and this will threaten the new generation in this city . ”
“ Now we face death of all kinds , ” said a doctor at Fallujah General Hospital .
“ In addition to all known diseases , new ones are invading us .
Blackwater fever , for instance , was an unknown disease in our area , but now it is spreading like fire in a forest .
We have no medicines to give our patients , and the black market is flourishing . ”
“ Our best doctors fled the city for fear of being detained by American and police forces just because they helped civilians during the two sieges of 2004 .
They are now considered terrorists or at least terrorist supporters , when they should have been decorated with medals for their heroic work in helping their people . ”
Medically speaking , “ the siege is total , ” a doctor who gave his name as Dr. Kamal told the press recently , speaking of the lack of drugs , oxygen , electricity , and clean water at Fallujah General Hospital .
U.S. military officials say reconstruction is under way , and that aid is being provided to hospitals .
People see little of that .
“ The brutal destruction of Fallujah by the American Army was not followed by any reconstruction , as if the city is being punished for its attitude against the occupation , ” said an engineer in Fallujah , Kaltan Fadhil .
Water and electricity supply , health facilities , and roads were provided “ in a way that only made some people who collaborated with Americans richer , ” he said .
“ It was no more than repainting some buildings to make them look nicer for a while , and then new contracts were announced to rehabilitate what was already rehabilitated . ”
If you ’re serious about getting your finances in order and regaining control over your money , the first step is to find out exactly where it ’s going .
Making the decision to track your expenses is important to do because it gives you a realistic view of how you ’re managing your money .
Too many people try to start budgeting or even skip budgeting without even thinking about tracking their expenses .
Sometimes it can be scary to peel back the rug and uncover what you ’re truly spending money on , but it ’s worth it in the end .
By tracking your expenses , you ’ll know exactly what ’s going on .
From there you can set realistic goals and work on your habits .
How We Used to Track Our Expenses
Back in the day , people would often balance their checkbooks , and save paper receipts throughout the month to enter everything into a system manually .
This was very tedious and time - consuming .
Not to mention , it can get pretty inaccurate when you lose some of your receipts or replace your paper tracking system .
If I had to track my expenses this way , I would dread it and probably just figure it was n’t worth the headache .
Luckily , there are much better ways to track your expenses especially when you take a more digital approach .
I ’m not a big fan of using a ton of finance apps and programs , but on the flipside , fintech can be more convenient in terms of taking over some of the work for you .
Here are some much more efficient programs I ’d recommend for tracking your expenses the non-painful way .
When you track your expenses you have a better idea of what 's going on .

Personal Capital
Personal Capital is a cash and wealth management program that you may have heard of .
It ’s completely free to use and you can connect all your accounts in just seconds including your checking and savings , credit cards , and loans and more .
Personal Capital uses this information to help track your net worth all in one place automatically .
If you connect your checking account (s ) too , you can use the ‘ Banking ’ tab to track your cash flow .
The system tracks all your spending and categories it throughout the money so you ’ll know exactly where your money is going .
They actually do a pretty good job at categorizing expenses accurately but if they ever misinterpret a cost , you can change it manually .
Mint
Mint is another expense tracking program that is very similar to Personal Capital .
Although , they focus more on helping you budget by tracking your expenses so it ’s not heavily focused on your net worth .
You can also connect all your accounts to make expense tracking easy and automatic .
I ’ve used Mint before in the past and liked how easy the system was , but often found that I had to manually correct certain spending categories to make it more accurate .
On the plus side , using an automatic expense tracker will save you time in the long run .
Even if you have to manually change some expenses in the beginning , just set aside time at the end of each week to check in .
Over time , Mint will adjust and start to categorize your expenses more accurately .
Mint users can now check their credit score for free as well which is pretty cool .
Every Dollar
Every Dollar is a budgeting app that helps you put Dave Ramsey ’s Baby Steps into practice .
You can start for free but there is a paid version of the app as well .
Start by adding your paycheck amounts in for the month or what you expect to earn .
Then , plan your expenses and budget categories based on your income .
The best way to budget is to put every dollar you have to use – hence the name of this app .
Of course , Every Dollar also helps you track your spending automatically and compare it to your budget .
This is so key if you want to be successful with budgeting .
It ’s not enough to set a budget and leave it .
You need to regularly track your expenses to make sure you ’re sticking to your budget so you can get real results .
Your Bank Account
Your bank account itself may be a perfect tool to help you track your expenses .
I bank with Huntington which is popular in the Midwest but it ’s a great bank to have because they provide account holders with a built - in expense tracker analysis .
Their feature is called Spend Setter and it allows you to create specific budget categories and track your spending in those categories as you use your debit card throughout the month .
I also love how you can set up alerts to notify you when you ’re getting close to the spending limit you set in a particular category .
It ’s free and you do n’t have to sign up for any other programs if you do n’t want to .
Huntington is probably not the only bank that does this so check around and see what your options are for tracking expenses automatically through your bank .

Summary
Tracking your expenses does n’t have to be a pain or a huge time suck .
Focus on making it easy and this will motivate you to stick to it .
Most people do n’t have the time or patience to manually track expenses throughout each day .
If you do prefer manual tracking , I ’d recommend consolidating this task to something you do weekly so it ’s not overwhelming .
Over time , you ’ll learn your spending habits and have peace of mind knowing you can account for every dollar of your income .
One problem is that society has never agreed on a standard of what is safe in these surreal realms when the odds of disaster might be tiny but the stakes are cosmically high .
In such situations , probability estimates are often no more than “ informed betting odds , ” said Martin Rees , a Cambridge University cosmologist , the astronomer royal and the author of “ Our Final Hour . ”
Adrian Kent , also of Cambridge , said in a paper in 2003 reviewing scientists ’ failure to calculate adequately and characterize accurately risks to the public , that even the most basic question , “ ‘ How improbable does a catastrophe have to be to justify proceeding with an experiment ? ’ seems never to have been seriously examined . ”
Dr. Calogero commented , as did Dr. Kent , in 2000 after a very public battle on the safety of another accelerator , the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , or Rhic , at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island .
Dr. Calogero said he hoped to apply a gentle pressure on Cern to treat these issues with seriousness .
“ A crusade against it is a danger , ” he said of the new collider .
“ It would not be based on rational argument . ”

Fears about the Brookhaven collider first centered on black holes but soon shifted to the danger posed by weird hypothetical particles , strangelets , that critics said could transform the Earth almost instantly into a dead , dense lump .
Ultimately , independent studies by two groups of physicists calculated that the chances of this catastrophe were negligible , based on astronomical evidence and assumptions about the physics of the strangelets .
One report put the odds of a strangelet disaster at less than one in 50 million , less than a chance of winning some lottery jackpots .
Dr. Kent , in a 2003 paper , used the standard insurance company method to calculate expected losses to explore how stringent this bound on danger was .
He multiplied the disaster probability times the cost , in this case the loss of the global population , six billion .
A result was that , in actuarial terms , the Rhic collider could kill up to 120 people in a decade of operation .
“ Put this way , the bound seems far from adequately reassuring , ” Dr. Kent wrote .
Alvaro de Rujula of Cern , who was involved in writing a safety report , said extending the insurance formula that way violated common sense .
“ Applied to all imaginable catastrophes , it would result in World Paralysis , ” he wrote .
Besides , the random nature of quantum physics means that there is always a minuscule , but nonzero , chance of anything occurring , including that the new collider could spit out man-eating dragons .
Doomsday from particle physics is part of the culture .
Next year will see the release of the film version of “ Angels and Demons , ” the prequel to Dan Brown ’s “ DaVinci Code , ” in which the bad guys use a Cern accelerator to gather antimatter for a bomb to blow up the Vatican , and it includes scenes at Cern .

In our original tribute post , we also pointed listeners towards " another marvelous and revealing resource " : Stan Mir 's lengthy 2006 interview with Gizzi and Craig Watson , which had recently been published in the final issue of .
While that 's still a wonderful document , we are happy to also add a 2017 retrospective honoring Gizzi at our own Kelly Writers House , hosted by Davy Knittle and featuring Mir and William Corbett , which is given prominence of place at the head of our Michael Gizzi author page .
Click here to reconnect with these marvelous poems and Gizzi 's memorable voice , which are every bit as potent a decade later .
Today is the tenth anniversary of the passing of Michael Gizzi .
When we originally broke the news on PennSound Daily , we acknowledged that Gizzi 's work was widely praised by some of the most respected names in the world of contemporary poetics , including John Ashbery , who hailed his poetry as " [ r ] azor sharp but also rich and generously compelling . . . [ it ] lambastes as it celebrates , bringing us finally to a place of poignant irresolution . "
Similarly , reviewing his final collectionfor John Yau praised Gizzi 's ear for " American vernacular , " insisting that readers interested in knowing " how weird , interesting , scary , and odd America is " acquaint themselves with Gizzi 's poetry , while Ron Silliman cited Gizzi's " genius " as " not just the degree to which [ he ] can make great complexity appear breath - takingly simple , but rather the great sense of humanity in whose service he does this .

Today , we 're happy to announce that we 've segmented three of these readings , as well as a favorite NYC reading from our archives .
It 's been more than a year since the death of poet Kevin Killian and his absence is still acutely felt within the poetry community .
In the aftermath of his passing we were grateful to A Voice Box who very generously shared a half - dozen recordings of Killian made in the Bay Area between 2009 and 2013 .
Today , we 're happy to announce that we 've segmented three of these readings , as well as a favorite NYC reading from our archives .
The most recent of these readings is Killian 's June 2011 set as part of the Condensary Series at Oakland 's The Speakeasy .
Following short introductory comments , Killian reads a total of sixteen poems , including " Better Than Today , " " Overcoming Shame , " " Anagrams , " " Wuthering Heights , " " Violets in the Snow , " and " Nude Valentine . "
Next , from the New Reading Series at Oakland 's 21 Grand we have a forty - three minute set that includes nine poems in total , among them " Hey Day , " " I Lost Me to Meth , " " Skull With Jewels on It , " " Cannot Exist , " and " American Idol . "
Also from 2009 , we have Killian 's undated recording from San Francisco 's Canessa Park , however this set consists of just one piece , " Hot Lights , " with brief opening comments .
Finally , Killian 's contribution to the 2007 launch event for EOAGH Issue 3 : Queering Language from the Bowery Poetry Club , which includes " Norwegian Wood " and " Is It All Over My Face ? "
Mortgage foreclosure notices are going out so fast that in some states the number of new foreclosure proceedings each month is greater than the number of homes sold that month .
The foreclosure problem appears to be greatest in the West , particularly in Nevada , where home prices soared in the housing boom and are now falling rapidly .
Worries about foreclosures have led to a variety of legislative proposals in Washington and in state capitals , as well as to a voluntary plan organized by the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , that seeks to delay foreclosures while homeowners and lenders try to work out agreements .
But so far , no consensus has emerged on legislation , and the volume of foreclosure notices continues to rise .
During January , it was reported this week by RealtyTrac , there were 153,745 initial foreclosure notices sent out in the United States .
That dwarfed the 43,000 total sales of newly built single - family homes and amounted to nearly half the total sales figure , which includes sales of existing homes and condominiums .
SOMEONE page Tom Cruise – his former friend and Scientolo - pal is slamming his beloved church .
Jason Beghe , a character actor best known for roles on TV’s “ CSI , ” “ Numb3rs ” and the now - canceled “ Cane , ” took to YouTube yesterday to slam his former religion .
Beghe , who was a member of the Church of Scientology for 13 years and was even featured in a promotional video for the church in 2005 , now says , “ Scientology is destructive and a rip - off . ”
In the video , billed as a three - minute teaser to a longer interview that ’s on its way , Beghe goes on to say , “ It ’s very , very dangerous for your spiritual , psychological , mental , emotional health and evolution .
I think it stunts your evolution .
If Scientology is real , then something ’s [ bleeped ] up . . .
It ai n’t delivering what it ’s promised .
It sure has not . ”
Beghe was n’t just a peon in the church .
The actor , who ’s best friends with David Duchovny , spent a lot of money to make it to the coveted “ OT 5 ” level achieved by Cruise , John Travolta and Kirstie Alley .
But Beghe now warns ,
“ The further up the bridge , the worse you get . . .
I do n’t have an agenda .
I ’m just trying to help .
I have the luxury of having gotten into Scientology and after having been in it , been out .
And that ’s a perspective that people who are still in and not out do not have . ”
A rep for Scientology said , “ There are millions of Scientologists around the world who will tell you of their daily wins in applying Scientology in their lives .
One need only visit http://www.scientology.org to see this for yourself . ”
Beghe ’s salvo is the latest hit to Cruise ’s controversial faith .
Since the beginning of the year , several creepy videos of Cruise exhorting people to join Scientology and laughing maniacally have hit the Web – videos which the church demanded be taken down , to no avail .
Last month , a group calling itself “ Anonymous ” took credit for bombarding Scientology churches across the country with prank calls , bomb threats and cyber attacks .
And in February , more than 50 masked protesters gathered outside of the Boston headquarters of Scientology and demonstrated against the church wearing Guy Fawkes masks .

Chancellor Alistair Darling has backed the Bank of England 's £ 50bn plan to help prevent the credit crisis causing more damage to the UK banking system .
Under the scheme , banks will be able to swap potentially risky mortgage debts for secure government bonds to help them operate during the credit squeeze .
Mr Darling said it would " help resolve " problems in credit markets and make life easier for would - be borrowers .
The UK 's financial system remained " fundamentally strong " , he argued .
In a statement to MPs , Mr Darling said the Bank 's intervention was necessary because money markets were not " functioning properly " and were beset by a " lack of confidence " despite billions of pounds in liquidity being pumped into the system .
This is a banking market bail - out of an ambition we have n't seen in this country since the early 1970's and possibly longer than that
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog in full Bank plan explained Lenders react to plan
The measures , he said , would help alleviate the " increasing cost and declining availability of lending by banks and building societies " .
Abbey , one of the UK 's largest lenders , reacted by instantly cutting the cost of some mortgage deals , albeit by a very small amount .
But one housing expert said the package would only have a " marginal " influence , at best , on current mortgage rates .
" It is pretty small beer , " said Simon Rubinsohn , chief economist for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors .
" It is not a short - term fix for the housing market . "
Swap scheme
Under the scheme , banks will be allowed to swap mortgage debts for government securities .
The swap scheme , starting on Monday , will be for a period of one year and may be renewed for a total of three years .
It will only apply to mortgage debts on banks ' books at the end of 2007 and the swaps cannot be used to finance new lending .
The central bank anticipates that initial take - up of the scheme will total £ 50 bn but there is no cap on lending .
Mr Darling denied the support was a bailout , stressing that the risk of losses remained with the banks which will be required to pay a fee for the swap facility and provide the Bank of England with assets of greater value than the government bonds they will receive .
The chancellor also called on banks to be honest about the true scale of their current losses , saying " transparency was an essential part of stabilising financial markets " .
We are very supportive of this development
John Varley , Barclays chief executive Despite " broadly " welcoming the plan , shadow chancellor George Osborne called for a " personal guarantee " from the chancellor that no taxpayers would lose out as a result .
Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats '
Treasury spokesman , said he had reservations about the idea , saying it " should be linked to changes in the banks ' behaviour " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the scheme was one of a range of measures to protect British workers from the turbulence in America 's financial and housing markets .
Banks welcomed the move and said they were confident it would go some way to free up credit markets .
" We are very supportive of this development , " said Barclays chief executive John Varley .
" It is both innovative and substantive . "
But John McFall , chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee , said it would be " silly " to think Monday 's move would serve as a panacea for the current financial distress .
" This is a stimulus but there are tough times ahead over the next year or two economically and you can't get away from it , " he told the BBC .
Beneficial effects British banks have become increasingly unwilling to make loans , even to each other , as a result of the credit crisis , which was triggered by massive losses for banks involved in the US sub - prime mortgage market .
And many investors , concerned at what happened to sub - prime mortgages in the US , no longer want UK mortgage - based assets .

The disappearance of this market has deprived banks of tens of billions of pounds of finance for mortgage lending .
Although it will not directly support new lending , the greater liquidity should free up bank balance sheets and enable them to lend more to consumers , home buyers and businesses .
However , the Council of Mortgage Lenders - which is meeting with Mr Darling tomorrow to discuss ways of helping borrowers - said that the liquidity boost would not automatically reverse the recent trend for higher mortgage costs .
" Further details are ... awaited on how much of the additional liquidity might be recycled responsibly into mortgage products or pricing , " it said .
Bail - out ?
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said the primary purpose of the scheme was to prevent another Northern Rock , not to try and bring down mortgage rates .
" Or to put it another way , taxpayer support is being provided to minimise the risk of huge future losses for taxpayers from another banking collapse . "
" This is a banking market bail - out of an ambition we have n't seen in this country since the early 1970's and possibly longer than that , " he said .
Until now , the Bank of England has been more conservative in its financial support for banks than the Federal Reserve in the US and the European Central Bank .
In the US , the Federal Reserve took similar action with a $ 200 bn programme to boost liquidity in financial markets last month .

In the past few months , several countries have announced plans to eliminate the bags .
Bangladesh and some African nations have sought to ban them because they clog fragile sewerage systems , creating a health hazard .
Starting this summer , China will prohibit sellers from handing out free plastic shopping bags , but the price they should charge is not specified , and there is little capacity for enforcement .
Australia says it wants to end free plastic bags by the end of the year , but has not decided how .
Efforts to tax plastic bags have failed in many places because of heated opposition from manufacturers as well as from merchants , who have said a tax would be bad for business .
In Britain , Los Angeles and San Francisco , proposed taxes failed to gain political approval , though San Francisco passed a ban last year .
Some countries , like Italy , have settled for voluntary participation .
But there were no plastic bag makers in Ireland ( most bags here came from China ) , and a forceful environment minister gave reluctant shopkeepers little wiggle room , making it illegal for them to pay for the bags on behalf of customers .
The government collects the tax , which finances environmental enforcement and cleanup programs .
Furthermore , the environment minister told shopkeepers that if they changed from plastic to paper , he would tax those bags , too .
While paper bags , which degrade , are in some ways better for the environment , studies suggest that more greenhouse gases are released in their manufacture and transportation than in the production of plastic bags .
Today , Ireland ’s retailers are great promoters of taxing the bags .
“ I spent many months arguing against this tax with the minister ; I thought customers would n’t accept it , ” said Senator Feargal Quinn , founder of the Superquinn chain .
“ But I have become a big , big enthusiast . ”
Mr. Quinn is also president of EuroCommerce , a group representing six million European retailers .
In that capacity , he has encouraged a plastic bag tax in other countries .
But members are not buying it .
“ They say : ‘ Oh , no , no .
It would n’t work .
It would n’t be acceptable in our country , ’ ” Mr. Quinn said .

The group 's lawyer said the ruling was a victory for religious freedom
The decision overturns a lower court ruling which said the state need not recognise conversions from Islam because of a religious ban .
This is a case that has tested Egypt 's tolerance of conversions from Islam .
A lawyer for the 12 Coptic Christians described the case as a victory for human rights and freedom of religion .
He says it could open the door for hundreds of other Copts who want to revert to their original faith from Islam .
Limited application
It appears , though , that the court 's decision will have a limited application .
Reports say the judge decided that the Copts should not be considered apostates for converting from Islam , because they had been born Christian .
This suggests that Egyptians born Muslim will still be unable to convert to other faiths and have those conversions recognised on their identity cards .
Many Muslims believe that converting from Islam is wrong , and some believe it is punishable by death .
Last year , an Egyptian convert to Christianity was forced to go into hiding when he received death threats after trying to have his conversion officially recognised .

This is the unedited and modified version of the letter toour local newspaper , the Intelligencer , Doylestown , Bucks County , Pa. , printed today .
See the italicized remarkes for the unedited thoughts that especially reflect my experience as voting integrity activist .
It ’s a long letter ; I ’m appreciative to Intell for publishing most of it .
I present it to Brad Blog as an example , State and Nationwide of what we can do as voting activists to inform our local communities .
.. something to keep in mind for November Presidential election .
-------------------------------------------
Letter to Editor :
For this important Primary , all over the State , , ‘ get out the vote ’ by encouraging others to vote in large numbers .
If there are unseen unknown problems with the computerized voting , your candidate will be more likely to win if there are large numbers of votes for him / her to overcome a possible error rate of the machine ’s software .
As a Bucks County , Pennsylvania , Judge of Elections and voting integrity advocate I offer some suggestions for Election Day , especially for newly registered voters who need to take ID , such as your signed voter registration card , or driver ’s license or utility bill .
Returning voters do n’t need ID .
Your signature , matching your signature on record , serves as proof of your identity .
Danaher voting machines are used in my county of Bucks as well as the following Pennsylvania Counties : Philadelphia , Dauphin , Berks , Monroe , Delaware and state of Delaware .
In the voting booth for the Danaher machine , you will see red blinking lights for each candidate .
Upon choosing your selection , the red blinking lights of your choices will turn solid red .
When all your selections are made , then push the large green VOTE button .
Most importantly , be sure the screen then goes blank .
You are now finished voting .
However , if you leave , without pressing that green vote button at the end , your selections are still on the screen and are to be erased by the workers !
To cast a write - in vote , follow written instructions inside booth and ask pollworkers for instructions .
In this process , do n’t push on the write - in door slot to get to the paper tape , since this could cause machine to malfunction or paper to jam .
Do n’t write in the name of a candidate already on the ballot .
If any problem is observed with machine malfunctions , or long lines or other problems , or for even simple questions , speak to your Judge of Elections and report any problem to both the national Election Protection line : 1- 866-OUR -VOTE and locally , call Mary Ann Gould Director of Coalition for Voting Integrity at 215-357-5206 ..
Polls are open 7 am to 8 pm. , Tuesday , April 22 .
We the people can shape our future , if we participate in civic activities , starting with the vote .
As Ben Franklin admonishes us from our past - it ’s our Republic if we can keep it .

Yes Floridiot .
A comment some time ago by SevenString ( C&L ) said it all so well .
" An e-voting machine is like my bowels : they both generally appear to run smoothly , and their resultant outputs have about the same intrinsic value . "
Thanks SevenString , where ever you are , for the best quote ever regarding DRE's .

GWN , With all of the talk about wireless networking to gain access to the machines , or even network cables plugged into ethernet ports hidden on the machines ,
Why not just use the power cord & plug that is plugged into a standard AC outlet on the wall to gain access ?

No voting machine is reliable !
I live in Nebraska , and a few years ago we had republicans winning 5,000 votes in towns with only 2,000 people !
LOL !
Not only that but districts that had NEVER gone for a republican suddenly did so in overwhelming numbers !
And what do we have ?
An unjustified war started by an inside job terrorist attack , laws that favor billionaires and designed to totally destroy the middle class !
And a supreme court that makes certain that Bush gets everything he wants !
Democracy ?
Hardly !
Several thousand people leave the US every month !
Now I know why !
And martial law is staring us in the face !

Hopefully Robert Mugabe 's reading this and , with the help of DRE , democracy can finally truly take off in Zimbabwe .
Then , with the likes of the US and the UK closely following his example a true golden age , the likes of which 's never been known to humanity , can finally come to realisation .
In fact , things 'll become so wonderful our glorious leaders 'll eventually decide to spare us the tedium involved in choosing candidates by devising algorithms that 'll do this for us .
Then , finally , they 'll simply dispense with all forms of voting at all .
By the way , lest it is n't perfectly obvious , I am , of course , being utterly sarcastic .

If you think Hillary has ' experience ' by virtue of being married to that fraud from Arkansas then you really are an idiot , and no ' you might be ' about it .
The fact that this mega-rich , dishonest , power hungry , utterly venal sow is being treated as though she were a serious candidate has destroyed what little faith I still had in my fellow citizens .
God help us !
Critical thinking is dead .
The Clinton 's have accrued 109 MILLION DOLLARS in the past 8 years , and yet you honestly think she 's going to represent the interests of the working class !?

If you think Republicans are voting for Obama in places like Ohio were Hillary ’s vote counts often exceeded the total number of registered Democrats by large margins then you absolutely have to be an idiot .
With it being a felony for Republicans to vote in the Democratic primary in Ohio there clearly were very many Republicans committing felonies to vote for Hillary or there were a lot of votes manufactured for Hillary in Ohio .
Those NeoCons , who are into manufacturing votes big time , are I believe also from the Republican party as well .

Now I know there 's something fishy about BPL .
If Kevin Martin likes it , I do n't FCC chief Kevin Martin said that " holds great promise as a ubiquitous broadband solution that would offer a viable alternative to cable , digital subscriber line , fiber , and wireless broadband solutions , " and that BPL was one of the agency 's " top priorities " .

The best thing you can do to peacefully protest is do n't show up to vote .
Do n't play the game .
Start a movement .
Hand out flyers that say " Do n't vote !

the worst thing u can do to protest the blackboxes is to stop voting .... when voters show up in huge numbers and the programs have to " change " results is when they get " impossible " numbers

Pennsylvania : “ Trust us to count your vote , even though you ca n’t verify it ” TruthIsAll
The GOP wants to run against Clinton because they believe she ’s a weaker candidate than Obama .
Just look at the polls : Obama does much better than HRC against McCain .
But the GOP vote counters will make sure that Hillary gets enough votes in PA to keep her super delegate hopes alive .
And since they control the unverifiable machine count , who will question the result ?
Even if the pre-election and exit polls indicate a close race , those who control the machines and count the votes will sit back and watch the show - just like they have since 2000 .
They know there will be no recount ; there ’s nothing to recount .
Only electronic voting machines will be used in this election .
Paper ballots ?
How quaint to want to see that the votes are fairly counted in full view .
The politicians and the media have revised the old saying .
It ’s now “ Trust , but do n’t expect to verify ” .
No one will talk about 2008 primary election fraud , except for a handful of activists , like Michael Collins ( autorank ) and Brad Blog .
And as usual , the media and the politicians will just go along with the myth that late undecided voters broke for Hillary ; that young Obama supporters did n’t vote ; that Obama ’s clock was cleaned in that ABC farce of a debate .
The bought and paid for moderators asked Obama about his lapel and Reverend Wright , but they did n’t ask Clinton about husband Bill ’s lucrative free - trade work for Columbia and his full - court NAFTA press .
Historically , Democratic presidential candidates have always fared better in the exit polls than the recorded vote .
That ’s because the Republicans cheat in every election– and they will in this one .
In 2004 , the exit polls had Kerry winning PA by 55 - 44 ; the recorded vote was 50.9 - 48.4 , far exceeding the 2 % margin of error .
His 11 point margin shrank to 3 % .
Kerry won 58.6 % of the final 127,000 votes ( absentees , etc. ) .
Only about 2000 PA voters were exit polled .
The MoE is exceedingly low .
So how could Kerry exceed his 51.1 % share of the first 5643 k votes by 7.5 % in the final 127k ?
Here ’s why :
The final 127k votes came in days after the election ended .
The fraud spigot was turned off by then .
But PA was not alone ; the MoE was also exceeded in 28 other states .
Move along , nothing to see .
In 2000 , Gore won PA by 51 - 46 .
Remember that Nader took votes away from Gore , so Al would have won by more than 5 % if Nader had not run .
But those returning Nader voters broke for Kerry by better than 3 - 1 , so how did Kerry do worse than Gore in PA ?

If fast eddy says he does n't know of the dre voting problems he is flat out lying .
I have him on video , where I explain them to him , and he states that at this point ( before 06 election ) its really a money crunch problem !
I moved this year and the video is somewhere in one of my basement boxes , as well as the entire Harrisburg FCC hearing about media consolidation .

Hell yes vote !
But remember that those who count the votes decide ... until we decide to take them out .
And enventually we will if they continue to screw us in glee .
Government should fear the people , the people should not fear the government .
The Amurkan movie they parade before us is such a lame piece of shit .

I am so sorry , Pennsylvania .
You have got to get rid of those machines as a way that most / all voters vote .
I am a poll worker in California , and we have to have one of those machines per precinct for those voters who would be unable to vote seretly without them .
At neither of the two precincts at the polling place where I work are any votes cast on these machines , ever .
They are there because election law says they have to be .
I set my machine up , and then I take it down , for every single election , even though nobody uses it .
I have to attend a special training for every single election on how to work with these machines .
You need to get your wonderful state to this point , where voters simply do not use them .
There is no point working through the national / state legislative systems .
Your legislators do not care about how you view these machines , or how they are a threat to our democracy .
They only care that the lobbyists who work for the companies who manufacture and market these machines contribute to their legislative campaigns .
I am sorry it is like this , but this is the reality we are up against .
Do whatever you have to do to get voters in your state to reject these machines .
That is the only way to go .
Oh , and contribute to Brad Friedman 's blog , because he is one of only a few people in America who are on to this electronic voting machine scam .

Sorry , but I just watched the Why Tuesday videoclip after I wrote my last post .
Here 's what I got out of that videoclip :
As long as they are getting elected by voters who use these machines , THEY DON'T CARE .
They will not challenge the integrity of these machines .
Can you see how insidious these machines are ?!!!
BTW , Why Tuesday is a great site .
I link to it at my site , and Jacob does a great job with it .

The thing about people who do n't vote , is that they either do n't care that people do n't vote , or they are in a situation where their vote does n't matter .
I am in Massachusetts .
I voted for Nader one year because it was obvious the Democratic would take the state .
But I did realise that I would never have voted for Nader if I was in Florida .

I screensaved a lot , because as soon as Hertzberg was exposed at BreakForDisinfoNews , he started scrubbing and pruning his internet activities , such as with Hertzberg.org where he admitted to having worked for the DoD. AA at Kos blogged about Brad and the Curtis / dog story .
I could find only one other person who did that .
It was " Fintan Dunne , " a known disinformation noise maker .
Kudos to John Dean for busting up the disingenuous pack of trolls who made a mockery out of the election integrity movement .
As for Hertzberg , it appears that his websites were on government property .
If so , I am curious why his ronpaulonline and other websites were there too .
Finally , if the Election Science Institute was a true non-profit dedicated to helping with election integrity issues , why is the domain no longer available ?

Since they are n’t counting Fl and MI , To balance that disenfranchisement out , why do n’t we not count 2 other states of equal delegate votes that Obama won .
That way the current states that are being punished wo n’t feel so bad and the 2 new states who will be disenfranchised wo n’t really care or wo n’t care enough to bother in the general election .
Do you think they would mind ?
Instead of Hillary taking the hit , we will make the hit even .
Of coarse did Obama even win two states as big as FL and MI ???

The recent increase in fighting around Basra , which is rapidly spreading to Baghdad , has the punditariat in a lather .
Their sacred Surge has turned into a mere splurge  of resources , lives , and misplaced hope .
Well , I could have told you that , and , indeed , I did .
But never mind the chattering classes , their delusions of American omnipotence , and my own unfortunate penchant for self - congratulation .
What ’s really fascinating about this story is how it underscores the central mystery of our Iraq war policy : why in the name of all that ’s holy are we supporting the pro-Iranian parties and factions in the Iraqi government , whilst Our Glorious Leader is coupling Tehran and al - Qaeda as “ twin ” evils to be fought and defeated in Iraq ?
We have placed our chips on the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , whose party , Da’wa ( Islamic Call ) , in alliance with the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , now known as ISCI , was one of the few Iraqi resistance groups to refuse all U.S. aid in the run-up to the invasion , and was n’t all that cooperative as the occupation regime was established .
Together with their partners in government , the Da’wa Party , SCIRI / ISCI took refuge in Iran during the Ba’athist era and received military aid and training from Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
The extension of Iranian influence into Iraq was a direct consequence of the Iraq war , and the recent visit of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Baghdad has underscored this and provided plenty of grist for those who are pointing at the so - called Shia Crescent with alarm .
It was n’t supposed to turn out like this .
The original plan of the neocons was to install Ahmed Chalabi , their own personal Iraqi puppet , but that soon fell through  and Chalabi , it turned out , had strong links to Iranian intelligence agencies .
Accused of divulging American secrets to Tehran , Chalabi had his Iraq headquarters raided by Iraqi and U.S. personnel .
Unfortunately , the horse was already out of the barn .
In any case , what the neocons  who knew ( and know ) nothing about Iraq or the Middle East  did n’t anticipate was the awakening of the Shi’ite giant , whose rising took the form of Iranian - born Shi’ite religious leader Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the Shi’ite version of the pope .
It was he who scuttled the neocon - devised “ caucus ” system , which would have convoked assemblies of handpicked U.S. stooges in the provinces , who would , in turn have elected a national constituent assembly , with the result easily manipulated by Washington ’s expert ventriloquists .
Sistani called his followers out into the streets , and that ’s when things really started to veer out of Washington ’s control .
When Chalabi ’s shenanigans were exposed to the light of day , and his extensive interactions with the Iranians were revealed , a theory was floated by several in the intelligence community that we were basically suckered into the Iraq war by its chief beneficiaries , the Iranians .
Using their chief asset , the double agent Chalabi , they and their neocon allies fed us ersatz “ intelligence ” via the various Iraqi “ defectors ” rounded up by the Iraqi National Congress and paraded across the front page of the New York Times by Judith Miller and her editors .
“ One of the most sophisticated and successful intelligence operations in history ” is how one intelligence officer described the run-up to the invasion of Iraq to a Newsday reporter .
Looked at this way , U.S. policy in Iraq begins to make a kind of twisted , Bizarro World sense .
From the very beginning , U.S. policymakers were determined to go after militant Shi’ite leader Moqtada al - Sadr , the son of a prominent cleric , whose Mahdi Army is the only significant indigenous opposition to the pro-Iranian militias and the Tehran - influenced central government .
Sadr is critical of both the U.S. and the Iranians , and , as such , represents a direct threat to the occupation and the Iraqi status quo .
U.S. efforts to paint the Sadrists as tools of Tehran backfired for lack of evidence , and are , in any case , counterintuitive  as Sadr is an ardent Iraqi nationalist who decries the country ’s breakup and opposes all foreign influence .
The consolidation of a strong Iraqi state is the last thing the Americans want , for that would threaten their occupation and lead to their swift exit from the country .
It is also in the Iranian interest to keep Iraq divided and stop the nationalist Sadr and his brutal militia from taking power in Baghdad .
And , as Robert Parry points out , another factor played a key role in tricking us into war :
“ Israeli governments have long made a high priority out of forging alliances with countries like Iran on the periphery of the Arab world to divert Arab antipathy that otherwise could be concentrated on Israel .
Plus , Israel and Iran had an important enemy in common : Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein .
Both Israel and Iran had a lot to gain by convincing the United States to remove their hated adversary . ”
As Parry notes  and professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt showed in their trailblazing book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy  the neoconservatives , strategically positioned inside the national security bureaucracy , and the Lobby pushed this agenda , touted Chalabi , and relentlessly campaigned for war with Iraq .
Parry ’s review of the long - standing ties between the Israelis and the Iranians is quite educational , and it explains a lot about what is happening in Iraq today  and , perhaps , what will happen tomorrow .
I think I pretty much summed up here the scenario that is now unfolding :
“ I have to laugh when I hear criticisms from the Democrats and the growing number of antiwar Republicans in Congress who complain that we do n’t belong in Iraq any longer because , you know , it ’s a civil war .
This is largely seen as an unintended consequence of the American invasion  but what if it was intended ?
“ It would , after all , make perfect Bizarro ‘ sense . ’
If , instead of trying to build a stable , democratic Iraq , you ’re trying to wreak as much destruction as possible and turn Arab against Arab , Muslim against Muslim , and the Kurds against everyone else , then the invasion and occupation of Iraq was the right thing to do . ”
That was last May , when the Surge was being hailed as the solution to all our problems in Iraq , and it ’s little wonder that this strategy is now being pronounced a failure .
What you have to understand , dear reader , is that , in the Bizarro World alternate universe we seemed to have slipped into , failure is success .
At the end of John McCain ’s Hundred - Year War , when whoever is president declares “ victory ” and hightails it out of Iraq , some subversive soul will remind us of King Pyrrhus ’ lament :
“ Another such victory over the Romans , and we are undone . ”

I ’ve been blogging up a storm over at the new , completely revamped Taki ’s Magazine , where I say all the naughty things they wo n’t let me get away with at Antiwar.com .
At any rate , go check out this one , in particular .
I ’m having major fun with the graphics .
A lot of folks spend a lot of time analyzing blog traffic .
Josh Bancroft wrote a very good article in January about " Site Statistics I Care About as a Blogger " where he talks about the various and sundry statistics that Google Analytics provides and how you should read them .
Ultimately this all comes down to two things :
Do you care who reads your blog ?
and if so
Will you change your behavior given statistics on who reads you blog ?
I used to care deeply about my blog , the way one cares about tending a garden .
I 'd watch it every day and revel in each new visitor .
Now , after almost 6 years of pretty active blogging , I now think more about people than pageviews .
You can't trust a referrer or a trackback .
Rule # 1 of blogging stats :
The only way to know if a human is reading your blog is if they are talking with you .
Given that realization , I look at my stats maybe twice a month , and I 'm most interested in seeing what posts folks really liked that month .
I used to ( maybe 3 years ago ) look at every referrer and stats daily , but then I realized that my personal litmus test for my blog 's success or failure is comments and other folks ' blog posts , and nothing else .
I feel like we 've ( that means me and you , Dear Reader ) have a little community here .
When you comment , I am happy because I feel more connected to the conversation as this blog is my 3rd place .
I blog to be social , not to have a soapbox .
I 'm even happier when the comments are better and more substantive than the post itself .
I would take half the traffic and twice the comments any day .
If you 're a " lurker , " why not join the conversation ?
Anyway , some blogs use their stats as a measuring stick ( to measure all sorts of thing ) and some keep them secret .
I was thinking I should just publish mine occasionally , and perhaps others would do the same .
You can't trust stats , usually , as on never knows how many bots are visiting their site spidering .
I know that Google Analytics and any analytics package worth its salt filters out spiders .
DasBlog , for example , does n't do this , so the statistics you 'll get from DasBlog ( any many other blogging engines ) will be artificially inflated .
The same thing happens if you just run a script over your web server logs looking for HTTP GETs .
Rule # 2 of blogging stats : HTTP GETs do n't equal warm bodies .
I was " tweeting " with Brendan Tomkins of CodeBetter about this and he thought it would foster a sense of openness and give everyone in our tiny slice of the blogosphere an idea of who 's out here .
There 's a little FeedBurner chicklet up there in my blog that shows a ballpark number of how many subscribers I have .
Here 's more on how FeedBurner comes up with that number .
That number goes up and down based from day to day by 10 - 20 % , depending on such mundane things as whether your computer was on to make the request .
I have only had Google Analytics on since March 3rd so I 'm not sure how accurate this data is , but here 's the stats since then .
There seems to have been some kind of ramping up process , so this is about a 2.5 to 3 week ( not a full month ) slice , as I 'm not sure how to count the ramp - up days .
Notice the regular dips ?
Those are weekends .
The peaks ?
Mondays .
Folks love to read on Mondays .
Here 's another rollup :
Rule # 3 of blogging stats : PageViews do n't equal warm bodies .
See the difference between Visits and PageViews ?
You can't take a number like PageViews and correlate that directly to " # of humans " although you 'll see that a lot when folks quote stats .
Rule # 4 of blogging stats :
You have a worldwide audience !
( Hi Sri Lanka ! )
Folks come from all over !
...using lots of different OS's ...
Rule # 5 of blogging stats :
If it can browse , someone will visit you with it .
Not sure what to do with the 2,200 visits by 800x600 people .
I have made an effort to make the site mobile friendly though .
Rule # 6 of blogging stats :
People like what they like
This I thought was really interesting - the number of URLs ( posts / comments URIs ) views vs. number of views , and the top pages for this ~3 week period .
The Programmer Themes Gallery is popular this month , as is the tools list and my Outlook GTD post .
Also , I can see that folks do enjoy the Weekly Source Code , so I know I 'll keep doing that .
I can also see that referrals via search sent 94,850 total visits via 64,239 keywords over this period .
It 's funny , the posts that I like writing , the deep technical stuff , programming languages stuff , it seems like no one cares about .
I think this is the Digg influence .
If you post a Gallery or a List or anything post with a Prime Number and the word " Rules " in the title , you 'll get traffic .
You post smart , compelling content , you need to be wicked smart before folks take note .
That said , here 's rule # 6.5
Rule # 6.5 of blogging stats : Blog for you .
You can certainly use these statistics make decisions on what to blog and only blog things that the largest number of people would like , but " meh . "
Would you really want to do that ?
I continue to blog about Baby Sign Language and Diabetes and I get no traffic for those topics .
Ultimately , I blog for me , and that 's why I keep this blog on my own server where the content is my own .
I also use FeedBurner , which provides RSS - specific and site specific stats , and it sometimes offers differing stats .
This might have to do with how many people browse with Javascript turned off ( gasp ! ) or use an Ad Blocker like IE7 Pro or AdBlock for Firefox .
FeedBurner has an interesting view that breaks down the details of how many folks subscribe in what reader .
Rule # 7 from Mark Twain :
There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics .
Do n't trust any of these values .
If you 've got an engaged audience , they 'll comment , blog , talk , chat , twitter , email and generally engage in the conversation .
All else is poo .
I 've only been using Google Analytics for a few weeks , as you can see , but I think I 'll install Microsoft adCenter 's Analytics Package side - by - side and do some comparisons and see what kinds of stats I can get out out of it .
As Josh so rightly said , and I 'll steal borrow from him , if you ever want to flatter me , just subscribe to my feed ( and leave comments ! )
Well , that 's all I 've got , so Dear Reader , Blog your Stats and let 's learn from each other what works .

Last week , the Mad Money host , responding to a viewer e-mail , emphatically told his viewers not to move their money from the bank , saying , “ If anything , they ’re more likely to be taken over . ”
Speaking to Erin Burnett during his regular Stop Trading !
segment , he defended his call .
Cramer was n’t recommending the common stock , he said .
He was only allaying concerns about Bear ’s liquidity .
“ If you kept your money at Bear , you made out .
You got the liquidity , ” Cramer said , referring to the Fed ’s back up of Bear ’s credit business .
So telling people to keep their money in Bear was " 100 % right .
Everybody got guaranteed by the Fed . "
The common stock was a different story , though .
Once Bear Stearns hit $ 36 on Friday , “ I said the common stock was worthless , ” Cramer said .
“ No one was saying that . ”
The Mad Money host pointed out how “ stupid , reckless and wrong ” it would have been if he ’d told people to pull their money out of Bear Stearns , or any other bank for that matter .
It could have caused a run on Bear , he said , despite the Fed ’s willingness to intervene .
Maybe this all could have been avoided if only the Federal Reserve was willing to buy the huge amount of Fannie Mae paper Bear held , Cramer said .
Once that paper went belly up , so did Bear .
If the central bank bought the $ 200 billion worth he recommended , “ then Bear would have still been alive . ”
As for JPMorgan Chase ’s $ 2 - a - share buyout of Bear , “ it was a great deal , ” Cramer said .
They knew they had “ the Fed over a barrel .
They had all the cards . ”

Energy conservation and gadgetphilia are tough to combine , but this Power Cost Controller power strip might be just the ticket for those looking to monitor -- and potentially cut back on -- their power usage .
The strip 's display counts kilowatt - hour power usage and tracks by hour , week , month , and year .
It also monitors line quality with voltage , line frequency , and power factor readings .
We 're just not sure if we really want to know how much power we 're using , but if you 're ready for the bad news , the strip is $ 99 and available now .
The San Francisco Chronicle is reporting Fannie warns homeowners who walk away .
The country 's two largest sources of mortgage money have a blunt warning for anyone thinking about joining the growing " walkaway " trend , where homeowners stop making payments and months later send the house keys back to their lender :
You will feel the pain .
On March 31 , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) sent out new guidelines to lenders intended for walkaways and other foreclosure situations .
Fannie will now prohibit foreclosed borrowers from getting another mortgage through the giant investor for five years , unless there are " documented extenuating circumstances . "
In those cases , the mortgage prohibition is for three years .
Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , Fannie 's rival , counts foreclosures as major credit blots for seven years , and a senior official said the company is now aggressively pursuing some walkaway borrowers " to preserve our deficiency rights " where permitted under state law .
My Comment
(1) Just because a state permits recourse loans does n't mean it forbids non-recourse loans !
In general , parties to loan transactions are allowed to agree on whatever terms they are able to negotiate .
It 's a freedom - to - contract principle .
(2) However , just because a document is stamped " Non-Recourse " does n't necessarily make it such .
A stamp on a document may be part of its terms , or it may be legally meaningless .
To be sure the loan is truly non-recourse , I would suggest reading the entire document pretty carefully .
The walkaway trend is particularly noteworthy in former housing boom markets - including California , Florida and Nevada - where many homeowners find themselves upside down on their loans , owing tens of thousands more than the current market value of their houses .
If they invested little or nothing in down payments , some owners reason , continuing to make payments - even if they can afford to - may be throwing good money after bad .
My Comment
Robin Stout Migala , consumer outreach manager for Freddie Mac , said in an interview that " there are so many bad reasons for walking away " from a home loan .
Not only are borrowers ' credit standings wrecked - forcing them into excessively high interest rates on any credit they can manage to obtain .
But they also face other potential problems , including federal income tax liabilities .
Federal legislation enacted last year allows homeowners who negotiate loan modifications with lenders and have portions of their principal debt eliminated to escape income tax liability for the amount forgiven .
Walkaway borrowers , by contrast , have nothing forgiven , and the IRS may demand income taxes on the balance they never paid , according to Migala .
My Comment
If part of the forgiven debt does n't qualify for exclusion from income under this provision , is it possible that it may qualify for exclusion under a different provision ?
Yes .
The forgiven debt may qualify under the " insolvency " exclusion .
Normally , a taxpayer is not required to include forgiven debts in income to the extent that the taxpayer is insolvent .
A taxpayer is insolvent when his or her total liabilities exceed his or her total assets .
The forgiven debt may also qualify for exclusion if the debt was discharged in a Title 11 bankruptcy proceeding or if the debt is qualified farm indebtedness or qualified real property business indebtedness .
If you believe you qualify for any of these exceptions , see the instructions for Form 982 .
For borrowers who faced genuine financial hardships leading to foreclosure , underwriters are likely to be more sympathetic a few years down the road .
But if you walk away , here 's the deal :
Do n't expect to get a new home loan - certainly not one with favorable terms - for five to seven years .

California Attorney Chimes In
As a California real estate attorney I can tell you this :
1 ) Mortgage debt , whether its a first or second loan , is nonrecourse if it is " purchase money " , used initially to purchase the property ;
2 ) Mortgage debt that exists due to a refinancing and / or to second loan taken out after purchase is recourse , but -- and its a BIG but -- only if the lender elects to file a lawsuit for judicial foreclosure rather than going through the usual foreclosure process ;
3 ) Suits for judicial foreclosure are in my experience of 28 years extremely rare , due mostly to the fact that any buyer at a judicial foreclosure sale has to give the foreclosed - upon party a full year to redeem the property .
This of course is a complete deal - killer .
An interesting side - note : California 's anti-deficiency law originated during the Depression years , in order to place the burden of properly valuing real property and risk of loss on lenders ( who presumably were more sophisticated and able to assess value ) rather than buyers .
Fast - forward to now , when it turns out that rampant greed prevented lenders from acting rationally in their own self interest .
Now they are paying the price with walk - aways and " jingle mail " .

Myth #

Energy Independence Is Good
On February 1 , 2006 , Prince Turki al - Faisal , Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to Washington , arrived at the White House in a state of agitation .
The night before , in his State of the Union address , President Bush had declared the United States to be “ addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world . ”
He had announced plans to “ break this addiction ” by developing alternatives — including a multibillion - dollar subsidized ramp - up of biofuels — and had boldly stated that by 2025 , America could cut imports from Gulf states by three - quarters and “ make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past . ”
“ I was taken aback , ” Prince Faisal later told cnn , “ and I raised this point with government officials . ”
Two years on , anyone who ’s been to a gas station or a grocery store knows the prince had very little to worry about .
Despite supposedly bold initiatives such as last year ’s Energy Independence and Security Act , America is no freer from foreign oil : Since 2006 , imports have remained steady at about 13 million barrels every day , while the price for each of those barrels has jumped by $ 30 .
And though federal efforts to encourage biofuel production have significantly boosted output , our heavily subsidized ethanol refiners now use so much corn ( closing in on a third of the total crop ) that prices for all grains have soared , sparking inflation here at home and food riots abroad .
Okay , so maybe ethanol ’s critics are right , and turning food into fuel is n’t the smartest way to wean ourselves from imported oil .
But the deeper lesson here is n’t that Washington backed the wrong weapon in the war for energy independence , but that most policymakers — and Americans generally — still think “ energy independence ” is a goal we can , or should , achieve .
Nine in ten voters say the country is too dependent on foreign crude .
Every major presidential hopeful formulated some kind of strategy for energy liberation ( Rudy Giuliani unveiled his at a nascar race ) , and between 2001 and 2006 the number of media references to “ energy independence ” jumped by a factor of eight .
And on the surface , the argument seems solid .
Imported oil , some 60 percent of the oil we use , exposes our economy and politics to stresses halfway around the world ( bin Laden calls it “ the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community ” ) .
It also increases our already massive trade imbalance , which must be corrected by ever - greater federal borrowing , and funnels tens of billions of dollars to the likes of Saudi Arabia , Russia , and Venezuela — countries that are unfriendly and , in some cases , actively anti-American .
What ’s not to like about energy independence ?
In a word , everything .
Despite its immense appeal , energy independence is a nonstarter — a populist charade masquerading as energy strategy that ’s no more likely to succeed ( and could be even more damaging ) than it was when Nixon declared war on foreign oil in the 1970s .
Not only have we no realistic substitute for the oceans of oil we import , but many of the crash programs being touted as a way to quickly develop oil replacements — ” clean coal , ” for example , or biofuels — come at a substantial environmental and political cost .
And even if we had good alternatives ready to deploy — a fleet of superefficient cars , say , or refineries churning out gobs of cheap hydrogen for fuel cells — we ’d need decades , and great volumes of energy , including oil , to replace all the cars , pipelines , refineries , and other bits of the old oil infrastructure — and thus decades in which we ’d depend on oil from our friends in Riyadh , Moscow , and Caracas .
Paradoxically , to build the energy economy that we want , we ’re going to lean heavily on the energy economy that we have .
None of which is exactly news .
Thoughtful observers have been trying to debunk energy independence since Nixon ’s time .
And yet the dream refuses to die , in no small part because it offers political cover for a whole range of controversial initiatives .
Ethanol refiners wave the banner of independence as they lobby Congress for massive subsidies .
Likewise for electric utilities and coal producers as they push for clean coal and a nuclear renaissance .
And it should n’t surprise that some of the loudest proponents of energy liberation support plans to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other off - limits areas to oil drilling — despite the fact that such moves would , at best , cut imports by a few percentage points .
In the doublespeak of today ’s energy lexicon , says Julia Bovey of the Natural Resources Defense Council , “ ‘ energy independence ’ has become code for ‘ drill it all . ' ”
Yet it is n’t only the hacks for old energy and Archer Daniels Midland who are to blame .
Some proponents of good alternatives like solar and wind have also harped on fears of foreign oil to advance their own sectors — even though many of these technologies are decades away from being meaningful oil replacements .
Put another way , the “ debate ” over energy independence is not only disingenuous , it ’s also a major distraction from the much more crucial question — namely , how we ’re going to build a secure and sustainable energy system .
Because what America should be striving for is n’t energy independence , but energy security — that is , access to energy sources that are reliable and reasonably affordable , that can be deployed quickly and easily , yet are also safe and politically and environmentally sustainable .
And let ’s not sugarcoat it .
Achieving real , lasting energy security is going to be extraordinarily hard , not only because of the scale of the endeavor , but because many of our assumptions about energy — about the speed with which new technologies can be rolled out , for example , or the role of markets — are woefully exaggerated .
High oil prices alone wo n’t cure this ill :
We ’re burning more oil now than we were when crude sold for $ 25 a barrel .
Nor will Silicon Valley utopian­ism :
Thus far , most of the venture capital and innovation is flowing into status quo technologies such as biofuels .
And while Americans have a proud history of inventing ourselves out of trouble , today ’s energy challenge is fundamentally different .
Nearly every major energy innovation of the last century — from our cars to transmission lines — was itself built with cheap energy .
By contrast , the next energy system will have to contend with larger populations and be constructed using far fewer resources and more expensive energy .
So it ’s hardly surprising that policymakers shy away from energy security and opt instead for the soothing platitudes of energy independence .
But here ’s the rub :
We do n’t have a choice .
Energy security is nonnegotiable , a precondition for all security , like water or food or defense .
Without it , we have no economy , no progress , no future .
And to get it , we ’ll not only have to abandon the chimera of independence once and for all , but become the very thing that many of us have been taught to dread — unrepentant energy globalists .
Myth #
2
Ethanol Will Set Us Free
What ’s wrong with energy independence ?
Let ’s start with the sheer physical enormity of replacing imports .
Even if we limit the discussion to oil ( and America buys boatloads of foreign natural gas , electricity , and even coal ) , the job is far more daunting than many liberationists — or environmentalists — want to believe .
If we distilled our entire corn crop into ethanol , the fuel produced would displace less than a sixth of the gasoline we currently guzzle , and other candidates , like hydrogen , are even more marginal .
The challenge is n’t simply quantity , but quality .
Oil dominates the energy economy , and especially the transportation sector ( which is 95 percent dependent on crude ) , in part because no other fuel offers the same combination of massive energy density and ease of handling .
As author Richard Heinberg has observed , enough energy is contained in a single gallon of gasoline to replace 240 hours of human labor — considerably more than oil ’s likely rivals .
And because oil is relatively easy to produce , the energy “ investment ” needed to exploit that massive energy content is small .
On average , an oil company burns the energy equivalent of 1 gallon of oil to produce 20 gallons of oil .
In other words , oil ’s energy return on energy invested is quite high .
By contrast , the return for oil ’s declared alternatives is quite low .
For example , hydrogen , once considered a natural successor to oil , is so tricky to refine and handle that , by one study , a gallon of hydrogen contains nearly 25 percent less energy than was consumed producing it .
As for ethanol ’s energy return , scientists are debating whether it ’s slightly positive or altogether negative .
Oil ’s qualities were unbeatable when it cost $ 25 a barrel , and even at $ 100 , it still has a critical advantage .
Because it was generated ages ago and left for us in deep underground reservoirs , oil exists more or less in a state of economic isolation ; that is , oil can be produced — pumped from the ground and refined — without directly impinging on other pieces of the world economy .
By contrast , many of oil ’s competitors are intimately linked to that larger economy , in the sense that to make more of an alternative ( ethanol , say ) is to have less of something else ( food , sustainably arable land ) .
Granted , oil ’s advantages will ultimately prove illusory due to its huge environmental costs and finite supply .
But oil ’s decline wo n’t , by itself , make alternatives any less problematic .
Higher oil prices do encourage alternatives to expand , but in a world of finite resources , these expansions can come at substantial cost .
Because good U.S. farmland is already scarce , every additional acre of corn for ethanol is an acre unavailable for soybeans , or wheat , whose prices then also rise — a ripple effect that affects meat , milk , soft drinks … .
And for the record , to make enough corn ethanol to replace all our gasoline , we ’d need to plant 71 percent of our farmland with fuel crops .
To be fair , ethanol can be produced in a way that is less disruptive to the food economy .
Cellulosic ethanol , for example , is made from wood chips , crop detritus , and other organic waste .
And in Brazil they make ethanol from sugarcane — a process a third as energy intensive as corn ethanol ’s .
But cellulosic ethanol , though quite promising , is not yet commercial , while Brazilian ethanol is , well , Brazilian :
It ’s effectively barred from our market by a 54 cents per gallon tariff , which U.S. lawmakers defend on the grounds of energy independence , but which coincidently leaves corn ethanol , with its massive federal subsidy , as pretty much the only game in town .
So much corn is now going to biofuel that the food and energy markets are effectively linked , an unprecedented coupling that not only disrupts global food security but also undermines corn ethanol ’s usefulness as an oil replacement .
The ripple effect of energy alternatives is n’t confined to the economic sphere .
As eager farmers have expanded their corn crops ( U.S. farmers planted more acres in 2007 than anytime since World War II ) , they ’ve tilled land not suited for intensive agriculture , exacerbating erosion and other environmental problems .
Corn is also the most chemically intensive commercial grain crop ; runoff attributable to the ethanol boom is causing oceanic dead zones and pesticide - laden groundwater .
Ethanol is an easy target , but the sad truth is that all of the ballyhooed alternatives carry at least some environmental or other external costs .
Wind requires vast amounts of land ; solar - cell manufacturing is chemically intensive .
Nuclear energy is steeped in safety and security concerns .
And although the United States could fuel its entire car fleet with a synthetic gasoline made from abundant coal , syngas is even more ecologically challenged than oil .
Industry likes to trumpet potential technologies to capture and sequester coal ’s carbon dioxide , but the federal government has cut research funding .
And as Severin Borenstein , an economist at the University of California - Berkeley , points out , even if we do find climate - friendly ways to turn coal into fuel , that ’s only one end of the process : “ We ’re still going to be burning that fuel in cars and thus releasing all that CO 2 out the tailpipe . ”
Such problems drive home a critical flaw in the paradigm of energy independence — namely , that energy is n’t a zero - sum game anymore .
We can no longer look at the energy economy as a constellation of discrete sectors that can be manipulated separately ; everything is tied together , which means that fixing a problem in one part of the system all but invariably creates a new problem , or a whole series of problems , somewhere else .

Conservation
Is a “ Personal Virtue ”
By now it should be clear not only that energy independence is prohibitively costly , but that the saner objective — energy security — wo n’t be met through some frantic search for a fuel to replace oil , but by finding ways to do without liquid fuel , most probably through massive increases in energy efficiency .
This is n’t a popular idea with Dick Cheney , who before 9/11 famously said that “ conservation may be a sign of personal virtue , but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound , comprehensive energy policy . ”
Nor among traditional energy players , who desperately want to find something to sell us if oil becomes untenable — and do n’t really care if that something is hydrogen or ethanol or pig manure .
But for the rest of us , the logic of conservation is pretty hard to argue with .
Better energy efficiency is one of the fastest ways to reduce not only energy use , but pollution and greenhouse gas emissions :
According to a new study by McKinsey & Company , if the United States aggressively adopted more efficient cars , factories , homes , and other infrastructure , our CO 2 emissions could be 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 .
And saving energy is almost always cheaper than making it :
There is far more oil to be “ found ” in Detroit by designing more fuel - efficient cars than could ever be pumped out of anwr .
And because transportation is the biggest user of oil — accounting for 7 of every 10 barrels we burn — any significant reduction in the sector ’s appetite has massive ramifications .
Even the relatively unambitious 2007 energy bill , which raises fuel - economy standards from 25 mpg to 35 mpg by 2020 , would save 3.6 million barrels a day by 2030 .
And if we persuaded carmakers to switch to plug - in hybrids , we could cut our oil demand by a staggering 9 million barrels a day , about 70 percent of our current imports .
Such a shift would impose massive new demand on an electric grid already struggling to meet need , but plug - in hybrids actually stretch the grid ’s existing capacity .
Charged up at night , when power demand ( and thus prices ) are low , plug - in hybrids exploit the grid ’s large volume of unused ( and , until now , unusable ) capacity .
Such “ load balancing ” would let power companies run their plants around the clock ( vastly more cost - effective than idling plants at night and revving them up at dawn ) ; as important , it would substantially boost the grid ’s overall output .
According to the Department of Energy , with such load balancing , America ’s existing power system could meet current power demands and generate enough additional electricity to run almost three - quarters of its car and light - truck fleet .
That alone would be enough to drop oil consumption by 6.5 million barrels a day , or nearly a third of America ’s current demand .
Granted , this switch to electric - powered cars would n’t be free .
Seventy percent of America ’s electricity is made from high - carbon fuels like natural gas and especially coal , which is why the power sector emits 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions .
Just 8.4 percent comes from renewable sources , and most of that is environmentally dubious hydroelectric ; wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass together supply 2.4 percent , and despite rapid growth , their share of the power market will remain small for decades .
Even so , an electric or plug - in hybrid fleet is still probably the most environmentally plausible path away from oil .
Why ?
Because kilowatt for kilowatt , turning fossil fuels into electricity in massive centralized power plants and then putting that juice into car batteries is more efficient than burning fossil fuels directly in internal combustion engines , and thus generates fewer CO 2 emissions per mile traveled .
( Our existing fleet generates a third of America ’s CO 2 emissions . )
The doe found that replacing three - quarters of the U.S. fleet with plug - in hybrids would cut vehicle CO 2 emissions by 27 percent nationwide — 40 percent or more if the country ’s power system were upgraded to match California ’s low - carbon grid .
And once the new fleet is in place , there is nothing stopping us from upgrading our power sources to truly renewable systems .

We Can Go It Alone
Given America ’s reliance on imported oil , it seems safe to assume that if we succeeded in getting such dramatic reductions , whatever sacrifices we ’d made would be more than compensated for by our new immunity to the nastiness of world oil markets .
Let Saudi Arabia cut its production .
Let Hugo Chávez sell his oil to China .
Such maneuvers no longer matter to Fortress America .
And yet , no country can really hope to improve its energy security by acting alone .
True , cutting our own oil use would bring great things here at home , everything from cleaner air and water to lower noise pollution .
But we ’d be surprised by how little our domestic reductions changed the rest of the world — or improved our overall energy security .
The first problem , once again , is the small - planet nature of energy .
America may be the biggest user of oil , but the price we pay is determined by global demand , and demand is being driven largely by booming Asia , which is only too happy to burn any barrel we manage to conserve or replace .
Second , any shift to alternatives or better efficiency will take years and perhaps decades to implement .
The U.S. car fleet , for example , turns over at a rate of just eight percent a year .
That ’s as fast as consumers can afford to buy new cars and manufacturers can afford to make them , which means that — even in a fantasy scenario where the cars were already designed , the factories retooled , and the workers retrained — it would still take 12 years to deploy a greener fleet .
Most forecasts fail to acknowledge how slowly such changes could actually occur .
Sure , if the United States could cut its oil consumption overnight by 9 million barrels , or 6.5 million barrels , or even 3.6 million barrels , it would have a staggering impact on oil prices .
But barring a global depression , demand wo n’t ever drop so rapidly ; instead , our demand reductions will be incremental and thus effectively canceled out by the expected demand growth in other , less efficiency - minded countries like China .
Berkeley ’s Borenstein , for example , estimates that the 3.6 million barrels the United States would save by 2030 under the 2007 energy bill will be more than offset by growth in demand elsewhere .
Put another way , we could all squeeze into smaller cars and still be paying $ 4 for a gallon of gasoline .
To be sure , energy security is n’t defined solely by cheap energy , and in fact , a great many enviros and energy wonks like oil at $ 100 a barrel , as it seems to be the only thing keeping more of us from buying Hummers .
But high prices are killing our other energy - security objectives .
High prices mean that money is still flowing into rogue states .
High oil prices also imply tight oil markets , prone to massive price swings that are painful for consumers and make it virtually impossible for companies and governments to forecast their future energy costs — and so correctly gauge how much to invest in next - generation energy technologies .
And no matter how clean and carbon free the United States becomes , if China and India are still burning massive volumes of oil we have n’t done much to improve long - term security of any kind .
The only way to achieve real energy security is to reengineer not just our energy economy but that of the entire world .
Oil prices wo n’t fall , evil regimes wo n’t be bankrupt , and sustainability wo n’t be possible — until global oil demand is slowed .
And outside of an economic meltdown , the only way it can be is if the tools we deploy to improve our own security can be somehow exported to other countries , and especially developing countries .
Energy globalism does n’t mean that every new energy gadget or fuel we invent has to work in Beijing or Burkina Faso .
It does , however , suggest that our current energy strategy , tailored primarily to our own markets and our own technical capabilities , will be next to useless in an energy economy that is increasingly global — and that at least some of our energy investments should be compatible with regions where natural resources are strained , governments are poor , and consumers do n’t have access to home - equity lines of credit .
Myth #

Some Geek in Silicon Valley Will Fix the Problem
So , what kinds of technologies would qualify under this more global strategy ?
Although corn and even cane ethanol are dubious — arable land in most of the developing world is already far too scarce — cellulosic ethanol has definite potential .
Plug - in hybrids are probably too expensive for most Third World consumers , but have possibilities in the megacities of Asia and Latin America .
In the near term , however , the most practical energy export will be efficiency .
China is so woefully inefficient that its economy uses 4.5 times as much energy as the United States for every dollar of output .
This disparity explains why China is the world ’s second - biggest energy guzzler , but also why selling China more efficient technologies — cars , to be sure , but also better designs for houses , buildings , and industrial processes — could have a huge impact on global energy use and emissions .
As a bonus , such exports would likely be highly profitable .
Japan , whose economy is nine times as energy efficient as China ’s , sees enormous economic and diplomatic opportunities selling its expertise to the Chinese , and America could tap into those opportunities as well — provided technologies with export potential get the kind of R&D support they need .
Yet this is n’t assured .
You may have read that the volume of venture capital flowing into energy - technology companies is at a record high .
But much of this capital is flowing into known technologies with rapid and assured payoffs — such as corn ethanol — instead of more speculative , but potentially more useful , technologies like cellulosic ethanol .
Once upon a time , America compensated for investor reluctance with gobs of federal money .
But though President Bush routinely promises to spend more on alternative energy , little new money has appeared ; federal spending on solar research , for example , is well short of that in the Clinton years , and the $ 148 million Bush pledged for solar back in 2006 was , in inflation - adjusted terms , less than half of what we spent annually in the 1970s .
Other technologies suffer as well .
Senator Richard Lugar , an Indiana Republican who has long argued for a global approach to energy security , notes that despite Bush ’s stated support for cellulosic ethanol , the Energy Department ’s “ glacial implementation ” of R&D loan guarantees has turned off potential investors .
“ The project is moving forward , ” Lugar says , “ but critical time was lost . ”
Myth #6
Cut Demand and the Rest Will Follow
Given America ’s tectonic pace toward energy security , the time has come for tough love .
Most credible proposals call for some kind of energy or carbon tax .
Such a tax would have two critical effects .
It would keep the cost of oil high and thus discourage demand , as it has in Europe , and it would generate substantial revenues that could be used to fund research into alternatives , for example , or tax credits and other incentives to invest in the new energy technologies .
To be sure , higher fuel taxes , never popular with voters , would be even less so with gasoline prices already so high .
Indeed , many energy wonks are still bitter that President Bush did n’t advocate for a fuel tax or other demand - reduction measures in the aftermath of 9/11 , when oil prices were relatively low and Americans were in the mood for sacrifice .
Bush “ could have gotten any set of energy measures passed after 9/11 if he had had an open and honest dialogue with America about how bad things were , ” says Edward Morse , an energy market analyst and former State Department energy official .
Instead , Bush urged Americans to …go shopping .
Seven years later , with oil prices soaring and the economy hurting , swaying the electorate will take a politician who is politically courageous , extraordinarily articulate — and willing to dispense with the sweet nothings of energy independence .
And higher energy taxes are just the first dose of bitter medicine America needs to swallow if it wants real energy security .
For no matter how aggressively the United States cuts oil demand both at home and abroad , it will be years and perhaps decades before any meaningful decline .
The 12 - year fleet - replacement scenario outlined above , for example , assumes that efficient new cars are being mass - produced worldwide and that adequate new volumes of electricity can be brought online as the fleet expands — assumptions that at present are wildly invalid .
A more reasonable timetable is probably on the order of 20 years .
During this transition away from oil , we will still need lots and lots ( and lots ) of oil to fuel what remains of the oil - burning fleet .
If over those 20 years global oil demand were to fall from the current 86 million barrels a day to , say , 40 million barrels a day , we ’d still need an average of 63 million barrels a day , for a total of 459 billion barrels , or almost half as much oil as we ’ve used since the dawn of humankind .
And here we come to two key points .
First , because the transition will require so much old energy , we may get only one chance :
If we find ourselves in 2028 having backed the wrong clusters of technologies or policies , and are still too dependent on oil , there may not be enough crude left in the ground to fuel a second try .
Second , even if we do back the right technologies , the United States and the world ’s other big importers will still need far too much oil to avoid dealing with countries like Iran , Saudi Arabia , and Russia — no matter how abhorrent we find their politics .
In one of the many paradoxes of the new energy order , more energy security means less energy independence .
Myth #

Once Bush Is Gone , Change Will Come
No presidential candidate has indi­cated he or she will raise energy taxes or sit down in oil talks with Tehran .
All have ties to a self - interested energy sector , be it coal , ethanol , or nukes .
And even after the election , energy security is so complex and requires such hard choices that any president , and most members of Congress , will be sorely tempted to skirt the issue in the tried and true manner , by pushing for a far more palatable “ energy independence . ”
As Senator Lugar so choicely put it , “ The president will have advisers who will be whispering cautions about the risks of committing the prestige of any administration to aggressive energy goals .
Those advisers will say with some credibility that a president can appear forward - looking on energy with a few carefully chosen initiatives and occasional optimistic rhetoric promoting alternative sources .
They will say that the voting public ’s overwhelming energy concern is high prices for gasoline and home heating , and that as long as the president appears attentive to those concerns they can cover their political bases without asking for sacrifices or risking the possible failure of a more controversial energy policy . ”
Lugar , a veteran pol , is no doubt correct about the pressures the next president will face .
What we can only hope is that by the time he or she is chosen , the signals from an overheating energy economy will have reached a point where platitudes no longer suffice — where it is possible to embark on a “ controversial energy policy , ” to ask voters to make sacrifices , and above all , to push America , the champion of globalization , out of a posture of self - absorption and into a stance that is genuinely and sustainably global — at which point the Saudi ambassador really would have something to worry about .
House Intel Chair : Telecom immunity deal ' very close '
Associated Press
Published : Sunday March 2 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The House Intelligence Committee chairman expects a compromise soon on renewal of an eavesdropping law that could provide legal protections for telecommunications companies as President Bush has insisted .
Rep. Silvestre Reyes , in a television interview broadcast Sunday , did not specifically say whether the House proposal would mirror the Senate 's version .
The Senate measure provides retroactive legal immunity to the companies that helped the government wiretap U.S. computer and phone lines after the Sept. 11 attacks without clearance from a secret court .
Bush wants the House to agree to the Senate bill .
Reyes , D - Texas , said he was open to that possibility after receiving documents from the Bush administration and speaking to the companies about the industry 's role in the government spy program .
" We are talking to the representatives from the communications companies because if we 're going to give them blanket immunity , we want to know and we want to understand what it is that we 're giving immunity for , " he said .
" I have an open mind about that . "
Regarding a compromise deal , Reyes said : " We think we 're very close , probably within the next week we 'll be able to hopefully bring it to a vote . "
Rep. Roy Blunt , the second - ranking Republican in the House , said Sunday he was not " quite that optimistic yet . "
" I am committed to the idea that we have to work this out , " said Blunt , R - Mo .
" It 's easy to solve this problem if the Democrats decide they want to solve it .
The Senate proved it was easy and enough Democrats in the House believe it 's easy that it 's just up to the leaders to do this . "
The eavesdropping law makes it easier for the government to spy on foreign phone calls and e-mails that pass through the United States .
The law expired Feb. 16 after Congress did not quickly renew it .
Bush opposed a temporary extension and has warned that failure to renew the law would put the nation at greater risk .
But House Democrats worried the legal protections would erode civil liberties protections and accused Bush of fear - mongering .
A quirk in the temporary eavesdropping law adopted by Congress last August allows the government to initiate wiretaps for up to one year against a wide range of targets .
Reyes , whose interview was taped Friday , appeared on CNN's " Late Edition , " as did Blunt .
This video is from CNN's Late Edition , broadcast March 2 , 2008 .
( with wire reports )
The crew of the Spanish - owned Playa de Bakio must have felt they were safe .
Fishing for tuna more than 200 nautical miles off Somalia 's coast last weekend , they were surely out of the pirates ' range .
But they had not reckoned with the ' mother ship ' lurking nearby .
A hijacked trawler was now the pirates ' base ; it was towing their high - powered speedboat .
The Playa , with 26 crew , was easy pickings for an experienced militia armed with AK - 47s and rocket - propelled grenades .
For the second time in a fortnight Somali pirates had captured a European - registered and crewed ship , the most lucrative prize .
The French luxury yacht Le Ponant , hijacked on 5 April with 30 crew on board , netted a $ 2 m ( £ 1 m ) ransom , despite the close attention of France 's military .
Last night the Playa and its crew were safely heading for home waters , escorted by a Spanish frigate after negotiations between the pirates and the Spanish government , which refused to say whether an equally lucrative ransom had been paid .
Vice - President María Teresa Fernández de la Vega said the release had been achieved through ' co- operation and diplomacy ' between Spain , the ship 's owners and representatives of the hijackers .
The hijackings are confirmation , if any were needed , that the waters off Somalia are the most dangerous in the world .
Last year , there were 31 attacks there , making the notorious bandits operating in the South China Sea and Malacca Straits look almost lazy by comparison .
So far this year there have been 23 attacks by Somali pirates , including the 47 - day hijacking of a new , British - captained icebreaker tug , the Svitzer Korsakov , on its way from Europe through the Gulf of Aden towards the gas fields in far eastern Russia .
The ransom paid for its release was reported to be $ 1.6 m .
It is not only the frequency of the attacks off Somalia that has maritime experts deeply worried .
It is the skill and daring of the pirates , some of whom call themselves ' marines ' and claim to be protecting the country 's maritime resources from foreign exploitation .
Until five years ago , captains were advised to stay at least 50 miles away from Somalia 's coastline .
A spate of hijackings led to a doubling of the safety zone .
Now , the recommended safe distance is 200 miles , but the Playa attack shows even that is no guarantee of safety .
With the large ransoms allowing the pirates to buy faster boats , and more sophisticated GPS systems , they can strike even in rough waters several hundred miles out to sea .
The surge in attacks coincides with the worst unrest in Somalia since the early Nineties - the last time the country had a functioning government .
Insurgents are battling Ethiopian troops who toppled an Islamist authority from power in December 2006 .
More than half the population of Mogadishu has since fled the city .
The Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) of President Abdullahi Yusuf , which is packed with former warlords , exercises little authority and claims to be unable to stop the piracy .
But it is perhaps telling that during the six - month reign of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts over much of south and central Somalia in 2006 , attacks on passing ships all but stopped .
Andrew Mwangura , head of the Mombasa - based Seafarers ' Assistance Programme , and one of the foremost experts on Somali piracy , says there are five main pirate groups operating , sometimes together .
' Most of them are linked to warlords , ' he said .
' And the warlords are linked to the TFG , all the way to the top . '
Monitoring Somalia 's 1,880 - mile coastline , the longest in Africa , is no simple task .
For several years a joint US - European naval unit has patrolled the region , which is on the trade route between the Mediterranean , east Africa and Asia , in an attempt to discourage attacks and keep an eye out for terrorists .
But the bandits simply shifted their bases north to the semi-autonomous Puntland region .
One - off military operations , such as the raid in Somalia 's desert by French special forces to arrest six of the pirates who had attacked Le Ponant , are ineffective deterrents , say experts .
Piracy is simply too profitable .
A gunman on a pirate ship typically earns between $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 for a year 's work - a fortune in Somalia .
Those bankrolling the attacks from bases in the United Arab Emirates or Kenya , and sometimes as far afield as Canada , London or Hong Kong , can net several million dollars from a single strike , depending on the nationality of the shipowner , the origins and gender of the crew , the cargo and the age of the boat .
' Once the pirates ' bosses have the ship 's name they immediately use the internet to research how much money they can make , ' said Mwangura .
' These guys really know what they are doing . '
Most owners pay up quickly , transferring money through a network of accounts in Nairobi , Mombasa and Dubai .
The crews are seldom harmed .
When older , less valuable trawlers - often from Taiwan or China - are captured , the demand is not cash but the temporary use of the boat .
The owners promise not to report their vessel missing , and it becomes a temporary ' mother ship ' .
In the past , pirates have attacked a cruise liner , as well as several cargo ships chartered by the UN World Food Programme containing food aid meant for Somalis .
But as bizarre as it sounds , there is some truth in the pirates ' claim that they are acting as a coastguard .
Under international law , a country 's ' exclusive economic zone ' - where it has sole rights over marine and mineral resources - extends 200 nautical miles out to sea .
Foreign ships are allowed to pass through these waters , but not to fish without a permit .
Yet at any one time there are up to 500 foreign - registered boats fishing in Somalia 's rich waters , according to the Seafarers ' Assistance Programme .
European boats catch tuna or shrimp ; vessels from the Far East catch sharks for their fins .
Almost all are fishing illegally .
Often , pirate attacks are not even reported to maritime authorities : the ransoms paid are regarded as legitimate fines , both by the pirates and the ship - owners .
' One way to stop the piracy is to stop the illegal fishing , ' said Mwangura .
' That way there will be nowhere for the pirates to hide . '
ROME 
In a mood of national pessimism , Italians began voting Sunday in a race between the conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi , seeking a third term as prime minister , and Walter Veltroni , a former mayor of Rome .
The campaign , in a nation that has had more than 60 governments since World War II , has been considered lackluster , with voters skeptical of change no matter who wins at a time of economic trouble and political stagnation .
Some pollsters predicted an especially low turnout , in a nation where turnout is usually high .
The Interior Ministry reported that on the first day of two days of voting , 48.9 percent of eligible Italians cast ballots for the lower house of Parliament , the Chamber of Deputies .
In national elections two years ago , which Mr. Berlusconi lost , the first - day turnout was 52.2 percent .
With economic growth again near zero and crises involving trash and the national airline unresolved , many Italians have said that they want change , but that neither candidate seemed capable of providing it .
Nick Clegg , leader of the Liberal Democrats , has hardly had the easiest of weeks .
It began with the toe - curling revelation in a magazine interview that he had slept with " up to 30 women " .
And it ends with new claims that he may not , in fact , be the real leader of the Lib Dems after all .

According to one authoritative account of the leadership contest last December , Chris Huhne would be Lib Dem chief were it not for hundreds of ballot papers being held up by the Christmas post .
Mr Clegg beat his rival by just 511 votes out of more than 41,000 party members in one of the closest - run races in political history .
Yet as many as 1,300 postal votes arrived after the deadline of 15 December – and an unofficial check of the papers showed that Mr Huhne had enough of a majority among them to hand him victory .
The extraordinary claim could spark demands for a rerun from Mr Huhne 's supporters .
The secret dispute around the result has not surfaced until now because the outcome was not officially challenged by Mr Huhne .
No official count took place and the ballot papers were thrown away .
But the party gossip machine has fired up again after Mr Clegg 's lacklustre first 100 days , culminating in his admission to GQ that he had had sex with " no more than 30 women " – earning him the nickname " Cleggover " .
Ballot papers were sent out to party members on Saturday 17 November , and had to be returned by Saturday 15 December , before the result was announced on Tuesday 18 December .
Thousands decided to leave it late and watch how the contest developed because both men were so closely matched .
A rogue briefing document from the Huhne camp describing his rival as " Calamity Clegg " may have contributed to a late surge for their man .
The ballot closed on Saturday the 15th , but , according to a source , around 1,300 votes came in late on Monday the 17th .
Lib Dem elections chief Lord Rennard , the returning officer for the contest , asked both contenders if they wanted the late votes to be counted .
Mr Huhne indicated maybe they should , but Mr Clegg refused and his rival did not press the issue .
Another insider confirmed the claims , but insisted the " rules were the rules " , adding : " I suppose Chris knows that Nick knows that Chris knows he could be leader . "

MPs were aghast that once again a Lib Dem leadership contest risked being branded a farce .
When told of the details , one Lib Dem MP , referring to the " hanging chads " fiasco of the 2000 US presidential election , said : " Oh God .
They are our very own George Bush and Al Gore .
It was always a mistake to hold it so close to Christmas . "
The deadline for the Christmas post was Thursday 20 December for first - class letters and Monday 17 December for second class .
At the time , Lib Dem blogs were awash with warnings that members ' votes could be delayed by the huge demands on the Royal Mail before Christmas .
Perhaps ironically , Mr Clegg told The Times when asked about another matter yesterday : " I 've always counted myself lucky . "
A spokeswoman for Mr Clegg said yesterday : " The Electoral Commission absolutely firmly have said that none of the late votes were ever counted by anybody .
There was n't an official go - through of late ballot papers .
Late ballot papers were discarded , because they were late and therefore void . "
Mr Huhne could not be contacted for comment .
The Weighted Popular Vote ( WPV ) is very simple .
I take the population of each state in the 2000 census , and multiply it by the percentage of votes each candidate gets in the state ( excluding Michigan and Florida , since they have not yet held a valid vote ) .
This allows us to compensate for the inevitably lower levels of voting in a caucus , since it is held at a particular time and lasts for a lengthy period .
There ’s a big problem with the common measurement of the popular votes , since it disenfranchises the states which held a caucus .
For example , Colorado ( pop. 4.3 million ) with 120,000 caucus voters , counts under the popular votes analysis for less than a third of the value of a much smaller state , Oklahoma ( pop. 3.45 million ) with its 417,000 primary voters .
The weighted popular vote compensates for this .
So here are the results : by the WPV , Obama leads Clinton 110,761,104 to 98,744,197 ( 52.87 % to 47.13 % , a margin of 5.74 percentage points ) .
By contrast , the current popular vote summary has Obama leading Clinton 51.38 % to 48.62 % , a margin of 2.76 percentage points ( often reported as a 49 - 47 lead in most of the media ) .
By the regular popular vote margin , Clinton would need to gain 720,000 votes to catch Obama .
However , if we apply the WPV percentage margins to the number of current votes , Clinton would actually need to win by a margin of 1.49 million votes to equal Obama .
The remaining states ( and Puerto Rico and Guam ) have a total population of 41,252,457 .
Utilizing the WPV , Clinton must win these elections by a total average margin of 64.5 % to 35.5 % .
That means Clinton must win by a margin of 29 percentage points just to equal Obama in the real , weighted popular vote .
Considering that Pennsylvania is a strong state for Clinton , and she is behind in several remaining states , it is likely that even a 40 - point win by Clinton in Pennsylvania would leave her unable to catch up to Obama in the pledged delegates or the weighted popular vote .
In other words , Clinton cannot win .
Of course , the only real measure of victory in the Democratic primary is the number of pledged delegates , not the number of states or the popular vote .
But it is valuable to look at the popular vote , as long as you weight the margin for the caucus states .
This also allows us to test whether Obama ’s lead reflects the oddities of the delegate allocation system ( as happened in Nevada , where Clinton won the popular vote but Obama won more delegates ) .
The WPV shows us that this has n’t happened .
So far among the pledged delegates , Obama has won 52.66 % compared to Clinton ’s 46.56 % .
This delegate victory margin of 6.1 points is roughly the same as the WPV ’s margin of 5.7 points .
Of course , some people might object to the caucus system altogether .
But those were the rules adopted by both parties to allow them , and caucuses have the benefit of helping to build party involvement and reducing the influx of Rush Limbaugh acolytes trying to bring chaos to the Democratic primaries .
If we are going to have caucuses as part of the primary system , then the Weighted Popular Vote is the only fair way to measure the overall national popular vote .

Big Beautiful Wonder Woman
Cartoonist Jamar Nicholas started The Big Beautiful Wonder Woman Blog to share his collection of drawings featuring the zaftig superhero .
He invites artists to share their own vision of queen - sized Wonder Woman , whether that vision is curvaceously cute ( like the drawing by Chrissie Altese on the left ) or covered in cellulite ( as in the drawing on the right by Derrick Fish ) .
Ice Cream People
Brian Butler is conducting A Survey of Ice Cream Entities , and wants your photgraphic or artistic evidence of Ice Cream People .
The intent of this project to get the Ice Cream Person recognized among the greatest of supernatural beings , ( right up there with Bigfoot , Lochness , and UFOs ) .
According to the FAQ , an Ice Cream Person is " a hybrid creature composed of both human and ice cream parts . " 
The hybrid on the left is by Sir Mitchell and the plush on the right was created by Jenny Harada .
Skull a Day
Noah Scalin makes skulls .
He created Skull - A - Day to showcase his artwork , and posted one every day , as you could guess from the title .
The skulls are made from some surprising materials , such as his Googley - Eyed Skull and Sewn Skull .
The reality of making so much art is eventually I burned through all of the materials / ideas at hand and had to reach out to others for help , and really that 's been some of my favorite work .
I was also completely surprised by the community that grew up around the project and the fact that the Braincase ( the submissions section ) , which I had never intended to be a part of what I was doing , turned into such a large part of the project .
Scalin still produces a skull for every day , but posts submitted skulls in addition .
A recent contest invited people to illustrate Mr / Mrs Squarehead Skull .
700 Hoboes
The 700 Hoboes Project was inspired by the book Areas of My Expertise by John Hodgman , in which the author names 700 hoboes ( 800 in the paperback edition ) .
Mark Frauenfelder of Boing Boing suggested that artists illustrate each name , and that 's exactly what happened .
The submissions initially came into a Flickr set , and then a website was created for the project .
There are now 1769 illustrations of hoboes .
Honest Amelia Dirt by Ape Lad ( Adam Koford ) is on the left , and Slow Motion Jones by xandrian is on the right .
Mickey Feio
Mickey Feio ( Ugly Mickey ) is a Brazilian site with depictions of Mickey Mouse that would make Walt Disney turn in his grave .
It began as a showcase for the International Ugly Mickey Contest , but after contest was over , the Mickeys kept coming !
The mouse on the left is by artist Danilo Beyruth , the emo Mickey on the right is by Monike Demikoski .
Che Feio
Ernesto Che Guevara was a very handsome revolutionary in life and an icon in death , but that icon is fodder for parody .
Che Feio ( Ugly Che ) as another Brazilian blog that takes submissions of Che art using massive amounts of artistic license .
In Portuguese .
The works here are by Estenio Arantes ( left ) and Bruno Pagani ( right ) .
Bad Spock Drawings
The idea behind Bad Spock Drawings is stated in the first post by creator Jason Robert Bell , also known as Caveman Robot .
A few weeks ago I was doing my daily hour of " mindless doodling " and this Bad Spock was created , something about it made me laugh , and I realized that there needs to be more Bad Spock drawings !
Not just drawings by me , but all the other artist / free thinkers I know as well , a giant step for illogical thought .
The picture that inspired him is on the left .
Many have contributed , including Kyle Thye , who did the confused Spock on the right .

OCALA , Florida ( Reuters ) - Actor Wesley Snipes , star of the “ Blade ” movie series , was found guilty of three misdemeanors by a U.S. court on Friday for failing to file tax returns for three years .
The actor and two co-defendants had been charged with six counts of failing to file tax returns , two of fraudulently claiming tax refunds and one count of conspiracy to defraud the government .
Snipes could still face up to three years in prison , according to prosecutors .
Using NASA , Japanese , and European X - ray satellites , a team of Japanese astronomers has discovered that our galaxy ’s central black hole let loose a powerful flare three centuries ago .
The finding helps resolve a long - standing mystery : why is the Milky Way ’s black hole so quiescent ?
The black hole , known as Sagittarius A* ( pronounced " A - star " ) , is a certified monster , containing about 4 million times the mass of our Sun .
Yet the energy radiated from its surroundings is billions of times weaker than the radiation emitted from central black holes in other galaxies .
" We have wondered why the Milky Way ’s black hole appears to be a slumbering giant , " says team leader Tatsuya Inui of Kyoto University in Japan .
" But now we realize that the black hole was far more active in the past .
Perhaps it ’s just resting after a major outburst . "
The new study , which will appear in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan , combines results from Japan ’s Suzaku and ASCA X - ray satellites , NASA ’s Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the European Space Agency ’s XMM - Newton X-ray Observatory .
The observations , collected between 1994 and 2005 , revealed that clouds of gas near the central black hole brightened and faded quickly in X - ray light as they responded to X - ray pulses emanating from just outside the black hole .
When gas spirals inward toward the black hole , it heats up to millions of degrees and emits X - rays .
As more and more matter piles up near the black hole , the greater the X - ray output .
These X - ray pulses take 300 years to traverse the distance between the central black hole and a large cloud known as Sagittarius B2 , so the cloud responds to events that occurred 300 years earlier .
When the X - rays reach the cloud , they collide with iron atoms , kicking out electrons that are close to the atomic nucleus .
When electrons from farther out fill in these gaps , the iron atoms emit X - rays .
But after the X - ray pulse passes through , the cloud fades to its normal brightness .
Amazingly , a region in Sagittarius B2 only 10 light - years across varied considerably in brightness in just 5 years .
These brightenings are known as light echoes .
By resolving the X - ray spectral line from iron , Suzaku ’s observations were crucial for eliminating the possibility that subatomic particles caused the light echoes .
" By observing how this cloud lit up and faded over 10 years , we could trace back the black hole ’s activity 300 years ago , " says team member Katsuji Koyama of Kyoto University .
" The black hole was a million times brighter three centuries ago .
It must have unleashed an incredibly powerful flare . "
This new study builds upon research by several groups who pioneered the light - echo technique .
Last year , a team led by Michael Muno , who now works at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , Calif. , used Chandra observations of X - ray light echoes to show that Sagittarius A* generated a powerful burst of X - rays about 50 years ago -- about a dozen years before astronomers had satellites that could detect X - rays from outer space .
" The outburst three centuries ago was 10 times brighter than the one we detected , " says Muno .
The galactic center is about 26,000 light - years from Earth , meaning we see events as they occurred 26,000 years ago .
So , in terms of actual dates , the activity occured about 26,300 years ago ( although the 26,000 light - year distance is only a best estimate ) .
Astronomers still lack a detailed understanding of why Sagittarius A* varies so much in its activity .
One possibility , says Koyama , is that a supernova a few centuries ago plowed up gas and swept it into the black hole , leading to a temporary feeding frenzy that awoke the black hole from its slumber and produced the giant flare .
Launched in 2005 , Suzaku is the fifth in a series of Japanese satellites devoted to studying celestial X - ray sources and is managed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
This mission is a collaborative effort between Japanese universities and institutions and NASA Goddard .
Whatever else you say about last night : do n't blame ABC News :
The journalist ’s job is to make politicians uncomfortable , to explore evasions , contradictions and vulnerabilities ...
We may not like it , but issues like Jeremiah Wright , flag lapels and the Tuzla airport will be important in the fall .
Remember how George H.W. Bush toured flag factories to expose Michael Dukakis .
So Lee Atwater wins by default ?
We are losing a war , we have destroyed our fiscal future , the planet is in distress , we have effectively quit the Geneva Conventions , the economy , propped up by massive public and private debt , is teetering ... and we all have to actually defend the fact that this election will be decided on the basis of closet Muslims , flag lapel pins , and '60s terrorists ?
Brooks actually gives ABC News an " A " for their questions .
The job of debate moderators is to generate an actual discussion about the issues and questions that matter in deciding between two candidates .
They make an editorial choice about what those questions are .
To focus almost exclusively on idiotic process questions based on the lowest form of political debate imaginable is an editorial choice to run a tabloid freak show .
I see no reason to excuse Obama 's bad performance .
But I cannot fathom why we should exonerate the execrable standards of ABC News at the same time .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

BT has been accused of " sneakily " switching millions of customers to a new tariff where they will have to pay up to 2,000 per cent more for their calls .
Nationwide , phone bills are expected to jump by at least £ 300 m as a result of the rises in line rental and weekday calls , which came into force on 1 April .
On 1 February , BT wrote to 10.8 million people on the BT Together 1 package telling them : " At BT , we 're always looking for ways to give you value for money " , and informing them they would , in future , receive free weekend calls on the Unlimited Weekend Plan .

But the small print in a leaflet contained details of above - inflation price rises .
Monthly line rental has increased by 6 per cent to £ 11.75 , while daytime calls are up from 3.25 p a minute to 4 p a minute , a rise of 23 per cent .
A flat rate charge of 4.5 p for evening calls is replaced by a 6 p initial charge then 1.5 p - a- minute , meaning a 60 - minute call that used to cost 4.5 p now costs 96 p .
Customers can obtain free evening calls by signing a 12 - month contract with BT , the country 's biggest telecoms company .
" There will be some consumers who benefit from this , " said Ceri Stanaway , of the consumer group Which ?
" However we think they have sneakily hidden some charges that have affected people , some of whom may not want to sign up to a 12 - month rolling contract . "
The rises follow several surveys in the past year that have criticised BT 's service and suggested call centre staff fail to resolve problems .
In an unpublished press release , BT said 640,000 customers had saved themselves £ 20 m by signing a 12 - month contract since February .
That suggests the 10 million who have not done so will have to pay an extra £ 312 m in charges .
The rise in line rental alone would make BT £ 50 m , according to the price comparison site uSwitch.com .
" Probably we will make more money out of this , " said BT spokesman Michael Jarvis .
" But these things are always a balance between a giveaway on one hand and revenue on the other . "
He added : " Call charges are incredibly cheap .
This is one where a do - nothing , apathetic approach is probably going to cost you money . "
One customer complained : " There 's just a line that says 'we 're making other important changes too ' , referring you to the small print leaflet .
" And even there , it 's not exactly spelt out – even knowing what I was looking for this time round . "
The amount of hatred one can earn simply by speaking one ’s mind and doing one ’s job never fails to astonish me .
All the more remarkable is how the people who hate so viciously are the very ones you ’d expect to be tolerant , or at least quietly begrudging — people whose ancestors , both familial and ideological , were themselves the targets of bigotry in generations past , when different powers were the oppressors .
Yet today , even in a country which prides itself on a long list of freedoms , speaking the plain , factual truth of the world is a sure way to win oneself ire , derision and abuse .
Both history and current events teach us that forces of prejudice and inequity oppose the dissemination of truth to certain sectors of society .
As recently as 2006 , the Afghan schoolteacher Mohammed Halim was drawn and quartered by motorbikes , the remains of his body put on display so that others would think twice before defying Taliban law and committing the unforgivable crime of teaching female children .
I doubt the Taliban thugs who beat the algebra teachers of Ghazni have any particular animosity towards the mathematics ; given a moment ’s reflection , they might wholeheartedly support the math lessons necessary to train engineers who then build weapons to be used against the United States .
The crime in their eyes , I ’d wager , is not the material , but the audience .
In the country where I grew up and am writing now , the story is a little different : most of the time , hatred against educators does not escalate to physical violence , although threats of violence are common enough , and most of the time , the factor provoking abuse is not the audience , but the lesson itself .
The plain truth I ’m talking about is the biological principle of evolution .
The single most powerful idea in biology , this discovery has withstood decades of criticism to emerge triumphant as one of the most well - checked propositions in human history .
Learn about evolution , and you can go to work on diseases , or help find out where species both living and extinct fit into the family tree of life .
You can understand the living world , and help preserve human life within it .
Open your mouth about evolution around the wrong people , though , and you can find yourself harassed , ejected from your job and even beaten in the street .
Just ask these people .
Steve Bitterman was an instructor who taught the Western Civilization course at Southwestern Community College in Red Oak , Iowa .
In 2007 , at the age of sixty , he was fired because he did not teach the story of Adam and Eve as literal truth .
( How many faithful Christians there are in this country who see that story as an allegory , and a powerful , meaningful one , of the loss of innocence ! )
“ I just thought there was such a thing as academic freedom here , ” he said afterward .
“ From my point of view , what theyâ€™re doing is essentially teaching their students very well to function in the eighth century . ”
Alex Bolyanatz was an assistant professor of anthropology at Wheaton College , a Protestant liberal - arts college in Illinois .
He had been popular with both students and his fellow teachers , but in the spring of 2000 , he received a letter from his provost issuing a stern rebuke : “ During your term at Wheaton College , ” Stanton Jones wrote , “ you have failed to develop the necessary basic competence in the integration of Faith and Learning , particularly in the classroom setting . ”
Jones castigated Bolyanatz for not treating creationism with respect and instead teaching evolution as the plain , scientific truth .
Bolyanatz had repeatedly made the point that evolution did not conflict with his own religious faith , but claiming that “ The evolutionary model does not discount faith ” was not enough to save his job .
His experience parallels that of Howard J. Van Till , who taught physics at Calvin College in Michigan .
When Van Till made the modest claims that evolution had been scientifically proven and that Biblical texts were influenced by the cultures in which they ’d been written , angry community members pressured Calvin College ’s Board of Trustees into forming an investigative committee , which subjected Van Till to four years of inquiry .
He was , eventually , cleared , but not until the committee had performed , he said , “ a test of the entirety of my theological position . ”
Likewise , Richard Colling graduated from Olivet Nazarene University and taught there for twenty - seven years .
A man of strong religious convictions , he argued that one could believe in the Christian God and still accept the scientific truth of evolution .
In 2004 , he published a book about this belief , and for his pains , he was barred from teaching general biology or having his book used in the school .
Colling had been granted tenure , so that at least his job and paycheck were secure , even though the ejection from the community he loved brought him significant anguish .
Nancey Murphy of Fuller Theological Seminary did not have that shield , and so when her negative review of Phillip Johnson ’s Darwin on Trial aroused Johnson ’s ire , she had to fight for her job .
Johnson , a lawyer who was one of the instigators in rebranding creationism as “ Intelligent Design , ” has never displayed a grasp of basic biological facts , but that did n’t stop him from calling up a Fuller trustee and starting a campaign to get Nancey Murphy fired .
Gwen Pearson taught biology at the Permian Basin branch of the University of Texas , located in the city of Odessa .
Her three years as an assistant professor ended with assaults on her integrity and her physical self :
This all became a great deal more serious when I began to get messages on my home answering machine threatening to assist me in reaching hell , where I would surely end up .
I also received threatening mail messages : “ The Bible tells us how to deal with nonbelievers : ‘ Bring those who would not have me to reign over them , and slay them before me . ’
May Christians have the strength to slaughter you and end your pitiful , blasphemous life ! ”
An envelope containing student evaluations from my evolution class was tampered with .
A student wrote a letter to the president of the university claiming that I said in class that “ anyone who believes in God gets an F . ”
Despite the fact that she had never been in my class , and it was clearly untrue , a full investigation of the charge ensued .
There were other problems .
Often I arrived in class to find “ Dr. Feminazi ” scrawled on the blackboard .
An emotionally disturbed student assaulted me on campus .
In town , Maurice Sendak ’s award - winning book Where the Wild Things Are was removed from school libraries , as it might “ confuse children as to the true nature of Beelzebub . ”
The California - based Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) preached in the county stadium to 10,000 local people .
I finally resigned when I received an admonition from the dean in my yearly reappointment letter to “ accommodate the more intellectually conservative students with a low threshold of offensibility ” in my evolution course .
Rather than compromise my academic freedom , I chose to leave what seemed to be a dangerous place .
Pearson was faced with an intolerable situation — people who had seemingly never contemplated the nobility of forgiveness — and left of her own volition , but Chris Comer was not so lucky .
A dedicated employee of the Texas Education Agency , Comer was serving as Director of Science when she forwarded a brief e-mail message mentioning that the philosopher Barbara Forrest would be giving a talk at an Austin public events center .
Forrest and her colleague Paul Gross are authors of Creationism ’s Trojan Horse , a book which details how creationism has masqueraded as serious science in order to slip particular religious beliefs into the public schools .
For sending a brief “ FYI , ” Comer was forced to resign .
Paul Mirecki was professor of religious studies and department chair at the University of Kansas .
He planned to teach a class called “ Special Topics in Religion : Intelligent Design , Creationism and other Religious Mythologies , ” but canceled those plans after events took an unfortunate turn .
He had displayed an acerbic tongue in online discussion forums , and on further reflection apologized for his less temperate remarks , concluding that the class was better taught at another time ; that apology and change of plan did not prevent two men from beating him in the street one December morning , for the crimethink of having proposed the class in the first place .
Sympathy for a physically assaulted human being did not stay the KU administration , who forced him to step down as department chair .
The real occurrence of violence gives death threats a certain cachet of intimidating force .
Eric Pianka , a biologist at UT Austin , gave a speech before the Texas Academy of Science , which was presenting him with a distinguished - service award .
In his speech , he articulated his fears that overpopulation will lead to a disaster for the human species .
The story then took a twist which a fiction writer would be hard - pressed to surpass : a creationist named Forrest Mims claimed that Pianka advocated releasing the Ebola virus to eliminate 90 % of the world ’s population .
Other creationists , like William Dembski , soon picked up the story , leading to online hysteria .
Within days , Pianka himself and others in the Texas Academy of Science received death threats .
“ I do n’t bear any ill will towards anybody , ” Pianka told one reporter , and elaborated : “ I ’ve got two granddaughters , man .
I ’m putting money in a college fund for my granddaughters .
I ’m worried about them . ”
The issue of creationism has been simmering for decades , sometimes frothing up into great legal battles which attract widespread attention .
The most recent of these watershed events happened in Dover , Pennsylvania , where a school board tried to push “ Intelligent Design ” into the science classrooms .
Judge John E. Jones III , a Republican and faithful Lutheran , delivered a landmark verdict in which he summarized the claims of Intelligent Design proponents as “ breathtaking inanity . ”
Once the verdict was revealed , Judge Jones became the target of character assassination and even received death threats for the crime of doing his job .
His decision put Judge Jones on the cover of Time Magazine , but you do n’t have to be famous to have someone get very upset about you .
Michael Korn sent threatening letters , adorned with skulls and crossbones , to several biology professors at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
Several of the messages were delivered by slipping envelopes under the professors ’ office doors after working hours ; Korn ’s missives referred to “ killing the enemies of Christian society . ”
He then skipped town and is currently a fugitive from justice .
When will one of these threats come to fruition ?
When will self - righteous anger , fueled by ignorance , unchecked thanks to prejudicial culture , meet a loosening of inhibitions and end in grief ?
If you think this is such a long shot that it could never happen and is n’t worth bothering about , what about the sad story of Rudi Boa ?
A 28 - year - old graduate of Edinburgh University with degrees in chemistry and forensic science , Boa was backpacking across Australia with his girlfriend , Gillian Brown .
At a bar in Tumut , New South Wales , Boa had an argument over religion with another traveler , Alexander York .
Later that night , it appears , York attacked Brown and in the ensuing fight , Boa was stabbed , once , in the chest .
York was found guilty of manslaughter .
A community center in Phnom Penh , through which Boa had traveled shortly before his death , was later founded and named in his honor , using donations from the Boa family .
I wonder : when will this happen in America ?
All the ingredients are already here .
It does n’t take an organized conspiracy , just a culture in which the enemy has already been defined .
We fight over scarce resources , whether they be oil or cocaine , and we invent new scarcities over which to wage war , treasures whose very existence depend upon human perception and whose value can never be tested through experiment and rational investigation .
Even when this contest does not lead to physical violence , it deranges lives and brings anguish .
Many of the names I ’ve mentioned in this essay belong to faithful Christians .
These people , who have suffered because they accept the scientific truth of evolution , are not raving atheists or infidel interlopers .
They learned the hard way that some folks just are n’t satisfied with “ theistic evolution , ” with the idea that the Creation took a long time or that science and religion answer different kinds of questions .
Compromise and coexistence are , quite simply , not good enough .
Those who advise such a friendly relationship find themselves , dare I say it , expelled .
And stories which begin with unshakable hate do not end very well .
UPDATE ( 20 April 2008 ) : I should have known that my Gentle Readers would have additional items to offer .
See , for example , the story of Kanawha County , West Virginia and this list of incidents , which overlaps with my own .
Oh , and I ’ve also been alerted to the unfortunate case of Terry Gray , a Christian biochemist whose negative review of Phillip Johnson ’s Darwin on Trial sparked an unhappy response from the Orthodox Presbyterian Church , which eventually forced Dr. Gray to recant .
UPDATE : In addition to that , Christopher J. O’Brien describes his correspondence with Richard Colling , the professor at Olivet Nazarene whose experiences I summarized above .
Colling writes to O’Brien thusly :
I am deeply saddened that the entire situation has come to this point of misrepresentation and organized attempts to discredit and malign my reputation .
My heart has always been to offer a means to students and to the general public by which science and faith can be viewed as compatible .
My faculty colleagues and students will attest that I have done this accurately , as well as faithfully and sensitively in the classroom and in my book , Random Designer .
Yet sadly the university leadership , without willingness to accept responsibility for questionable actions and misleading communications , has apparently chosen to ignore these facts .
I have discovered that some of the most fundamental voices in the Christian church and culture only want war , and seemingly will stop at nothing to discredit / destroy anyone who understands the biology / evolution and makes an intellectually honest attempt to communicate peace between Biology and the Bible .
This grieves me deeply .
I believe the anguish in Colling ’s voice can reach out to others of different faiths , or of none at all .
We all listen to human stories .
UPDATE ( 21 April ) :
The problem is not restricted to the United States .
Christopher diCarlo was teaching a critical thinking course at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo , Canada , when one day he wore a T - shirt he had made which said , “ We Are All Africans . ”
It ’s true : go back a mere eyeblink of geological time , and our ancestors all lived in East - Central Africa .
A student became incensed when diCarlo explained that human beings had evolved and filled up the world by migrating around it ; she complained to the administration , and diCarlo found himself explaining his case again to the Associate Dean .
Almost certainly in consequence , diCarlo was passed over for a full - time professorship .
He has n’t done too poorly for himself in the years since , but it ’s worth noting that his supporting the fact of human evolution caused him at least as much trouble , if not more , than that suffered by the “ martyrs ” whom creationists like to trumpet as victims of “ Darwinism . ”
UPDATE ( 29 April ) :
Thanks to the alert reader who caught my timeline glitch with regard to Prof.
Mirecki !
Where would I be without my legion of intrepid fact - checkers ?

I also wanted to use Photoshop .
But I did n’t wanted to use any Photos .
I just wanted to paint the whole thing .
In Addition I not just wanted to lay a realistic texture over the original figure , but to rework the forms and proportions as well , to get the whole creature a more realistic look .
This is n’t a untooning of bowser , it ’s a redesign .
How would he look like if he would be a real animal .
While I changed some of his proportions here and there I still wanted to keep his overall character .
My redesign is a bowser who is a bit more slender with a narrower mouth that resembles a dinosaur .
All this to give him a more realistic , faster and threatening look .
I also took the original color scheme of Bowser and tried to convert it into some kind of realistic animal coloration .
For this picture I only used the Photoshop Brushtool ( 99 % a simple round brush ) and sometimes the smudge tool .
I never used more than two layers at once , trying to work much like painting as possible .
The nonprofit group behind Wikipedia , the mammoth internet encyclopedia built by volunteers , is getting its largest donation ever — $ 3 million US from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation .
The award , to come in $ 1 - million instalments over each of the next three years , will help the Wikimedia Foundation become more financially secure as it hires more staff and seeks to improve the quality and reach of Wikipedia content , foundation leaders said .
" We think it will pave the way towards more donations as it is a signal that a major foundation sees good in what we are doing , " said Jimmy Wales , the project 's leader and a board member of the Wikimedia Foundation .
" And it should take away a lot of the questions people have had about whether we will need advertising to survive . "
Founded in 2001 , Wikipedia is now the seventh - most popular website in the U.S. , according to comScore Inc .
More than half the Wikimedia Foundation 's $ 4.6 - million budget covers the servers and internet bandwidth to handle all that traffic .
It also supports Wikipedias in dozens of other languages and affiliated free projects such as dictionaries and news sites .
The San Francisco - based Wikimedia Foundation said it would use the Sloan grant for software enhancements , including one that make it easier for Wikipedia editors to grade article quality .
Wikimedia leaders also envision doing more outreach to new contributors and creating educational content for people without computers .
Doron Weber , a Sloan Foundation representative , said in a statement that Wikipedia " represents a quantum leap " in the collection and organization of knowledge .
Relying largely on small , individual donations , the Wikimedia Foundation saw cash contributions jump to $ 2.2 million last year from $ 1.3 million in the prior year .
But foundation leaders have been looking for sturdier mechanisms of support to ensure the group 's long - term survival .
It does not have an endowment fund .
The group also recently lined up $ 1 million in gifts from anonymous sources .
Those donors were introduced to the group by Roger McNamee , a prominent venture capitalist who himself has given at least $ 300,000 , which raised questions about whether investors might try to capitalize on Wikipedia 's brand name in a for - profit side business .
Wales has said no such venture is planned .
Germs , either there are viruses or bacteria and other micro-organisms they are usually everywhere .
But the fact is that , we have solutions in our hands that are helpful in keeping the hazards and risks away from affecting our health .
Some germs are easily removed when the surfaces are disinfected but sometimes they are more likely to spread when not taken care about .
Usually the germ are spread via touching contaminated surfaces , some are spread into the air and some are spread through water carriers .
For the pandemics these are mostly likely to spread through air as the spread is quick .
In such cases the use of n95 respirator and sometimes the disposable face masks are used in order to filter out the contaminated particles and air molecules .
With the help of n95 masks the possibility of getting purified air is possible because these masks are more likely to filter our larger contaminated particles as well as minute germs which are otherwise not possibly removed through the layers of a regular surgical mask .
It has been observed that the use of things like the n95 face masks have greatly reduced the spread of germs that are carried through the air as they filter the air quite effectively .
In addition to using the kn95 masks there are other methods of keeping the health risks away from us to encounter .
Manufacturers in the United States are now focusing on making the most effective forms of face masks including n95 mask as well as other versions which have proven their worth in keeping things as expected include the masks like 3 M 8511 and 3 M 8210 .
Knowing the pattern on which the germs spread helps in determining how can we protect ourselves from the affect and the risk associated with them .
Not taking enough measures may increase the risks and that leads to health troubles .
The viruses and bacteria that affect human body are usually carried and survive by most of the conditions around us .
If the conditions are made unfavorable for the propagation of the germs then it is possible that there are lesser chances of the spread .
So in addition to the protective measures and precautions the disinfection procedures as well as elimination of germs may be the best thing to do .
This will work in two ways as the prevention and elimination as well as safety practices will continue to keep the risks away .
A medical librarian , who ran a typical search on POPLINE , ( the world 's largest database on reproductive health ) found something very disturbing .
The term " abortion " had been pretty much blocked from its database for normal searches .
Go here and try the search .
I did and got " No records found by latest query . "
What is POPLINE ?
the world 's largest database on reproductive health , containing citations with abstracts to scientific articles , reports , books , and unpublished reports in the field of population , family planning , and related health issues .
POPLINE is maintained by the INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health / Center for Communication Programs and is funded by the United States Agency for International Development .
( USAID ) .
I was contacted yesterday by someone and given this email thread .
Here 's what he / she said in the email :
The e-mail exchange below is fairly straight - forward : a governmental database on Population , POPLINE ( POPulation OnLINE ) has been changed so that one can no longer search the term " abortion . "
As the representative from POPLINE states , " As a federally funded project , we decided this was best for now . "
I suspect pressure was placed from on high to do this .
Why would the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University , where POPLINE is hosted , decide on its own to eliminate searching for information on abortion ?
I hope you can publicize this outrageous maneuver .
Here 's the email conversation that was posted here .
It 's quite troubling .

Hi Debbie –
Thank you for your quick response to my e-mail .
I have forwarded your e-mail to researchers with whom I am working ; I suspect they will be as puzzled as I about the decision to make “ all abortion terms stop words ” in the government funded , publically available “ POPLINE ” database .
Even more troubling is the implications for the average user – eliminating this term essentially blocks access to the reports in the database and ultimately to information about abortion .
“ Unwanted w2 pregnancy ” is not a synonym for abortion .
My colleague and I are also forwarding this e-mail to several organizations whose members are primarily medical librarians .
We suspect they will also be puzzled by the notion that a perfectly good noun such as “ abortion ” should for no apparent reason be classified as a “ stop word ” and equated with “ a ” , “ an ” , “ the ” .
A better explanation is deserved – the explanation should also be posted on the website for all users to know , e.g. , “ The POPLINE database producers have decided to ignore “ abortion ” as a searchable to term because ……. ?
We look forward to a better explanation for why this term has been eliminated ; all of the users of POPLINE deserve to know .
Regards ,
Researcher

Subject : RE : Popline retrieval discrepancy
Hi researcher ,
Yes we did make a change in POPLINE .
We recently made all abortion terms stop words .
As a federally funded project , we decided this was best for now .
In addition to the terms you ’re already using , you could try using ‘ Fertility Control , Postconception ’ .
This is the broader term to our ‘ Abortion ’ terms and most records have both in the keyword fields .
Also , adding ‘ unwanted w2 pregnancy ’ in place of aborti* .
We have a keyword Pregnancy , Unwanted and there are 2517 records with aborti* & unwanted w2 pregnancy
I hope this helps .

Subject : RE : Popline retrieval discrepancy
Hello Debbie :
I left a message on your voice mail today regarding POPLINE , but did n’t explain the problem I ’m encountering , so here is an email follow - up .
When I ran this strategy on Jan 18 , 2008 , POPLINE retrieved 1684 refs ; when I re-ran the same strategy today , POPLINE retrieved fewer refs , ie , 1478 refs .
Usually , when a search is re-run at a later date , the total number of references retrieved is more , not less .
Has POPLINE undergone some major change in the past few months that might explain the decreased retrieval ?
What can account for this discrepancy ?
( strategy removed )
I also tested a second strategy that was developed in Jan 2008 and had similar results , ie , fewer refs retrieved this time than previous .
Puzzling ?!?
Appreciate a prompt response --
Thank you , researcher .

Women 's Health News did a little digging and says : " Why is a Government - Funded Reproductive Health Database Blocking Users from Searching for Abortion Articles ?
Now , a little digging reveals that the POPLINE folks have n’t actually removed the term “ abortion ” ( or related ones ) as subject terms from the citations , or from their Thesaurus which tells you which subjects appear in the database .
If you know to use the “ Browse Index ” * you can still find the term and come up with almost 25,000 results .
However , if you simply enter the word “ abortion ” in the Subject search box , as the instructions directly above the box suggest you should be able to do , the search returns 0 results .
Another work - around is to enter the search as = ” Abortion ” as the Index search would do , and you can still get the results .
Of course , that applies for now , until they realize that the work - around is there and remove it as well .
Right now , this move is essentially a barrier to your basic search / er - an advanced searcher might get 25,000 results , while someone just following directions will get none .
As the librarian reporting the problem noted , “ It is important to remember that this database is used by both professional searchers and the public .
The average user goes directly to the query box and searches ; they will retrieve nothing when the term “ abortion ” is entered . ”
She also notes that using the advanced options was * not* among the suggestions from POPLINE personnel in response to her inquiry ... read on
Medical librarian blogs are now actively picking up on this :
Sure , you can search for " unwanted pregnancy " or , ( as the representative from the database suggests ) " Fertility Control , Postconception , " but these are not the terms people use .
A good search engine is responsive to both vernacular and specialized terms , providing results that allow the user to learn the more specialized terms as their research progresses .
Now , to use POPLINE , you have to know in advance .
Turning to their handy " Keyword Guide " wo n't help you either , because Abortion , Abortion Law , and Abortion Rate are all still misleadingly listed as keywords .
Government Database Restricting Information On Abortion
Bush Acts on Abortion ' Gag Rule '
Aaron Edlin first noticed this imbalance more than 15 years ago .
“ I was a graduate student at Stanford , ” he says , “ and I drove maybe 2,000 miles a year .
But I paid roughly the same $ 1,000 as if I ’d driven 10 times as much , which was a huge portion of my budget . ”
A few years later , Edlin was serving on the President ’s Council of Economic Advisers when he floated an idea that economists had long found attractive : pay - as - you - drive ( PAYD ) insurance .
It seemed like an obvious solution .
Since no one expects to pay the same price for , say , a 60 - minute massage as they pay for a 15 - minute massage , why should people pay the same for insurance no matter how many miles they drove ?
“ The objection within the White House , ” Edlin recalls , “ was there was n’t good academic research on the subject . ”
Edlin and a few others , including Jason Bordoff and Pascal Noel at the Brookings Institution , have since done such research .
It makes a compelling case that PAYD insurance would work well , reducing the carbon emissions , congestion and accident risk created by too much driving while leading drivers to pay the true cost of their mileage .
Bordoff and Noel put the total social benefit at $ 52 billion a year .
The better news is that PAYD insurance is no longer just an academic exercise .
G.M.A.C. has begun using OnStar technology to offer mileage discounts , and next month Progressive will roll out a comprehensive PAYD plan called MyRate .
Progressive , the huge Ohio - based insurer that has long prided itself as an innovator , will first offer the plan in six states , having run a similar pilot in three other states .
Drivers who sign up for MyRate will install a small wireless device in their cars that transmits to Progressive not just how many miles they drive but also when those miles are driven and , to some extent , how they are driven : the device measures the car ’s speed every second , from which Progressive can derive acceleration and braking behavior .
Which means that Progressive will not only be able to charge drivers for the actual miles they consume but will also better assess the true risk of each driver .
If PAYD is such a great idea , why has it taken so long ?
There are at least three reasons : the tracking technology has only recently become affordable ; insurers were anxious about drivers ’ privacy concerns ; and there was a substantial risk for whichever company was first to offer PAYD on a large scale .
Participation in the MyRate program is voluntary , and that ’s where the economics get interesting .
As with most incentive changes , there will be winners and losers .
The clearest winners are people like Zelda , who can drive the same distance they used to drive and pay less .
What ’s less obvious is whether Progressive will be a winner ; there are , in fact , a couple of situations in which Progressive could lose out .
If all MyRate accomplishes is to give Progressive ’s low - mileage customers the rate cut they deserve , then Progressive is doing little more than lowering its own revenues .
It could , of course , try to compensate by raising rates on all its high - mileage Arthurs , but then there ’s nothing to stop Arthur from buying his insurance elsewhere .
( Of course , losing its riskiest customers to other companies might also prove profitable for Progressive . )
If , however , Progressive can corner the Zelda market by stealing millions of Zeldas from other insurers , then it could make a killing by being the first to sell accurately priced insurance for low - mileage drivers .
The bigger goal for society  and the wild card in this or any incentive shift  is to create real behavior change .
And that is always easier said than done .
But if Progressive ’s PAYD insurance can induce some of its high - mileage customers to drive less and especially to drive more safely , resulting in smaller claims payouts for Progressive and fewer negative externalities for everyone , then it could truly be a win - win - win situation .
Except , perhaps , for Progressive ’s rivals .
In last week 's Philadelphia debate , Hillary Clinton said she would commit the United States to a retaliatory attack against Iran , presumably with nuclear weapons , if it dropped the bomb on Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait .
Asked if " it should be US policy now to treat an Iranian attack on Israel as if it were an attack against the United States , " Clinton astonishingly responded that she 'd use American nukes not just to defend Israel , our traditional strategic ally , but also other neighboring states such as the UAE , Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from an Iranian nuclear attack .
Barack Obama 's far more sensible answer was simply to commit to definitively and aggressively extend our deterrent protection to Israel - period .
Here 's Hillary 's answer , when asked if she 'd make clear to Iran that a nuclear attack on Israel would be answerable with our full retaliatory capability :
" We should be looking to create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than just Israel .
Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States .
But I would do the same with other countries in the region .
. .
You ca n't go to the Saudis or the Kuwaities or UAE and others who have a legitimate concern about Iran and say , ' Well , do n't acquire these weapons to defend yourself ' unless you 're also willing to say we will provide a deterrent backup . "
No American president has ever made so sweeping a commitment in the region - but Hillary appears eager to break new ground .
Obviously , Iran will shortly develop the ballistic - missile capability to hit Europe and , eventually the United States , just as North Korea is doing .
France 's Charles de Gaulle used to wonder if a US president would ever actually trade New York for Paris - that is , retaliate against the USSR with nuclear weapons if Moscow nuked Paris , knowing that Russia would then retaliate by wiping out a US city like New York .
His doubts led him to develop France 's own nuclear deterrent .
But now Sen .
Clinton appears willing to mortgage America 's cities to protect nations like Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the UAE - which includes Dubai , which has paid her husband ( and the Clintons ' joint bank accounts ) almost $ 15 million in the past seven years .
Indeed , is it a coincidence that all three of the countries that she mentioned were generous benefactors to her husband 's library ?
( While donations to the library remain secret , it 's known that the Saudi monarchy gave $ 10 million . )
Liberals often say they do n't want to exchange blood for oil .
But how much more blood could there be than to guarantee nuclear war over an attack on these nations ?
Are they worth it ?
None of these nations are democracies , all boycott Israel - and Dubai has been cited for numerous human - rights violations by our State Department for its treatment of Pakistani and Indian workers who labor there .
Indeed , the emir of Dubai has been sued by parents of children his agents are alleged to have abducted to serve as undernourished and uneducated jockeys for his camel races .
The class - action suit , filed in US District Court in Miami , was dismissed after the emir 's lobbyists ( firms with close Clinton ties ) got the State Department to signal to the court that the lawsuit was " a matter of interest " for the US government .
What criterion does Hillary use to decide to protect these dictatorships ?
That Iran may hit them with nuclear weapons .
Ca n't that apply to any nation on earth ?
Is the US nuclear retaliatory capacity now available to anyone , with all the risks that entails for global nuclear war ?
Hillary Clinton is now willing to risk our cities to save some of the most repressive regimes in the Middle East .
And she thinks we want her answering those 3 a.m. phone calls ?
A lot rides on which of these predictions turn out to be true , and on how and where different religions bump up against one another .
A common worry is that intense competition for souls could produce another era in which religious conflict leads to religious war — only this time with nuclear weapons .
If we are really in for anything like the kind of zeal that accompanied earlier periods of religious expansion , we might as well say goodbye to the Enlightenment and its principles of tolerance .
Yet breathless warnings about rising religious fervor and conflicts to come ignore two basic facts .
First , many areas of the world are experiencing a decline in religious belief and practice .
Second , where religions are flourishing , they are also generally evolving — very often in ways that allow them to fit more easily into secular societies , and that weaken them as politically disruptive forces .
The French philosopher Blaise Pascal once famously showed that it would be irrational to bet against the existence of God .
It would be equally foolish , in the long run , to bet against the power of the Enlightenment .
The answer to the question of which religion will dominate the future , at least politically , may well be : None of the above .

" In this age of science we have heaped up great intellectual riches of the pure scientific kind ...
But what will it profit us if we gain the whole world and lose our own souls ? "
By John Burroughs " In the Noon of Science " ( September 1912 ) " In this age of science we have heaped up great intellectual riches of the pure scientific kind ...
But what will it profit us if we gain the whole world and lose our own souls ? "
By John Burroughs
Until relatively recently , most social theorists , from Marx to Freud to Weber , believed that as societies became more modern , religion would lose its capacity to inspire .
Industrialization would substitute the rational pursuit of self - interest for blind submission to authority .
Science would undermine belief in miracles .
Democracy would encourage the separation of church and state .
Gender equality would undermine patriarchy , and with it , clerical authority .
However one defined modernity , it always seemed likely to involve societies focused on this world rather than on some other .
But intellectual fashions are fickle , and the idea of inevitable secularization has fallen out of favor with many scholars and journalists .
Still , its most basic tenet — that material progress will slowly erode religious fervor — appears unassailable .
Last October , the Pew Global Attitudes Project plotted 44 countries according to per capita gross domestic product and intensity of religious belief , gauged by the responses to several questions about faith ( a rendition of the Pew data appears on the opposite page ) .
The pattern , as seen in the Pew study and a number of other sources , is hard to miss : when God and Mammon collide , Mammon usually wins .
Toward the right edge of the graph — in the realm of the most - prosperous countries — and at the very bottom lies western Europe , where God , if not dead , has only a faint pulse .
Islam , to be sure , is increasingly prevalent in countries such as France and Great Britain , and one can also detect a slight uptick in Christian religiosity across much of the Continent in the past decade or so .
But at the same time , the region ’s last significant pockets of concentrated religiosity are collapsing .
Fifty years ago , Spain and Ireland were two of the most religious countries in Europe ; now they are among the least .
Not long ago , Spain was governed by a fascist dictator in close collaboration with the Catholic Church ; now it allows both gay marriage and adoption by gay couples , making it as liberal as Massachusetts .
Ireland once gave us , in the form of James Joyce ’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , one of the most chilling depictions of damnation in world literature ; these days , Dublin ’s churches are emptying out , and the few parishioners are apt to be Polish immigrants , most of whom presumably came to Ireland to nourish their bank accounts , not their souls .
Earlier this week , a decision by the judge presiding over Elektra v. Barker was widely misreported as providing substantial support for the argument that making a song available over a P2P network constitutes copyright infringement .
Another decision rendered the same day and just brought to light by the EFF actually does come to that conclusion , and the judge in that case has quashed a subpoena issued by the RIAA to learn the identities of four anonymous Boston University students .
Like the Barker decision , the EFF submitted an amicus curiae brief in London - Sire v. Does 1 - 4 raising many of the same arguments that it had in Elektra v. Barker and Atlantic v. Howell .
The EFF argued that simply making music available on a P2P network did not rise to the level of copyright infringement and that the RIAA needed to demonstrate that someone other than its authorized agent , MediaSentry , downloaded the file .
Judge Nancy Gertner agreed .
" Merely because the defendant has ' completed all the steps necessary for distribution ' does not necessarily mean that a distribution has actually occurred , " wrote Gertner in her order .
" As noted above , merely exposing music files to the Internet is not copyright infringement . "
Judge Nancy Gertner
Judge Gertner did find another EFF argument unconvincing , however .
In this and other cases , the EFF had argued that the Copyright Act mandates that an actually , physical copy change hands in order for infringement to occur .
Not so , according to the judge , who ruled that the EFF was relying on an " overly literal " definition of " material object . "
Whether the distribution takes place electronically or physical makes no difference .
As was the case in Elektra v. Barker , the judge did note that an " offer to distribute " is sufficient basis for a copyright infringement claim , which means that the RIAA can continue to make that allegation in its lawsuits .
There is , however , a big difference between having evidence for a copyright infringement claim and showing by a preponderance of evidence that infringement actually took place .
Another issue addressed in the judge 's ruling was how far a university should be required to go in order to identify suspected infringers for the RIAA .
She notes that IP addresses cannot always be traced to a particular individual with certainty and says that Boston University 's coughing up a " long list of possible infringers " would in effect greenlight an RIAA fishing expedition .
While Judge Gertner is throwing out the RIAA 's subpoena , she is allowing the labels to refile .
Boston University will then need to submit a copy of its terms of service ( if it exists ) along with the possible identities of those who were using the IP addresses in question when MediaSentry stumbled upon the shared folders .
Once that information is in hand , the judge will make a decision on whether or not the data will be disclosed to the RIAA .
The RIAA sees this as only a temporary setback , with a spokesperson telling Ars that it is " confident " that it will get its hands on the identifying information at some point .
It also took issue with the judge 's decision on the " making available " argument .
" We do not believe that the court 's findings on this issue — which are at odds with the findings of numerous other courts to have addressed this issue , as well as the United States Copyright Office and Congress itself — are necessary to the court ’s decision , " the spokesperson said .
The fact that two judges issued such different rulings on the same day shows how much new ground is being covered by the RIAA 's lawsuits — in no small part due to defendants that are willing to stand up to the record labels ' bullying tactics .
Ultimately , the question of what , exactly , needs to happen on a P2P network in order to show infringement is far from a settled issue .
As the EFF points out in its press release that the wide variance in rulings so far means that other judges will have to deal with the same issues in other lawsuits brought by the RIAA .
So far , there has been only a single trial , while the RIAA has even had some difficulty winning default judgments in cases where the defendants never showed up in court .

Born out of the VPNTunnel Project , the TorrentFreedom ‘ manifesto ’ is an interesting document , particularly if you ’ve ever worried about being tracked , traffic shaped , blocked or censored on the Internet .
With a suitably clandestine feel , the manifesto states :
“ Today , there is a nexus of Schumpeterian creative destruction to be found at the asymptotic fringe of intellectual property law and networking technology .
Everyone says there is an ‘ arms race ’ between the unwashed filesharing masses and the forces of Big Brother – we like to think of ourselves as the suitcase nuke for the little guys . ”
TorrentFreak got in touch with ‘ Faust ’ of Torrent Freedom to find out what on earth they ’re talking about .
TF : Tell us about this ‘ creative destruction ’ and what inspired you to create TorrentFreedom .
Faust :
It ’s all but trite to point out nowadays that we ’ve undergone a revolution in how human knowledge is created , stored , and shared .
And , much as Schumpeter himself had predicted , the creativity unleashed has more than made up for the detritus of old forms of information transmission that now scatter the landscape like broken , forgotten toys .
This is as it should be .
The backlash from the praxis of stasis threatens to drown the organic reinvigoration that innovation technology has always brought forth – there would be no 95 theses without Gutenburg , remember .
So our inspiration comes from a deeper , historical appreciation for the transformative role of new technologies in human social organization .
Nobody knows where creativity , academia , and knowledge creation will evolve as our tools allow for more and deeper interconnection between physically disparate peoples – but we do know that hampering that process is n’t part of making a better world for all beings .
We ’d like to see people keep sharing , keep learning , keep exploring .
. . and they ca n’t do that if there ’s roadblocks and threats of censorship every step of the way .
Make it easy and make it work , that ’s our approach – then the creative destruction can continue apace .
TF : There are number of evils you appear to tackle head on with this service , such as traffic shaping , packet raping , blocking , censorship etc .
I expect lots of Comcast customers will be interested as you specifically mention the ‘ Sandvining ’ technique they employ .
How does your system work and how will it benefit each type of problem ?
Faust : Metaphorically , the system is quite simple : think of the difference between sending postcards in the postal mail , versus sending sealed envelopes .
A postcard can easily be read by anyone along the way , and if they do n’t like what it says ( or who it is addressed to ) , they could just throw it out – oops !
A sealed letter is n’t vulnerable like that – the contents are n’t readable whilst in transit .
Even more than that , our system protects the address ( sender and receiver ) on the envelope as well – so nobody can block the message just because they do n’t like where it ’s headed ( or where it ’s come from ) .
At a deeper level , our server farm is based in the Netherlands .
Everything passes in and out of these machines , and all IP addresses are associated with them .
The activities of our customers – once their sessions decrypt and leave our server farm – are fully and unambiguously decoupled from their RL info ( including local / physical IP address ) .
Big Brother is n’t going to show up at their doorstep with a fishing - expedition summons or subpoena .
We took it a step further , however – we ’ve broken the link between RL info and public IP for our customers inside our systems as well – once an account is set up , it is methodologically impossible for anyone to back - connect a given external TF IP address to a customers ’ specific account , ever .
TF : You ’re called Torrent Freedom so it ’s fairly clear which crowd you ’re aiming your product act .
What sort of dedicated optimizations can BitTorrent users look forward to when using your service ?
Faust :
We ’ve tested the service extensively with just about every BT client out there .
They all work seamlessly .
We also do n’t penalize our customers for running lots of network traffic over TorrentFreedom – there are no monthly caps , and no drama if someone uses a lot of gigs with us .
That ’s cool – it ’s why we built the system !
OpenVPN , in its rawest form , will work with BT traffic – but getting it to do so consistently and smoothly is nontrivial .
We ’ve done all that work , so our customers do n’t need to become experts in subnet addressing , MTU window sizing , and the 100 other little tweaks one needs to do to really make BT over a VPN sing .
We also hand out real , public IP addresses – so no port forwarding garbage , just fast connectivity .
TF : Please give us a brief rundown on how your system works .
Faust :
On a technical level , it ’s an implementation of the TLS - based OpenVPN project ’s codebase ( which itself implements various OpenSSL crypto algorithms ) .
Starting from there , we ’ve created a Java - based client that handles all the encryption and coordinates OpenVPN ’s handshake tasks , to ensure that every packet coming and going from our customers ’
PCs is tightly encrypted ( including DNS queries , unlike pptp ) .
The really cool stuff comes in the firewall - busting tricks that our client has up its sleeve – there ’s very few local network configurations that we ca n’t tunnel through .
. . with no customer tweaking of the software needed .
We ’ve also implemented a rather clever port 443 wrapper so that , unlike many VPN instantiations , the TorrentFreedom service ca n’t be blocked unless the entire HTTPS capacity is also shut down – unlikely .
We ’ve built most everything with open code , and we ’re pushing further in that direction ( with perhaps full distribution of the source for our client extensions in the works ) .
“ Just trust us ” crypto is n’t worth anything – if it ’s not open , it ’s not reliable .
We run 2048 keylength RSA algorithms so , to the local ISP or anyone else “ listening in ” to our customers ’ packets , the data all looks like a stream of secure web traffic , back and forth .
This is true for ALL IP traffic coming off a machine , all protocols and all applications .
So there ’s no need to tweak individual applications to get them to “ work ” with Torrent Freedom – just set up the client , connect , and everything is encrypted all the time .
TF : There are other well known VPN services that say they are strong on anonymity and hide your IP address , yet all of them will give up your personal details at some point .
How is TorrentFreedom going to live up to the claim in the manifesto that BitTorrent users using your service will be “ just about as traceable as dusty footprints in a windswept street .
You ca n’t subpoena what does n’t exist ” ?
Faust :
Ok this is where the rubber really meets the road .
An “ anonymizing ” service that keeps detailed records of their customers ’ activities is just a problem waiting to happen .
There ’s no point in hiding an IP address only to keep records that connect that IP address to the one that ’s used to cover for it !
And , reality is that there is no place in the world that is n’t subject to some form of legal jurisdiction – just saying “ we wo n’t turn over records ” is silly .
When the authorities show up – with court orders or guns – and people start talking about jail time and contempt , those records are going to get coughed up , period .
Despite our respect for the company overall , Hushmail ’s admission that it provides “ secure ” email information to certain government authorities demonstrates all too well that even a good team will fold if the pressure gets too high – and if they have information to provide in the first place !
We built the system from day one so that there ’s no correlation between an IP + timestamp and a username – this means we can’t hand over logs of “ who was on what IP at what time ” , and therefore the user ca n’t be tracked back from their online activity .
Our payment system is fully abstracted from the operational environment – billing events are passed to the VPN engine via temporary “ tokens ” that are one - way - factors – there ’s no link between the VPN account and the details of the billing transaction , ever .
We keep a little bit of data on file to make sure we can monitor the performance of the system overall , but we do n’t have “ server logs ” like everyone else does .
They do n’t exist .
So , we can be forced to turn over those logs – but they do n’t link back to anything .
Not to mention all of our operational VMs run in fully - encrypted partitions , etc .
Someone seizing any of our servers has nothing but an expensive doorjam for their troubles .
Even someone with full access to every machine we have cannot link people to their past network traffic through TorrentFreedom .
It ’s structural anonymity , at the most fundamental level .
Now , there ’s lots of other VPN services out there and some of them are sorta ok .
Most , let ’s be honest , are based on pptp – it ’s really insecure with several known weaknesses .
Plus , it ’s closed - source / proprietary , so who knows if it has backdoors or not ?
The reason people use it is because it ’s easy to set up – Windows machines come with it pre-installed .
Well , we did the hard work of getting a real VPN implementation ( OpenVPN ) to work just as easily as pptp – but without the security problems .
Some of the stuff we did is a little complex , behind the scenes , but the end result is a service that ’s really easy to set up and use .
We ’ve got clients for Windows , Macs , and Linux .
We do n’t limit bandwidth , and we ’ve got some very fast servers backing it all up .
It ’s all done right .
TF : Any final thoughts ?
Faust : Using TorrentFreedom for online security is like bringing a machine - gun to a knife fight .
. . it might not be ‘ fair , ’ but the outcome is n’t going to be in question either .
TF : lol ;)
TorrentFreedom has agreed to let the first 50 lucky TorrentFreak readers have a month ’s free subscription to test out their service and see if it lives up to the claims .
Hurry !
They wo n’t last long !
Update : the free invites are gone .

Abstract :
Entrapment of prepuce in a zipper is a common cause of prepuceal injury in children .
The reported interventions include dismantling the zipper with bone or wire cutters , to circumcision .
A quick , simple and non-traumatic approach to the zipper manipulation is presented in which prepuce is instantly released by lateral compression of the zip fastener , using a pliers .
Key words : Children , Injury , Penis , Zipper .
Entrapment of penile foreskin is quite a distressing situation for the child and the parents and can be a frustrating management problem .
Any overzealous intervention would simply worsen the situation .
Also , attempts to cut open the zip fastener are time taking and may not be either helpful or feasible in all the situations .
The approach to the zipper manipulation should be quick , simple , non-traumatic and reproducible irrespective of the age of the child , mechanism and site of entrapment , presence of the local edema and zipper size or design .
Case Report
The technique described was applied in three consecutive boys of 5 - 7 years .
All of them had entrapment of the prepuce while fastening the zip .
In two of them , the ventral prepuce was entrapped whereas the third boy had entrapped the dorsal skin of his shaft .
In each of these , the prepuce was entrapped between the zip and the zip fastener .
In the first case , parents had tried some lubricant in vain .
In the second case , the parents had cut the pant off the zip and further , in an attempt to extricate the prepuce , had cut the lower ( zipped ) end of the zip and peeled apart the two halves .
But the zip fastener , still holding the prepuce , did not budge from its place .
In the third case a local doctor had tried unfastening the zip after infiltration of 2 % lignocain in the prepuce , but failed to release the prepuce and rather caused further ecchymosis .
All these boys were very frightened at presentation .
Technique
In all these cases only one method was applied .
Step 1 : Just ahead of the entrapped foreskin , using an ordinary wire cutter , the two unzipped halves were first given transverse cuts over the free margin so that the tooth line is divided , and then , further cutting the cloth strips just lateral to the tooth lines , the cuts were extended along the sides of the zip fastener ( Fig. 1 ) .
Fig .
1 . The tooth line divided and the cuts extended upto the sides of the zip fastener .
Step 2 : The zip fastener was then held with pliers from side to side ensuring that the lateral margins of its both anterior and posterior faceplates were within the grip of the pliers ( Fig. 2 ) .
Applying a strong compression , the entrapped foreskin was released instant - aneously .
This maneuver was painless .
It was due to an increased gap between the two faceplates of the zip fastener when compression was applied from the lateral sides .
The increased gap resulted in loosening the interdigitation of the teeth of the two halves of the zip , allowing the prepuce to be slipped off .
Fig.2 .
The zip fastener gripped by pliers and compressed side to side .
The first step is essential to facilitate a proper grip of the pliers over the sides of the two faceplates together ( Fig. 2 inset ) .
Unless the cloth strips are cut upto the sides of the zip fastener , the posterior plate , which is behind the zip line , cannot be properly held , as the pliers are applied from the anterior surface of the zipper .
If there is no enough width of the cloth strip between the central teeth line and the stitching of the zip to the pant , the cut in the zip should be extended upto the sides of the zip fastener by cutting through the pant fabric .
No local anesthesia is required .
The children can simply be taken into confidence .
Small babies , if required , may be sedated .
Discussion
Entrapment of unprotected penis into zipper is the most common cause of prepuceal injury in children ( 1 ) .
These children are often distressed and frightened due to several unsuccessful and painful attempts at extrication by the parents ( 2 ) .
In these cases , various management strategies are reported , including an aggressive approach of partial excision of the entrapped foreskin , or a circumcision under general anesthesia ( 3 ) .
The non aggressive management strategies involve some form of mechanical disengagement of the zipper from the skin .
One of the crude methods is to push the zip fastener in the opposite direction from which it had originally trapped the skin(4 )
However , tugging at the zipper in either directions may result in a tighter entrapment or a further bruising as it tends to re-enact the original trauma in the reverse .
Another technique described is to unfasten the zipper one tooth at a time , alternating sides ( 1 - 4 ) .
Also reported is giving transverse cuts through the cloth strips holding the tooth line , and allowing disengagement from both sides of the entrapment ( 5 ) .
Still others report use of mineral oil followed by traction ( 2 ) .
However , the most common method described so far , involves the division of the median bar connecting the anterior and posterior faceplates of the zip fastener , using a bone cutter or a mini hacksaw ( 6 - 9 ) .
These strategies of zip manipulation , while effective , are not very rapid and cause sufficient movement of the zipper and the penis and therefore , often require local anesthesia .
Moreover , if the median bar lies deep or a portion of the entrapped prepuce projects ahead of the zip fastener , it may be very difficult and potentially dangerous to divide the median bar using these methods .
The technique reported here is simple , safe , quick , and painless .
As it does not involve a division of the median bar , it can be used in all the cases of prepuceal entrapment regardless of the size of the zip , the mechanism of entrapment , the position or projection of the prepuce , and an associated edema .

Rationing , shortages and profiteering hit garages yesterday ahead of the planned strike at the Grangemouth oil refinery as motoring organisations and government ministers pleaded with drivers not to panic - buy petrol .
Many stations in Scotland limited customers to £ 10 or £ 20 - worth of fuel , a few ran out of diesel , and a small number raised prices by up to 10 p a litre .
Farmers feared they would face severe difficulties if supplies dried up .
" The message that there 's enough fuel to go around is not quite squaring with what people are seeing on the ground at the moment , " warned James Withers , chief executive of NFU Scotland .
Grangemouth , north - west of Edinburgh , refines 9 m litres of petrol a day , around 10 % of the UK 's daily usage .
The two - day strike will also force 70 oil and gas fields in the North Sea to halt production .
Around 700,000 barrels of oil , more than a third of the UK 's output , normally flows into the nearby Kinneil plant which relies on steam and electricity from the Grangemouth site and which will have to be closed tomorrow .
Shutting down oil production will also halt the flow of gas from the fields , cutting UK output by about 30 % .
National Grid said it did not expect the closure to have an impact on gas supplies because demand had dropped from winter levels .
Scotland 's first minister , Alex Salmond , said : " We need everyone 's cooperation in not repeat - buying , to cut out nonessential trips , and to use public transport . "
Malcolm
Wicks , the UK energy minister , said : " I cannot guarantee that every garage forecourt will have petrol at [ any ] precise moment .
People will have to be sensible and rational . "
The AA said it was not aware of any problems in England or Wales .
" There are [ only ] shortages in Scotland , " a spokesman said .
" Earlier in the week , when garages started rationing , there was lots of abuse .
Sense is now returning to forecourts . "
North Sea production is expected to be restored within five to six days of the end of the strike .
Grangemouth is expected to be out of action for much longer .
" We are saying three weeks , that 's our best guess , but it could be more , " said a spokesman for the refinery owners , Ineos .
Yesterday there was little sign of agreement between the company and the union , Unite .
The plant 's 1,200 - strong workforce will begin the two - day strike tomorrow over changes the company wants to make to its final salary pension scheme .
To understand this geeky war - story , you need to know a little about the architecture of the Commodore 64 computer .
Architecture of the Commodore 64
The RAM of the Commodore 64 was divided up into sections .
Bytes 0 – 1023 was used for a whole lot of registers that were used to configure the behaviour of the computer .
Bytes 1024 -2040 were memory - mapped to the 40 ×25 character screen .
For example , that means that if you set ( “ poked ” ) the value 1 into byte 1024 , the letter A value would appear in the top - left corner .
If you poked 2 into byte 1064 ( i.e. 1024+40 characters per line ) , the letter B would appear on the left hand - side of the second line .
Bytes 2041 - 2047 were used to control sprites .
Bytes 2049 - 32767 were used as space for storing your BASIC program code , in a very lightly pre-processed ( tokenised ) format .
All of this is from memory ( no pun intended ) , so I apologise if it is slightly inaccurate , and I fear greatly that it might be right – why ca n’t my brain remember facts more useful to me ?
The Task
Geoff and I were playing around with the development of a little tank - game – the genre where you get a top down view of two tanks that fire at each other , past obstacles .
We were using character - based graphics , with a custom font that included a picture of a tank pointing up down left and right .
We had programmed the tank to turn to each of the four compass points , and to move forward and backward .
It was time to add the code that controlled the bullets .
The Bullet Code
We programmed the BASIC code for firing downwards :
Set the memory associated with the appropriate location on the screen to the character representing a cannon shell .
Add 40 , and do it again .
Blank out the original location , and repeat .
Time to test :
We moved the tank , pointed it downwards , and fired .
A shell fired out of the cannon , and neatly proceeded down the screen .
We were overjoyed , until it reached the end of the screen , and we looked at each other , as realisation dawned :
We had n’t yet written any code to stop the bullet from continuing when it reached the end of the screen .
Aborting the code , we found to our horror that our fears were true .
The bullet had proceeded past the end of the memory - mapped screen , skipped by the sprite data , and had continued to shoot a hole right down the middle of our BASIC code .

Ayattu Nure :
Do as I say , not as I do
After seeing his fortune disappear under the competing demands of his enormous family , Ayattu Nure , 56 , even urges people not to get married .
" I want my children to be farmers but I have no land , I want them to go to school but I have no money , " he says .
But his eldest son has not heeded Mr Ayattu 's advice and he has three wives .
Share wealth
Seven of Mr Ayattu 's wives live in huts around his compound , which are in urgent need of renovation .
He says he cannot remember all his children 's names but tries to work out who they are from their mothers and which huts they live in .
Mr Ayattu says he used to be rich and wanted to share his wealth around , which is why he took so many wives .
But now he struggles to feed them all .
" I feel like killing myself when I see my hungry children whom I cannot help , " Mr Ayattu says .
His wives have given birth to more than 100 children but 23 have died .
School photos
However , he blames Ethiopia 's government for not doing more to help him look after all his children .
People see me as a funny man , but there is no fun in my condition
Ayattu Nure
But his biggest complaint at the moment is with the authorities of the local school which 40 of his children now attend .
They want photographs for each of his children 's files , which will further deplete his meagre resources .
He says that he tries to share his time evenly between his wives and children , adding that although quarrels and squabbles are common , they try to solve their problems amicably .
" People see me as a funny man , but there is no fun in my condition .
I am a desperate man struggling to survive , " he says .
Although Mr Ayattu 's eldest son , Dagne Ayattu , does not have a job , at the age of 33 , he has seven children and is about to marry his fourth wife .
But he says he will not have as many children or wives as his father .
SafeD

I 've seen some very good programmers move away from C++ in favor of languages like Java or C#.
Being a hard - core C++ programmer myself , I wondered why anyone would want to switch to a less powerful and less efficient language .
Mind you , I could understand why a newcomer would opt for a simpler , flatter - learning - curve language but , once somebody invested the time and effort to become proficient in C++ , why in the world would they want to abandon it ?
The universal reason I 've heard from the turncoats was “ productivity . ”
The consensus seems to be that programmers are more productive using Java , C# , Ruby , or Python then they are using C ++.
What are the major impediments to productive programming in C ++?
Horrible syntax is one .
This is actually more serious than it sounds .
A good programmer can probably master some pretty horrible syntaxes given enough time .
The problem is that C++ syntax and grammar is not only human - unfriendly but also parser - hostile .
The fact that the Java market is saturated with productivity boosting tools is the reflection of the language 's parseability .
I have to yet see a C++ programming environment that would offer such powerful refactoring tools as are commonplace in Java .
Language safety is the other major factor .
C++ is notorious for presenting a never ending gallery of opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot .
In fact C++ not only provides the opportunity to write dangerous code , it encourages it .
At some point a major C++ compiler vendor marked a portion of STL algorithms as " deprecated " because of safety concerns .
In particular the C++ Standard Library , in accordance with the spirit of C++ , extends the number of ways a buffer overflow bug might sneak into your program .
One notorious example is the std:: swap_ranges algorithm , which takes three iterators .
The first two iterators are supposed to delimit one range , the third one marks the beginning of the second range .
No testing is done whether the second range does n't extend past the end of the container .
When it does , virus writers rejoice !
The pipe dream of programming language designers is to be able to guarantee that if a program compiles successfully , it will work .
Of course you have to be reasonable about your definition of a " working " program .
For instance , you might require that the program will never get " stuck " — a term which has a precise meaning in computer science , but loosely means that the program will not GP - fault on you ( it is stuck in the sense that there is no well - defined system - independent next step ) .
Languages that have such a property are called " sound " .
Guess what , there is a well - defined ( and meaningful ) subset of Java that is sound .
Real - life Java programs , for practical reasons , stray outside of this sound subset ; but at least the use of unsafe features is less prevalent and easier to spot in a Java program than it is in a C++ program .
In practice , a Java compiler will detect more bugs in your program than a C++ compiler , and that translates directly into less time spent debugging — ergo , higher productivity .
So what are the good features of C ++?
Performance is one .
It 's really hard to beat C++ performance .
If your program has to be fast and responsive you have little choice but to write it in C++ ( or , in rare cases , in C or assembly ) .
Then there are the low - level features of C++ that let you write programs interacting directly with hardware .
For instance , C and C++ are still kings of embedded programming .
C++ offers powerful abstractions , in particular the ability to write generic code .
Java and C# have their own generics but they are feeble compared to what C++ has to offer .
All these features make C++ an ideal language for writing operating systems .
Operating systems are huge programs that have to be fast and interact directly with hardware .
But even outside operating systems there are a lot of applications that have to be large and fast .
So it looks like the programming world could be nicely partitioned between C++ , Java , C# and the likes .
And it all makes sense as long as you believe in the unavoidability of tradeoffs .
But there is no law of nature that says , You have to trade productivity for power .
What about a language that is built like an onion .
It has a reasonably simple and safe core , which is not unlike Java or C# .
A programmer can quickly master a safe subset of it and be as productive as a Java programmer ( if not more ) .
And what if the safe subset offered performance that was comparable to C ++?
And then , the same language has outer layers that can be mastered gradually , as the need arises .
It offers low - level features to grind the hardware , and high - level features to generate code on demand .
It offers modularity and implementation hiding .
It has unrivaled compile time features that enable lightning fast runtime performance .
I 'll let you in on a secret , this language is D .
Programming Pitfalls
Did you know that the famous " Hello World ! " program , which is usually the first program people write in C , exposes some of the most dangerous features of the language ?
It contains this statement :
printf ( " Hello World !
" ) ;
printf
int printf ( const char * restrict format , ... ) ;
Consider the signature of
( restrict is a new C keyword . )
First of all , it 's a function that takes a variable number of arguments .
The number and the types of arguments are encoded in the format string .
When is the match between the format and the argument list checked ?
Not at compile time — the compiler has no understanding of the format string ( although some compilers may issue warnings if the string is statically known ) .
At runtime then ?
Well , guess again .
Consider this :
If the programmer makes a mistake of calling printf with too few arguments , he or she will not get a nice error code or exception .
Here 's what the C Standard says about this situation :
If there are insufficient arguments for the format , the behavior is undefined .
Undefined behavior is the worst thing that may happen to a program .
If you 're lucky , the program will fault and terminate without prejudice .
If you 're not so lucky , the program will continue in a compromised state and , in the worst case , it will execute malicious code that will take over your computer .
The second dangerous feature of printf is its use of a pointer .
It is up to the diligence of the programmer to ensure that a pointer points to a valid piece of data .
In the " Hello World ! " example , the pointer points to a null - terminated static string , so we 're fine .
But the following program will compile too :
char * format = 0 ; printf ( format ) ;
Guess what happens .
Inside printf the pointer is dereferenced and then all bets are off .
Again , citing the C Standard ,
If an invalid value has been assigned to the pointer , the behavior of the unary * operator is undefined .
Let 's talk about pointers some more .
Every memory allocation returns a valid pointer ( unless the program runs out of memory ) .
You might think that dereferencing such a pointer would be safe .
That is correct as long as your program does n't free the allocated memory thus ending the lifetime of the object .
After that , you are dealing with a dangling pointer and all bets are off .
Again , C Standard is pretty upfront about it .
Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer by the unary * operator are a null pointer , an address inappropriately aligned for the type of object pointed to , and the address of an object after the end of its lifetime .
As you can see , C was not designed for the faint of heart .
It 's a low - level language and the programmer better know what he or she is doing or suffer the consequences .
C++ is different though , right ?
Throughout its history , C++ has been struggling with C legacy .
A lot of constructs have been provided to patch the unsafe features of C .
For instance , the " Hello World ! " program in C++ might be transformed to a safer version .
std:cout << " Hello World ! " << std::endl ;
There is no variable argument count , and the std :: cout object is smart enough to understand the types of arguments passed to it ( still , many programmers continue using printf in C++ , if only for its syntactic simplicity ) .
Unlike in C , memory allocation in C++ is typed and combined with object construction ( as long as you stay away from malloc and free ) .
That 's the good part .
However , objects still have to be explicitly recycled ( deleted ) .
And after recycling , the program is still left with dangling pointers , whose dereferencing — you guessed it — leads to undefined behavior .
Whereas pointers were important in C , C++ embraced them as the main vehicle for the Standard Library .
STL algorithms use iterators , objects that are either pointers themselves or imitate the behavior ( and the pitfalls ) of pointers .
Just like with pointers , a programmer 's error in using iterators leads to undefined behavior ( see the swap_range example ) .
In response to C/ C++'s inherent lack of safety , languages like Java and C# took a different path .
They either ban pointers altogether or relegate them to special " unsafe " blocks .
Memory management , with its risk of accessing recycled data , is taken away from the programmer and dealt with by automatic garbage collection .
There are many other simplifications and safety improvements over C++.
Unfortunately they all come at the expense of expressive power and performance .
The SafeD Subset
In D , we expect the vast majority of programmers to operate within the safe subset of D , which we call SafeD .
The safety and the ease of use of SafeD is comparable to Java — in fact Java programs can be machine - translated into this safe subset of D. SafeD is easy to learn and it keeps the programmers away from undefined behaviors .
It is also very efficient .
When you enter SafeD , you leave your pointers , unchecked casts and unions at the door .
Memory management is provided to you courtesy of Garbage Collection .
Class objects are passed around using opaque handles .
Arrays and strings are bound - checked ( it 's possible to turn the checks off with a compiler switch , but then you 're no longer in SafeD ) .
You may still write code that will throw a runtime exception ( e.g. , array out - of - bounds error , or uninitialized - class - object error ) , but you wo n't be able to overwrite memory that has n't been allocated to you or that has already been recycled .
Let 's look at the " Hello World ! " program in D .
On the face of it , it 's not much different than its C counterpart :
writeln ( " Hello Safe World ! " ) ;
The function writeln is the equivalent of the C printf ( more precisely , it 's the representative of a family of output functions including write and its formatting versions , writef and writefln ) .
Just like printf , writeln accepts a variable number of arguments of arbitrary types .
But here the similarity ends .
As long as you pass SafeD - arguments to writeln , you are guaranteed not to encounter any undefined behavior .
Here , writeln is called with a single argument of the type string .
In contrast to C , D string is not a pointer .
It is an array of immutable char , and arrays are a built into the safe subset of D .
You might be interested to know how the safety of writeln is accomplished in D .
One possible approach would have been to make writeln a compiler intrinsic , so that correct code would be generated on a case - by - case basis .
The beauty of D is that it gives a sophisticated programmer tools that allow such case - by - case code generation of code .
The advanced features used in the implementation of writeln are :
Compile - time code generation using templates , and
A safe mechanism for dealing with variable number of arguments using tuples .
SafeD Libraries
One of the major differences between Java and D is that D has enough power to let an advanced programmer implement libraries that can be used within SafeD .
A lot of advanced features of D are compatible with SafeD , as long as they do n't force the user to use unsafe types .
For instance , a library may provide the implementation of a generic list .
The list can be instantiated with any type , in particular with a pointer type .
A list of pointers , by definition , cannot be safe , because pointer arithmetic is unsound .
However , a list of ints or class objects can and should be safe .
That 's why such ageneric lists can be used in SafeD , even though their usage outside of SafeD may be unsafe .
Moreover , it might be more efficient to base the internal implementation of a list on pointers .
As long as these pointers are not exposed to the client , such an implementation might be certified to be SafeD compatible1 .
You can have a cake ( advanced features of D ) and eat it too ( take advantage of them in SafeD ) .
One User's Experience
Even before I came up with the idea of SafeD2 , I tried to restrict myself to the safe subset of D for most of my projects .
I was surprised how much could be accomplished and how my productivity soared .
I also showed SafeD to my co-worker , a C++ programmer , and he was able to learn it in a very short time .
So far my experience has been that if a SafeD program compiles without errors then , in a vast majority of cases , it runs without errors , and does what I want it to do .
That definitely has n't been my experience with C++.
What is even more surprising to me is that I was able to accomplish all that with almost non-existing support from tools and with a compiler that excels in cryptic error messages .
D is still lacking a lot of infrastructure , but I can imagine how easy programming will be when a critical mass of productivity tools sprouts around it .
And unlike C++ , D is easy to parse and its front end is open source .
So there are no barriers to entry for tool writers .
Footnotes
There is no central authority to issue such certifications , each library provider has to establish a level of trust with its clients .
In particular , you should expect the D standard library to be SafeD certified by the compiler provider .
The name , SafeD , was proposed by David B. Held .

T Boone Pickens is famous for thinking big .
He founded his Texan oil company , Mesa Petroleum , in 1956 with just $ 2,500 ( £ 1,200 ) in the bank .
After a string of audacious takeovers he turned it into an independent empire that challenged the big oil companies , and today he is worth $ 3bn .
Now this straight - talking Southerner is launching the biggest and most audacious project of his career .
This month he will make the first down payment on 500 wind turbines at a cost of $ 2 m each .
The order is the first material step towards his goal of building the world 's largest wind farm .
Over the next four years he intends to erect 2,700 turbines across 200,000 acres of the Texan panhandle .
The scheme is five times bigger than the world 's current record - holding wind farm and when finished will supply 4,000 megawatts of electricity - enough to power about one million homes .
It 's not just the breathtaking scale of the scheme that is striking , though at a total cost of $ 10bn it impresses even Pickens himself : " It 's pretty mind boggling , " he says .
The fact that Pickens , a tycoon who made his fortune in oil , has turned his attention to wind power is an indication of how the tectonic plates are moving .
Until recently wind was seen as marginal and alternative ; now it is being eyed by Wall Street .
" Do n't get the idea that I 've turned green , " Pickens tells the Guardian in the Dallas offices of his new venture Mesa Power .
" My business is making money , and I think this is going to make a lot of money . "
His fascination with wind developed as Pickens engaged in his favourite leisure pursuit - quail hunting .
For years he has been shooting Bobwhite quail on his 68,000 - acre ranch in the panhandle .
" I 've been hunting quail for 50 years , I know where the wind is , " Pickens says .
The idea formed that this area of Texas , with its wide - open space , low population and steady south - westerlies would make a perfect location for wind - generated energy .
Studies proved him right - there was more wind than even he had imagined , much of it at peak times in the middle of the day when power sells at a premium .
So he set about convincing neighbouring ranchers to join his scheme , promising them between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 in annual royalties for every turbine they allowed on their land .
They have all signed up , eager to cash in on this literal windfall .
( Pickens , by contrast , refuses to have any of the turbines placed on his own ranch .
" They are ugly ! " he says , unashamedly . )
To see exactly what the promise is to ranchers and rural communities of the new dash for wind , you have to drive four hours west of Dallas into the Texan prairies .
Until a couple of years ago Sweetwater was a gently declining railroad town , its population falling year on year and its infrastructure quietly rotting .
Now it is a boom town , a 21st - century equivalent of the Wild West .
German wind technicians who have poured into the area have coined a name for it - the Wind West .
The three largest wind farms in America are all situated in the surrounding area , Nolan county , which , with a population of just 18,000 , now produces more wind power than the UK , France and California .
While other towns in the region are struggling with plummeting house prices and job losses , Sweetwater is in the midst of a construction explosion .
Two new companies opened this week , one servicing the blades of the county 's 2,000 turbines , another renting out cranes used in erecting new turbines .
The turbines , state of the art models 400 feet to the tip of their blades , span out for 150 miles in any direction .
New roads and houses are going up , and local schools and medical centres have been renovated using the influx of tax revenues from the energy companies .
Greg Wortham , Sweetwater 's mayor , says he has watched over the past two years as wind power was transformed " from a hobby - a green thing - into an industry .
Suddenly it was all about welders and engineers and truckers .
We have companies here begging for new workers and paying them more than the thousands being laid off by the car companies . "
Back in Dallas , Pickens believes there are several reasons to invest in this new energy source .
Beyond the mere profit motive , which clearly excites him , there is the fact that Texan oil has been on the wane since it peaked at 10 m barrels a day in 1973 , and is already down to half that amount .
" Oil fields have a declining curve - you find one , it peaks and starts downhill , you 've got to find another one to replace it .
It drives you crazy !
With wind , there 's no decline . "
There is also a political edge to his obsession .
Politics and Pickens go together , as is obvious from the walls of his offices , lined with photographs of him with world leaders .
One shows him with the Queen , Prince Philip and George HW Bush ; another is with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan ; a third shows him on board Air Force One with the current President Bush .
There is a signed calendar from Arnold Schwarzenegger on the table .
As the pictures suggest , Pickens has for many years been a major financial backer of both George Bushes , but he professes to be frustrated by the lack of action on energy by this administration and all its predecessors .
" George Bush has done nothing .
Nothing .
Every guy that ran for president clear back to Nixon said he would make us energy independent , but not one goddamned thing has been done .
Zero .
The biggest problem facing the United States in the next 50 years is energy and nobody has come up with a solution . "
Pickens , being Pickens , has come up with a solution - and it makes his own gargantuan plans for a wind farm in the panhandle look tiny .
For the benefit of the Guardian , he draws on a white board his master scheme .
He carves out an enormous corridor of land running north to south through the middle of the US - along the great plains - where he would build an army of wind farms .
Then he draws an equally enormous corridor running east to west from Texas to southern California which he would similarly dedicate to solar energy .
" You need a giant plan for America .
Not the pissant 83 megawatt [ windfarm ] deals being stamped all over the country .
There needs to be a huge plan from someone with leadership .
It 's going to take years to do , but it has to start now . "
Only then , he explains , can the US stop what he regards as the madness of a flood of money flowing out of America to the oil producers of the Middle East .
" That money is going God knows where - a few friends , a lot of enemies .
We 've got to stop it . "
T Boone Pickens certainly is thinking big .
And all this as he prepares to celebrate his 80th birthday next month .
How is it that he appears to be expanding his ambitions at a stage in life when most people are retrenching theirs ?
" You 're getting older so you are running out of time , " he says .
" So let 's go !
We have n't got long , and we 've got to get this job finished . "
The exchange between the two men happened on a windy boulevard shortly before 5 p.m .
The first , a professional violinist without a violin .
The second , an animal rescue investigator turned treasure hunter carrying an oblong leather case in his hand .
Within moments the deal was done .
Hands were shaken , one man walked away $ 1,000 the richer .
The other clutched his newly retrieved 1972 Ansaldo Poggi beneath his chin and serenaded passers - by with that old familiar tune , So Happy Together by The Turtles .
But somewhere , beyond the reach of the notes vibrating off the violinist 's bow , a lone bag lady wandered , not knowing how close she had come to a $ 1,000 reward .
Things could n't have turned out better for Jim Wallenberg , a veteran violinist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra .
Wallenberg lost the $ 77,000 violin on Saturday when he left it at the streetcar shelter at Queens Quay and Spadina and then boarded a streetcar bound for Union Station .
Unable to find the violin upon his return to the shelter , he offered a reward for its safe return .
What he did n't know was that a bag lady , well known among Queens Quay Blvd.
residents as a loud woman with a shopping cart filled with bottles , bags and licence plates , had picked up the violin , placed it in her cart and carried on down the street .
On Monday , after hearing of the reward , Wayne Wulff , a local animal rescue investigator , spotted the violin case in the bag lady 's cart and called Wallenberg to confirm the reward .
" I said : ` I might have seen a case in a homeless person 's cart in the area .
I do n't know if it 's a violin case , it 's sort of a long brown oblong case , ' " Wulff recounted moments after the handover .
" He said , ` Oh my god , can you go and find this lady or do what you can to track her down ? ' "
Knowing for the first time of the total amount of the reward , Wulff went looking again for the bag lady , finally catching up with her in a park at the south corner of Bathurst St. and Queens Quay Blvd .
and began bartering for the violin .
" I told her : ` That case there belongs to a friend of mine and I 'm willing to give you everything I have , ' " Wulff said .
Everything Wulff had amounted to $ 35 and a shiny silver ring worth no more than $ 40 , which he exchanged with the lady – whom he described as " very angry " – for the violin .
Then he called Wallenberg back to announce that he had retrieved the instrument and the two men set a time and place for the exchange .
Neither Wulff nor Wallenberg seemed terribly bothered by the absence of the bag lady from the scene of the exchange .
" I do n't think she was robbed of $ 1,000 , " said Wallenberg , adding he was extremely relieved to have the 36 - year - old violin that had once belonged to his mother back in his possession .
" She took the violin and kept it for herself and did n't contact me .
She could have contacted me , she could have left it there , but maybe she did n't know what it was and might have thought that it was up for grabs .
If she had contacted me and said : ` I 'm so and so and I 've found this violin , ' I would have given her the $ 1,000 . "

Wulff , who did n't tell the woman about the reward money before cutting the deal for a fist full of dollars and a shiny ring , said she would n't have understood what he was saying had he told her the value of what was resting in her cart .
" There was obviously a problem with communicating with her .
She 's constantly talking to herself , so I do n't think she understood the magnitude of what was in the case , " Wulff said .
Wulff is adamant that he did what he had to to get the violin back safely , but said he would consider giving a larger portion of the $ 1,000 to the bag lady if he sees her again .
In the meantime , he 's planning to put the money toward a trip to Las Vegas .
Simroid , the silicone - skinned , pneumatically - powered female patient robot designed to help train dental students , recently appeared on the Fuji TV show Idainaru Miraizukan .
( Watch video . )
In addition to highlighting Simroid 's ability to interact with dentists and react to mouth pain , the show features an interview with Dr. Naotake Shibui of the Nippon Dental University in Tokyo , who helped develop the robot with engineers from Kokoro Co. , Ltd .
According to the interview , Simroid is modeled after a 28 - year - old woman , and her fear of dentists and sensitivity to pain have earned her the nickname " Pain Girl " ( Ita - gaaru ) .
Asked why Simroid is female , Shibui explains that female patients must be treated with more sensitivity than male patients .
With sensors embedded in her chest , Simroid can teach dentists - in - training to pay close attention to where they place their elbows .
Simroid 's primary purpose is to help dental students improve their patient communication skills .
Washington D.C. -
Three powerful House Commerce Committee Chairmen strongly urged their colleagues Thursday to defer acting on requests for retroactive immunity and to demand more information from the White House and the telecommunications companies in the wake of disclosures by another whistleblower that the government apparently has been granted an open gateway to wireless communications by a major telecommunications company .
Babak Pasdar , a computer security consultant , has gone public about his discovery of a mysterious " Quantico Circuit " while working for an unnamed major wireless carrier .
Pasdar believes that this circuit gives the U.S. government direct , unfettered access to customers voice calls and data packets .
These claims echo the disclosures from retired AT&T technician Mark Klein , who has described a " secret room " in an AT&T facility .
The White House is putting heavy pressure on lawmakers to grant the telecoms immunity from lawsuits over the spying as part of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) legislation pending in Congress .
But in today 's letter -- written by John Dingell , Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce ; Ed Markey , Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet ; and Bart Stupak , Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations -- the congressmen argue lawmakers must not " vote in the dark " on the immunity issue when " profound privacy and security risks " are involved .
" When you put Mr. Pasdar 's information together with that of AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , there is troubling evidence of telecom misconduct in massive domestic surveillance of ordinary Americans , " said Cindy Cohn , Legal Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) .
" Congress needs to have hearings and get some answers about whether American telecommunications companies are helping the government to illegally spy on millions of us .
Retroactive immunity for telecom companies now ought to be off the table in the ongoing FISA debate . "
EFF represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecommunications company of violating their rights by illegally assisting the National Security Agency in widespread domestic surveillance .
The Hepting case is just one of many suits aimed at holding telecoms responsible for knowingly violating federal privacy laws with warrantless wiretapping and the illegal transfer of vast amounts of personal data to the government .

Barack Obama supporter , and former Clinton Energy Secretary , Federico Peña released a statement today about what he called Hillary Clinton ’s gas tax holiday , “ gimmick . ”
“ Today we ’re seeing another example of Washington politics at its worst .
Senator Clinton is running TV ads and launching repeated attacks on Barack Obama for not supporting the gas tax holiday she ’s supporting , but today her own aides told the Washington Post that they know that this is a questionable plan and that they are using it to make it appear they ’re against big oil , ” Peña said .
He called the Clinton / McCain plan a pandering insult to people ’s intelligence , “ The Clinton gas tax gimmick does little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and will actually increase oil prices .
It is the kind of pandering that insults people ’s intelligence .
With energy prices skyrocketing , we ’re looking for real solutions — not political posturing to get elected . ”

I expected this kind of empty headed pandering from a candidate with no ideas , such as John McCain , but if Hillary Clinton was half the candidate that she claimed to be , she would never stoop this low .
Clinton is obviously so desperate now that she is willing to invent issues about debates and gas tax holidays just to try to get ahead of Obama .
I think what everybody forgets when they talk about this issue is that since none of these candidates will be president this summer , so this whole discussion is nothing more than fantasy .
We have been down the gas tax holiday road before , and it does n’t work .
Gasoline is not expensive because it is overtaxed , but because the price has been jacked up due to an over speculative market .
The reason why the price is so high is because people would rather go bankrupt at the pump , than change their consumption patterns .
Gas tax holidays are n’t the answer , but electing a president that will promote a new energy strategy that will cut consumption and develop alternative fuels is .
Neither Clinton nor McCain is interested in finding solutions to the nation ’s problems .
A gas tax holiday would create more problems than it solves , and this is why it has zero chance of ever happening .

After a Month in Vista , This Pretty Much Sums Up My Feelings About Operating Systems
The loss of sea ice due to climate change could spell disaster for polar bears and other Arctic marine mammals .
Sea ice is the common habitat feature uniting these unique and diverse Arctic inhabitants .
Sea ice serves as a platform for resting and reproduction , influences the distribution of food sources , and provides a refuge from predators .
The loss of sea ice poses a particularly severe threat to Arctic species , such as the hooded seal , whose natural history is closely tied to , and depends on , sea ice .
The Arctic undergoes dramatic seasonal transformation .
Arctic marine mammals appear to be well adapted to the extremes and variability of this environment , having survived past periods of extended warming and cooling .
" However , the rate and scale of current climate change are expected to distinguish current circumstances from those of the past several millennia .
These new conditions present unique challenges to the well - being of Arctic marine mammals , " says Sue Moore ( NOAA / Alaska Fisheries Science Center ) .
The April Special Issue of Ecological Applications examines such potential effects , puts them in historical context , and describes possible conservation measures to mitigate them .
The assessment reflects the latest thinking of experts representing multiple scientific disciplines .
Climate change will pose a variety of threats to marine mammals .
For some , such as polar bears , it is likely to reduce the availability of their prey , requiring them to seek alternate food .
Authors Bodil Bluhm and Rolf Gradinger ( University of Alaska , Fairbanks ) note that while some Arctic marine mammal species may be capable of adjusting to changing food availability , others may be handicapped by their very specific food requirements and hunting techniques .
Species such as the walrus and polar bear fall under this category , while the beluga whale and bearded seal are among those who are more opportunistic in their eating habits and therefore potentially less vulnerable , at least in this regard .
Using a quantitative index of species sensitivity to climate change , Kristin Laidre ( University of Washington ) and colleagues found that the most sensitive Arctic marine mammals appear to be the hooded seal , polar bear , and the narwhal , primarily due to their reliance on sea ice and specialized feeding .
Shifts in the prey base of Arctic marine mammals would likely lead to changes in body condition and potentially affect the immune system of marine mammals , according to Kathy Burek ( Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services ) .
She and fellow researchers point out that climate change may alter pathogen transmission and exposure to infectious diseases , possibly lowering the health of marine mammals and , in the worst case , their survival .
Changing environmental conditions , including more frequent bouts of severe weather and rising air and water temperatures , also could impact the health of Arctic marine mammals .
The effects of climate change will be compounded by a host of secondary factors .
The loss of ice will open the Arctic to new levels of shipping , oil and gas exploration and drilling , fishing , hunting , tourism , and coastal development .
These , in turn , will add new threats to marine mammal populations , including ship strikes , contaminants , and competition for prey .
Timothy Ragen ( US Marine Mammal Commission ) and colleagues describe how conservation measures may be able to address the secondary effects of climate change , but that only reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can -- over the long - term -- conserve Arctic marine mammals and the Arctic ecosystems on which they depend .

A man was yesterday ordered to sell his home and give his ex-partner half the proceeds - even though they are n't married .
Carl Barron lived with Lynne Fowler for 17 years in the home where they raised their two children .
But despite the fact that he paid for the mortgage , the Court of Appeal decided she is entitled to half of the £ 150,000 property .
The ruling could set a legal precedent that unmarried couples who live together and buy a home must split the proceeds equally .
However , other cases have directly contradicted this judgement .
Government proposals on cohabiting couples , which are designed to address the issue of home ownership , were recently put on hold .
Scroll down for more ...
Equal share :
The ruling could set a legal precedent that unmarried couples who live together and buy a home must split the proceeds equally
Retired firefighter Mr Barron and Miss Fowler , 43 , moved into their house in Bognor Regis , Sussex in 1983 , which they registered in both their names .
They were together for a total of 23 years during which time they had two children Nicholas , now 20 , and Sarah , now 13 .
In court it was agreed that Mr Barron had paid the deposit , the mortgage and the bills on the property out of his pension .
Miss Fowler , for her part , worked most of the time and spent her income on family holidays , food and looking after the children .
When the couple split in 2005 Mr Barron was declared the ' beneficial ' owner in a county court ruling .
Yesterday , however , Lady Justice Arden , and two other Appeal Court judges , overturned that decision .
The judge said the joint name registry was a deliberate choice and it must be legally presumed that ownership was equal .
Justice Arden said : " I do not think that it is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that Miss Fowler should have no share of the house if the relationship broke down .
" That might leave Miss Fowler dependent on state benefits and housing for support . "
A previous ruling at The House of Lords , however , came to the exact opposite conclusion .
In April last year five Law Lords ruled that a father of four was not entitled to half of the family home he had shared with his girlfriend of 20 years because she had contributed more money to buy it .
Plans for reform of the law for cohabiting couples was finalised last year by the Law Commission .
They suggested that the better - off partner of a live - in couple that splits up would pay compensation to the other if they have children .
A live - in partner would also be liable for compensation once the couple had lived together for more than two years .
The reforms are currently on hold while ministers investigate how much it will cost in legal aid .
One in six couples living together are unmarried , 67 per cent more than ten years ago .
This is expected to rise to one in four by 2031 .

In a paper published in February by the leading scientific journal Nature , scientists at the Consortium for Conservation Medicine ( CCM ) Wildlife Trust New York , the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) , Columbia University ( New York ) and the University of Georgia announced a major breakthrough in the understanding of what causes diseases like HIV / AIDS and SARS to emerge , and how to further predict and prevent future devastating pandemics by plotting a global map of " Disease Hotspots . "
Collaborating author Peter Daszak , Executive Director of the Consortium for Conservation Medicine at Wildlife Trust , tells us why this research is so important .
Here is part of his interview .
To read the full interview , go to the Wildlife Trust website at http://www.wildlifetrust.org.
Q : Peter , tell me about this breakthrough research .
A : Emerging infectious diseases ( EIDs ) are diseases that have recently appeared in our populations , and they ’re considered a major threat to global health .
Yet , despite over 30 years of work on them , scientists have not been able to predict when or where the next disease will come from .
We set out to do this , by analyzing the patterns of previous disease emergence .
We found that , first , emerging diseases are definitely increasing over time , something that has been proposed , but not proven until now .
Second , we showed that the factors that cause these diseases to emerge are directly related to us – humans – that is , population growth , and the way we change the environment .
We found that the most common EIDs are caused by drug - resistant microbes , and by microbes that come from other animals ( especially wildlife ) .
This latter group includes most of the really significant EIDs , or zoonoses , like HIV / AIDS , influenza and Ebola .
One of the big findings of our work is that these diseases are on the rise also , and that they are most likely to emerge in the future from developing countries in the tropics , a region where our surveillance programs are poorest .
So our work shows us that we need to change the way we allocate global funds and scientific expertise to really beat this problem .
Q : So , emerging diseases are on the rise but in particular zoonoses .
What are zoonoses and why do you think they ’re on the rise ?
A : Zoonoses are infectious diseases caused by microbes that come from other animals , for example , mad cow disease , monkeypox , Ebola virus , HIV / AIDS .
They ’re on the rise because there is increasing contact with wildlife in regions where we 're encroaching on their habitat .
Hunting wildlife for food , bringing livestock into contact with them and the wildlife trade are some of the most important ways zoonoses emerge .
Also , do n’t forget we live in a globalized planet , where new pathogens can rapidly spread through our population .
Q : What sparked your interest in this line of research ?
Were you always interested in the spread of pandemic diseases ?
A : I first got interested in emerging diseases when I was part of a team that discovered a new disease of frogs that was wiping out populations in the tropics .
I worked at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta at the time , and I noticed the similarities between this wildlife disease and the emerging diseases affecting people ( HIV , hantavirus , Lyme disease ) .
It was amazing to me that these diseases seem to emerge out of nowhere , and despite all the research , no one seemed to have analyzed the processes through which they emerge .
Q : What was the most unexpected or exciting result from the research , what surprised you ?
A : That we ’ve managed to identify a major gap in the way we deal with emerging diseases on a global scale .
That is , while most of our research effort is focused on the richer , developed countries ( the ones that can afford it most ) , the most significant EIDs will be emerging in the developing countries of the tropics .
Our work means we can now target these EID ' hotspots ' for what I call " Smart Surveillance " , and try to identify the next HIV or SARS before it even emerges .
A press release about this research is available here .

Most scientists involved in Aids research believe that a vaccine against HIV is further away than ever and some have admitted that effective immunisation against the virus may never be possible , according to an unprecedented poll conducted by The Independent .
A mood of deep pessimism has spread among the international community of Aids scientists after the failure of a trial of a promising vaccine at the end of last year .
It just was the latest in a series of setbacks in the 25 - year struggle to develop an HIV vaccine .
The Independent 's survey of more than 35 leading Aids scientists in Britain and the United States found that just two were now more optimistic about the prospects for an HIV vaccine than they were a year ago ; only four said they were more optimistic now than they were five years ago .

Nearly two thirds believed that an HIV vaccine will not be developed within the next 10 years and some of them said that it may take at least 20 more years of research before a vaccine can be used to protect people either from infection or the onset of Aids .
A substantial minority of the scientists admitted that an HIV vaccine may never be developed , and even those who believe that one could appear within the next 10 years added caveats saying that such a vaccine would be unlikely to work as a truly effective prophylactic against infection by the virus .
One of the major conclusions to emerge from the failed clinical trial of the most promising prototype vaccine , manufactured by the drug company Merck , was that an important animal model used for more than a decade , testing HIV vaccines on monkeys before they are used on humans , does not in fact work .
This has meant that prototype HIV vaccines which appear to work well when tested on monkeys infected with an artificial virus do not work when tested on human volunteers at risk of HIV – a finding that will be exploited by anti-vivisectionist campaigners opposed to vaccine experiments on primates .
Anthony Fauci , the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , near Washington , told The Independent that the animal model – which uses genetically engineered simian and human immunodeficiency viruses in a combination , known as SHIV – failed to predict what will happen when a prototype vaccine is moved from laboratory monkeys to people .
" We 've learnt a few important things [ from the clinical trial ] .
We 've learnt that one of the animal models , the SHIV model , really does n't predict very well at all , " he said .
" At least we now know that you can get a situation where it looks like you are protecting against SHIV and you 're not protecting at all in the human model – that 's important , " he said .
The NIAID spends about $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) on HIV vaccine research each year and despite calls from some Aids pressure groups for funds to be diverted to other forms of Aids prevention , Dr Fauci said this was not the time to stop vaccine research .
" I do n't think you should say that this is the point where we 're going to give up on developing a vaccine .
I think you continue given that there are so many unanswered questions to answer , " he said .
" There is an impression given by some that if you do vaccine research you are neglecting other areas of prevention .
That 's not the case .
We should and we are doing them simultaneously . "

More than 80 per cent of the scientists who took part in our survey agreed that it was now important to change the direction of HIV vaccine research , given the failure of the Merck clinical trial , which was cancelled when it emerged that the vaccine may have actually increased the chances of people developing Aids .
Robert Gallo , a prominent Aids researcher in the US who is credited with co-discovering the virus in the early 1980s , likened the vaccine 's failure to the Challenger disaster , which forced Nasa to ground the space shuttle fleet for years .
At the end of last month , Dr Fauci convened a high - level summit of leading HIV specialists at a hotel in Bethesda , Maryland , to discuss the future direction of research .
A group of 14 prominent Aids specialists had already written to Dr Fauci suggesting that his institute had " lost its way " in terms of an HIV vaccine .
He said that one outcome of the meeting was a refocusing of the vaccine effort away from expensive clinical trials towards more fundamental research to understand the basic biology of the virus and its effects on the human immune system .
" We 'll be turning the knob more towards answering some fundamental questions rather than going into big clinical trials , " Dr Fauci said .
" I 'm certainly disappointed that we 're not further ahead in the development of a vaccine but I do n't say that this year I 'm more discouraged than I was last year .
I always knew from the beginning that it would be a very difficult task given what we know about this very elusive virus . "
About 33 million people in the world are infected with HIV and some 26 million have died of Aids since the pandemic began .
The majority of scientists who responded to The Independent 's survey said that a vaccine would be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus given the failure of many education programmes .
Winnie Sseruma , 46 : ' For me , the key has been not to give up '
Ms Sseruma says she believes abandoning research for a vaccine would mean a loss of hope for millions of people .
" When I was diagnosed , nearly 20 years ago , it was when the first drugs had come on the market .
A lot of people had said before then that there was no hope and that all efforts should be put into prevention .
But look where we are now .
We cannot lose hope ; we need to invest in a vaccine . "
She says this latest failure needs to be seen as the first hurdle , not a signal to give up .
" Yes , the scientists have not been very successful in their quest for a vaccine , but you can learn a lot from failures .
Now they have realised they cannot use the normal routes used to develope simpler vaccines . "
Ms Sseruma lives in London , but was born in Uganda and says that the current climate of pessimism for the vaccine is not dissimilar to the initial doubts over the likelihood of treating HIV in Africa .
" I remember when treatment started being available in the West and people were saying it would be impossible to send it to Africa .
But look what 's happened .
We should always do whatever is humanly possible to fight Aids .
It 's been a long journey , but for me , the key has been not to give up , and the scientists need to have the same attitude . "
' Philippe B ' , 42 : ' People are getting resistant to drugs '
" Philippe " , who wishes to remain anonymous , discovered he was HIV positive 11 years ago .
The 42 - year - old believes the search for the vaccination should no longer be a priority , but that it should not stop altogether .
" Unfortunately what 's happening now is that people are getting more resistant to drug treatment , and more money needs to be put into finding more drugs for treatment , " he said .
For people like Philippe , the fear of building an immunity to drugs and running out of options is a real one .
He believes that as long as scientists are still pessimistic about the chances of successfully finding a vaccine , money needs to be invested in continuing to fund research into treatment .
" I 've already become resistant to five combination treatments over the last ten years , and if I was on the last one available I 'd be very afraid .
HIV is not a death sentence in the way it once was , but we do need to fund further research into the drugs that treat it . "
Nevertheless ,
Philippe thinks it is not yet time to abandon all research into a vaccine .
" In my lifetime I do n't think we 'll have a vaccine , but there 's no reason we should believe it is n't possible , " he said .
" But we should now be spending more on other ways of dealing with the disease . "

Editor ’s note : Otis Grigsby ’s version of events differ from that put out by the media and Illinois State Police .
The Herald News
May 1 , 2008
JOLIET — A correctional officer shot while reportedly fighting with state police last week died Monday .
Lernard Grigsby , 48 , of Crest Hill , was pronounced dead at 2:26 a.m. at Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center , Will County Coroner Patrick K. O’Neil reported .
State troopers were called around 4 a.m. Thursday to the correctional officers ’ dormitory at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill .
Trooper Mark Dorencz said a sergeant and a trooper responded and spoke to a woman about a “ domestic disturbance . ”
The pair then spoke to Grigsby , who allegedly attacked them .
He struck the sergeant and the trooper ’s heads and tried to take the sergeant ’s handgun .
“ Fearing for his life and safety , the sergeant shot ( Grigsby ) twice in the torso , ” Dorencz said .
All three were taken to Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center .
The sergeant and trooper were treated for head , neck and facial injuries and released from the hospital Thursday afternoon .
Illinois Department of Corrections spokesman Derek Schnapp said the correctional officers ’ building is on Stateville property outside the prison walls .
“ It ’s a co-ed dorm where officers or staff can live or stay during their workweek so they ’re close to the facility , ” he said .
Schnapp described the building , which was built in 1969 , as a dormitory with “ bare - bones ” furnishings and amenities .
Grigsby was hired as a correctional officer in September 1993 at the Joliet Correctional Center on Collins Street .
He transferred to Stateville after that prison closed in 2002 .
The state police ’s Division of Internal Investigations is investigating .
Grigsby ’s relationship with the woman involved in the dispute is not known .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) -
It looks like a mirage but the lush fields of cauliflower , apricot trees and melon growing among a vast stretch of sand north of Cairo ’s pyramids is all too real -- proof of Egypt ’s determination to turn its deserts green .

While climate change and land over - use help many deserts across the world advance , Egypt is slowly greening the sand that covers almost all of its territory as it seeks to create more space for its growing population .
Tarek el - Kowmey , 45 , points proudly to the banana trees he grows on what was once Sahara sands near the Desert Development Centre , north of Cairo , where scientists experiment with high - tech techniques to make Egypt ’s desert bloom .
“ All of this used to be just sand , ” he said .
“ Now we can grow anything . ”
With only five percent of the country habitable , almost all of Egypt ’s 74 million people live along the Nile River and the Mediterranean Sea .
Already crowded living conditions -- Cairo is one of the most densely populated cities on earth -- will likely get worse as Egypt ’s population is expected to double by 2050 .
So the government is keen to encourage people to move to the desert by pressing ahead with an estimated $ 70 billion plan to reclaim 3.4 million acres of desert over the next 10 years .
Among the incentives are cheap desert land to college graduates .
But to make these areas habitable and capable of cultivation , the government will need to tap into scarce water resources of the Nile River as rainfall is almost non-existent in Egypt .
The plan has raised controversy among some conservationists who say turning the desert green is neither practical nor sustainable and might ultimately backfire .
Anders Jagerskog , director of the Stockholm International Water Institute in Sweden , questions the wisdom of using precious water resources to grow in desert areas unsuited to cultivation and where water will evaporate quickly under the scorching sun .
“ A desert is not the best place to grow food , ” he said .
“ From a political perspective , it makes sense in terms of giving more people jobs even though it is not very rational from a water perspective , ” he added .
REGIONAL TENSION ?
The scope of the reclamations could also add to regional tension over Nile water sharing arrangements as in order to green its desert Egypt might need to take more than its share of Nile water determined by international treaties .
Egypt ’s project to reclaim deserts in the south , called “ Toshka ” , would expand Egypt ’s farmland by about 40 percent by 2017 , using about five billion cubic meters of water a year .
That worries neighbors to the south who are already unhappy about Nile water sharing arrangements .
Under a 1959 treaty between Egypt and Sudan , Egypt won rights to 55.5 billion cubic meters per year , more than half of the Nile ’s total flow .
Ethiopia , where the Blue Nile begins , receives no formal allocation of Nile water , but it is heavily dependent on the water for its own agricultural development in this often famine ravaged country .
“ The Toshka project will complicate the challenge of achieving a more equitable allocation of the Nile River with Ethiopia and the other Nile basin countries , ” said Sandra Postel , director of the U.S. - based Global Water Policy Project .
“ Egypt may be setting the stage for a scenario that ’s ultimately detrimental to itself . ”
But other experts suggest that in the delicate arena of water politics , it may be more of an imperative for Egypt ’s government to mollify its own population rather than heed its neighbors concerns .
Overcrowding is straining infrastructure in the cities and the government is worried that opposition groups such as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood , which has a fifth of the seats in Parliament , might capitalize on discontent .
“ The government feels it needs to reduce the number of people in high density areas , which puts a lot of pressure on resources like fertile land , ” said Mostafa Saleh , professor of ecology at Al Azhar University in Cairo .
“ They are trying to spread the population to other parts of the country . ”
DESERT TOURISM
Some critics say that Egypt should look at desert tourism rather than agriculture , which might not be sustainable or particularly profitable and could destroy fragile wildlife habitats that might otherwise be a drawcard for tourists .
A desert reclamation project last decade , south of Cairo , destroyed much of the Wadi Raiyan oasis and its population of slender horned gazelles .
“ The price tag on these assets is huge , both as natural heritage and as a resource for tourism , ” said ecologist Saleh .
Saleh is vice president of an Egyptian firm that built an electricity - free ecolodge , consisting of rock salt and mud houses , amid olive and palm groves in the desert oasis of Siwa .
The lodge , which costs $ 400 per night and has attracted guests such as Britain ’s Prince Charles and Belgium ’s Queen Paola , shows that the desert would be better used for ecotourism than farming , he says .
“ In Egypt , water is the most critical resource and we should be careful to use it to maximize revenue , ” Saleh explained .
“ Agriculture is not the best option for Egypt .
Nature - based tourism could bring in much more money . ”
At the Desert Development Center , irrigation water comes through a canal connected to the Nile , about 15 km ( nine miles ) away , where it is used to keep crops flourishing and grass green for hardy hybrid cows to graze .
Experts at the centre believe greening the Sahara might be Egypt ’s best hope of bringing prosperity to its people .
Workers graft fruit - bearing plants onto the stems of plants that survive well in the desert .
Favorite fruits are citrus as they flourish in hot climates and can land on supermarket shelves in Europe hours after harvesting .
Proximity to markets in Europe and a lack of pests , which usually thrive in humid environments , make desert farming economically viable , said Richard Tutwiler , director of the Desert Development Center at the American University in Cairo .
Water supply , Tutwiler said , should n’t be an issue at least for the next ten years .
It makes sense , he says , to expand agriculture onto land that was once useless .
“ There is no frost and there is sun all the time here , ” he said .
“ Plants just go nuts . ”

This extends the tracker protocol to support simple obfuscation of the peers it returns , using the infohash as a shared secret between the peer and the tracker .
The obfuscation does not provide any security against eavesdroppers that know the infohash of the torrent .
The goal is to prevent internet service providers and other network administrators from blocking or disrupting bittorrent traffic connections that span between the receiver of a tracker response and any peer IP - port appearing in that tracker response .
The key words " MUST " , " MUST NOT " , " REQUIRED " , " SHALL " , " SHALL NOT " , " SHOULD " , " SHOULD NOT " , " RECOMMENDED " , " MAY " , and " OPTIONAL " in this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119 .
Announce
When using this extension , instead of passing the info_hash parameter to the tracker , a sha_ih is passed .
The value of sha_ih MUST be the info - hash of the torrent , with a second SHA - 1 applied to it .
For example if a torrent has infohash with hex representation aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d then its sha_ih is sha1 ( infohash ) =' 6b4f89a54e2d27ecd7e8da5b4ab8fd9d1d8b119 ' .
The value MUST be url encoded , just like the info_hash .
Thus the sha_ih above when url encoded becomes kO%89%A5N -%27%EC%D7%E8 %DA%05 %B4 %AB%8F%D9%D1%D8%B1%19 .
If the sha_ih is passed then the value for the port parameter should be treated as a 16 bit integer and MUST be obscured as described in the Obfuscation Method section .
Similarly if the optional ip parameter is passed in the announce then its value MUST also be so obscured .
This extension does not change the semantics of any parameter passed in the peer 's announce .
Announce Response
If the tracker supports this extension , the response should be exactly the same as if the info_hash had been passed , except that any field that contains peer information ( such as peers , peers6 or any other field defined by another extension ) MUST be obfuscated as described in the next section .
There are additional parameters the tracker may OPTIONALLY return .
These are discussed in the optimizations section .
Obfuscation Method
The values for the ip and port announce parameters , the returned peer list and any other values that contain peer information are obscured using the method described in this section .
We distinguish between the tracker peer list and the returned peer list .
The tracker peer list contains the ip - port pairs of all known peers in a given torrent , i.e. , those peers that have reported to the tracker that they are transferring the file with a given infohash .
The tracker may store this peer list however it wishes .
The returned peer list contains a packed array of ip - port pairs conforming to the BitTorrent protocol specification .
If the swarm is sufficiently large then the returned ip - port pairs constitute a subset of the ip - port pairs in the tracker peer list .
When a parameter is obscured , it is encrypted using RC4 - drop768 encryption using the infohash as a shared secret and optionally employing an initialization vector .
For the remainder of this document RC4 refers to RC4 - drop768 .
In the process of encryption , RC4 generates a pseudorandom string that is XOR'd with the plaintext to generate the ciphertext .
The receiver recovers the plaintext by generating the same pseudorandom string and XOR'ing it with the ciphertext .
In generating the pseudorandom string , the tracker and client MUST discard the first 768 bytes .
The next 8 bytes in the pseudorandom string are reserved for optimizations discussed in the next section .
To communicate an initialization vector , the tracker includes in the bencoded response the parameter iv with value set to a byte string containing the initialization vector .
The initialization vector can be of arbitrary length and is sent in plaintext .
Initialization vectors can only be applied to parameters in tracker responses and NOT to announces .
If the tracker sends no initialization vector then the infohash is used as the RC4 key ( 160 bit key ) .
If the tracker provides an initialization vector then the RC4 key is generated by appending the vector to the infohash and then hashing with SHA - 1 .
The resulting hash is then used as the RC4 key .
For example , given infohash aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d and initialization vector abcd both represented in hex , the RC4 key is derived as follows : key = sha1 ( ' aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434dabcd ' )
The resulting key in hex is f36e9cae87cf33e07645ef5ca745a8a83469f31e .
It is RECOMMENDED that the tracker use the initialization vector , and that it change the iv on roughly the same period as the rerequest interval .
The reasoning for this is contained in the rationale .
Optimizations
The described optimizations are OPTIONAL for the tracker , but the corresponding client - side MUST be implemented by clients that support this extension .
These optimizations hobble the strength of the RC4 encryption in order to improve tracker performance .
In the rationale section we discuss why hobbling RC4 is reasonable and in many cases has negligible foreseen effect on security .
For the purpose of these optimizations we assume that the tracker stores the tracker peer list for each infohash as a packed array that can be copied directly into the response .
We further assume that the packed array is reused many times and that with each request the tracker either returns the entire packed array or copies a single contiguous substring from the tracker peer list into the response .
If the peerlist is represented and used as assumed then to improve randomness in the set of peers handed out by the tracker , it is RECOMMENDED that the tracker periodically reshuffle the peerlist with period similar to the rerequest interval .
After each reshuffle the tracker reperforms the operations described in this section .
To reduce computation the tracker MAY cache the pseudorandom string generated by RC4 and reuse it as peers arrive and depart .
The tracker MAY also cache the encrypted tracker peer list .
To support this the tracker MUST pass two additional parameters i and n each with 32 - bit integer values , except the tracker MAY omit i and n when i=0 and the returned peer list is the entire tracker peer list .
Whether the tracker returns i and n , the first 8 bytes of the RC4 psuedorandom string are reserved for obscuring i and n .
We come back to this momentarily .
Decryption starts by XORing from 6 i bytes for ipv4 ( or 18 i for ip v6 ) into the pseudorandom string after the discarded and reserved bytes .
Assuming that the tracker encrypted the tracker peer list starting from the first byte after the discarded and reserved bytes in the pseudorandom string then i also corresponds to the ith ip - port pair in the tracker peer list .
So that the client and the tracker do not have to generate an arbitrarily long pseudorandom string to support large swarms , we assume the tracker bounds the length of the pseudorandom string and reports the length in ip - port pairs as the value to parameter n. n excludes reserved and discarded bytes .
We RECOMMEND that n be equal to the length of the tracker peer list or random but within constant factor of the longest peerlist returned by the tracker , whichever is smaller .
Thus the tracker encrypts the jth byte of the ith ip - port pair in an ipv4 tracker peer list by XORing with the byte ( 6i+j ) mod n bytes into the pseudorandom string .
Transmitting i and n as plaintext would significantly reduce the cost for an attacker to recover the pseudorandom string .
The tracker MUST XOR the value of i with the first 32 bits of the pseudorandom string .
The tracker then XORs n with the next 32 bits from the pseudorandom string ( see Figure 1 ) .
We describe encryption in the following example for an ipv4 tracker peer list consisting of 3 ip - port pairs , and using an RC4 pseudorandom string of length n=2 .
n is small for purposes of illustration .
Also , for the purpose of illustration , the tracker returns only 2 peers at a time .
Given the following peer list ( 208.72.193.86 , 6881 ) , ( 209.81.173.15,14321 ) , ( 128.213.6.8 , 6881 )
As a packed array represented in hex it becomes d048c1561ae1d151ad0f37f180d506081ae1 which we XOR with an RC4 pseudorandom string excluding discarded and reserved bytes , e.g. , a496e5f9b83e835013d42226 to generate 74de24afa2df5201bedb15d72443e3 f1a2df
Because the RC4 pseudorandom string is shorter than the tracker peer list , we wrap to the beginning of the pseudorandom string .
A tracker returning the first two peers would return the bencoded equivalent of : peers=74de24afa2df5201bedb15d7 , i=0 , n=2 A tracker returning the second and third peer would return the bencoded equivalent of : peers=5201bedb15d72443e3f1a2df , i=1 , n=2
In each response the tracker includes additional parameters such as the rerequest interval and the initialization vector iv .
The tracker response MUST remain a valid bencoded message .
Backwards Compatibility
Trackers that support obfuscation are identified in the .torrent file by the inclusion of an obfuscate - announce - list which otherwise has the same semantics as the announce - list parameter .
Peers that do not support obfuscation simply ignore the obfuscate - announce - list .
A client that is configured to use this extension should always send the sha_ih to any tracker supporting obfuscation .
The client SHOULD only contact trackers in the announce - list once the client has attempted all trackers in the obfuscate - announce - list and all failed .
If a tracker that supports obfuscation wishes to allow legacy peers to connect to the tracker then the announce URL should appear in both the obfuscate - announce - list and the announce - list .
If a tracker URL appears in both lists running on the same port , and the tracker failed to respond when selected from the obfuscate - announce - list then the client MAY treat the tracker in the announce - list as if it were temporarily unreachable and defer trying it until it has tried other trackers in the announce - list .
Peers MUST never send both the info_hash and sha_ih parameters in the same request , since that would defeat the purpose of the shared secret .
Any peer that requests with a sha_ih SHOULD implement Message Stream Encryption ( MSE ) .
Any peer returned from the tracker in response to a request with a sha_ih SHOULD be assumed to support Message Stream Encryption .
We include these provisions because if a peer communicates with another peer without using MSE then the BitTorrent protocol is trivially identified from the first twenty bytes of the BitTorrent header and the info_hash appears in plaintext as the next twenty bytes , hence also defeating the purpose of the shared secret .
If the tracker does not know enough peers assumed to support MSE to return the desired number of peers then it MAY include peers that are not assumed to support MSE .
If a peer closes a connection in response to an encrypted header then the initiating peer SHOULD assume that the peer does not support MSE .
The initiating peer however SHOULD ONLY initiate unencrypted connections when all peers have been tried and those that support MSE fail to provide " adequate performance . "
We intentionally omit any definition of " adequate performance . "
Rationale
This extension directly addresses a known attack on the BitTorrent protocol performed by some deployed network hardware .
By obscuring the ip - port pairs network hardware can no longer easily identify ip - port pairs that are running BitTorrent by observing peer - to - tracker communications .
This deployed hardware under some conditions disrupts BitTorrent connections by injecting forged TCP reset packets .
This hardware was presumably deployed to get around BitTorrent Message Stream Encryption .
Peers implementing BitTorrent Message Stream Encryption obfuscate peer - to - peer connections by employing RC4 encryption on every byte from the first byte transferred .
BitTorrent Message Stream Encryption thus increases the difficulty for a device observing passing packets to identify BitTorrent peer - to - peer connections .
By using the SHA - 1 of the infohash , the tracker is able to identify torrents without sending the plaintext infohash and without requiring an additional prior exchange of a shared secret .
Where trackers now maintain mappings from infohash to the corresponding torrent 's peerlist and other torrent - specific state , obfuscated trackers would need one additional mapping from sha_ih to the torrent 's state .
Trackers may also cache the encrypted version of each torrent 's tracker peer list , to increase computational performance at the expense of increasing memory footprint by a constant factor .
The obfuscation method meets the following criteria :
The entire plaintext of the peer list is not easily obtained even if an eavesdropper identifies one or more subsequent connections as using BitTorrent and the corresponding ip - port pairs appeared in the ciphertext of the tracker response .
Even when a subsequent connection from a peer that has received a tracker response is observed by an eavesdropper , it is difficult to map the ip - port pair to specific ciphertext to verify that the connection is using BitTorrent .
When the optimizations are used , Few computations are performed at request time .
Encryption may be performed at the time a peer is added .
The encrypted peer ip and port may be handed out hundreds of times .
Security is minimally impacted .
The objective is NOT to create a cryptographically secure protocol that can survive unlimited observation of passing packets and substantial computational resources on network timescales .
The objective is to raise the bar sufficiently to deter attacks based on observing ip - port numbers in peer - to - tracker communications .
If a tracker observes a large number of tracker requests and responses and subsequent connections , it is possible to attack the encryption .
RC4 is known to have a number of weaknesses especially in the way it is used with WEP .
However , with tracker peer obfuscation , the number of bytes transferred between the tracker and a client is likely significantly smaller than transferred between a wireless computer and a basestation .
An attacker faces a much larger task in obtaining sufficient ciphertext to directly break the encryption .
Hobbling the RC4 encryption by using a bounded - length RC4 pseudorandom string for small swarms is likely to have negilgible impact on security over any other encyption method since the pseudorandom string is probably equal to or longer than the plaintext and thus no part of it is repeated in the XOR except as peers arrive or leave the swarm .
Thus on the timescales of rerequest intervals , nearly the same ciphertext is handed to every peer requesting the same infohash .
Intercepting the same ciphertext multiple times provides no additional information to the attacker .
The attacker could correlate ip - port pairs in connections following tracker responses , but an attacker could do this regardless of the encryption method employed .
Furthermore more direct methods of traffic analysis applied to peer - to - peer communication is available to network operators .
For larger swarms , hobbling RC4 may simplify breaking the encryption since the same pseudorandom string is used repeatedly across the peer list .
Some study is in order taking into account that the tracker can periodically change intiailization vectors .
We know from experience that periodically reshuffling peer lists on the order of the rerequest interval negligibly impacts tracker performance even with swarms containing millions of peers .
Generating a new pseudorandom string using RC4 on this same time interval is likely to incur negligible performance penalty because 1 ) RC4 is a small constant factor more expensive than a shuffle on an input string of equal length , 2 ) the generated pseudorandom string is only n ip - port pairs long where recommended n is within a small constant factor larger than the largest returned peer list and thus much smaller than the tracker peer list for large swarms , and 3 ) the cost of the XOR operation is lighter weight than performing a random shuffle .

( Where people coincidentally were also always getting murdered . )
If you live in Cabot Cove , you 're either going to commit murder , get murdered , be falsely accused of murder , or you 're a shit - stupid cop .
Take your pick .
The rocket fire from Gaza , which is now being claimed proudly by the democratically - elected government of the Palestinians , has wounded more children in Israel , and nearly killed some on their way to school .
Because that ’s the tactic that the terrorists are most fond of these days :
Firing rockets when they know Israeli children are walking to and from school , in the hopes of getting some .
They did .
Eleven Qassam rockets were fired at the western Negev Thursday morning .
Three rockets landed in Sderot , causing several people to suffer shock and damaging a shed close to a residential house , as well as some vehicles .
Firefighters were called to the scene to extinguish a fire caused by the rockets .
Two rockets were fired at the Eshkol Regional Council and landed near a school .
They hurt two young girls .
Tchelet , the two - year - old , sustained shrapnel injuries to her leg , and her mother suffered from shock .
Twelve - year - old Yardena was injured in the shoulder .
They were both taken to the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon for treatment .
Gladis Za’arur - Fishbein , Tchelet ’s mother , said she had just picked up her infant daughter from the children ’s quarters in the kibbutz when the Qassam landed .
“ We were walking on the road with the playground to our left ; it ’s usually packed with kids at this time of day , ” she recounted .
“ Suddenly I heard a whistling sound followed by an explosion and fire .
I was thrown back by the force of the blast .
Tchelet was also thrown back and I heard her call for my help .
I picked her up and noticed that she was injured in the leg ; her shoe was filled with blood . ”
These are the “ crude , homemade rockets ” that the news media likes to pretend “ rarely kill or injure . ”
And the fact that the children of southern Israel have only 15 to 20 seconds to find shelter when the rockets are fired ?
Well , sometimes , you do n’t even get that .
“ There were times in the past when we heard the ‘ Color Red ’ alert system and then quickly ran for cover , ” Gladis added , “ but this time the rocket fell without warning ; it just exploded right before my eyes . ”
But here is the most despicable element to this story :
The terrorists in Gaza are deliberately firing rockets during the times they know they have the greatest chance of hitting Israeli children on their way to and from school .
An Israeli I know told me they fire the rockets around a quarter to eight , hoping to get the children .
Eshkol Regional Council head Haim Yalin , whose daughter attends the kibbutz ’s kindergarten , told Ynet “ the rocket landed at a time when all of the children usually play outside , especially on a beautiful day like today .
This is also the time of day when some parents come to pick their children up .
Even the AP is finally acknowledging the rocket fire , although there was the inevitable “ cycle of violence ” angle to the story .
Hamas militants fired a rocket into an Israeli border village , wounding two young sisters as they played outside their home .
The attack followed Israel airstrikes against Gaza militants and threats of an “ all - front ” war on the Islamic group .
The rapid - fire events threatened to escalate into large scale combat that could bury U.S. - led Mideast peace efforts .
Hamas stepped up its rocket barrages at southern Israel for a second day , retaliating for an Israeli strike that killed seven of its police officers .
More than a dozen rockets rained down , one exploding at Kibbutz Beeri , a communal village about four miles from the border fence .
Because in AP - speak , firing rockets into civilian areas is “ retaliation ” for the IDF killing terrorists .
The moral equivalency game of our times .
But we ’re used to it .
We ’ve been reading it since the bloody , bloody spring of 2002 , when suicide bombs were going off sometimes two and three times a day — and the world told Israel to “ show restraint ” in the face of her children being blown apart on buses .
Israel is cutting Gaza ’s power by 5 % per line tonight .
Watch for the world condemnation — of Israel , of course .

Zimbabwe poll : Have Your Say Tuesday 1 April , 18.32 GMT , Harare : Mandi emailed to say : " I am in one of Harare 's suburbs now , there is no electricity .
For the past two weeks before the elections , we had electricity 24 - 7 .
Some of the results are being announced now but we cannot hear them .
Harare right now is like a funeral gathering , everyone is in a pensive mood . "
16.54 GMT , Harare : Awaiting the results , Hensley writes in an email : " I pray that the Electroral Commission does not delay any further , for fear of inciting the public into violence .

We are almost there guys , because even if Mugabe does not accept these results , it is time for SADC to isolate him . "
13.43 GMT , Bulawayo : Dubindlela e-mails : " It 's mind - boggling what the partisan ZEC ( Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ) is doing by continuing to withhold results .
We desperately need a new direction .
Any friend of Zimbabwe will agree that the confusion is a product of the " Zanufication " of national political discourse .
We hope sanity will prevail . "
13.38 GMT , Harare : Darren writes in an e-mail : " The MDC say they have taken photographs of the results published outside the polling stations .
Why do n't they publish these photos , to prove their claim of a landslide victory ?
This would highlight the numbers being doctored by the ZEC .
Why are Mbeki and the other SADC ( the Southern African Development Community ) leaders keeping quiet ? "
13.25 GMT , Hwange :
Bruce e-mails to say the situation is quiet but tense .

There is a heavy military presence of armed soldiers in pick - up trucks .
Emmanuel Tumbare 11.32 GMT , Masvingo :
Dave e-mails saying that before the election , Zanu supporters were intimidating the electorate and jet fighters flew at low altitudes to instil fear in people .

09.37 GMT , Harare : Len e-mails : " All the young people I know ( 25 to 35 ) are now resigned to the fact that Mugabe has rigged the election and are already making plans to leave the country .
It 's sad .

08:44 GMT , Harare : Sara is keen to quell speculation that Mugabe has fled the country : " I saw his motorcade go past as it made its way into the city at 10.15 am this morning , with an added security contingent , probably to work on his victory speech , " she says .

On the buses , train station and in streets it 's obvious change is inevitable . "
06:02 GMT , Harare : Louise e-mails saying she voted on Saturday in Chikomba West : " Many people were turned away as they were not on the voters ' roll , however , later it came out that another book had been found .
People had to go back and check if their names were there .
With the cost of transport it is unlikely any returned , or even received the news there was another voters ' roll .
We were all hopeful but again it looks like the real results will not be announced . "
05:10 GMT : An anonymous voter texts : " The results of the 29 March elections are already known because they were posted in each command centre and polling station . "
04:50 GMT Harare : Lance e-mails saying there should be concern from the international community .

02:11 GMT , Harare : John : " The delay in announcing is worrying .
I would urge the electorate to be patient and uphold the tranquillity that so far has been in order since day one of elections .
My own view is that peace has prevailed .
For the first time , the opposition was allowed to campaign freely including using the national television and radio .
There was no intimidation whatsoever . "

" No country in the world has ever succeeded by debasing its currency , " he said .
" That 's what this man is trying to do .
He 's trying to debase the currency as a way to revive America .
It has never worked in the long term or the medium term . "
' Socialism for the Rich '
The Fed 's move to accept risky collateral is not part of the central bank 's business , he added .
" What is Bernanke going to do ?
Get in his helicopter and fly around the world and collect rents ?
That 's absurd , " Rogers said .
A recession may be a good way to clean up the economy , while trying to prevent one may cost more and actually worsen the recession , Rogers said .
Also , investment banks should be allowed to fail .
" Listen , investment banks have been going bankrupt since the beginning of time .
If people make mistakes -- if you bail out every investment bank that gets in trouble , that 's not capitalism , that 's socialism for the rich , " he said .
The weakest financial institution is Fannie Mae , in Rogers ' opinion , " but all of them have problems . "
He said he had a short position on all investment banks and is buying agricultural commodities such as cotton , wheat , coffee and sugar and was also buying the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen .
" Buy agriculture .
Agriculture is one of the few places where you 're going to make a fortune in the next years , " Rogers said .

Methane emissions from landfill sites can be captured and used as fuel Levels of the greenhouse gas methane in the atmosphere seem to be rising having remained stable for nearly 10 years .
Data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) in the US suggest concentrations rose by about 0.5 % between 2006 and 2007 .
The rise could reflect melting of permafrost , increased industrialisation in Asia or drying of tropical wetlands .
The rise in carbon dioxide levels was significantly higher than the average annual increase for the last 30 years .
There is a sign that methane is showing some increase
Geir Braathen , WMO Noaa figures show CO2 concentrations rising by 2.4 parts per million ( ppm ) from 2006 to 2007 .
By comparison , the average annual increase between 1979 and 2007 was 1.65 p pm .
Concentrations now stand at 384 ppm , compared to about 280 ppm before the era of human industrialisation began .
Upwards curve ?
The rise in CO2 is not exceptional compared with the previous few years , but does add more evidence that concentrations are rising faster than they were a decade or so ago .
The methane figure is more interesting , and potentially of more concern .
Concentrations have been more or less stable since about 1999 following years of rapid increases .
Industrial reform in the former Soviet bloc , changes to rice farming methods and the capture of methane from landfill sites all contributed to the levelling off .
But the 2007 figure indicates that levels may be on the rise again .
" Looking at the curve , there is a sign that methane is showing some increase , " commented Geir Braathen , senior scientific officer with the World Meteorological Organization , who was not involved in the Noaa publication .
" But the mechanism behind that would be uncertain ; and it's too early to say if this is the start of a new increase or not .
" We will need several years of increase before we can state that there is a rising trend . "
Warming trend Methane concentrations have shown small rises and falls during the years of stability , but rises have been associated with El Nino conditions which are known to induce more wildfires .
Currently , the world is experiencing La Nina conditions , the opposite of El Nino .
A sustained rise could be due to several reasons .
Asia 's spectacular industrialisation , reversion to older rice farming techniques , and a drying out of tropical wetlands would all be candidates if the rising trend is confirmed .
Equally possible would be the release of methane from frozen zones of the world , notably the Arctic permafrost , as they warm .
Methane is the second most important gas causing man-made climate change .
Each molecule causes about 25 times more warming than a molecule of CO2 , but it survives for shorter times in the atmosphere before being broken down .

CHICAGO — Deputy Police Chief Eugene Williams had a tough week .
Wednesday morning , a two - storey house in his jurisdiction on the South Side .
Five people , shot dead .
The following afternoon , two more shootings .
Another that night , non-fatal , shot in the leg and back .
And all of this following a hail of gunfire that had peppered the city 's toughest neighbourhoods just a few days before :
In less than a week , more than 40 shootings , at least a dozen of them fatal .
Williams , an affable 28 - year veteran of the force , sat in his office in the blue - paneled bunker of the CPD 's District 5 headquarters in South Chicago .
As he managed his constantly pinging email and two BlackBerrys vibrating at regular intervals on his desk , he suggested a worrying paradox .
" The regular citizen in Chicago can not go anywhere and buy firearms , " says Williams , eyebrows raised .
" And yet , in one year , in the 1990s , we had more than 19,000 weapons recovered .
In one year .
We 've been averaging 10,000 weapons recovered every year for the last 10 or 12 or 14 years .
And that 's with a ban . "
Toronto Mayor David Miller – who is aggressively pushing the federal government to institute a broad - ranging national handgun ban as gun violence in the city spikes upwards – please take note :
The city of Chicago has a broad - ranging firearms ban in place .
It has for a long time .
It started with handguns in 1981 , and then assault weapons in 1992 .
( It 's worth noting that , as Williams explained the litany of recent weapons offences in his jurisdiction , one of them involved three officers being fired on by an AK - 47 semi-automatic assault rifle . )
Chicago 's gun laws are among the toughest in the country , making it and its anti-gun crusading mayor , Richard Daley , the target of gun advocates nationwide .
Lobbyists like the National Rifle Association routinely campaign against what they call " Chicago - style " gun legislation ; one of those campaigns , challenging the constitutionality of a gun ban in Washington , D.C. , is now being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court .
And yet , in Chicago , gunfire is a routine feature of the city 's dominant criminal dynamic , a deeply - entrenched , multi- generational gang system with , authorities estimate , close to 70,000 members citywide .
Bans ?
" That 's what people do when they do n't understand the problem , " says Juan Johnson – or " Big Juan , " as he 's fairly known in the hardscrabble neighbourhoods on Chicago 's gang - infested west side .
It 's mid-afternoon , and for Johnson , a mountain of a man , over six feet tall and larger around , his work day is just beginning .
In the basement of the neighbourhood 's Alliance of Local Service Organizations , on a rough stretch of Armitage Avenue , Johnson and Melvin Santiago , both former gang members , trade war stories .
Johnson was a high - ranking member of the Cobras , one of the area 's half dozen Latino gangs .
He served 11 years in prison for a murder charge that was overturned .
Santiago , wiry , chatty and quick to smile , did 19 years for a gun murder he committed when he was 17 .
The two men used to patrol the neighbourhood , near the axis of Logan Square and Humboldt Park , for their respective gangs .
Now , they do it as outreach workers for Ceasefire , a community - based attempt to stem the violence .
No easy task here , in a region known for at least a generation as one of the city 's deadliest .
In 2003 , when Chicago retook the dubious title of the United States ' murder capital with 599 , it was here – in Johnson 's territory , police beat 1413 – that held the distinction of being the most lethal , with 10 killings within its 28 square blocks .
Eight of them were shootings .
Since then ?
" The next year , zero .
The year after that , zero , " Johnson , whose street cred still has currency , says with clear pride .
He was able to broker a peace between the two strongest warring factions , the Latin Kings and the Maniac Latin Disciples .
" Most of the time , they do n't even know what they 're fighting about – just that they have to , " Johnson says .
" There 's no such thing as a gun ban .
Once you 've got them , you can't get rid of them .
There 's military hardware on these streets .
There 's always a way . "
Indeed , in modern crime prevention , where illegal weapons flow freely on long - established routes between states and nations in the hundreds or thousands , a gun ban seems , at best , naïve .
It 's the Hail Mary pass , a swing for the fences , a last - minute pull - the - goalie push :
When you 've already lost , what have you got to lose ?
That 's why , in America 's most violent urban patches , better ways are constantly being pursued .
" We ca n't take all the guns away , " Santiago says .
" But what we can do is change the mindset : ` If somebody calls me a bitch , I have the right to blow his head off . '
They do n't know they have a choice .
They think that 's what they have to do . "
Santiago is touching on a relatively new way of addressing gun violence in America :
Not with sterner laws , but social interventions .
A generation of rampant violence has shown , says deputy chief Williams , " that we can't arrest ourselves out of this situation .
We have to be open to different approaches . "
The Chicago Police Department has been using its roughest neighbourhoods as a laboratory .
In 2002 , with federal backing , Chicago police embarked on a program called Project Safe Neighborhoods in two of its worst - afflicted districts .
Working with academics like Tracey Meares , now a professor of law at Yale on the city 's west side , Williams ' force embraced a novel approach :
Try talking to them .
The program focused on trying to get ahead of the problem :
As a condition of parole , gun offenders had to sign a form stating they understood their next firearms offence would be pushed to the federal level , where sentences are sterner and parole nearly non-existent , to say nothing of where they 're incarcerated .
" You wake up on Idaho , " Williams says .
" That means your homies are n't driving 10 miles down the road to visit . "
Signing the form also obligates them to attend a forum , where they 're told in no uncertain terms what can happen on their next gun conviction .
Once they establish consequences , they throw them a rope : Education , emergency housing , medical attention for drug rehabilitation .
The program also puts forward employers willing to give jobs to ex-offenders if they 're sincere about wanting out .
" We tell them they have a choice to make , " Williams says .
" ` You can go back to doing what you 've been doing , slinging dope and get arrested with a gun and face the consequences , or you can step out of that life , and we 'll help you do it . ' "
In the two police districts where the program was applied , homicide rates were cut by almost half – numbers , Williams says , the districts have been able to maintain or better since .
From the initial two , the model is now being applied in six of the city 's 25 districts .
Results are encouraging :
The events of the past week notwithstanding , gun violence in Chicago has been declining steadily over the past 10 years .
With the south side now the reigning gun violence district , Williams ' transfer there , from the west side , is no coincidence .
" We put a lot resources into ( the west side ) , and we had a major impact , " says Williams .
Behind him , maps of the various south side districts line the walls , divided and colour - coded in gang - claimed swaths : The Black Disciples , the Four Corner Hustlers , the Vice Lords .

" Now , this is where the most difficult challenge lies , " Williams says .
Outside his office , a boy no older than 13 is led by an officer , his hands cuffed behind his back .
" We need to do here what we did there : Reduce the desire of young people to pick up a gun . "
David Kennedy , an anthropologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York , is the godfather of this approach .
In 1996 , when he was a professor at Harvard , Kennedy launched the Boston Gun Project , the first intervention of its kind .
It reduced gun crime in the city by 60 per cent .
Since then , it has blossomed to a number of cities across the U.nited States .
Kennedy views bans , like the one Miller is pushing for , as a symptom of the problem , not a cure .
" For people desperately searching for a solution , it seems like it makes sense , " says Kennedy .
" What they do n't understand is that there are better tools that do n't require law to implement , and are practically cookbook and off - the - shelf . "
Chicago 's Project Safe Neighbourhoods is close to Kennedy 's prescription ( he helped advise on the project ) ; Cincinnati's Initiative to Reduce Violence is its full manifestation .
In Cincinnati , gun-related homicides spiked in 2006 to 89 , more than double the annual average , since 1991 , of 43 .
Kennedy 's research team unpacked what he calls typical trends :
They identified 69 distinct street groups , comprising about 1,000 people .
Of the 89 homicides , these 1,000 people – less than half a per cent of the city 's population – were connected to more than 75 per cent of them .
Identifying the problem makes the solution relatively simple , Kennedy says .
" If we change the behaviour of these people , we solve the problem . "
Simple , but not easy .
Still , Kennedy 's methods have had impact :
In Boston , in Chicago , and in Cincinnati , where homicides were cut in half the first year .
The solution lies not with trying to remove guns from the equation – the proverbial impossible task – but communicating to their users both consequences and options .
In Cincinnati , any offender who asked for help back to a crime - free life was welcomed .
In a year , 20 per cent of the 1,000 took the offer .
In Logan Square , Johnson – officially , a " violence interrupter – has a task at hand .
A teenage gang member – a high school student – had been shot in the chest the night before , the victim of a rival gang member .
" Now , it 's my job to stop the retaliation , " says Johnson , matter - of - fact .
As he slips into the street on foot , bound for some tough negotiations ( " Usually , you 've just got to talk them into taking a day , two days , " Johnson says ; " by then , they realize they do n't really want to do it " )
Santiago cruises in his Jeep , pointing out gang borders .
" That 's Cobra territiory , over there is Disciples , " he says , rolling slowly past modest bungalows and well - kept lawns .
" You 've got to know the borders , or you could be in a lot of trouble . "
He rolls to a stop near an alleyway , where the boy was shot the night before .
A broken box spring , the alley strewn with trash .
The Eagles , an upstart faction , did the shooting here , in Cobra territory , Santiago explains .
It makes the job more complicated , but not impossible .
Ceasefire , with its street - bred outreach workers , may lack the scientific basis that Project Safe Neighborhoods can claim .
But still , it can claim results :
In the worst police beat in America , a reduction in gun violence over four years of more than 80 per cent .
Minus the data , the message rings clear .
" We 're the little breath they need to rethink their actions , " Santiago says .
" They think they need to do this .
They do n't .
I had a choice not to pull the trigger .
I was looking to make a name for myself , I ended up killing somebody and I paid the price .
" We let them know : This is not what you want to become . "

Third Party Watch wishes to congratulate Chuck Baldwin on his nomination and wishes him success in November .
Stay tuned to Third Party Watch for additional coverage of the convention .
Why should this rise in the concentration of unemployment within relatively few neighborhoods concern us ?
The answer relates to the idea that we are all influenced by our immediate surroundings .
For decades , economists and sociologists have argued that the characteristics of an individual ’s residential area greatly influence his or her economic outcomes , and a fair amount of evidence supports this notion .
Economists Anne Case and Lawrence Katz , for instance , looked at a sample of residential areas in Boston and found evidence of strong peer effects characterizing a variety of behaviors , including criminal activity , drug and alcohol use , schooling and employment status .

Giorgio Topa , an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , found evidence of local spillovers in unemployment across neighborhoods in Chicago ; high levels of unemployment within a residential area tend to have a negative influence on the employment prospects of individuals residing within or near that neighborhood , he said . [ 2 ]
The rise in the concentration of unemployment , therefore , may be creating poverty traps from which people will find it increasingly difficult to escape .
Determining the reasons for this trend , therefore , are important from the perspective of policymakers interested in combating unemployment .
Three possible reasons for the trend are : urban decentralization ( i.e. , the movement of individuals from dense city cores into less dense suburban fringes ) , industrial and institutional changes in the labor market , and increases in the extent of segregation of individuals across neighborhoods by income and education .
The Trend in Residential Unemployment Based on data from the decennial U.S. census covering more than 165,000 block groups located in 361 metropolitan areas , neighborhoods became increasingly divided into high - and low - unemployment areas between 1980 and 2000 .
Rates of unemployment tended to fall in neighborhoods that already had low rates of unemployment in 1980 , while they tended to rise in neighborhoods that had relatively high rates of unemployment in 1980 .
People without a job , therefore , were more likely to come from one of a handful of high - unemployment neighborhoods in 2000 than two decades earlier .
To see this , consider the unemployment rate of the neighborhood in which the “ average ” unemployed person resides .
[ 3 ]
In 1980 , this individual lived in a block group with an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent .
Two decades later , this person lived in a block group with an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent .
This trend is particularly striking in light of the fact that the national unemployment rate and the average metropolitan area unemployment rate both declined over this period , suggesting that labor market conditions throughout the U.S. improved over this period .
These differences are depicted in Figure 1 .
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
The figure shows selected unemployment rates over the years 1980 , 1990 and 2000 .
The average neighborhood unemployment rate of the median unemployed worker has increased roughly 0.5 percentage points over this period , despite the national unemployment rate and the average metropolitan area unemployment rate declining roughly three and one percentage points , respectively .
The degree to which unemployment is geographically concentrated can also be quantified by looking at the 90th , 50th and 10th percentiles of the block group unemployment distribution within each metropolitan area .
These percentiles are intended to represent neighborhoods with high ( 90th ) , medium ( 50th ) and low ( 10th ) rates of joblessness .
Figure 2 plots each one over the years 1980 , 1990 and 2000 .
NEIGHBORHOOD UNEMPLOYMENT
PERCENTILES
The figure shows the 90th , 50th and 10th percentiles of the block group unemployment distribution within each metropolitan area , representing neighborhoods with high , medium and low rates of joblessness , over the years 1980 , 1990 and 2000 .
A greater difference between the percentiles indicates a greater unemployment distribution .
The majority of the widening took place between 1980 and 1990 when the average 90th percentile rose while the 50th and 10th percentiles decreased .
Between 1990 and 2000 , all three percentiles actually decreased by similar amounts , leaving the three differentials mostly unchanged between 1990 and 2000 .
In 1980 , the average difference between the neighborhood at the 90th percentile of the unemployment distribution and the neighborhood at the 10th percentile was 7.3 percentage points ( a difference between an unemployment rate of 11 percent and one of 3.7 percent ) .
Two decades later , the difference was 11.2 percentage points .
Where Do the Unemployed Live ?
In looking for explanations for these patterns , it is instructive to look at some basic characteristics of neighborhoods with high ( and low ) rates of unemployment .
To begin , the rate of joblessness in a neighborhood tends to be strongly tied to the level of education and income of its residents .
Neighborhoods with higher average levels of income , not surprisingly , tend to see lower unemployment rates , which can be interpreted in at least two ways .
First , employed households tend to receive more income than unemployed households because only the former receive earnings from a job .
Second , individuals with high incomes tend to be relatively successful in the labor market because they are highly skilled or highly educated ( or both ) .
These types of individuals have a much lower incidence of unemployment .
In terms of demographic characteristics , neighborhoods with larger fractions of foreign - born , female , nonwhite and nonmarried households tend to be associated with higher rates of unemployment .
Individuals belonging to these groups tend to have less successful labor market outcomes , particularly with respect to earnings .
The census data also show that neighborhoods with fewer workers under 25 tend to exhibit lower rates of unemployment , consistent with the idea that individuals between 25 and 64 , the so - called prime working years , are especially likely to have a job .
The lower unemployment rate may also reflect the result that , beyond age 65 , many individuals are considered retired and , therefore , would not be counted among the unemployed .
Block groups with high rates of unemployment also tend to have relatively large fractions of their working households facing longer commute times to work .
In particular , the data reveal a strong , positive association between unemployment and the percentage of individuals with a one - way commute time in excess of 45 minutes .
Finally , there is some evidence that a neighborhood ’s rate of unemployment is connected to the industries in which its working residents are employed .
In particular , larger fractions of workers in construction , wholesale trade , finance - insurance - real estate ( FIRE ) and education services tend to have lower rates of unemployment .
In the case of FIRE and education services — sectors that employ relatively well - educated individuals — this result is quite sensible .
The results for construction and wholesale trade , on the other hand , may simply be related to the strong growth of these industries between 1980 and 2000 .
On the other hand , larger fractions of employment in manufacturing tend to be associated with higher rates of unemployment in a neighborhood , a result that is likely driven by the decline of this sector within the U.S. in recent decades .
Some Explanations
Sprawl
One of the most significant ideas to emerge from the field of urban economics over the past half century holds that the movement of population and employment away from city centers toward suburban locales has created an underclass of unemployed workers in central cities .
This idea is known widely as the spatial mismatch hypothesis . [ 4 ]
As city populations and employers move away from traditional central business districts , finding and securing jobs becomes more difficult for workers who choose to remain in those central cities .
Increased spatial isolation from employment opportunities , presumably , increases commuting costs and makes the job search process more difficult .
In addition , increased distance may limit access to information about available jobs or create negative attitudes about central city workers among employers .
As employers move farther away , therefore , locating and maintaining a job becomes less likely for the residents of historical city centers .
In addition , one of the characteristics of high - unemployment neighborhoods is the prevalence of relatively long commutes to work among residents who have jobs .
In order to evaluate whether sprawl has influenced the residential concentration of unemployment , it must be measured .
Unfortunately , quantifying sprawl tends to be difficult because the term does not have a precise definition .
A variety of measures attempt to capture the basic concept : individuals and employers moving from dense cores toward less - populated suburban peripheries .
Such measures include the fraction of a metropolitan area ’s population or employment located in a central city , the fraction within certain distances of the historical city center and overall metropolitan area density .
Urban decentralization within a metropolitan area can be quantified using population density , which is constructed as an average of block group - level densities , taking into account each block group ’s share of total metropolitan area population .
Hence , a metropolitan area ’s density is taken to be the density of the block group in which the average resident lives .
Because suburban locales tend to have much lower residential densities than urban cores , lower levels of population density ought to be associated with more extensive sprawl . [ 5 ]
Between 1980 and 2000 , the average metropolitan area saw its population density decrease from 3,080 residents per square mile to 3,004 residents per square mile .
Although average density did increase slightly during the 1980s , it dropped during the 1990s , leaving the residential density faced by a typical metropolitan resident lower in 2000 than two decades earlier .
This pattern follows the long - standing trend over the past century for U.S. populations to spread out geographically .
Industrial Shifts and Unionization
Over the past several decades , the U.S. economy has seen a decrease in the employment of certain sectors , but increasing employment in others .
Manufacturing employment has decreased , while service employment has increased .
In addition , rates of unionization have fallen substantially .
Between 1980 and 2000 , the average share of manufacturing in total employment declined from 22 percent to 14 percent across the metropolitan areas studied for this article , whereas the fraction of workers employed in education and in health services rose from 17 percent to 20 percent .
Rates of unionization decreased from an average of 24 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 2000 .
How might these changes influence the geographic distribution of unemployment within a metropolitan area ?
If workers in certain neighborhoods tend to be employed in similar types of industries , or if unionization is relatively concentrated among the residents of certain neighborhoods , these changes may have produced different rates of unemployment across different areas within a city .
In other words , rather than there having been a change in the way that residents of an area sort themselves across neighborhoods , it may simply be that changes in the labor market have differently influenced workers of different neighborhoods .
For example , larger fractions of workers within a neighborhood who are employed in manufacturing tend to be associated with higher unemployment rates .
Larger fractions of workers in finance - insurance - real estate , by contrast , correspond to lower unemployment rates .
The change in the industrial makeup of a metro area ’s economy , then , might help to explain the trend in neighborhood unemployment .
Segregation by Income and Education
The rise in the concentration of unemployment may , on the other hand , be the product of greater segregation of individuals by income and education .
Unemployment shows a very strong association with both income and education .
If the way individuals sort themselves into residential areas has created neighborhoods with concentrations of either high - or low - skill individuals , increasing disparity between the unemployment rates of different neighborhoods should be seen .
Low - skill individuals , after all , tend to experience higher rates of unemployment than high - skill individuals . [ 6 ]
On the surface , this explanation seems related to the urban decentralization hypothesis .
Indeed , previous work has suggested that as city populations spread out , households become increasingly sorted into high - and low - income neighborhoods . [ 7 ]
Recent research , however , finds little association between the extent to which urban populations spread out and the income differentials they exhibit across block groups . [ 8 ]
We quantify income segregation by calculating the variance of average income across neighborhoods .
As high - and low - income people move into separate areas , of course , this measure increases .
To quantify the segregation of households by education , we compute an index describing the extent to which individuals with at least a bachelor ’s degree live in the same neighborhoods as those with less formal schooling .
On average , the amount of income variation between neighborhoods nearly doubled over this period , although essentially all of the increase took place during the decade of the 1980s .
The educational segregation measure rose by more than 17 percent during the 1980s , but remained relatively constant during the 1990s .
The Findings Results from the statistical analysis of these patterns indicate that , of these three possible explanations , rising segregation of individuals by income and education is the most likely culprit . [ 9 ]
After controlling for a number of characteristics that may influence the residential distribution of unemployment , including the basic demographic make - up of each metropolitan area , the findings indicate that there is essentially no correlation between rising unemployment concentration and any of the following three quantities : population density ( a measure of urban decentralization ) , the industrial composition of a metropolitan area and the extent of unionization among the local workforce .
In contrast , there is a significantly positive association between unemployment concentration and the extent to which neighborhoods are segregated by income and educational attainment .
Sidebar One Possible Solution : Move the Unemployed to Workers ’ Neighborhoods
Seeking to help individuals find work are a number of public and private programs , including unemployment insurance , job training and employment agencies .
For the most part , these programs are aimed at assisting people who do not have jobs either by trying to connect them with employers who have vacancies or by helping those jobless people acquire skills that employers require .
Yet , because research indicates that a worker ’s ability to find and maintain employment may be influenced by the extent of joblessness in his or her neighborhood , this process may have become increasingly difficult for workers residing in high - unemployment areas .
Consequently , policymakers interested in the reduction of unemployment within a metropolitan area may wish to investigate strategies that attempt to reduce the extent to which the unemployed are residentially isolated .
Although it is difficult to influence where people with different levels of education and income choose to reside , programs that attempt to achieve greater heterogeneity within residential areas could certainly help to prevent areas of extreme unemployment and poverty from forming .
Revitalizing downtowns , for example , might help to draw high - income , highly educated residents to areas that currently suffer from high unemployment .
Doing so may also help the unemployed find work by providing greater numbers of jobs nearby .
Recall , although population density did not show a significant association with unemployment concentration , a neighborhood ’s unemployment rate is strongly tied to the average commute times of its residents .
In addition , programs aimed at helping individuals living in impoverished areas to relocate to more economically successful neighborhoods might help .
Policies that encourage mixed - income housing — that is , policies that set aside certain fractions of new housing units for low - to moderate - income households — may also assist individuals who face a high risk of unemployment with finding and maintaining employment .
These , of course , are just a few hypothetical strategies , and they require a great deal more research before any formal policy recommendations could be made .
However , the notion that the residential concentration of unemployment probably represents a significant aspect of the unemployment problem in the United States is one to which policymakers should give some serious consideration .
The fact that this problem seems to have grown worse in recent decades suggests that the costs of not doing so are rising .

Advertisement The Olympic torch has met with more protests and scuffles on the latest leg of its troubled relay in the Japanese city of Nagano .
With security tight along the route , two demonstrators tried to seize the torch and a third threw eggs at the flame .
All were arrested .
But correspondents say the relay passed off without serious disruption .
The streets were lined with thousands of Chinese supporters , as well as dozens of protesters .
A sea of wellwishers greeted the torch as the final runner completed the relay at a city park .
Officials said four people were slightly injured in separate incidents , and a smoke - emitting tube was thrown at the relay without effect , according to reports .
More than 3,000 police officers were brought in to guard the event after demonstrations had plagued the flame in some other cities on its route .
In a last - minute change , the Nagano leg of the relay began in a car park rather than a 1,400 - year - old Buddhist temple .
The temple was withdrawn as the starting point after objections over China 's crackdown in Tibet .
The start of the relay , with the torch first carried by the manager of Japan 's national baseball team , was closed to the public , as were rest stops on the route .
Riot police Protests elsewhere on the torch 's progress - and the huge security operations they have spawned - have turned the celebratory tour of 20 countries into what analysts describe as a public - relations disaster for Beijing .
In pictures : Japan relay Earlier , Japan told Chinese Olympics organisers that the large team of security officers who have accompanied the flame elsewhere would not be welcome here , says BBC Japan correspondent Chris Hogg .
Instead riot police in running gear surrounded the athletes carrying the torch along each stage of the four - hour relay .
Two columns of 40 police officers each flanked the torch , making it hard for spectators to see much , the organisers admit .
In advance of the torch 's arrival , buses full of riot police patrolled the streets and police helicopters hovered overhead .
Vietnam expulsion Japan , which has had a troubled relationship with China , took extensive steps to ensure that any disruption was kept to a minimum .
Over the following few days , the torch will stop in South Korea , North Korea , and Vietnam .
In Hanoi , Vietnam , authorities expelled a US citizen of Vietnamese origin who they say was planning protests against the torch , reported state media .
Protests in Athens , London , Paris and San Francisco - where demonstrators angry at China 's policies in Tibet tried to disrupt processions - have dominated media coverage of the torch relay .
However , the flame has made relatively peaceful progress through other cities , including Bangkok in Thailand and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania .

Are the days of recharging our batteries via a regular charger about to come to an end ?
Can you imagine yourself reading this post and on the very same time charging your AA batteries on your laptop or desktop computer ?
With time passing by so is technology advancing .
Moixa Energy Ltd. has developed the USBCELL battery which is a revolutionary technology that allows recharging the batteries simply by plugging them into a USB port .
Their NiMH AA cell battery can be used like any normal battery that is available at the stores .
According to the company , there are over 15 billion alkaline batteries made and thrown away each year , the outcome of that is wasted resources , carbon dioxide ( C02 ) and toxic landfill .
The USBCELL offers an eco-friendly alternative – since no charger adapter or cable is needed , their batteries can be reused hundreds of times .
The average price of two USBCELL Batteries stands at $ 23 .
Within Moxiaâ€™s future product pipeline are : further formats , fashion batteries in designer colors , advanced cells and USBCELL for phones , cameras and other devices .
SAN FRANCISCO —
They work long hours , often to exhaustion .
Many are paid by the piece — not garments , but blog posts .
This is the digital - era sweatshop .
You may know it by a different name : home .
A growing work force of home - office laborers and entrepreneurs , armed with computers and smartphones and wired to the hilt , are toiling under great physical and emotional stress created by the around - the - clock Internet economy that demands a constant stream of news and comment .
Of course , the bloggers can work elsewhere , and they profess a love of the nonstop action and perhaps the chance to create a global media outlet without a major up - front investment .
At the same time , some are starting to wonder if something has gone very wrong .
In the last few months , two among their ranks have died suddenly .
Two weeks ago in North Lauderdale , Fla. , funeral services were held for Russell Shaw , a prolific blogger on technology subjects who died at 60 of a heart attack .
In December , another tech blogger , Marc Orchant , died at 50 of a massive coronary .
A third , Om Malik , 41 , survived a heart attack in December .
Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain , sleep disorders , exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always - on as the Internet .
To be sure , there is no official diagnosis of death by blogging , and the premature demise of two people obviously does not qualify as an epidemic .
There is also no certainty that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths .
But friends and family of the deceased , and fellow information workers , say those deaths have them thinking about the dangers of their work style .
The pressure even gets to those who work for themselves — and are being well - compensated for it .
“ I have n’t died yet , ” said Michael Arrington , the founder and co-editor of TechCrunch , a popular technology blog .
The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue , but there has been a hefty cost .
Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years , developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees .
“ At some point , I ’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital , or something else will happen . ”
“ This is not sustainable , ” he said .
It is unclear how many people blog for pay , but there are surely several thousand and maybe even tens of thousands .
The emergence of this class of information worker has paralleled the development of the online economy .
Publishing has expanded to the Internet , and advertising has followed .
Even at established companies , the Internet has changed the nature of work , allowing people to set up virtual offices and work from anywhere at any time .
That flexibility has a downside , in that workers are always a click away from the burdens of the office .
For obsessive information workers , that can mean never leaving the house .
Blogging has been lucrative for some , but those on the lower rungs of the business can earn as little as $ 10 a post , and in some cases are paid on a sliding bonus scale that rewards success with a demand for even more work .
There are growing legions of online chroniclers , reporting on and reflecting about sports , politics , business , celebrities and every other conceivable niche .
Some write for fun , but thousands write for Web publishers — as employees or as contractors — or have started their own online media outlets with profit in mind .
One of the most competitive categories is blogs about technology developments and news .
They are in a vicious 24 - hour competition to break company news , reveal new products and expose corporate gaffes .
To the victor go the ego points , and , potentially , the advertising .
Bloggers for such sites are often paid for each post , though some are paid based on how many people read their material .
They build that audience through scoops or volume or both .
Some sites , like those owned by Gawker Media , give bloggers retainers and then bonuses for hitting benchmarks , like if the pages they write are viewed 100,000 times a month .
Then the goal is raised , like a sales commission : write more , earn more .
Bloggers at some of the bigger sites say most writers earn about $ 30,000 a year starting out , and some can make as much as $ 70,000 .
A tireless few bloggers reach six figures , and some entrepreneurs in the field have built mini-empires on the Web that are generating hundreds of thousands of dollars a month .
Others who are trying to turn blogging into a career say they can end up with just $ 1,000 a month .
Speed can be of the essence .
If a blogger is beaten by a millisecond , someone else ’s post on the subject will bring in the audience , the links and the bigger share of the ad revenue .
“ There ’s no time ever — including when you ’re sleeping — when you ’re not worried about missing a story , ” Mr. Arrington said .
“ Would n’t it be great if we said no blogger or journalist could write a story between 8 p.m. Pacific time and dawn ?
Then we could all take a break , ” he added .
“ But that ’s never going to happen . ”
All that competition puts a premium on staying awake .
Matt Buchanan , 22 , is the right man for the job .
He works for clicks for Gizmodo , a popular Gawker Media site that publishes news about gadgets .
Mr. Buchanan lives in a small apartment in Brooklyn , where his bedroom doubles as his office .
He says he sleeps about five hours a night and often does not have time to eat proper meals .
But he does stay fueled — by regularly consuming a protein supplement mixed into coffee .
But make no mistake : Mr. Buchanan , a recent graduate of New York University , loves his job .
He said he gets paid to write ( he will not say how much ) while interacting with readers in a global conversation about the latest and greatest products .
“ The fact I have a few thousand people a day reading what I write — that ’s kind of cool , ” he said .
And , yes , it is exhausting .
Sometimes , he said , “ I just want to lie down . ”
Sometimes he does rest , inadvertently , falling asleep at the computer .
“ If I do n’t hear from him , I ’ll think : Matt ’s passed out again , ” said Brian Lam , the editor of Gizmodo .
“ It ’s happened four or five times . ”
Mr. Lam , who as a manager has a substantially larger income , works even harder .
He is known to pull all - nighters at his own home office in San Francisco — hours spent trying to keep his site organized and competitive .
He said he was well equipped for the torture ; he used to be a Thai - style boxer .
“ I ’ve got a background getting punched in the face , ” he said .
“ That ’s why I ’m good at this job . ”
Mr. Lam said he has worried his blogging staff might be burning out , and he urges them to take breaks , even vacations .
But he said they face tremendous pressure — external , internal and financial .
He said the evolution of the “ pay - per- click ” economy has put the emphasis on reader traffic and financial return , not journalism .
In the case of Mr. Shaw , it is not clear what role stress played in his death .
Ellen Green , who had been dating him for 13 months , said the pressure , though self - imposed , was severe .
She said she and Mr. Shaw had been talking a lot about how he could create a healthier lifestyle , particularly after the death of his friend , Mr. Orchant .
“ The blogger community is looking at this and saying : ‘ Oh no , it happened so fast to two really vital people in the field , ’ ” she said .
They are wondering , “ What does that have to do with me ? ”
For his part , Mr. Shaw did not die at his desk .
He died in a hotel in San Jose , Calif. , where he had flown to cover a technology conference .
He had written a last e-mail dispatch to his editor at ZDNet : “ Have come down with something .
Resting now posts to resume later today or tomorrow . ”

We prepared for the " wrong kind of aftermath " , says Jonathan Powell .
Ex -Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell said the preparation was for the " wrong kind of aftermath " .
He said on BBC1's Andrew Marr show : " We probably had n't thought through the magnitude of what we were taking on . "
Meanwhile , the Tories have called for a Privy Council inquiry into the " origins and conduct " of the Iraq war .
Mr Powell told BBC1's Andrew Marr show : " We made lots of preparations for humanitarian disaster , for the lack of water and that kind of thing .
" What we had n't , in my view , really thought through was the long - term nature of this . "
He added : " I think we probably had n't thought through the magnitude of what we were taking on in Iraq .
This is something that will take many decades to sort out . "
We will be raising this again in Parliament in the coming weeks
William Hague
Shadow foreign secretary
Also speaking on the Andrew Marr show , shadow foreign secretary William Hague said the fifth anniversary of the war was the right time for a full inquiry .
" Clarity " was needed on the future for Britain 's deployment in Iraq , he said .
And he demanded : " It is very important to commence the full - scale Privy Council inquiry into the origins and conduct of the war , because if we are not going to start it now , five years on from the beginning of the war , then when on earth would we have such an inquiry ?
" Lessons have got to be learned , and visibly learned , and we have got to start on that process now .
We will be raising this again in Parliament in the coming weeks . "
Aftermath
There have been four inquiries into different aspects of the Iraq war , including the Butler report into intelligence failings and the Hutton inquiry .
But there has not been an inquiry focusing on how the government 's decision to join the US - led invasion was made .
William Hague wants a comprehensive inquiry to start now
The government has indicated it will sanction a high - level inquiry into the war once British troops had been withdrawn .
Groups opposed to the continuing war in Iraq are marking the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion with demonstrations .
Thousands of protesters marched in London and Glasgow on Saturday ahead of the March 20 anniversary to demand Britain withdraw its troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan .
Strategic failure
And the Liberal Democrats have repeated their demands for an " early and full " withdrawal of British troops .
The party 's leader Nick Clegg said Iraq was the biggest strategic failure of British foreign policy for decades .
Mr Clegg said the date should remind government and Tories not to " blindly " follow Washington 's lead .
" On this anniversary of the greatest strategic failure in British foreign policy in the post - war period , both Labour and the Conservatives must learn from their fateful decision to back George Bush 's invasion of Iraq , " he said .
" It is now time to recast British foreign policy in Britain 's interests , not those of Washington , starting with an early and full withdrawal of all remaining British troops in Iraq . "
Back in the days , business cars were called trade cards and businessman of those days would distribute to clients and potential customers just like we do now .
The design on this cards is the only thing that actually changed over the year .
Long before you decided to read this story , your brain may have already said “ click that link ” .
By scanning the brains of test subjects as they pressed one button or another – though not a computer mouse – researchers pinpointed a signal that divulged the decision about seven seconds before people ever realised their choice .
The discovery has implications for mind - reading , and the nature of free will .
“ Our decisions are predetermined unconsciously a long time before our consciousness kicks in , ” says John - Dylan Haynes , a neuroscientist at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin , who led the study .
It definitely throws our concept of free will into doubt , he adds .
This is by no means the first time scientists have cast doubt on conscious free will .
In the early 1980s , the late neuroscientist Benjamin Libet uncovered a spark of brain activity three tenths of a second before subjects opted to lift a finger .
The activity flickered in a region of the brain involved in planning body movement .

But this region might perform only the final mental calculations to move , not the initial decision to lift a finger , Haynes says .
Brain decides
Haynes ’s team delved deeper into the brain with a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) that can measure brain activity while a subject carries out a task .
In this case , 14 volunteers lay in a brain scanner and were told to tap a button with a finger of the left or right hand whenever they felt the urge .
While the subject waited to make a choice , a screen flashed a random letter every half second .
After a subject finally pushed a button , they were asked to indicate which letter had on the screen at the moment the decision was made .
There is usually half second a lag between thought and action , Haynes says .
When Hayne ’s team later analysed the fMRI scans , they found that the prefrontal cortex – a part of the brain that is involved in thought and consciousness – lit up seven seconds before the subjects pressed the button .
Unconscious will
By deciphering the brain signals with a computer program , the researchers could predict which button a subject had pressed about 60 % of the time – slightly better than a random guess .
“ It seems that the brain is making the decision before the person themselves , ” he says .
Although we make some choices in a heartbeat , Haynes thinks his experiment captures the dawdling tempo of daily life .
“ In most cases , we decide internally in a self - paced way : ‘ Now I want to get some orange juice ’ or ‘ I ’m going to get some apple juice instead ’ , ' ” he says
Our brains might pick beverages long before we realise , but Haynes thinks such decisions are still a matter of choice .
“ My conscious will is consistent with my unconscious will – it ’s the same process , ” he says .
Mind-reading
Chris Frith , a neuroscientist at University College London , also questions whether the experiment puts a dagger in the concept of free will .
Getting volunteers to lie in brain scanner and waiting to press a button could affect their brain activity in way normal decision - making does n’t , he says .
And what if we do n’t like our brain ’s decision ?
Experiments to test whether a choice can be reversed are in the works , Haynes says .
“ We ca n’t rule out that people might be able to change their minds . ”
Anticipating a person ’s decision might one day find use in devices that wire our brains directly to a machine , he adds .
A mind - reading car might anticipate lane changes and turns well before the driver ever knows his intentions .
“ It ’s good if the technology knows what the user is going to want – potentially before the user even knows what they are going to want , ” he says .

Scarlett was last seen alive at a beach bar
Fiona MacKeown British teenager Scarlett Keeling was drugged and sexually assaulted before she died , police in Goa , India , say .
The 15 - year - old girl , from Bideford , Devon , was found dead on a beach in Anjuna , Goa , last month .
Placido Carvalho was detained on Wednesday , two days after another man , Samson D'Souza , 28 , was charged with raping Miss Keeling .
Mr Carvalho , who gave himself up voluntarily , will appear in court in Goa later .
He was detained on suspicion of involvement in the rape and murder of Miss Keeling .
Police allege Mr Carvalho intentionally supplied ecstasy and possibly other drugs to Miss Keeling before she was raped .
The arrests come after police initially said Scarlett had drowned .
The administration tried its best to hush up the death as a simple case of drowning
Fiona MacKeown , Scarlett 's mother Mr D'Souza appeared in court in Mapusa , Goa , on Monday and was remanded into custody for 14 days .
Miss Keeling 's mother , Fiona MacKeown , said the case remained unsolved , despite the two arrests .
In a statement released through her lawyer , the 43 - year - old said : " The arrest of two low - level persons , to my mind , is certainly not a completion of the investigations . "
Her lawyer , Vikram Varma , said on Thursday that he expected further arrests in connection with the rape and murder .
He said : " I have been told the police will be arresting more people . "
Miss Keeling 's naked and battered body was found on a beach in Anjuna three weeks ago .
' Hushed up ' death Ms MacKeown is waiting for a response from India 's prime minister to her claims there was a police cover - up over her daughter 's death .
In a letter to Manmohan Singh , Ms MacKeown , said : " I have no faith in the leadership of the Goa police .
" The administration tried its best to hush up the death as a simple case of drowning . "
Speaking in Anjuna , police inspector Kishan Kumar said once the police investigation had come to a conclusion about the rape and murder of Scarlett " we will look into other aspects " .
That could include the possible neglect of the teenager , said Mr Kumar .
Ms MacKeown had left her daughter at the resort with a friend while the rest of the family travelled further afield .
Ms MacKeown , who has denied neglecting her daughter , said : " I think I was probably naive and too trusting of the people around her that claimed to be her friends , but that was probably the worst thing I have done . "
Ms MacKeown was on a six - month holiday with her boyfriend , Scarlett and six other younger children .

Rep. Mike Michaud ( D. , Maine ) Writes Strong Letter to Conyers Calling for Cheney Impeachment Hearings
afterdowningstreet.org
submitted by David Swanson
Congressman Mike Michaud , a conservative and Blue Dog Democrat from Maine sent a letter over the holiday break to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers calling for impeachment hearings of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Michaud is not among the 25 cosponsors of Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s H Res 333 ( also known as H Res 799 ) , a resolution stipulating articles of impeachment against Cheney .
Michaud is also not among a group of Judiciary Committee Members led by Rep. Robert Wexler ( Michaud is not on the committee ) who have called for hearings to begin , and who plan to send their own letter to Conyers this month .
But Michaud shares their position that hearings should be held first and articles drafted when and if called for by the evidence exposed .
For progress of the various groups of congress members now pushing for impeachment of Cheney see : http://impeachcheney.org
Maine has been a hotbed of impeachment activism in recent months : http://afterdowningstreet.org/me
Efforts have been led by an activist coalition : http://maineimpeach.org and a group of lawyers called Maine Lawyers for Democracy .
Citizens have staged sit-ins in the offices of Rep. Michaud and also Rep. Tom Allen demanding support for impeachment .
Those efforts may be paying off , and Michaud appears in the letter below to have grasped some of his constituents main arguments for impeachment .
While known as a conservative , Michaud has turned against the occupation of Iraq and joined a small number of Congress Members in voting against further funding .
Iraq is also the first issue Michaud mentions in his letter to Conyers .
Here is the full text of the letter , also attached below as a PDF .
Dear Chairman Conyers ,
I write today to request that you include vigorous hearings into the abuses of power by this Administration and include impeachment hearings of Vice President Richard Cheney in the Judiciary Committee schedule for the second session of the 110th Congress .
As you are aware , the House of Representatives voted on November 7th to send a resolution of impeachment of Vice President Cheney to the Judiciary Committee .
I urge you to commence these proceedings .
There is no doubt that at the very least this Administration has dangerously expanded the scope of executive authority and flaunted the constitutionally defined separation of powers .
Serious allegations have been raised against the Vice President regarding his role in mischaracterizing information that led to the invasion of Iraq , in similarly mischaracterizing information about Iran ’s nuclear program , the outing of a CIA agent as political retaliation , the abuse of detainees in contravention of the Geneva Conventions , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens .
As a recent poll indicates , 70 % of the American public believes that the Vice President has abused his power .
This is not an attack on Vice President Cheney or any other member of this Administration .
Impeachment investigations must not be about the man or his personal life ; they must focus on whether the office of the Vice President has illegally expanded its power or abused the law .
Expansions and potential abuses of power by this Administration become precedents for future ones , which lead to further erosions of our constitutional rights .
That is why these investigations must be held with the utmost seriousness of purpose and must lay all the facts on the table .
We do not know what the result of any investigation will be , but this is the only way to restore the faith of the American people in their government .

San Francisco ’s Handgun Ban Overturned
Thisis a victory for gun owners all across the country .
An important victory for the protectors of and the believers in the second amendment .
San Fransisco voters approved banning handguns in the city .
The NRA sued on behalf of gun owners and the high court in California has ruled the ban unconstitutional .
I know what the proponents of the ban are going to say .
They are going to claim that the wishes of the people have been thwarted .
The fact is that just because a majority of people approve a law does n’t mean it will become law if it is judged to be unconstitutional .
The people can not vote on an unconstitutional law thereby changing the constitution .
There is a process for changing the constitution and it is called amending the constitution .
Even in San Fransisco it looks as though we still have some semblance of sanity and constitutional law left .
would have forbidden San Francisco residents to possess handguns , exempting only law enforcement officers and others who needed guns for professional purposes .
It would have also prohibited the manufacture , sale or distribution of any type of firearms or ammunition in San Francisco .
While this was being billed as a handgun ban , you can see above that the law would have gone well beyond handguns .
All firearms would have been banned in San Fransisco .
The state courts recognized that “ law - abiding citizens are part of the solution , not part of the problem of violent crime , ” said Chuck Michel , lawyer for the plaintiffs in the NRA suit .
“ The authority of local cities to over - regulate firearms is very limited . ”
I still ca n’t get over the fact that this happened in San Fransisco .
It is totally believable that the residents would want to ban firearms in San Fransisco with all the moonbats out there .
But I am totally surprised that the law was overturned .
Next up is Washington D.C. , if this is any indication , things are beginning to look brighter for gun owners and the constitution all over the United States .
" Commercial use " of the sphinx will be controlled under the law
Zahi Hawass , who chairs Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities , told the BBC the law would apply in all countries .
The money was needed to maintain thousands of pharaonic sites , he said .
Correspondents say the law will deal a blow to themed resorts across the world where large - scale copies of Egyptian artefacts are a crowd - puller .
Mr Hawass said the law would apply to full - scale replicas of any object in any museum in Egypt .
Las Vegas ' Luxor complex mimics Egyptian monuments
" Even if it is for private use , they must have permission from the Egyptian government , " he added .
But he said the law would not stop local and international artists reproducing monuments as long as they were not exact replicas .
The Luxor hotel in the US city of Las Vegas would also not be affected because it was not an exact copy of a pyramid and its interior was completely different , Mr Hawass told AFP news agency .
But he said claims by the hotel that it was " the only pyramid - shaped building in the world " could no longer be made .
The announcement came two days after an Egyptian newspaper called on the hotel to pay a share of its profits to the central Egyptian city of Luxor , which administers the ancient Valley of the Kings burial site .
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton edged rival Sen. Barack Obama in the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania , saying victory showed she had the better shot at winning in November than he .
Sen . Hillary Clinton addresses supporters following her win in Pennsylvania .
" It 's a long road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and it runs right through the heart of Pennsylvania , " she told supporters in Philadelphia Tuesday night .
Her top advisers had called the state a must - win to stay in the race .
" For six weeks , Senator Obama and I have criss - crossed this state -- meeting people up close , being judged side by side , making our best case , " she said to cheering supporters .
" You listened and today you chose . "
Obama congratulated Clinton on her win and said his campaign closed what had been a huge margin in her favor .
Watch Obama claim his campaign 's own victory
" There were a lot of folks who did n't think we could make this a race when it started , " he said at a campaign rally in Evansville , Indiana , where Democrats will go to the polls May 6 .
" They thought we were going to get blown out .
But we worked hard and traveled across the state , to big cities and small towns , to factories and VFW halls and now , six weeks later , we closed that gap . "
Obama leads in overall votes , states won and pledged delegates .
And unless " the wheels come off his wagon , " Obama was likely to hold that lead , said David Gergen , a former adviser to both Republican and Democratic candidates .
With 80 percent of Pennsylvania precincts reporting , Clinton was leading Obama 55 to 45 percent .
A total of 158 delegates to the convention were at stake .
Her win adds to those in other big states , like Ohio , New York and California and , according to her campaign , should revive questions about whether Obama can beat presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in November .
Watch Clinton 's victory speech »
Polls closed at 8 p.m. local time ( 0000 GMT ) after what election officials in Pennsylvania 's largest cities called a solid but not record - breaking turnout .
Heading into the primary , Clinton led Obama in published polls by nearly 20 points , but Obama closed the gap to have a competitive showing and outspent her by more than 2 - to - 1 in the process .
The last week of campaigning included a tough debate between Obama and Clinton , who pounded her rival for his recent remark that decades of economic decline had left some rural voters " bitter " and clinging to religion and guns .
CNN exit polls showed nearly a quarter of state voters made their decisions in the past week , and those voters leaned toward Clinton by a margin of 56 percent to 44 percent .
Weekly churchgoers made up almost 36 percent of the electorate , who went to Clinton by a 56 - 44 margin .
More than a third were gun owners , and they preferred Clinton by an almost - identical margin -- 60 percent to 40 percent , the polls found .
Exit polls showed Obama appeared to rack up wide margins in Philadelphia and its surrounding counties .
Clinton supporters turned out heavily in Pittsburgh and the counties of western Pennsylvania , and she racked up similarly lopsided margins in the state 's industrial northeast , exit polls found .
Among the state 's black voters , who are heavily concentrated around Philadelphia , Obama racked up margins of more than 90 percent .
The voting bloc comprised about 14 percent of the vote , while whites made up about 80 percent and voted 60 - 40 for Clinton .
Early exits polls indicated Obama scored big with new Democratic voters in the state while Clinton fared better with voters who made up their mind in the final days of campaigning .
They also indicated the economy was the number one issue .
Analysts said a big win for Clinton could propel her back into the race .
With neither candidate expected to gain a simple majority of delegates before August 's Democratic Convention , the nomination could be decided among the party 's 800 " superdelegates " -- state governors , members of Congress and party leaders and officials -- among whom Clinton continues to hold influence .
" If Clinton wins by more than 10 points , which was her margin in neighboring Ohio and New Jersey , her campaign will have new momentum and she will soldier on , " said Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst .
" If Clinton wins by single digits , we 're in a political twilight zone .
Nothing changes . "
But if Obama scores an upset , Schneider said , " Clinton will face tremendous pressure to end her campaign rather than damage the party . "
Obama played down his chances of a surprise victory despite outspending Clinton by about $ 7 million to her $ 2.7 million in the state .
His hopes rest on a strong performance in Philadelphia where he is expected to do well among African - American voters , among large numbers of newly registered voters and in the city 's wealthier suburbs .
Pennsylvania is also holding a Republican primary , but McCain has already secured the 1,191 delegates needed to win his party 's presidential nomination .

WHOLESALE PRICES WHOLESALE PRICES
The price of oil shot to a record Tuesday , pushed up by supply worries — and a gusher of new money into the commodities markets .
Texas light , sweet crude for May delivery closed at $ 113.79 , up $ 2.03 from Monday 's record settlement at $ 111.76 .
Oil has soared 79 % the past 12 months .
The record followed a government report that said prices at the wholesale level soared nearly 7 % in the 12 months ended in March and that half the increase came from energy .
Moving the prices : • Oil production jitters .
Middle East producers are pumping at full capacity .
" Any supply disruption has an outsized impact , " says Alec Young , equity market strategist for Standard & Poor's .
Traders have been fretting about problems in Nigeria and Russia .
• Huge demand .
" Even though the U.S. is in recession , analysts have underestimated the voracious demand for oil from emerging markets , " Young says .
Just seven in 1,000 Indians own a car , for example , despite India 's booming economy .
As emerging economies grow , so will the demand for oil and energy .
• The weak dollar .
Oil is priced in dollars , and the value of the dollar has tumbled 8 % this year vs. the euro .
Producers raise prices to compensate for the lower value of the dollar .
All of these forces have been in place for some time .
But huge demand for commodity investments — particularly in energy — have sent oil prices skyrocketing , says Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service .
" People are pouring money into commodities as the can 't - miss asset class of the second half of the decade , " Kloza says .
The number of energy futures contracts traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the first three months of 2008 soared 18 % vs. the same period in 2007 .
Investors have poured a net $ 928 million into four of the largest commodity exchange - traded funds this year , Lipper says .
Commodity markets are smaller than the stock or bond markets , and even modest increases in volume can push up oil prices sharply .
" People who say it has nothing to do with speculation are the same people who said there was n't a housing bubble a few years ago , " Kloza says .
Soaring oil prices drove wholesale prices up 1.1 % in March from February , the second - largest increase in 33 years , the Labor Department said Tuesday .
Producers ' prices in March were up 6.9 % from a year earlier , and about half the increase came from higher energy costs .
Energy prices on a monthly basis leaped 2.9 % in March , led by a 13.1 % rise in heating oil and a 15.3 % gain in diesel fuel .
Core producer prices , which are stripped of the volatile food and energy components , grew 0.2 % .
Ms Sebire suffers from an extremely rare form of cancer
Chantal Sebire , a 52 - year - old former schoolteacher and mother of three , had asked a court in Dijon , eastern France , to allow doctors to help her die .
But while the French have liberalised legislation governing euthanasia , the court ruled the law still did not allow doctors to actively end a life .
The case of Ms Sebire has , however , sparked intense debate and sympathy .
She suffers from an extremely rare form of cancer in the nasal cavity known as an esthesioneuroblastoma .
Only 200 cases of the disease have been recorded worldwide in the past two decades .
Appealing on French television last month for the right to die , Ms Sebire said she could no longer see properly , taste or smell .
She described how children ran away from her in the street .
" One would not allow an animal to go through what I have endured , " she said .
' Second opinion '
But a magistrate in Dijon said such a request could simply not be granted .
I now know how to get my hands on what I need , and if I do n't get it in France , I will get it elsewhere
Chantal Sebire
" Even if the physical degeneration of Madame Sebire merits compassion , this request can only be rejected under French law , " he said .
Legislation adopted in 2005 allows families to request that life - support equipment for terminally ill patients be switched off , but does not allow a doctor to take action to end a patient 's life .
French President Nicholas Sarkozy , whom Ms Sebire has urged to intervene in her case , said he had asked his chief health adviser to make contact , and help with providing further opinions on her condition .
Ms Sebire , who has said she will not appeal Monday 's decision , has , however indicated she may go to a country such as Switzerland - where assisted suicide is legal .
" I now know how to get my hands on what I need , and if I do n't get it in France , I will get it elsewhere , " she has said .
Sarah Wootton , of Dignity in Dying , which campaigns in the UK for assisted dying for the terminally ill , said : " It is immensely sad that because France has no assisted dying law , Chantal Sebire will continue to suffer .
" It is simply wrong that terminally ill people not just in France , but also in the UK , who are suffering unbearably are not being given the choice to die with dignity . "
We have been following the Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner for a long time .
It 's a beautiful aircraft , which allegedly provides with a much - better flying experience — less noise , bigger windows , more space , and better fuel efficiency — thanks to its new construction processes and technologies .
However , a new delay in its LEGO - like manufacturing process shows that Boeing is having very serious difficulties with its mass production , which will put them a whooping 18 months behind their original schedule .
Advertisement
According to the always entertaining Richard Quest , the delays have been caused precisely by the new technologies and manufacturing strategies that Boeing is using for the 787 .
Mainly , the biggest problem seems to be with the carbon fiber modules being manufactured all through the world , which then have to be brought and put together at Boeing 's Everett factory in Washington , using their gigantic cargo Dreamlifter .
Advertisement
But as Quest points out , there will have to be major changes to this process because , at the end of the day , " the reality is that they have discovered they can't do it " in this way .
One of these immediate and most serious changes , will likely require a redesign of the 787's wingbox .
As a result of these troubles , Boeing has ended with " new revised schedules " and an " extraordinary embarrassment " comparable to the humiliation that EADS had as a result of the multiple delays on the Airbus A380 .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The even - worse thing is that , while it 's understandable that companies like Boeing and EADS may have setbacks in the construction of these giant next - generation machines , the problem does n't end in the technological embarrassment :
Boeing will have to pay compensation to the airlines who have already bought 850 Dreamliners — which is " far more than any other aircraft at this stage " — and were expecting them on time .

Nightmareliner indeed . [ CNN ]
It s the end of a year that sets a record for American casualties in Iraq –and yet , we are told , the " surge " is " working . "
We re well into an election season in which the American voting public overwhelmingly opposes this war , and wants our troops out by the end of 08  and yet the " major " presidential candidates of both parties are pledged to keep us in , indefinitely .
As we look back on the events of 2007 , we cant help but detect this strange pattern of inversion , which I have previously dubbed the " Bizarro World effect . "
According to my theory , the collapse of the twin towers on 9/11 tore a hole in the space - time continuum , and we slipped into an alternate universe where metaphysics and morals are stood on their heads .
This has been pretty much confirmed by the events of the past six years  and yet 07 was a bit different .
Im pleased to report the Bizarro World effect appears to be wearing off , at least in certain areas : I m speculating , here , but it looks like the further away one is from the sites of the 9/11 attacks  New York City and Washington , D.C.  the more likely one is to have recovered ones senses .
So it wasnt all bad : the past year has given advocates of a more peaceful foreign policy some reason for hope , and that s the point of handing out these year - end awards :
Antiwar.coms " Man of the Year " 
No , it isnt Vladimir Putin : unlike others , we dont think hes the Devil incarnate , but neither is he an angel , and its certainly an odd choice for an American magazine to make .
Instead , Antiwar.com chooses Thomas Fingar , the principal author of the recently - issued National Intelligence Estimate on Iran .
As the Guardian put it : " Almost single - handedly he has stopped  or , at the very least , postponed  any U.S. military action against Iran . "
Fingar is a top intelligence analyst at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , a former head of the State Departments Bureau of Intelligence and Research , with a Stanford degree ( in political science ) and lots of experience with the State Departments China desk .
He is in charge of producing and overseeing the Presidents daily briefing , among other duties , was reportedly opposed to the Iraq war , and has consistently been a voice of reason within the administration .
Fingar has apparently been fighting the War Party  notably , John Bolton  in the corridors of power , and his recent victory in the NIE matter marks a turning point in the fight to re-take American foreign policy from the neoconservatives who hijacked it so effectively after 9/11 .
The Iran NIE augurs the rollback of the Bizarro Effect even in Washington , the very epicenter of the distortion .
With the triumph of the " realists , " and the retreat of the neocons , George W. Bushs last months in office may be a whole lot safer than we ever imagined possible .
Liberal of the Year  Glenn Greenwald , whose column at Salon.com is must - reading for all those concerned with our crazed foreign policy of global intervention , and its domestic consequences  the PATRIOT Act , and the rise of the surveillance state  has always been one of my personal favorites , but this year hes taken a turn for the better with his spirited defense of Ron Paul against the attack dogs of the sectarian Left .
This column on why the liberals operate under a double - standard when it comes to judging politicians , and his calm , reasoned refutation of the left - neocon smear campaign , is yet more evidence that here is a liberal who actually means what he says about opposing U.S. imperialism , and who doesnt put his defense of civil liberties on the back - burner in order to provide a left cover for the Democratic party .
Hes a populist , too , and that has something to do with it : he doesnt see himself as part of the Establishment , nor does he aspire to be the next Thomas Friedman .
Hes a true liberal , in the old sense of the term , meaning a rebel against the status quo  and since the status quo , today , is perpetual war abroad and authoritarianism on the home front , hes pro-peace and pro-liberty .
As I said here , Greenwald is well along the road , along with thousands of others inspired by Ron Pauls candidacy , from liberalism to libertarianism .
Conservative of the Year  John Derbyshire , the author , mathematician , and writer for National Review , who has consistently bucked the neocons , annoyed John Podhoretz to no end , and is capable of writing the following :
" From Kimberley Strassels piece in the Dec. 14 Opinion Journal :
Paul rallies heave with voters waving placards and shouting ‘ Liberty !
Liberty !’
" Are those supporters crazy , as some colleagues tell me ?
" Perhaps they are , to be shouting for liberty in 2007 , after decades of swelling federal power and arrogance , of proliferating taxes , rules , and interests , of gushing transfers of wealth to politically connected elites from working - and middle - class grunts , of the college and teacher - union scams , of the metastasizing tort - law rackets , of ever more numerous yet ever more clueless intelligence agencies , of open borders and visas for people who hate us , of widening cracks in our sense of nationhood ( " Press one for English " ) , of speech codes and race lobbies and judicial impositions .
" If those people are crazy , though , I want to be crazy with them .
Im for liberty , too .
That s why Im for Ron Paul .
And why do we have 75,000 soldiers in Germany ? "
Activist of the Year  Trevor Lyman , the Ron Paul supporter who conceived and was instrumental in organizing the two recent Ron Paul " money bombs , " neither of which were affiliated with the official campaign , and both of which were roaring successes .
Here is an example of self - generated , self - organizing activism of the sort that other campaigns only dream about .
A man with a vision  with no previous political experience , and no demonstrated fundraising ability  can make political history , and its no accident that he accomplished this on behalf of the Paul campaign , and not , say , one of the " major " candidates .
It s all about the ideas , as Ron Paul says , and , in Trevors case , its all about the war , and the complete inability or unwillingness of a Democratic congress to act on its electoral mandate and put an end to it .
That s what inspired him  and he has inspired us all .
Webmaster of the Year 
Our own Eric Garris , who has been the real mover and shaker behind Antiwar.com ( although I often , wrongly , get the credit ) , and without whose dedication this site would never have been created , let alone survived for over a decade as the worlds premier news - and - opinion site dealing primarily with US foreign policy and international affairs .
Eric is always working  yes , even on Christmas , hell be slaving away .
Surely he is the webmaster of the year  any year .
This Christmas , we have a lot to be grateful for , as well as a lot to worry about , and , when it comes down to it , the good and the bad just about balance each other out .
I thought , however , that Id accentuate the positive , for once  in hopes that the new year , which is already almost upon us , will be an improvement over the last .
There are many signs that the prospects for peace are getting better by the moment , and the American people are  finally !
 beginning to wake up from their post - 9/11 slumber .
And not a moment too soon .
Oil rose to a fresh record on the world 's commodities markets today , trading at above $ 115 a barrel on fears that stocks in the US would be inadequate for the summer driving season .
Continuing the strong upward movement of recent days , US light crude hit a peak of $ 115.45 but fell back as dealers took profits .
Brent crude was trading at a record $ 113.29 .
Oil prices have shrugged off the impact of looming recession in the US and a slowdown in the rest of the world to post records for the past three days .
The cost of crude is now the highest it has been , even when inflation is taken into account .
Today 's rise is likely to mean further increases in prices for UK motorists , already paying well over a pound a litre for unleaded petrol on forecourts .
Dealers said that an expected drop in demand for energy as economic growth weakened was currently being outweighed by concerns about shortages of supply and the weakness of the dollar .
US government data yesterday showed drops in gasoline and crude inventories against analysts ' expectations for increases .
" Summer driving season is approaching .
And even in a recessionary economy , seasonal gasoline demand will pick up , which adds to stress on the global oil supply chain , " Jan Stuart , economist with UBS , said .
The dollar was poised to drop through the $ 1.60 level against the euro today for the first time .
Oil is priced in dollars , and as the US currency has fallen on the foreign exchanges the price of crude has risen .
With the passage of the hotly debated state budget last night , New York legislators approved a bill that will require many online retailers to begin collecting sales taxes on purchases shipped to the state , even if they have no operations or employees working there .
New York Governor David Paterson is widely expected to sign the measure .
The so - called " Amazon tax " closes a loophole for Internet retailers who derive sales through affiliate programs in which Web site owners place a link to the merchant on their site and earn a commission on sales made from referrals .
In lobbying for the bill , the industry group representing New York retailers had argued that the exemption from the sales - tax collection requirement gave out - of - state online retailers an unfair competitive advantage .
" This is a first step -- but a critical one -- in our ongoing battle to level the sales tax playing field between New York retailers and the out - of - state Internet giants that have , for years , capitalized on an unfair and unintended competitive advantage driven solely by tax policy , " James Sherin , president CEO of the Retail Council New York , said in a statement reacting to the bill 's passage .
Legal experts predict challenges by Web affiliates .
The controversial bill ends what for many New Yorkers had been tax - free online shopping , and experts predict that other states could follow suit with similar provisions .
Consumers are required to report purchases they make online from out - of - state companies on their tax returns and remit a use tax , but many people are either unaware of that obligation or ignore it .
Collecting those taxes from individuals has been an administrative impossibility .
New York expects the new requirement will generate about $ 50 million in revenue this fiscal year .
The debate over the bill , which former - Gov. Eliot Spitzer introduced in February , had drawn sharp criticism from Amazon and conservative tax policy analysts .
It also rests in a murky legal area about the interstate tax responsibilities of online retailers .
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The Quill That Became Law
The tax was inspired in some ways by a 1992 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court .
In Quill v. North Dakota , the Court determined that out - of - state retailers cannot be required to collect sales tax on purchases sent to states where they did not have a physical presence .
They argued that compelling merchants to adhere to the complexities of the state and local tax codes would place an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce .
With the new law , New York is taking an aggressive stance on the Quill ruling , claiming that a retailer such as Amazon holds a physical presence in the state because it derives sales through its affiliates who live there , explained Hugh Goodwin Jr. , a state and local tax attorney and partner at the global firm DLA Piper .
As governors and legislators search for new sources of revenue , New York 's move could become a model for other states , but Goodwin expects a legal challenge over whether Internet affiliates are enough to constitute physical presence within a state .
" Quill says what it says , and it says physical presence , " Goodwin told InternetNews.com .
" It is an aggressive posture by the states .
The states have to expect that there 's going to be some opposition to provisions that are coming really close to this definition .
That 's where the battleground is . "
The law only applies to online retailers that collect at least $ 10,000 in annual revenue from affiliates who live in the state , but the requirement will be burdensome even for large companies , said Joe Henchman , tax counsel at the Tax Foundation , a tax - reform research group in Washington , D.C.
There are more than 7,400 state and local tax codes in the United States , and retailers complain that complying with the nuances of each will entail considerable expense .
" States are becoming increasingly ambitious about collecting revenue from out - of - state companies , " Henchman told InternetNews.com .
While Shermin of the Retail Council praised the bill for levelling the playing field for online and traditional retailers , Henchman said it will have the opposite effect , and that a universal tax rate is the only fair solution .
" Brick - and - mortar retailers will have to keep track of just one tax law at a time , while online retailers will have to keep up with 7,400 , " he said .
" A neutral tax system would have all retailers collect tax on one standard or the other . "
There is an initiative to simplify the tax codes among states through national legislation , but critics charge that the Streamlined Sales Tax Project is mired in bureaucratic infighting among the member states , and that even if Congress passed legislation based on its recommendations , it the state and local tax codes would still be overly complex .
In its lobbying efforts , Amazon had professed support for the Streamlined project , of which New York is not a member .
Spitzer had introduced the idea in November in a memo from the Department of Tax and Finance , but rescinded it the same day as media outlets began reporting the controversial new policy .
State Democrats say Clinton camp may sue Legal action could disrupt or delay caucuses , party says
AUSTIN — The Texas Democratic Party warned Thursday that election night caucuses scheduled for Tuesday could be delayed or disrupted after aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton threatened to sue over the party 's complicated delegate selection process .
In a letter sent out late Thursday to both the Clinton and Barack Obama campaigns , Texas Democratic Party lawyer Chad Dunn warned a lawsuit could ruin the Democrats ' effort to re-energize voters just as they are turning out in record numbers .
Spokesmen for both campaigns said there were no plans to sue ahead of the March 4 election .
" It has been brought to my attention that one or both of your campaigns may already be planning or intending to pursue litigation against the Texas Democratic Party , " Dunn wrote in the letter , obtained by the Fort Worth Star - Telegram .
" Such action could prove to be a tragedy for a reinvigorated Democratic process . "
Democratic sources said both campaigns have made it clear that they might consider legal options over the complicated delegate selection process , which includes both a popular vote and evening caucuses .
But the sources made it clear that the Clinton campaign in particular had warned of an impending lawsuit .
" Both campaigns have made it clear that they would go there if they had to , but I think the imminent threat is coming from one campaign , " said one top Democratic official , referring to the Clinton campaign .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity .
Another Democratic official who was privy to the discussions confirmed Clinton representatives made veiled threats in a telephone call this week .
" Officials from Sen . Clinton 's campaign at several times throughout the call raised the specter of ' challenging the process , ' " the official said .
The source , who asked not to be identified , said Clinton 's political director , Guy Cecil , had forcefully raised the possibility of a courtroom battle .
But Adrienne Elrod , Clinton 's top
Texas spokeswoman , said campaign and party officials had merely discussed election night procedures and that the campaign was merely seeking a written agreement in advance .
How I Met Your Mother is one of the three funniest shows on TV right now , along with The Office and 30 Rock .
However , because it ’s on the normally sucky CBS , it gets very little love and very little attention , except when they do things like stuntcast Britney Spears .
Sigh .
They do n’t need Britney , not when they have great comic actors like Neil Patrick Harris , Cobie Smulders , Josh Radnor , Alyson Hannigan and the absolutely awesome Jason Segel .
For the uninitiated , the framing device of the show is simple : in the year 2030 ( still no flying cars , sadly ) , this guy Ted is telling his kids the story of how he met their Mother .
That ’s it : nearly every episode starts with a shot of highly uninterested teenage kids staring in the camera while a voiceover starts the week ’s episode with a “ Kids , let me tell you … ) , before flashing back to the present with that week ’s part of the story of how he met their Mother .
Seems simple enough , but within that framing device lurks misdirections , fast - forwards , flashbacks , Rashomon - like POV changes , and , so far , no concrete idea of who The Mother actually is .
And oh yeah , lots and lots and lots of great jokes .
At its best , it is , in a word , awe–
–some !
It ’s also probably the most continuity - obsessed sitcom in the history of TV , though the makers of Arrested Development or The Office might beg to differ .
In any event , because it ’s so continuity - obsessed , it works on more levels than just that particular episode , meaning that it ’s perfect to geek out over .
Which I obviously have .
So , for the past year or so , the morning after an episode has aired , I ’ve rushed over to Alan Sepinwall ’s blog to see what the other HIMYM geeks thought of the latest episodes .
In the first season , the kids would occasionally react , or ask questions .
But no more .
Because the actors who played the kids have aged , they ’ve gone to using the same stock shot .
Apparently the thinking is that they ca n’t show any type of the interaction with the kids anymore because the actors would be visually older than they were when the show started .
The main reason this sucks is that it means that we will never get the reactions of the kids to the final revelation of how Ted met The Mother .
I ’m here to tell you why that thinking is wrong : it has struck me that even if Future Ted ( the father who is telling the story to his kids in 2030 ) was telling the story to his kids as just a narrative , it would take a very very long time .
One of the conceits of the show is that he will stop in the middle of an episode , and explain a piece of dialog ( or cover - up for a particularly risque piece of business ) to the kids .
Because of this , I ’ve always assumed each story was told in “ real ” time .
In roughly 20 minute pops .
So , say the series lasts 100 episodes .
( Please CBS , say the series lasts 100 episodes ! )
That would mean 2000 minutes of the story of how Ted met The Mother. 33 hours .
By the end of this season , they ’ll have done nearly 2 /3rds of that .
Now , no teenage kids are going to sit still for 33 hours straight while their father rattles on and on and on about his sex life , so therefore , this story has to be told over time .
In other words , he is n’t telling the story in just one sitting , but rather over multiple sessions .
I call them “ episodes . ”
And once you come to that conclusion , then you make it take any amount of time ( days , months , years ) for Future Ted to get through the entire story .
Therefore , the kids should actually be aging while he ’s telling the story .
So , it ’s OK for the Showrunners to bring back the actors for reactions .
It actually makes more sense .
Now , people might point out that the flaw in my theory is this : why the kids would come back for multiple sessions , er , episodes ?
That ’s easy : punishment .
They did something absolutely heinous — like make fun of one of their father ’s haircuts , and this is their punishment , like Jem reading to Mrs Dubose every day in “ To Kill a Mockingbird . ”
Of course , in that case , Jem and Scout learned a valuable lesson about dying with dignity , in this case the only thing learned by the kids is that their father can’t tell a story in a linear fashion or a short amount of time .
McCain really does n’t know what he ’s talking about when he talks about Iraq .
Well , he either really does n’t or he ’s really confused .
Not sure which is worse .
Think Progress spotted another blatant error today :
The GOP nominee does n’t understand what happened over the past couple weeks .
McCain thinks 1 ) al Sadr asked for the recent ceasefire ; and 2 ) the Iraqi military is functioning “ functioning very effectively . ”
Wrong and wrong :
In fact , it was members of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s government who brokered the ceasefire , to which Sadr agreed .
Experts agree that Sadr ’s influence was strengthened — rather than diminished — by the Basra battle .
Finally , the New York Times reported Friday that at least 1,000 Iraqi national soldiers deserted or refused to fight in Basra .
Like Bush , McCain just says things that are n’t true .
Part of it may be deliberate , but part may just be befuddlement .

In North Korea , the Eternal President pin is a symptom of a national cult of personality , just as Mao pins once were in China ; hammer and sickle pins were sported by many officials in the old Soviet Union , where an ideology became a political monoculture .
Here , the American flag pin is commonly held as a symbol of allegiance to a free society , not the emblem of a conformity that marginalizes dissent or writes it off as unpatriotic .
Many right - wing commentators have toyed with Mr. Obama ’s background , suggesting that he was reared in a fanatical Islamic religious setting ( he attends a Christian church in Chicago ) and have leaned hard on his middle name , which is Hussein .
They have not complained that Senator John McCain does n’t usually wear a flag pin .
And despite vacant lapel - age on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s clothing , no one got around to asking her on Wednesday night why she was n’t wearing a pin .
Instead , the other ABC moderator , George Stephanopoulos  like his colleague , Mr. Gibson , not wearing any visible flag pin  linked Mr. Obama ’s empty lapels to the “ general theme of patriotism in your relationships , ” noting that the senator had connections with a member of the defunct Weather Underground , the radical antiwar leftist group of the 1960s and 1970s that planted bombs in the United States .
Mr. Obama , who was a boy when the Weathermen were active , noted that he is also friendly with a very conservative member of the United States Senate , Tom Coburn , who once called for the execution of abortionists , and said he should n’t have to explain the views of every person he knows .
Mr. Finlayson , the trombonist , said his father , who fought in World War II and Korea , and was awarded a shelf of medals , flew the flag on the porch only on national holidays .
“ I suppose if Osama bin Laden showed up at Kennedy Airport wearing the Stars and Stripes on his turban , he just might get through , ” Mr. Finlayson said .
Once , on an episode of “ Seinfeld , ” Cosmo Kramer got into a fight at an AIDS walk when someone tried to make him wear an AIDS ribbon , as noted by James Joyner on the blog , Outside the Beltway :
KRAMER ( to organizer at desk ) : Uh , Cosmo Kramer ?
ORGANIZER : Uh ... O.K. , you ’re checked in .
Here ’s your AIDS ribbon .
LIVING WITH A DISABLED CAT
Copyright 1994,2013 Sarah Hartwell
Some cats are born disabled , other have suffered accidents or the degenerative effects of old age .
A disabled cat can still lead a full and enjoyable life , given a chance and an understanding owner .
Cats adapt their lifestyles to cope with disability far more easily than do most humans - this is because they are often willing to spend much of their time resting !
This article gives guidelines on caring for a disabled cat .
Just as the cat must adapt to its limitations , you will have to adapt your attitude and your home to accommodate its needs .
This article was updated 2001 in response to requests from owners of cats with cerebellar hypoplasia and radial hypoplasia / aplasia wishing to see more about the causes and management of these conditions .
Sections on two - legged cats and mobility carts ( including a link ) was added in 2002 in response to requests from owners of affected cats .
Links to providers of mobility carts and other resources is for reader convenience only and does not constitute an advertisement .
" Moving House With A Blind Cat " was added 2003 in response to reader requests .
THREE LEGGED CATS
The loss of a limb sounds catastrophic but 3 legged cats adapt well and are usually as agile and active as 4 legged cats .
The loss of a limb would be catastrophic to humans , but our limbs are more specialised ( 2 for walking , 2 for manipulating things ) while a cat 's limbs are all used for walking .
Three - legged cats need help grooming areas that would normally be groomed by the now - missing leg .
Do n't expect a recent amputee to be ' back to normal ' immediately , but do n't be over - protective .
He must work out his new limitations and how to compensate for a missing leg .
He must build up additional strength in his other limbs .
He can't do this if you carry him everywhere .
Honey - amputation of foreleg Twinkle - partial amputation of foreleg ( mummified hindleg later amputated fully )
Stumpy - one hindleg absent below hock joint , other hindleg amputated fully .
After an initial adjustment period , which is sometimes painful to watch , he will probably be able to jump and climb much as before .
If he has lost a hind leg , he may not be able to jump as high .
If he has lost a foreleg , he may find landing more difficult , especially when jumping down from a high place .
At first he will make some mistakes and you can expect some minor ( hopefully ) injuries , but he will quickly work out his own limitations and even find alternative routes to favourite places .
The loss of a fore - leg is actually more serious for a cat than the loss of a hind - leg .
This is because the forelegs are used when the cat lands after jumping while the hindlegs are used mostly for propulsion .
It is important that a three - legged cat is not allowed to become obese because he has fewer limbs on which to distribute his weight .
It is also important that he get exercise , gentle at first to help him adapt to his condition and more active later on to strengthen his remaining limbs .
Most 3 legged cats adapt well enough to become as active and energetic as they were before losing the leg - but you can't expect this to happen overnight and it may be painful to watch him adjusting .
Some kittens lose a limb very early on because the umbilical cord gets tangled round it and stops it from developing , because the mother cat is inexperienced and mishandles the kitten ( sometimes biting off the kitten 's paw due to a fault in her grooming behaviour ) or through some other birth defect which caused the limb to be deformed .
If the leg is amputated early in life , the kitten grows up on 3 legs and does n't know any different .
There are very many happy and healthy cats in the world whose nickname is " tripod " .
Remarkable Cats gives accounts of two feline amputees : Stumpy , a cat with partial hind legs , and Twinkle , a cat with one hind leg and one and a half fore legs .
TWO LEGGED CATS ( UNILATERAL DOUBLE AMPUTEES , DIAGONAL DOUBLE AMPUTEES )
One thing cats have in their favour is an amazing sense of balance .
This has resulted in cats with two amputated limbs ( fore - limb and hind - limb on the same side ) becoming fully mobile without the need for a cart .
Cats with diagonal amputations , such as " Twinkle " mentioned earlier , can adapt in a similar way .
In 2001 , a young black - and - white cat involved in a road accident arrived at Torre Argentina shelter ( Rome , Italy ) after surgery .
He had 2 legs crushed on the same side and a mangled tail .
Shelter staff decided to give him a chance to adapt to life with two legs and named him Farinello .
Initially half - slithering , half - walking , the friendly but mangled cat was overlooked by shelter visitors who often would n't even touch the disfigured creature who crawled out of his bed to meet them .
Farinello was adopted by German family in Munich and learned to walk and even jump .
Unfortunately the family could n't keep him and Farinello was sent back to the shelter where he went into a decline through depression .
After several months he was adopted by an Italian family and regained his health and his enthusiasm for life .
Farinello is not the only documented case of a two - legged cat .
In 2002 the case of Miss Kitty was reported in the USA .
Found hobbling around on two broken legs , the young semi- longhaired colour - point cat was taken to a vet surgery to be euthanized .
Both legs on the cat 's right side were dead and rather than put the cat to sleep , the vet amputated the legs .
The intention was for Miss Kitty to be fitted for a mobility cart , something possibly not considered in Farinello 's case .
Miss Kitty took matters into her own paws when she skipped out of the consulting room on her two remaining legs .
She is now the surgery 's resident cat and can both run and jump onto and off of chairs .
Both of the cats had youth on their side .
Older cats which lose two limbs in this way will have more difficulty adapting and find it harder to re-learn how to balance and walk .
If this is the case , a wheelchair or mobility cart offers a better solution .
In 2012 , Carrie Hawks ( Florida , USA ) found a male kitten that had been born without a pelvis or his two hind legs .
This kitten had apparently been wandering in the woods with a group of feral cats .
She caught the disabled kitten and named him Anakin .
At 2 – 3 months old , he plays and scurries around by balancing on his forelegs , which he positions under his middle , and balancing with his tail .
X - rays showed that despite missing his pelvis and hind limbs , he is otherwise normal with no internal abnormalities , although he sometimes needs enemas as he can’t always expel faeces ( especially as he ca n’t squat normally ) .
Should Anakin start to find things difficult , he will be fitted with a cat - wheelchair to support his hind end .
Caffrey , Sue Greaves ’ two - legged black Persian was reported in February 2013 .
He lost his left hind leg in 2003 , aged three , after being run over by a car .
His left fore - paw was also injured in the accident , but for many years Caffrey managed just fine with three legs .
Towards the end of 2012 , a malignant growth meant he was forced to have his front left leg amputated .
This left him with two legs , both on his right side .
Her vetm and several colleagues , believed Caffrey would be unable to walk and have no quality of life , but decided to give Caffrey a chance nonetheless .
He was expected to spend several weeks recovering at home , but within days he had achieved near perfect balance and he learnt to trot and run on his remaining limbs .
In March 2005 , a one year old two - legged cat got a prosthetic limb .
This case is described in the next section .
HIND -LIMB PARALYSIS ( & HIND - LIMB DOUBLE AMPUTATION )
Some cats suffer hind limb paralysis following accidental injury to the spinal cord .
Because the tail is an extension of the spinal cord , this is usually also paralysed .
Where the damage is to the nerves controlling the hind legs or pelvic damage , the tail may be unaffected .
Depending on the nature of the injury , paralysis may be temporary or permanent and may involve loss of sensation in bowel and bladder as well .
Where the injury has caused the blood supply to be cut off , the vet may opt to amputate the tail and / or lower parts of the hind legs due to the risk of gangrene .
Other conditions causing lack or loss of hind - limb function are pelvic deformities and spina bifida .
In some extreme cases , kittens have been born without proper pelvic bones .
If the bladder and bowel are affected this will result in incontinence ( uncontrolled dribbling of urine , uncontrolled defecation ) or an inability to urinate / defecate unaided .
In either case , the owner can manually express the bowel and bladder .
The vet will show you how to do this .
A build up of urine in the bladder can lead to infection which can track up the ureters to the cat 's kidneys .
If the cat is incontinent inbetween sessions , nappies ( US : diapers ) may be possible .
There are nappies ( " Stud- Pants " " Piddle - Pants " ) designed for incontinent dogs and cats , sometimes used by owners of stud cats which spray indoors .
Washable bedding will also be needed and must be washed daily .
Caring for a long - term incontinent cat requires effort and commitment .
PET WHEELCHAIRS & MOBILITY AIDS :
This is not a directory , but I 've been asked so many times for links I 've included a few .
Many of the sites below have links to related products .
Google will also give many more links Dog Mobility ( UK - based ) - wheelchairs , ramps , nappies etc

Many cats have pursued several more years of mobility and good quality of life using a " wheelchair " or mobility cart .
Initially developed for dogs , but now available for cats as well , these support the cat 's hind quarters and tail so that they do n't drag along the ground .
The cat can walk , run , lie down and defecate while in the cart .
They are also suited to hind - limb amputees .
The carts are generally made to measure and if used for a young cat or kitten , will have to be replaced as the cat grows .
Whether or not your cat is suited to a mobility cart depends on its personality and ability to adapt to a more dependent lifestyle .
Fiercely independent , tree - climbing kitties may not be able to make the adjustment to a more limited lifestyle .
Although designed to cope with a variety of terrains , pet mobility carts are rare in the UK due to the prevailing unsupervised indoor - outdoor lifestyle of most British cats .
In the USA , where an indoor lifestyle is more normal - meaning more even terrain - and a cat 's outside forays are likely to be supervised , they are more common .
They have been imported into the UK and some skilled cat owners have made similar carts ( as a temporary measure ) using the children 's construction toy Meccano or plastic plumbing tubes .
Home made carts are often in the form of four wheeled frames with the body supported by a sling .
Although useful as a stop - gap measure while a specialist cart is being made to measure or while a kitten is growing fast , many home - made carts are too bulky , heavy and cumbersome for long term use .
One thing cats in mobility carts cannot do is jump .
To reach a favourite chair , the cat requires a ramp wide enough to accommodate the cart .
Although not impossible , it is probably inadvisable for the cat to jump down from the chair .
Because pressure sores can develop at the points where the cat 's body is supported ( particularly on lifeless limbs where the cat cannot shift its position ) lap - times , nap - times and bed - times are times to come out of the cart .
Many cats are happy to remain in one place during these times , while others prefer to drag their hind ends around the floor .
Owners need to watch out for pressure sores and also for abrasions caused by dragging the lifeless limbs on the ground .
British behaviourists have expressed concerns that a partially paralysed cat 's body language might put it at a disadvantage .
For example , its lifeless tail might be interepreted by other cats as a " tail between legs " fear posture , but there is no evidence that affected cats are at any more disadvantage than naturally tailless or bobtailed breeds .
In Britain there is generally more resistance to artificial aids such as pet wheelchairs .
However , in the early 1990s a British Cat Shelter had a paraplegic puss who adapted well to a mobility cart for several years .
Hector was a semi- longhaired black - and - white tuxedo cat whose hind legs were paralysed by injury when he was six years old .
Hector lived at the Ingleside Cat Shelter who reported that his easy - going and co-operative personality meant he adapted well to a life in a mobility cart and his greater dependence on humans .
He was possibly one of the first British cats to use a mobility cart .
Hector eventually died of cancer , a condition unrelated to his partial paralysis .
George Stubbs - Two - Legged Wonder
Cat is another account of a cat with no hind legs , this time one who does not use a mobility cart .
In March 2005 , a one year old two - legged cat got a prosthetic limb .
George Bailey ( Raleigh , North Carolina , USA ) had two good front legs , but had to drag his stumps behind him .
In a pioneering two hour operation , surgeons at North Carolina State University drilled into his right tibia and fastened a custom - made prosthetic leg in place using titanium screws .
It is hoped that George Bailey 's leg bone will grows over the prosthesis and that he will be able to use his spring steel foot within six weeks .
Prior to the surgery , which cost thousands of dollars , owner Al Simmons had unsuccessfully ried home - made prosthetics using crutch tips and furniture tips held in place using Velcro ( it was not reported whether they had tried a wheelchair to support the hind legs ) .
It is claimed that George Bailey is the first cat to be fitted with a prosthesis and while he is the first cat to get a high - tech limb , he is not the first cat to get an artificial limb .
In the 1950s , Elmer Davis reported the case of a cat in Maine which had lost a foreleg leg in a trap .
His owner fitted him with a wooden peg which the cat apparently tolerated .
Not only did the cat walk on his wooden leg , when the cat caught a rat he beat it insensible with the wooden leg .
In June 2010 , the BBC TV documentary " The Bionic Vet " reported the case of a black cat called Oscar ( nicknamed the bionic cat ) that had both lower hind legs replaced by prosthetic limbs .
Oscar 's back legs had been severed by a combine harvester in October 2009 .
The prosthetics were custom - made implants that mimic the way deer antler bone grows through skin .
Padded feet are then attached to those prosthetic implants .
The pioneering operation was carried out by Surrey - based vet Noel Fitzpatrick and uses biological and engineering technology that will be applied to some human amputees .
Two - and - a - half year old Oscar had been snoozing in a maize field in Jersey when a combine harvester sliced off both back paws just below the ankle ( cats walk on their toes ) .
His owner thought Oscar would have to be put to sleep , but Jersey vet Peter Haworth cleaned and dressed the wound and gave painkillers and then referred the case to Fitzpatrick .
Oscar 's laid back temperament made him a suitable patient .
Two weeks later , Oscar flew from Jersey to Surrey to be measured for implants and later to have surgery .
The weight - bearing prosthetic pegs ( from hock to ankle ) are known as intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prosthetics ( ITAPs ) and were developed by a team from University College London led by Professor Gordon Blunn , head of UCL's Centre for Biomedical Engineering .
It involves implanting a piece of titanium metal and a flange into which bone and skin grows .
The titanium implant attaches to the bone at the point of amputation and sticks out through the skin which moulds around it , mimicking the way a deer 's skin and fur moulds around antlers .
The result resembles a lower leg bone in the way it moves .
Once these had healed fully , rubber paws were attached .
These were later replaced by rubber and metal paws ( thoughtfully covered in black tape to match Oscar 's colour ! ) and Oscar was up and moving as soon as the sedative wore off .
Oscar was soon walking , running and jumping like a normal cat and will return to Jersey when vets are satisfied with his rehabilitation and his treatment is complete .
His access to outdoors will have to be supervised in future because the prosthetic paws lack sensation or claws .
Four pairs of longer lasting prosthetic paws had had to be made as active Oscar wore through the first set in weeks !
Advanced prosthetics like Oscar 's are both time consuming and expensive .
The patient also needs to be healthy enough and laid back enough to cope with surgery and with periods of cage rest .
For owners who consider their cats family members with many years ahead of them , the expense is considered worthwhile .
Oscar faces some limitations to his lifestyle as he has no sensation below the hocks , but he can run , jump and even climb on his prosthetic paws .
PET PROSTHETICS :
This is not a directory , but I 've been asked so many times for links I 've included a few .

Lacerta ( part of University of Salford , UK ) - article and links on Dr Glyn Heath who makes prosthetic limbs for animals and birds BLIND CATS
Cats that keep bumping into things either can't co-ordinate their limbs or can't see .
A blind eye is often cloudy or the pupil remains dilated even in bright light .
Some cats are born without eyes ( anopthalmia ) or with very small eyes ( micropthalmia ) which may not function .
Others lose their sight either permanently or temporarily as a result of illness , physical injury , brain damage or poisoning ( including extreme reaction to anaesthesia ) and conditions such as glaucoma , cataracts or scarring caused by untreated entropion ( inturned eyelashes ) .
The degree of blindness varies from total blindness to partial blindness ( cloudy sight , ability to differentiate between light and shade , tunnel vision ) in much the same way that human blindness varies .
Usually the loss of sight is gradual and the cat compensates gradually so that you do n't even realise how bad its sight is .
Sometimes illness or injury necessitates the removal of one or both eyes .
Sudden blindness is more noticeable because the cat is disoriented , hesitant when walking , bumps into things and may vocalize more often ( some cats appear to listen for sound echoes ) .
Where a cat becomes suddenly blind it may develop unusual behaviours until it learns to adapt .
It may be unwilling to leave its sleeping area and may develop inappropriate toilet habits because it is unable to find the litter tray .
It will be reluctant to go outdoors to toilet .
It may appear withdrawn and call out ( when disoriented or in need of reassurance ) .
To test your cat 's vision , cover each eye in turn and see if its other eye can follow a moving finger or responds to a finger moving towards the uncovered eye .
You can also test its response to a torch ( flashlight ) being flashed on and off in the direction of the eye , but this is not 100 % accurate since blindness is not always seated in the eyeball itself - the pupil may respond to light , but the normal ' vision signals ' are not correctly processed by the brain .
A cat blind in one eye may lash out in self - defence at sudden movements on its blind side .
A cat with unilateral blindness may turn its head more often in order to compensate for the reduced field of vision .
It may also have problems with depth perception since it has lost the stereoscopic area of vision - one - eyed cats often take several ' sightings ' of a chair ( etc ) before jumping onto it , but quickly memorize the heights of such objects for future reference .
Fully blind cats may clamber onto things rather than jump , but many also memorize heights and distances which is why furniture should not be rearranged and obstructions should not be left on the floor when there is a blind cat in the house .
A blind cat is easily disoriented and should not be allowed to roam ; indoors only or indoors with access to a fenced pen or garden is best .
It may enjoy supervised forays in the garden using a harness and lead .
Make sure it is wearing a collar stating its address and disability in case it escapes .
If it is allowed to roam freely and is chased by another animal it may become lost or run into the path of traffic .
Because it relies so much on scent / sound , a lost blind cat will probably be unable to find its way home once it is beyond its normal territory .
Blind cats rely on scent and memory to find their way around so keep furniture in the same place and do n't leave obstacles in unexpected places where he could walk into them .
If he is prone to bumping into furniture , try padding table legs and chair legs with old pillows or some foam to reduce impact damage .
While most blind cats soon memorize routes and distances , not all manage this feat and rely on ' bumping into ' their signposts .
Whiskers become more important to blind cats to judge the cat 's proximity to an object .
This means they are subjected to more wear and tear than normal and can be broken or even worn down !
Sound is also important to a blind cat .
Noisy toys such as balls with bells in , a noisy paper sack or a scrunched up paper ball will provide stimulation .
Many blind cats learn how dribble scrunched paper balls or jingly toys .
According to Dean , his 2 year old born - blind domestic longhair can actually locate crumpled paper by listening for it to un-crumple a little and retrieves toys to play with .
She also catches flies , runs around the house at speed based on her memory of obstacles , pounces on other cats by listening to their footsteps and uses her very long whiskers and ear hair as sensors , possibly also sensing changes in air pressure with them .
She also walks with her tail tip touching the ground as an additional sense organ .
Carrying a blind cat around can disorient it so if you must move it , place it somewhere it knows well such as its feeding or sleeping area so that it can easily get its bearings .
Do n't move its litter tray or feeding areas around , it needs to find them easily by memory or use them as landmarks .
Do n't lift a blind cat onto raised surfaces as he will probably be disoriented and fall off .
This might not apply if he is being lifted onto a familiar surface such as a favourite chair or your bed .
If the owner takes care to provide a safe , stimulating environment then a blind cat or kitten can have a life which is a rich and happy as any sighted cat .
Because blind cats are often able to adapt so well to the absence of this sense , many owners of blind kittens do not realise that the kitten is blind for some considerable length of time !
There are also numerous reports of blind cats with access to outdoor enclosures successfully hunting birds and small mammals using scent and hearing alone .
Interestingly , other cats are often more tolerant of blind cats ( which may collide with them ) than they are of sighted cats .
Moving House With A Blind Cat
These are not definitive rules , but common sense guidelines .
For the most part they are similar to settling a sighted cat into a new home - starting with one room and expanding this territory over time .
For a blind cat , you will need to take extra care that the surroundings are safe and progress may be slower .
Encouragement , reassurance and rewards are essential .
Before you move , get your cat used to spending time or sleeping in a room on his own .
Make sure the room is kitted out with a litter tray , a bed and with food and water .
These facilities will be in addition to his normal litter tray , bed and eating area .
This is necessary because you will have to confine him to one room when you arrive at your new home .
Spend time with him in that room before closing the door for the night .
So that he knows it is not a punishment , put some treat foods ( varying these over time ) in the room or give him special fuss e.g. petting , grooming .
He will associate the room with quality time .
If possible , spend the first few nights in there with him .
Leaving a radio playing on low volume will provide company if you feel he is suffering from loneliness .
After you move , you will have to introduce your blind cat one room at a time to the new home .
This room must be set up with familiar things ( bed , litter tray ) and will be his new " safe room " .
He needs to scent mark ( with his cheek glands and flanks ) the new surroundings so he can find his way and feel at home .
He also needs to feel his way around and memorise his surroundings .
This is best done one room at a time .
At first it will be difficult to watch because he does not know where he is .
When he gets his bearings on the first room , let him extend his boundaries .
Supervise these excursions until he seems confident .
If you are in a home with multiple floors , temporarily block off the stairs .
Use your voice to provide encouragement for him to follow you .
Getting down on hands and knees to " walk him around " may help ( I have used this trick with a very shy sighted cat ) .
At first he must spend his nights in his safe room until he gains confidence and has memorised his surroundings .
Once he is familiar with one level , you can extend his boundaries to the next level at his own pace i.e. remove the block on the stairs .
When you can't be there to supervise , confine him to the original level until he is confident on the stairs and on both upstairs and downstairs .
Eventually you will have to shift his core territory from the safe room to the intended sleeping , eating and eliminating area .
He may already have chosen a preferred area and you can move his bed and his food there .
More likely you will have to duplicate his sleeping , eating and eliminating facilities i.e. one set in his safe room and one set in the final areas ( living room , kitchen , bathroom etc ) otherwise he will get totally confused at the sudden disappearance of his litter tray and accidents may result .
When he is consistently using the tray in the preferred location , you can remove the one in the safe room
Make sure there are lots of treats and plenty of interaction while he settles into the new surrounding .
Provide encouragement to explore and reassurance when he becomes disoriented or uncertain .
If he becomes disoriented , guide him back to a familiar place , preferably with your voice or be walking with him .
Only pick him up and place him in a familiar place ( e.g. his bed ) as a last resort .
Some cats , e.g. some blue - eyed whites , are born deaf .
Many other cats are thought to be ' grumpy ' by owners who do n't realise that their cat can't hear .
Deafness can be congenital or related to age , illness or physical injury .
Many cats lose their hearing gradually as they age ( as do many humans ) , sudden loss of hearing is normally the result of illness or injury and may be temporary or permanent .
Where hearing loss is gradual , it can be ages before you realise that Puss is deaf because the cat compensates for its lack of hearing .
Where hearing loss is sudden , the cat may appear confused , irritable , over - attached to the owner , insecure or exhibit other ' unusual ' behaviours in response to the sudden loss of this sense .
Some deaf cats call out more often and more loudly ( they cannot regulate their own volume ) while others may become mute .
As with blindness , deafness varies in degree .
In most older cats , hearing loss is gradual and not apparent until the later stages since cats do not always respond to being called .
A cat with unilateral deafness may turn its head more often to increase the chance of picking up sounds with the hearing ear .
Poor hearing makes cats defensive - they strike out first and ask questions later .
Click your finger nails close to each ear in turn ( make sure that it can't see your hands though ) - does it respond ?
Is it easily startled if you approach it from behind and touch it ?
Some deaf cats learn to respond to hand signals similar to those used in distance control of dogs .
At close range , sharp handclaps might provide enough vibration in the air to get the cat 's attention .
Flashing a torch ( flashlight ) , shone in the direction of the cat , on and off can be used to call it in from the garden at dusk ( this also works with hearing cats ) especially if it the flashing light is followed by a tasty incentive .
Deaf cats cannot hear warning sounds such as car engines , lawnmowers or barking dogs .
If it goes outdoors , make sure it is wearing a collar ( in case it is startled by something and bolts ) and write ' I AM DEAF ' on the collar to help people who wonder why the cat fails to react to shouts , car horns etc .
A noisy bell on its collar will help you to locate its whereabouts when it is in motion .
It is safest to confine a deaf cat to a safely fenced garden unless , like me , you are in a quiet area with no aggressive dogs and plenty of cat - lovers pre pared to take extra care .
In June 2003 , a German acoustics expert announced his invention of a hearing aid for cats .
Hans - Rainer Kurz , a hearing aid specialist , took two years to develop the hearing aid with help from experts at the Vetenarian University in Hanover .
They developed a tiny device , which can be implanted in the cat 's outer ear .
Herr Kurz has already had success with a similar aid for dogs .
He admitted that the device would not cure totally deaf cats , but could help those with severe hearing difficulties .
The hearing aid ensures that the cat is able to take the usual acoustic signals and re-work them into sounds in the brain .
Quiet sounds that hearing - impaired cats had never heard before would become distinguishable .
The feline hearing aid currently costs around £ 300 .
Despite a dark silent existence , deaf - blind cats can enjoy life since they rely on their keen sense of smell and their sense of touch through whiskers on the face and also on the lower leg .
Cats which have been blind throughout much of their lives may eventually suffer the additional problem of age - related deafness .
Most of the considerations noted for blind cats and for deaf cats apply .
A deaf - blind cat may hear you approaching by vibrations of the air and of the floor .
It is likely to become defensive and is easily startled .
It can be alerted to your presence by blowing gently in its direction .
At mealtimes , blow across the food bowl to waft the scent towards it .
Such cats can never be allowed outdoors unsupervised .
Confine a deaf - blind cat to familiar areas of the house where they can learn their way around and could sunbathe near a window .
A mesh covered window can provide ventilation and scents from outdoors , but the room must be escape - proof for the cat 's own safety .
When you are at home , a deaf - blind cat can have free run of the familiar area under a watchful eye ; but while you are out , make sure the cat is in a safe , escape - proof room or pen with food , water and litter within easy reach ( do not move the locations of these necessities , it will confuse the cat ) .
Catnip - scented toys provide stimulation .
A harness and leash allow such cats to go into the garden and enjoy the natural textures and scents .
Cat - safe plants such as catmint , cat - thyme or Japanese cat - vines can provide enjoyment .
This way they can ' feel ' the owner 's reassuring presence because through the leash .
Whenever they feel disoriented , indoors or outdoors on a leash , most deaf - blind cats learn to sit still , wailing , until help arrives and they are moved back to a familiar area .
Like blind cats , deaf - blind cats memorize their surroundings , but they are doubly at risk because they cannot hear dangers approaching .
Block off hazards such as stairs and fireplaces with a solid barrier - make sure the cat cannot stand on tiptoe and find the top of the barrier or it may decide to clamber over !
As with a deaf cat , a noisy bell on its collar will help you locate it as it explores .
A deaf - blind cat can never have unsupervised access to outdoors or to unfamiliar or hazardous parts of your home .
Make sure it knows exactly where to find its food and also litter tray otherwise accidents will ensue .
Such cats , if cared for well , gain plenty of enjoyment through their senses of smell and touch .
Moving House With A Deaf - Blind Cat
For moving house with a deaf - blind cat , the guidelines are much the same as for moving house with a blind cat ( covered in the section about blind cats ) except that sound stimuli ( encouragement , reassurance ) must be replaced by touch and smell i.e. stroking , walking the layout on hands and knees with the cat alongside you ( this really does work as it mimics the way a mother cat leads her kittens ) , encouraging the cat to explore by offering food treats .
The term ' spastic ' may be considered politically incorrect , however cats have no concept of political correctness and this colloquial term ( defined in my dictionary as " suffering from spasms " ) covers several conditions with similar symptoms .
I apologise to anyone who objects to the term , but I would point out that the term is used in the UK to describe cats with disabilities of co-ordination , muscular spasms and muscular tremor .
To avoid confusion among American readers , the term " spastic " is not used in the sense of a cat whose muscles lock rigid e.g. during a fit .
Spastic cats ( CH cats ) are sometimes born to females who have suffered Feline Infectious Enteritis ( FIE , Feline Panleukopaenia , Feline Distemper ) during pregnancy .
Cats which have suffered brain damage through an accident may also be unco-ordinated so these notes apply .
It can also be due to injury , poisoning or simply a random development problem .
It is not known to be caused by a pregnant cat receiving a the Enteritis vaccination and is usually only seen in kittens born to feral , stray or unvaccinated cats .
Adult cats have an immune system which can usually can fight off FIE , but in kittens the virus can cross the blood - brain barrier and cause defects in the cerebellum .
Unborn kittens at 1 - 4 weeks gestation are usually killed by the infection and the foetus is reabsorbed by the mother or spontaneously aborted .
Kittens at about 4 - 5 weeks gestation may be stillborn and have major defects ; if born live they are unlikely to survive .
Kittens infected near the end of the pregnancy may be stillborn or may be born with Cerebellar Hypoplasia ( spasticity ) .
These timings and the effects depend on the development stage , size , health and strength of the kitten .
It also depends on the mother cat 's health , the environment and the amount of virus she was exposed to .
There are different strains of the virus and some may be more damaging to unborn kittens than others .
Affected kittens may not grow as large as unaffected kittens or they may have slower development .
The virus affects the cerebellum area of the brain , an area involved in fine motor control .
Typical symptoms are ataxia ( poor co-ordination ) , gait abnormalities and perception .
Affected cats are wobbly and unco-ordinated ( variable degrees from wobbly through to unable to walk ) and have characteristic head tremors which are evident when they try to focus on something ( e.g. a bird ) .
Many also have sight problems , but it is difficult to assess their sight due to their strange posture and gait .
It often looks as though their body goes the opposite of what they are telling it to do , or one part goes in one direction while the other tries to head off elsewhere !
They adapt to these challenges , but will always be clumsy and may be nervous or unsure of themselves in new situations .
Barring any accidents caused by their unco-ordination , their life expectancy does n't seem to be affected and given a safe environment , they live as long as unaffected cats and seem little troubled by their condition .
In humans , the problems would be significant disabilities .
CH cats do n't worry over their inability to do things in the same way or at the same speed as other cats .
Spastic cats can do everything other cats do and are equally independent - they climb fences , play and performs daredevil feats , though they can be alarming to watch , especially as they teeter along a fence .
Occasionally they slip , catch hold with their claws and haul themselves back up again ; make sure there are soft plants to cushion any fall !
Like disabled humans most wo n't want to be overprotected , but in the same way that disabled facilities are made available to humans , some thought needs to be given to toilet facilities , access to favourite spots etc to ensure their wellbeing .
It is not advisable to give a spastic cat free access to outdoors as their mobility problems , perception problems and possible sight problems makes traffic doubly hazardous to them .
If you have an enclosed garden or a cat harness and leash they can have access outdoors .
Many people are unaware of the condition and people who see these cats twitching on the path outdoors sometimes try to help the ' injured cat ' , but the cat 's crazy zig - zag run confuses most pursuers - they simply do n't end up in the place they appeared to be heading for ( one more reason roads pose such a threat , a driver who tries to avoid the cat cannot compensate for the cat ending up in the wrong place ) .
Even birds are caught unawares by this zig - zag approach and I know of spastic cats who are reasonable hunters , exploiting this element of surprise .
CH cats are extremely independent and owners report that affected cats usually have " sunny personalities " , but some allowances still have to be made .
Cushions and rugs under windowsills act as safety nets and crash - mats for an unco-ordinated cat .
CH cats often lean against walls when at rest and when running , using the wall for stability and guidance .
If you provide a ramp up to seats or sills , make sure it is wide since such cats rarely walk in straight lines , carpet it for extra grip and make sure there is some form of crash - mat in case the cat does fall .
It may be a good idea to leave such cats with a full complement of claws since they need the extra grip to compensate for limb tremors .
These should be clipped regularly so they do n't accidentally snag in furnishings .
The litter tray needs to be untippable and high - sided apart from the entrance .
Puss may need to lean against a side while using it .
Even so , you need newspaper around it and must be prepared for some accidents as they do n't always position themselves correctly .
You may need to clean under the tail more frequently as the cat may be unable to co-ordinate itself well enough to stay in a squatting position while using the tray , or it may stagger and tread in the faeces .
Spastic cats are also messy eaters , placing both front paws in the food to prop their head up while eating .
If they twitch , some of the food goes flying so feed it in an easily cleaned area and use an untippable water bowl !
Despite what would seem to be unsurmountable problems to humans , CH cats enjoy a good quality of life , but need you to watch out for their inevitable accidents .
When they fall , they often go floppy and relatively short falls ( coffee table etc ) will damage their dignity rather than their body .
One owner of a spastic cat told me " let him pick himself up first , do n't compound the indignity by picking him up unless it is obvious that he needs help or is injured - and remember - cats bounce ! "
Much of the information given here for Twisty Cats can also be applied to cats which have lost both fore - limbs through injury of birth defect .
One of the earliest accounts of a double amputee cat with no fore legs can be found in Philip Brown 's book " Uncle Whiskers " ( 1970s , out of print , but sometimes turns up at secondhand book stores or jumble sales ) .
To protect his healing stumps , Uncle Whiskers was originally fitted with leather " boots " .
Some people who see a cat with Radial Hypoplasia ( RH ) for the first time either think it has both front legs broken or notice that it sits up like a rabbit .
They walk in a shuffling or scrabbling motion .
There are varying degrees of the condition , these tips take a worst case scenario .
Mildly affected cats may get along just fine , but have a peculiar bobbing gait .
Some affected cats are found among feral cat colonies , but unless the colony is being fed by someone , RH cats are unlikely to survive outdoors - they cannot hunt , cannot run from predators , traffic or malicious humans and cannot defend themselves if molested .
In addition they are likely to be singled out for abuse because they are different and therefore " easy targets " .
The front legs can be considered severely crippled , often with toes going in all different directions .
To help a cat with radial hypoplasia in getting around the house , you need carpet or rugs because they may have a hard time slithering across slippery floors on almost useless front legs .
Because the cats are walking on a crooked part of the leg rather than on the paw , you need to watch out for sores developing on the leg over time , the skin becomes callused and hardened , but when an affected kitten is learning to walk and trying to play , the skin can become abraded .
If calluses do not form , you may be able to fashion a padded leather bootee to protect the cat 's skin .
Favourite resting places need to be at low level and should be well padded to give the forelegs a well - earned rest .
Cats with severe RH have problems cleaning their faces , particularly their ears and eyes .
This can result in recurrent infections and a build up of debris around the eyes , in the ears and also food debris can accumulate around the mouth and nose .
Extra attention is needed to keep these areas clean so that infection does not occur .
In a multi-cat household , other cats have sometimes been seen to wash the face of an RH cat ( and even to " cover up " in the litter tray for them ! ) .
One or two RH cat owners have reported that their cats have extra skin around the eyes though this trait is not necessarily linked to the foreleg deformity .
Stella - mild radial hypoplasia
One danger is that of ingrown toenails because the claws do not get normal wear from walking and often the twisted leg cannot scratch a scratching post , either vertically or horizontally .
Sometimes the claws are deformed or twisted and even cutting them is hard .
Even if you are normally opposed to declawing , this is one instance where declawing may be necessary for health purposes .
Some owners have reported horn - like spurs growing out of the paw pads ; these might be bony spurs growing from damaged toe bones ( bones are prone to growing spurs after certain types of damage ) or to the unused tissue of the paw shrinking back to leave a " mummified " section of bone .
If these are causing discomfort or interfering with the cat 's locomotion , they should be removed .
Depending on the severity , the RH trait does not necessarily cause pain in movement , tendon problems or arthritis .
Because they can still climb and often develop more powerful hind - legs to compensate for the weak forelegs , most RH cats can get onto chairs , beds etc either by jumping or by climbing .
Jumping onto higher surfaces such as shelves may be impossible but the front paws are not positioned to grasp the edge of the surface as a cat with normal forelegs does .
Normal cats tend to " run " up the final few feet of a high leap and RH cats cannot do this .
They can only jump as high as their back legs can propel them or they might climb up soft furnishings or wire mesh .
However the jump down is problematical because they must land on the forelegs .
With their reduced forelegs , the landing is more dangerous and even painful .
The cat 's chin may graze on the ground as normal forelegs act like shock absorbers , damping the impact .
Having climbed up onto a chair , many RH cats find the descent daunting and dither while they psyche themselves up - at this point you may opt to lift your cat down .
A ramp with a shallow angle and covered with securely fixed carpet or sacking , or with ledges crosswise every few inches , so he does n't slither on smooth wood , may help him get up and down to a favourite chair .
Stairs are especially hazardous to a cat with severe RH .
Thought they can get up the stairs , getting down stairs is dangerous because they are likely to overbalance and tumble down the stairs , or even off the edge .
The fall can be lethal so try to restrict the cat to one level or use a solid ( not mesh or the cat will climb it ) child gate on the stairs to stop the cat from going onto them .
If he lives upstairs , the child gate must be at the top of the stairs .
If he lives downstairs it must be at the foot of the stairs and the banisters must have no gaps in which would otherwise allow him to bypass the child gate .
Some RH cats have learnt to safely descend stairs backwards to compensate , but unless you are certain that your RH cat has mastered this trick , access to the stairs should be restricted .
Mary Jackson 's RH cat " Bunny " using a leaning box ( known as a " Bunny box " ! ) which Mary has built specially .
This allows Bunny to rest in a comfortable position with her head at a normal height and her spine in a normal posture .
It also reduces the load on her forelimbs .
Jacob is an RH cat owned by Jamie Fay .
The debris on Jacob 's fur is catnip which he enjoys rolling in !
He has a severe form of Radial Hypoplasia as his forelegs are missing entirely , and his little stumps are very short and practically useless ( although he tries to bury his faeces ) .
Jacob has learned how to navigate stairs by turning around and descending them backwards .
Jamie 's step - children found Jacob outside , on his own , near Marshall , Texas .
He was homeless and very skinny .
The area is not far from where the infamous Twisty Cats have been deliberately bred so it 's possible that Jacob and the Twisty Cats are descended from the same gene pool of barn cats in the region .
A cute peculiarity which I noticed with an RH cat at a cat shelter is the tendency to rest the chest and forelegs on a raised ledge , sometimes with the forelegs dangling right over the ledge .
This is more comfortable for them as it more closely approximates a normal feline resting position .
Some RH cats , however , take it to extremes and sit almost upright with forelegs dangling over the back of a chair .
The fact that they sit like a squirrel or rabbit often leads to misidentification as a " cabbit " ( a genetically impossible cat - rabbit hybrid ) or squitten ( squirrel - cat hybrid - literally squirrel - kitten ) .
The lack or partial lack of the main leg bone means that RH cats cannot crouch in a typical eating position , their either need the food raised to their normal head height or they will eat lying down .
If your RH cat regularly rests its head and forelegs on a ledge , trying placing the food on the ledge so it can reach it more conveniently .
As with most of the disabilities mentioned , if your garden is securely fenced in ( RH cats can climb wire mesh ) , or you have an outdoor pen or your cat is leash - trained , limited supervised access to outside is possible .
Unfettered access to outdoors is especially dangerous to a cat with severe foreleg deformities .

If you are able to use a saw ( preferable a jigsaw or scrollsaw ) and drill , it is not hard to make an adjustable ramp or a simple set of steps .
These are general guidelines only .
Tanya Vranic has adapted the steps design to include a carpeted hidey - hole for her cat .
The ramp is based on a deckchair design with notches for the prop to allow the height of the ramp to be altered .
It is best to assemble the ramp and fit the prop before carving any notches , that way you can mark out where to carve notches to give a suitable range of heights ,
The notches must be deep enough that the prop does n't slide out when the cat 's weight is on the ramp .
To provide grip on the sloping surface , fit some carpet or nail a series of small battens across the ramp ( i.e. ladder - style ) .
To make the steps , measure the height of the surface the cat wishes to reach .
Then work out how many steps and how deep or shallow the steps need to be for your cat .
This will also affect the overall size of the item .
In general three steps is adequate .
To prevent the two sides splaying under the cat 's weight , brace the steps at their base as shown in the diagram .
Another simple steps design is shown below .
The top step can either be set at the height of the surface the cat needs to reach or a step 's depth below it .
This section provides answers to some of the more commonly asked questions .
Do Other Faculties compensate for the missing one ?
After losing a sense or a limb , cats must rely on their remaining faculties .
Many owners notice that the remaining senses may become more acute or remaining limbs may become stronger .
For example , a blind cat may have extremely acute hearing while a hind limb amputee may have front body strength comparable to a weightlifter .
The apparent sharpening of remaining senses is part of how the brain works .
The brain is n't static , it is capable of rewiring .
In animals and humans that are born blind , the unused areas of the brain normally associated with sight become commandeered by intensively used adjacent areas such as hearing and touch .
In cats which lose their sight during life , they rely more on other sense and those neuronal pathways become stronger and that area of the brain a little larger .
It 's a case of " use it or lose it " .
In a sense , while the sight area atrophies through disuse , other areas can grow into the freed up space .
Although a blind cat may be concentrating more on listening , the adaptation is n't a conscious effort , but a neurological effect .
This is greatly simplified ; you can learn about brain wiring in Matt Ridley 's book " Nature via Nurture " .
Physical attributes are much the same .
A cat who lacks one leg spreads his weight across his remaining limbs .
Like anyone who weight trains in a gym , those muscles are used more and get stronger .
In cats and dogs , the front limbs carry most of the weight , especially when moving .
In a hind limb amputee , there is additional weight on the fore limbs and these develop even more than usual .
Owners of dogs who have recently lost a front limb are advised to exercise the dog gently to give the remaining foreleg time to build up its strength and not to put too much strain on it too early .
Anyone who works out in a gym to develop specific muscles can see the same effects - the muscle responds to the strain by growing and becoming stronger .
In addition to adaptive changes in the brain and muscles , cats use their intelligence to cope with disability .
A cat with mobility problems can often be watched figuring out the best route onto or off of a shelf - it might figure out a route where it can get onto the shelf in a series of steps with little jumps , rather than a single leap .
A blind cat might gauge the height of a chair seat by reaching up on hind legs to pat its forepaws on the seat before making the jump .
A cat with one eye swivels its head to get several angles of view to get some depth perception before making a jump .
Where a sense is lost gradually , the brain can compensate over a long period of time .
For example , we may not realise our cat is going deaf until all hearing is lost .
Where a sense or limb is lost suddenly ( illness or accident ) the speed at which a cat adapts seems to be related to its age .
It just takes older cats a little longer and the adaptation may be a little less perfect .
Do disabled pets become more affectionate than able - bodied ones ?
Is this gratitude towards their humans ?
" Gratitude " is anthropomorphism i.e reading human emotions into animals .
Animals do have emotions ( Do Cats Have Emotions ? ) , but not the complex abstract emotions of humans because they perceive the world in a different way to us .
A better explanation of the " gratitude effect " in disabled cats is that the cat allows itself to become more dependent on its human family .
Cats frequently relate to humans as though we are parents ( providing food and comfort ) and they are juveniles .
A disabled cat is even more likely to view the owner as provider and may exaggerate its own role as kitten .
The owner makes additional efforts to accommodate a feline disability and the cat modifies its own behaviour to suit this relationship - we may not even realise this is happening , but it is a continual process .
Remember that cats interpret owner / cat relationships in feline terms , not in human terms .
Are cats with genetic disorders also genetically programmed to adapt in certain ways ?
For example are Twisty Cats genetically programmed to have stronger hind legs ?
A Twisty Cat will have relied on its hind legs since kittenhood hence these will have grown stronger .
The same extra-strong hind legs would be seen if the kitten 's forelegs were deformed through birth accident rather than genetic mutation .
In genetic mutations , the gene (s ) affected have all sorts of visible and invisible effects ( there is not a one - gene - one - trait correlation ) and it is possible , though unlikely , that some of the gene 's effects will compensate for its other effects .
However , it is more often the case that all of the genetic effects will be detrimental - throwing one part of a delicately balanced machine out of balance has a detrimental knock - on effect on other parts of that machine .
Genes give cats the potential to develop in a certain way , the environment hones how the cat actually develops .
A caring owner can think of other ways in which to help a disabled feline companion , but beware of being overprotective .
A disabled cat still requires some semblance of independence to allow it to fulfil that inner ' catness ' that we love in our feline friends .
Most seem unaware of their disabilities and they do not expect life to make allowances , but a helping hand and some adjustments to their lifestyle and perhaps your own lifestyle will ensure a disabled cat has a healthy , happy and safe life .

But shortly after the drop in diamond sales after the First World War , the beginning of the end started .
During the 1950's the town was deserted and the dunes began to reclaim what was always theirs .
Soon the metal screens collapsed and the pretty gardens and tidy streets were buried under the sand .
Doors and windows creaked on their hinges , cracked window panes stared sightlessly across the desert .
A new ghost town had been born .
A couple of old buildings are still standing and some interiors like the theatre is still in very good condition , but the rest are crumbling ruins demolished from grandeur to ghost houses .

Via : 2 Kolmanskop is a ghost town in southern Namibia , a few kilometres inland from the port of Lüderitz .
In 1908 , Luederitz was plunged into diamond fever and people rushed into the Namib desert hoping to make an easy fortune .
Within two years , a town , complete with a casino , school , hospital and exclusive residential buildings , was established in the barren sandy desert .
But shortly after the drop in diamond sales after the First World War , the beginning of the end started .
During the 1950's the town was deserted and the dunes began to reclaim what was always theirs .
Soon the metal screens collapsed and the pretty gardens and tidy streets were buried under the sand .
Doors and windows creaked on their hinges , cracked window panes stared sightlessly across the desert .

Before I proceed , let 's start with a little background into Sibel 's case .
When Sibel worked as a translator for the FBI , one of the main cases she was working on was a counter - intelligence operation against Turkey 's equivalent of AIPAC , the American Turkish Council ( ATC ) .
On the Turkish side , the ATC is ( largely ) represented by Turkey 's " Deep State – the politicians , military officers and intelligence officials who worked with drug bosses to move drugs from Afghanistan ... "
( On the American side , the ATC is represented by the ' Defense ' contractors , and Turkey 's American lobbyists - people like Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , former House Speaker Bob Livingston , former Defense Secretary William Cohen , former Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and others . )
Now , we 've all heard the statistics that Afghanistan is the source of 90 % of the world 's opium etc - but what many people do n't know is that most of that opium is imported into Turkey where it is transformed , on an industrial scale , into heroin .
It is warehoused on an industrial scale , repackaged and marketed on an industrial scale , and re-exported on an industrial scale .
As Sibel says :
" This multi billion - dollar industry requires highly sophisticated networks and people .
So , who are the real lords of Afghanistan ’s poppy fields ?
[ snip ]
These operations are run by mafia groups closely controlled by the MIT ( Turkish Intelligence Agency ) and the military .
According to statistics compiled in 1998 , Turkey ’s heroin trafficking brought in $ 25 billion in 1995 and $ 37.5 billion in 1996 .
That amount makes up nearly a quarter of Turkey ’s GDP .
Only criminal networks working in close cooperation with the police and the army could possibly organize trafficking on such a scale .
The Turkish government , MIT and the Turkish military , not only sanctions , but also actively participates in and oversees the narcotics activities and networks .
In other words , the folks who supply much of the world 's heroin break bread ( and share lots of dough ) with their American counterparts at places like the American Turkish Council .
Sibel says that there are at least four people in Congress that she knows of who are being bribed by the Turkish gang , and according to Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes , they also have " spies ... inside the US State Department and at the Pentagon . "
In Craig Murray 's article , he notes all of the impressive statistics regarding Afghanistan 's opium production - 2006 beat the previous record by 60 % , and this year promises to be stronger still - and then he makes two important points .
Firstly , he says that all of the ' value - add ' activity that was previously performed in Turkey ( turning poppies into heroin ) is now conducted within Afghanistan .
We do n't know whether this is a massive shift in the underlying structure of the industry , or whether the incumbent gangs that Sibel refers to have simply decided to ' off - shore ' their production from Turkey to Afghanistan .
I suspect that it is the latter , simply because we have n't seen the type of blood - bath that we would expect to see if there was a serious turf - war taking place .
From Murray 's piece :
" According to the United Nations , 2006 was the biggest opium harvest in history , smashing the previous record by 60 per cent .
This year will be even bigger .
Our economic achievement in Afghanistan goes well beyond the simple production of raw opium .
In fact Afghanistan no longer exports much raw opium at all .
It has succeeded in what our international aid efforts urge every developing country to do .
Afghanistan has gone into manufacturing and ' value - added ' operations .
It now exports not opium , but heroin .
Opium is converted into heroin on an industrial scale , not in kitchens but in factories .
Millions of gallons of the chemicals needed for this process are shipped into Afghanistan by tanker .
The tankers and bulk opium lorries on the way to the factories share the roads , improved by American aid , with Nato troops .
( FTR , I have seen no evidence for Murray 's claim that Afghanistan is now primarily exporting heroin rather than opium )
The second point that Murray makes is that this activity takes place with the the active participation of the authorities , just as Sibel said was the case in Turkey .
Murray :
How can this have happened , and on this scale ?
The answer is simple .
The four largest players in the heroin business are all senior members of the Afghan government – the government that our soldiers are fighting and dying to protect .
When we attacked Afghanistan , America bombed from the air while the CIA paid , armed and equipped the dispirited warlord drug barons – especially those grouped in the Northern Alliance – to do the ground occupation .
We bombed the Taliban and their allies into submission , while the warlords moved in to claim the spoils .
Then we made them ministers .
President Karzai is a good man .
He has never had an opponent killed , which may not sound like much but is highly unusual in this region and possibly unique in an Afghan leader .
But nobody really believes he is running the country .
He asked America to stop its recent bombing campaign in the south because it was leading to an increase in support for the Taliban .
The United States simply ignored him .
Above all , he has no control at all over the warlords among his ministers and governors , each of whom runs his own kingdom and whose primary concern is self - enrichment through heroin .
More Murray :
He became concerned at the vast amounts of heroin coming from Afghanistan , in particular from the fiefdom of the ( now ) Head of the Afghan armed forces , General Abdul Rashid Dostum , in north and east Afghanistan .
Dostum is an Uzbek , and the heroin passes over the Friendship Bridge from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan , where it is taken over by President Islam Karimov 's people ...
The heroin Jeeps run from General Dostum to President Karimov .
The UK , United States and Germany have all invested large sums in donating the most sophisticated detection and screening equipment to the Uzbek customs centre at Termez to stop the heroin coming through .
But the convoys of Jeeps running between Dostum and Karimov are simply waved around the side of the facility .
More Murray :
" In Afghanistan , General Dostum ( Head of the Afghan armed forces ) is vital to Karzai 's coalition , and to the West 's pretence of a stable , democratic government .
Opium is produced all over Afghanistan , but especially in the north and north - east – Dostum 's territory .
Again , our Government 's spin doctors have tried hard to obscure this fact and make out that the bulk of the heroin is produced in the tiny areas of the south under Taliban control .
But these are the most desolate , infertile rocky areas .
It is a physical impossibility to produce the bulk of the vast opium harvest there .
That General Dostum is head of the Afghan armed forces and Deputy Minister of Defence is in itself a symbol of the bankruptcy of our policy . "
None of this information was included in the NYT's 7 page article on how we ' lost ' Afghanistan .
In fact , in a fantastic recent interview , Sibel wonders aloud whether the media silence is intentional :
" Who prevents the media , or is it happening , from publishing the real facts ?
The Turks , their involvement , UAE and their position in laundering this money , Pakistan and narcotics .
It 's saying " Oops !
They are our ' allies ' and we do n't want to touch them .
We do n't want to turn them off . "
In fact , we have a lot of business , " sensitive diplomatic relations " , as John Ashcroft put it . "
As if to prove Sibel 's point , just last week , ABC 's blog The Blotter reported :
Heroin Found in Car Allegedly Owned by Top Afghan Border Official A manhunt is on in Afghanistan for the man President Hamid Karzai wanted to name head of his country 's border police , ABC News has learned , following the discovery that the official owned a car filled with heroin intercepted by members of the Kabul City Criminal Investigations Division .
U.S. authorities confirmed the seizure of 130 kilograms of heroin in June in a car that allegedly belonged to Haji Zahir Qadir , the former chief of the border police for northern Takhar province .
Haji Zahir was not in the car when it was intercepted .
His cousin and " right hand , " Bilal , was present and arrested .
Afghan officials say Karzai wanted to name Haji Zahir to head the border police , but a U.S. military intelligence assessment obtained by ABC News in 2006 named Zahir as a drug smuggler .
News of the seizure and the manhunt came at a most embarrassing time for Karzai , who was at Camp David with President George Bush to meet on regional issues , including the upsurge in violence in Afghanistan and cross - border issues with Pakistan .
The information fed to The Blotter was apparently designed to cause some embarrassment ( coming 6 weeks after the event ) , but it was n't very embrassing at all .
As best as I could tell , ABC 's blog entry was the only mention of this story at all , anywhere ( 1,2,3 ) .
For more on my coverage of the heroin angle of Sibel 's case , see Sibel Edmonds : America 's Watergate , Sibel Edmonds & the Neocons ' Turkish Gravy - Train , and Daniel Ellsberg : Hastert got suitcases of Al Qaeda heroin cash , should be in jail .
I 'll give Craig Murray the final word :
" Remember this article next time you hear a politician calling for more troops to go into Afghanistan .
And when you hear of another brave British life wasted there , remember you can add to the casualty figures all the young lives ruined , made miserable or ended by heroin in the UK .
They , too , are casualties of our Afghan policy . "

Not many people would leave a role as Natalie Portman 's husband in a film , but Williamsburg resident Abe Karpen has to do just that .
Karpen , who is a Hasidic Jew , told the Daily News , " It 's not acceptable in my community .
It 's a lot of pressure I am getting .
They [ the rabbis ] did n't like the idea of a Hasidic guy playing in Hollywood . "
Portman and Karpen had been filming a short called " Kosher Vegetarian " for New York , I Love You , which will include 12 short films about love in the Big Apple .
Karpen was asked to hold Portman 's hand but refused , " It 's against our religion .
You can't even hold your wife 's hand on the street . "
A rabbi also told him his kids would be kicked out of their schools if he continued to film his role , so Karpen , a kitchen cabinet salesman , is kissing his silver screen dreams good - bye .
He and his family left the city for the weekend ( a friend said , " The community wants to kill him " ) .
One Hasidic acitvist told the News , " We do n't watch television .
We do n't go to the movies , so to be in a movie is the worst thing .
It 's a shame for any Hasid . "
This is probably why the Law & Order : SVU episode involving the Hasidic community had actors wearing , as Television Without Pity put it , " really junky - looking fake beards ... it looks like they raided a ZZ Top cover band 's tour bus . "
Paul Krugman From Hype to Fear in American Politics
The opponents of change , those who want to keep the Bush legacy intact , are very good at the fear thing .
Von Paul Krugman
So I called him and invited him to have a drink with me that night .
We had our drink and walked back to our dorm and sat down in the courtyard , just talking .
It was June , two days before commencement .
He was graduating , and I was graduating , too , sort of , but the envelope I was getting would n’t have a diploma in it .
I had another semester of course work to complete .
Only the seniors were left at school , and most of them were in the courtyard .
I felt exposed .
Finally , getting up from the bench we ’d been sitting on , my friend said , “ Your place ? ”
And we went to my dorm room , which was a single suite I had all to myself , with my own bathroom , because my neurologist had written a note to the university .
We sat on my futon , drinking out of a plastic bottle of vodka .
Eventually he said , “ Do you have any other rooms in this place ? ” and walked me to the bedroom , and lay me on my bed , and had intercourse with me .
Then he asked me about the scabs on my chest from where the line had just been pulled out and listened to the things I told him , and held me very tightly .
Two mornings later , when we were in the courtyard again , seated in rows for graduation , he was wearing a buttoned shirt and sweating , because his neck was covered with bite marks .
Years passed .
He and I wrote almost every day .
I lived in one city and he lived in another .
He told me some of his secrets , and I told him some of mine .
Our letters were intimate , but I did n’t get around to explaining to him that I recovered from my disease only because he had selflessly had intercourse with an ugly version of a girl he once had a crush on .
A little less than seven years after I was cured of my disease through the mystical power of intercourse , my friend died of a sudden illness .
I never told him about my magical cure , his sweet medicine .
And I wish I could have saved his life .
I hope he knew somehow that he had saved mine .
All eight men deny conspiring to murder others
Eight men planned to detonate bombs aboard flights from London across the Atlantic to create deaths on an almost unprecedented scale , a court has heard .
Homemade devices were to be smuggled on to passenger aircraft and detonated mid-flight , Woolwich Crown Court heard .
After their arrests in August 2006 , passengers were banned from carrying most liquids on board aircraft .
The eight men all deny conspiring to murder others and endangering aircraft bound for the US and Canada in 2006 .
Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said the men planned to inflict heavy casualties , " all in the name of Islam " .
He told the court : " These men were , we say , indifferent to the carnage that was likely to ensue .
" Some of the men you see in the dock are those who were prepared to sacrifice their own lives . "
Mr Wright said two of the men were watched by police as they met in Walthamstow on 9 August , 2006 .
" The disaster they contemplated was not long off , " he said .
EIGHT ACCUSED MEN TOP ROW OF PICTURE ( L-R ) : Abdul Ahmed Ali , 27 Assad Sarwar , 24 Tanvir Hussain , 27 Mohammed Gulzar , 26 BOTTOM ROW ( L-R ) : Ibrahim Savant , 27 Arafat Waheed Khan , 26 Waheed Zaman , 23 Umar Islam , 29
The ' airliners plot ' allegations " They were prepared to board an aircraft with the necessary ingredients and equipment to construct and detonate a device that would bring about not only the loss of their own lives but also all of those who happened by chance to be taking the same journey . "
Mr Wright said Mr Ali , Mr Sarwar and Mr Gulzar were the main men behind the plot .
" Unfortunately for these men , but to the considerable good fortune of those that were their intended targets of those devices , their activities had come to the attention of the police , " he said He said from what police had observed " it was realised that these men , together with others , were engaged in some sort of terrorist plot " .
A computer memory stick recovered by police contained details of flight timetables , baggage information , security advice and other information about Heathrow airport , he said .
The jury heard the information focused on only one - way flights leaving Heathrow between August 2006 and August 2007 .
The planes were destined to fly from London to cities across North America , including Montreal , Toronto , San Francisco , Chicago , New York and Washington , the court heard .
The seven daily flights highlighted from Heathrow 's Terminal 3 were : 1415 United Airlines Flight 931 to San Francisco
1500 Air Canada Flight 849 to Toronto
1515 Air Canada Flight 865 to Montreal
1540 United Airlines Flight 959 to Chicago
1620 United Airlines Flight 925 to Washington
1635 American Airlines Flight 131 to New York
1650 American Airlines Flight 91 to Chicago Mr Wright said there was evidence that the men planned to bring down more planes than just those seven .
The jury heard the main ingredient of the explosives would have been hydrogen peroxide mixed with other organic materials .
The liquid explosive would have been injected in to 500 ml plastic bottles of soft drinks Oasis and Lucozade , Mr Wight said .
A sugary drink known as Tang would be mixed with the solution to add power to the explosion , he continued .
Mr Wright told the court the devices would be detonated using a substance called HMTD ( hexamethylene triperoxide diamine ) concealed in AA 1.5 - volt batteries .
He said of hydrogen peroxide : " It is capable of being detonated to deadly effect , as previous terrorist incidents have demonstrated . "
It is alleged the explosives would have been injected in to drinks bottles
The jury was shown pages from Mr Ali 's handwritten diary which make apparent references to how the bomb materials would have been got on to the aircraft .
Mr Wright said the bombers would have used a syringe in the base of the bottles to insert the explosive material .
The detonator would have been ignited using a metal wire , a small bulb or the flash from a disposable camera .
The defendants are Abdul Ahmed Ali , aka Ahmed Ali Khan , 27 , of Walthamstow , Assad Sarwar , 24 , of High Wycombe , Tanvir Hussain , 27 , of no fixed address , and Mohammed Gulzar , 26 , of Barking .
Also charged , are Ibrahim Savant , 27 , of Walthamstow , Arafat Waheed Khan , 26 , of Walthamstow , Waheed Zaman , 23 , of Walthamstow and Umar Islam , aka Brian Young , 29 , of High Wycombe .
The trial , which is expected to last eight months , was adjourned until Friday .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) had some harsh words for President Bush ’s announcement that there will be a halt to troop withdrawals from Iraq in July .
Bush also announced that he is cutting the length of troop tours from 15 months down to a year .
However , this change does n’t impact troops already on the front lines .
“ Today ’s announcement by the President can only be described as one step forward , two steps back .
After almost one year , the Administration is finally heeding the call of Congressional Democrats and military leaders to decrease troop deployments to 12 months .
Democrats have been fighting hard for more rational troop deployments and rest time back at home , but have found our efforts blocked twice by President Bush and Senate Republicans , ” Reid said .
Reid saved his most biting comment for last , “ The President still does n’t understand that America ’s limited resources cannot support his limitless war .
Let me be clear : this is not a so - called troop pause .
With today ’s announcement , the President has signaled to the American people that he has no intention of bringing home any more troops .
Instead he is leaving all the tough decisions to the next Administration .
President Bush has an exit strategy for only one man – himself on January 20 , 2009 . ”
I think that everyone has long grown tired of President Bush hiding behind Petraeus and Crocker to justify his decisions about Iraq .
No matter how much how much he wants to spin it , the general and the ambassador answer to him , not the other way around .
The fact that the next president was going to inherit little George ’s mess , has been known since 2005 .
All the president did today was confirm what we already knew was going to happen .
His speech reaffirms that our choice next November is critical .
Americans will have to choose whether or not we want to stay in Iraq .
Advertisements
If this , along with the economy , are the central issues of the 2008 campaign , the Democratic candidate , no matter who that is , will be left with some tough decisions the day after the party ends on January 20 , 2009 .
Both Clinton and Obama agree with the vast majority of Americans that it is time to get out of Iraq .
The issue for either of them will be how to structure America ’s departure .
The next president will inherit the responsibility for 142,000 troops .
Our vote next November will determine whether all of those troops come home , or some of them continue to be wounded or die .

The Situation Room takes a look at the upcoming documentary Standard Operating Procedure by Errol Morris ( The Fog of War , The Thin Blue Line ) which examines the incidents of abuse and torture at the Abu Ghraib prison .

More videos from the film via The New Yorker , in which Sy Hersh first broke the story of the US 's gulag in Iraq .
I look forward to seeing how complete and honest an account of what went on this film is .
It looks promising .
I 'm sure Janis Karpinski will do her part to make sure they set the record straight .
Also , I 'm pretty sure I know where the film 's title comes from :
Army documents show .
After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in April 2003 , U.S. soldiers and intelligence personnel began to use these techniques in Iraq , where they were informally " accepted as SOP [ standard operating procedure ] by newly arrived interrogators , " according to an August 2004 report on Abu Ghraib abuses by Maj.
Gen. George R. Fay .
By September 2003 , Gen. Geoffrey Miller had arrived at Abu Ghraib , allegedly with a mandate to " Gitmo- ize " interrogation procedures at the prison .
In light of the recent revelations that torture techniques were discussed and approved in meetings by the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , a group that included Vice President Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell , Donald Rumsfeld , George Tenet , John Ashcroft , and that President Bush admits he was fully aware of them , I think the Pentagon spokesman 's statement at the end of the CNN report that there was never " any government policy that directed , encouraged , or condoned abuse " is not only demonstrably false , it shows what a sham the military 's investigation into the matter was .
Janis Karpinski was right all along .
Georgia is seeking Western support in a worsening dispute with Russia over the " creeping annexation " of breakaway territories .
The move follows the shooting down of a Georgian spy plane over the separatistregion of Abkhazia .
" It 's clear that now is the moment of truth for the EU and Nato , to prove that they are willing and capable of protecting their values and principles , " said Giorgi Baramidze , the Deputy Prime Minister of the Western - leaning former Soviet republic .
Mr Baramidze , who spoke to The Independent in London after holding talks in Brussels , is one of several Georgian officials dispatched to Western capitals as the UN Security Council met to discuss the dispute .

Georgia called for the Security Council meeting after accusing Russia of shooting down a pilotless drone flying over Abkhazia earlier this week , in what the Georgian President , Mikheil Saakashvili , described as " unprovoked aggression " .
Although a video released by Georgia shows a jet flying towards the Georgian drone and firing a missile , Moscow denies that the plane was a Russian MiG - 29 and insists that the drone was shot down by Abkhazian air defence forces .
The incident forms part of a deepening crisis triggered by a Russian decision on 16 April to establish legal ties with two rebel provinces in Georgia , Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Mr Baramidze charged that the decree was signed by President Vladimir Putin in direct response to the international recognition of Kosovo independence and to the decision by a Nato summit to commit to discussing eventual Georgian membership of Nato .
" This is a very dangerous move and extremely provocative , " he said .
" This means the legalisation of the de facto annexation " of the two regions , he added .
Russia rejected a joint call from Britain , the US , France and Germany for the decision to be revoked during the closed - door Security Council discussions .
Russia 's UN ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , said : " This is , of course , a tall order , and I think that they themselves understand that this is something that is not going to happen .
In fact , this is not a kind of thing which we would expect from our international partners .
Clearly , this is not diplomatic recognition or international recognition of Abkhazia or South Ossetia . "
Mr Putin 's moves to strengthen links with " the de facto authorities " in the two regions were " in order to improve the living standard of the population of those two regions , " said Mr Churkin .
Mr Saakashvili , who has made recovering Georgian sovereignty over all its territory a priority of his administration since coming to office in 2003 , called for an international force to replace Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia .
Russian forces have been deployed since 1994 under a deal that ended a two - year separatist war in which hundreds of thousands of Georgians became refugees .
But Robert Simmons , Nato 's special envoy for the south Caucasus and central Asia , told a news conference in Tbilisi : " I cannot say that Nato is looking for a direct role in peacekeeping or in dealing with conflicts in this region . "
Mr Baramidze said Georgia also soughtWestern support for a peace plan for Abkhazia which offers autonomy for the territory in a new federal state , guarantees for the Abkhaz language and culture and a free economic zone .
Asked whether Georgia could expect the West to sacrifice relations with Russia in favour of Tbilisi , he said : " This is the test for Western democracy .
Georgia is unlucky to be in the front line . "
The annual rate of house price inflation has now turned negative for the first time since the property market began its decline , figures to be released today will show .
Hometrack , the property analyst , will say house prices have fallen by 0.6 per cent during April , leaving the market 0.9 per cent lower than a year ago .
April was the seventh consecutive month in which house prices fell , according to Hometrack , and its figures also suggest a marked deterioration of other leading housing market indicators .
The average time taken to sell a home has risen from 8.5 weeks in March to 9.1 weeks this month , and the typical property now sells for just 93 per cent of its asking price , down from 93.5 per cent last month .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
While the survey suggests the property market continues to be patchy , with some variation in price falls around the country , Hometrack said this month had been the first occasion on which it had recorded declines in the majority of postcode districts .
It warned that the slowdown was gathering pace , with falls recorded in 51.4 per cent of postcodes during April , markedly up on March 's figure of 28.8 per cent .
While Hometrack is the first analyst to portray annual falls in house prices , its figures are broadly in line with the most recent surveys from Nationwide Building Society and Halifax Bank , the two most widely - followed property benchmarks .
Figures from both suggested the annual rate of inflation was now close to zero and their next monthly updates , due within a week , could show negative growth .
Richard Donnell , Hometrack 's director of research , said there was little prospect of an immediate recovery , despite a series of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England .
Mr Donnell said that while a crisis in the mortgage market , with most lenders pulling their most competitive products from sale in recent months , was causing some problems , declining consumer confidence in the face of expectations of an economic slowdown was a more serious factor .
" While the availability of finance is impacting on demand in certain segments , the reality is that weak confidence is effectively resulting in a buyers ' strike , with households sitting on the sidelines to see how events unfold , " he said .
" Transaction volumes will be the big casualty and there now seems the prospect of a record low in residential sales volumes in 2008 . "
Hometrack 's warning of negative annual house price growth is particularly problematic for homeowners struggling with the rising cost of mortgages , particularly the 1.4 million borrowers due to come off cut - price two - and three - year fixed rates during the course of 2008 .
The Centre for Economic and Business Research ( CEBR ) will say today that it expects more than 33,000 people to lose their homes this year after falling behind on mortgage repayments .
The CEBR , which is predicting a 10 per cent fall in average house prices during 2008 and 2009 combined , is now forecasting there will be 33,400 repossessions this year , a 23 per cent increase on last year 's figure of 27,100 .
" 'As the credit crunch bites people will have to spend a greater proportion of their incomes on mortgages than they have done in the recent past , " said Nur Ata , a senior economist at CEBR . "

A sharp reversal of the tightening of the race seen late last week
Gallup Daily : Obama Regains Lead Over Clinton , 49 % to 42 % A sharp reversal of the tightening of the race seen late last week
PRINCETON , NJ -- Support for Barack Obama 's nomination bid has rebounded among national Democratic voters , who now favor him over Hillary Clinton by a seven percentage point margin , 49 % to 42 % .
This is first time Obama has had a statistically significant advantage over Clinton since the race collapsed into a dead heat late last week .
Prior to that , Obama was enjoying his longest front - runner streak since the start of Gallup Poll Daily tracking in January .
Today 's results , from Gallup Poll Daily tracking conducted April 18 - 20 , show Obama doing quite well in the last two days of polling ( on Saturday and Sunday ) , suggesting the latest difficulties troubling his campaign -- largely stemming from the April 16 Democratic debate in Philadelphia and the ensuing media coverage -- are subsiding .
Gallup Poll Daily trends suggest Clinton may have received a short - term boost in her standing after the Philadelphia debate , but that she has been unable to sustain those gains .
Now the focus shifts to Tuesday 's Pennsylvania primary that Clinton is describing as an important test of the candidates ' momentum and ability to win the fall election .
Any impact of the Pennsylvania election results on the sentiments of Democrats across the country will begin to be evident in Gallup Poll Daily tracking reports later this week .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking from April 16 - 20 shows no change from Sunday 's report in the national voter preferences for Obama vs. John McCain in a hypothetical matchup for the fall election .
The two remain tied at 45 % .
McCain , who has run nip and tuck with both Democrats since Gallup began tracking the general election in March , is now one point ahead of Clinton , 46 % to 45 % .
Although the race is essentially deadlocked , this is the first time in two weeks that McCain has edged out Clinton in national voter preferences .
-- Lydia Saad
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from April 18 - 20 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,238 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from April 16 - 20 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,342 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

On the eve of tomorrow 's hotly contested and relatively close Democratic presidential primary in Pennsylvania , a number of voting activists are sounding the alarm one last time about the state 's election systems .
Over 85 percent of PA voters will vote on paperless touchscreen machines that are hackable , failure - prone , and fundamentally unauditable .
The ever - vigilant Bradblog has a roundup of which models will be used in tomorrow 's contest , and it's not pretty :
Two PA counties , one of which , Montgomery , is the state 's most populous , will use the same Sequoia AVC Edge touchscreens that are now the subject of an investigation in New Jersey because of their spectacular failure in that state 's recent primaries .
Sixteen counties will use the Diebold Accuvote TS touchscreen model .
Regular
Ars readers will recall that my 2006 article , " How to steal an election by hacking the vote , " described in some detail how to steal an election using this machine .
( I hope that nobody from PA decides that it would be a good idea to print copies of the free PDF of this how - to article to bring to the polls with them as a form of protest , because you would probably get in trouble .
So do n't do that . )
51 counties will vote on the infamous iVotronic touchscreen from ES&S .
This is the same model that brought us the Florida 13 controversy that ultimately resulted in Florida scrapping touchscreens altogether .
So as is typical this cycle , the people of PA will vote tomorrow in an election that is impossible to audit , one in which the government cannot meet its burden of proof of election integrity .
A preview of November
As the state primaries wind down , the odds that the e-voting situation will be at all improved by November just got significantly slimmer , thanks to the success of the Bush administration and House Republicans in blocking e-voting reform .
This past January , Rep. Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) introduced the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act ( H.R. 5036 ) , which proposed a last minute , federally - funded push to help states and counties phase out paperless touchscreen e-voting machines before the November presidential contest .
In addition to setting aside $ 600 million to fund the implementation of a paper trail in the states and counties that rely solely on paperless touchscreens , the bill has a number of great audit - related requirements that would go a long way toward ensuring the integrity of our elections .
Holt 's bill passed the House of Representatives Committee on House Administration with unanimous , bipartisan support , only to be blocked by House Republicans on a near - party - line vote when it reached the floor .
The White House also spoke out against the bill , opposing it on fiscal grounds .
Rep .
Holt then blasted House Republicans in his own statement .
" I 'd like to ask the opponents how much spending is too much to have verifiable elections in the United States .
I note that many people who opposed this legislation supported spending almost $ 330 million in recent years to provide election assistance in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
I would have hoped those who supported efforts to export democracy abroad would be equally committed to strengthening democracy here at home , " Holt said .
Impressions after listening to the recorded samples for Test # 5 Male Voice , Exterior , on - axis , narrative setup
Audio - Technica AT875R
In this test , I was out in nature , so to speak , ( well , actually my backyard ) .
I was impressed at how the AT875R was able to reject most of the ambient street noise although you do hear the crickets more on this mic than on some of the others .
The sound quality was balanced and I thought it made the quality of my voice appealing .
This was not the best microphone for exteriors but I thought it would still be useful for exteriors if you were on a tight budget .
Audio - Technica AT4073a
Accurately judging the AT4073a outdoors was a tall order , mainly because of this microphone 's extraordinary sensitivity .
If I A/B between this microphone and the AT875 R , this microphone seems to be picking up more ambient noise .
But , in looking at the meters , I can also see that the signal that the AT4073a recorded at the same input levels was considerably hotter .
If I compensate and lower the levels on the AT4073a , then the ambient level becomes closer in level to most of the other mics .
This microphone would be excellent in picking up more distant subjects .
If you can only get your shotgun perhaps 4 - 6 feet from a subject instead of a foot or two away , this microphone would pick up the sound better than most of the other mics in the test .
Beyerdynamic MC - 836PV
The MC - 836 PV did a very nice job on the exterior test .
It had excellent rejection of off - axis noise ; I could barely make out the traffic din from a distant road .
I could still hear the crickets / cicadas , but they were more muted than with some of the other mics tested .
I felt as if the Beyerdynamic really came alive and sounded much more interesting and dynamic on an exterior than it did on interiors .
Neumann KMR81i
The Neumann KMR - 81i exhibited a remarkable isolation on my voice outside , it almost felt as if I was in a VO booth , the off - axis rejection was that good .
The KMR - 81i also warmed up my voice , adding a smooth bass / mid emphasis that was appealing to my ear .
In a lot of ways , this microphone , even though it is a shotgun , seems to feature a lot of the same qualities that Neumann large diaphragm studio condensers feature .
This microphone seemed to be ideal for exterior situations .
As you listen to the sample , keep in mind that the mic was located about a foot to a foot and half over my head !
Oktava MK - 012
I tested the Oktava with both the cardioid and hypercardioid capsules even though you would undoubtedly want to use the hyper for most exteriors .
I very much liked the quality of sound for exteriors with the hyper , it sounded much closer in quality to the cardioid but you will notice that the ambient noise level went way down when I switched to the hypercardioid capsule .
The overall sound quality on the exterior seemed a bit smoother to me than the interior clips .
Very impressive microphone .
Sanken CS -1
The Sanken CS - 1 had a very clear and detailed sound for the exterior but to my ear , it was picking up more off - axis sound in this situation than some of the other microphones .
The transitions between the frequencies were very good though and overall , this microphone sounded very appealing .
You would have to test this microphone to make sure that the ambient levels were acceptable for your needs .
I liked this microphone better for interiors .
Sanken CS - 3e
The Sanken CS - 3e sounded very good in the exterior test .
I noticed less ambient sound than the CS - 1 and a smoother , more bass / mid emphasis than on many of the other mics tested .
The Sanken did not have the degree of off - axis rejection that the Neumann seemed to have but in a way , it 's detail and high end were just a tiny bit more appealing to me .
The CS - 3e seemed to have more presence but it was not as " in - your - face " as some of the other mics .
Overall , it presented a very well balanced and sophisticated sound on the exterior test .
Schoeps CMC641
Wow !
This microphone surprised me .
I have always heard that few sound mixers use the CMC641 for exteriors .
Because the CMC641 is a supercardioid and not a shotgun , I was not expecting very good isolation from off - axis noise and I was expecting that overall this mic might not keep up with the shotguns on exteriors .
Listen to the clip , it sounds very impressive .
I felt that the mic had excellent off - axis rejection and the overall quality of the sound was superb .
Other than windy situations , I would have no problem in using this microphone for exteriors if this is the type of sound I could expect .
Schoeps CMIT5u
Much like the Neumann KMR81i , this microphone basically makes all of your off - axis issues almost disappear .
Very good isolation of the desired sound from background noise and I really enjoyed the warmth and intimate sound that the CMIT5u presents on an exterior .
To my ear , the Schoeps has a less colored sound than the Neumann , which presents with more bass coloration , but in a good way .
I did not have the time to record separate samples with all of the cuts and roll offs for this microphone but I am sure that they would be helpful to you in certain situations .
Schoeps has really done a nice job with the CMIT5u , it sounds great on exteriors .
Sennheiser MKH-50
The Sennheiser MKH - 50 simply has a punchy , bass and mid emphasized sound in comparison with the Schoeps CMC641 .
I judged the off - axis rejection to be about the same but the two mics sound pretty different on exteriors .
I would choose the Sennheiser MKH - 50 for exteriors if you record female talent or talent with a higher or thinner voice .
It can do wonders .
As for my voice , I do n't know , does it make me sound a little Barry White -ish ?
Sennheiser MKH - 60
The MKH - 60 was an outstanding performer on the exterior test .
I heard very little off - axis sound but I never got a sense being in a VO booth that I had with the Schoeps CMIT5u and the Neumann KMR - 81i .
I would say overall , the MKH - 60 shared a lot of similar qualities with the Sanken CS - 3e .
They both sound very natural on exteriors with the Sanken leaning slightly toward the mids and the Sennheiser leaning slightly toward the lows .
Interestingly , the MKH - 60 presents with a lot less of a bass feel than the MK - 50 on exteriors .
I really like the sound quality of this mic and I am told that the MKH - 60 makes an excellent mic for hand booming by less experienced boom operators .
It has some latitude and forgiveness in it 's pickup pattern which makes it a natural for a beginning boom operator .
Final Evaluation and Recommendations
Wrapping up the considerable amount of data I have presented in this article is a daunting task .
It seems that audio beginners simply want someone to tell them which microphone to buy , while more experienced and knowledgeable users want to read more sophisticated arguments for each microphone tested , using complex descriptions and metaphors for the sound quality of each microphone .
In the end , what I think of each microphone does n't matter in the least ; the paragraphs below are simply my opinion .
The real goal of this article was to provide you , the potential microphone buyer with objective writing and audio samples so that you can determine which microphone (s ) will suit your needs the best .
I am consistently amazed by the sheer diversity in how we all use our camcorders and microphones .
I have spoken with users from all over the world over the past decade , they are shooting in environments as varied as outer space , jungles , Antarctica , war zones , corporate boardrooms , weddings , live events , film sets , caves , underwater and many other strange , unusual and interesting places .
It seems that few of us have the same experiences as we film , videotape and record sound .
This reinforces my opinion that YOU need to critically evaluate your needs and eventual needs before selecting the microphones that will work best for your situation .
For Your Part
I am listening to all of the audio samples I recorded as I imagine which situations each of these microphones could best be used in .
I encourage you to do the same .
Keep in mind that the method for comparison between audio components , whether microphones , mixers or audio monitors usually comes from A/ B comparisons between your two or three most likely candidates .
I have learned that our ears and brain have an incredibly short memory .
Our ears and brain , because they are so adaptive to surroundings , also become easily confused .
The most common mistake potential audio buyers make is to listen to dozens of potential candidates in a row .
This will do nothing but confuse your ear and brain .
If you are serious about evaluating these microphones for purchase , I would encourage you NOT to sit down and listen to all of the sound samples for all of the microphones in this article in one sitting .
You will do nothing except fatigue your ear and confuse your mind about which microphones sound like what .
If you are just curious and doing preliminary research , listen away , it does n't matter , but if you are trying to narrow down which microphone to buy immediately , read on .
The best way to evaluate sound components begins on paper or on your computer screen .
Do your research .
Read manufacturer and sound magazine websites .
Talk to people in sound forums .
It is pointless to evaluate $ 2,000.00 microphones if you only have $ 500.00 to spend on one .
In the end , you should base your buying decision off of a body of research , not from any one recommendation , not even this article .
Most recommendations you will get about which microphones to buy are not objective .
Take it all in , process and distill your opinion down with what matters most to you .
Quality ?
Quality regardless of cost ?
Cost ?
Off - axis rejection ?
I would advise you to begin narrowing your selection by evaluating microphone candidates that are in your general price range by doing the research .
There are several microphones tested in this article that are considered " industry standards " .
This , to me has always meant very little to my evaluative process .
As in many other areas in life , buying into what the status quo uses is sometimes a good thing but often , you can discover a microphone that costs less and provides superior results for your particular needs .
This piece of gear may be the same microphone that most other people use ( cough , cough , Sennheiser MKH - 416 , cough ) or it may be a microphone that few people have ever considered , often because not every great microphone company is a multi-national conglomerate with a huge advertising budget .
The bottom line is to have an open mind and ear and truly evaluate what will sound best and work best for your situation .
Do You Have Feelings of Guilt ?
Once you have lined up potential candidates , the best of all worlds is to get your hands on a sample and use it .
Nothing beats an ears - on demonstration .
If you visit a quality location sound dealer , almost all will let you evaluate potential microphones that you may purchase from them .
Location sound is one of the few industries where there are still many small , quality companies nationwide that offer great advice and service .
In my opinion , it is bad form to go to an audio dealer , pick their brain , put your hands all over numerous microphones , then walk out and purchase your selection from that huge dealer in NYC over the Internet because they have the same microphone $ 50.00 cheaper .
People who do this ( you know who you are ) think that you are smart because you can get the microphone cheaper on - line but in reality , they are making a seriously short sighted decision when they do this .
The decision they make could eventually put all of our best small audio shops out of business .
I am all for capitalism and getting the best deal , just realize that the best deal is not always the lowest priced deal .
Taking care of you after the sale , offering ongoing advice and bailing you out on a Friday late afternoon for a weekend shoot are all things that my favorite two or three audio retailers have done for me over the years .
A good location sound dealer is easily worth paying a few bucks more to in exchange for better service .
My Final Overall Evaluations
Audio - Technica AT875R
This microphone was the little engine that could .
Frankly , I did not have very high expectations for this microphone .
It was a brand new , still unproven commodity .
It was really inexpensive .
In reading Audio - Technica 's literature , it was clear that the main design criterion was usage as an on -camera microphone .
The more I thought about though ; on - camera usage is n't really that different than using a mic on a boom pole overhead .
Sure , you can usually locate a boom mic closer to the source than on - camera , but good sound is good sound .
I knew that if Audio - Technica engineered the mic for on - camera usage , it would probably be fairly isolated from handling noise and would have pretty decent pickup from a distance .
I knew going in what the price was on this microphone but I made an effort to try to forget the price of the unit as I evaluated it .
This mic finished particularly strongly in the mic handling test and I really enjoyed it 's sound with the female talent .
All in all , if you are on an extremely limited budget , you could record good quality audio in many situations with the AT875R .
This microphone is a perfect example of the price paradigm in these types of microphones shifting .
Before I tested this mic , if you would have told that you could purchase a seriously high - quality sounding microphone for video / film usage for it 's price , I would have disagreed .
The AT875R is a very impressive new product and I highly recommend it as one of the best low cost mics on the market for film / video use .
It does not have the smoothness of sound , transient response , nuance and off - axis rejection of the more expensive microphones but in the right hands , it still makes good quality recordings for an amazingly low price .
Audio - Technica AT4073a
I have used this microphone for years .
It is a solid performer .
If you read around the sound forums , it is highly recommended by many users .
I would term this microphone as an " industry standard " even .
I found that in comparison to the other microphones evaluated , the AT4073a is a fairly unique microphone that has some particular strengths as well as some areas that it was not as strong in .
I was struck each time I used it by the 4073a 's amazing efficiency .
This microphone puts out a seriously higher nominal audio level than the other mics .
The other recurring theme is one of crispness .
This microphone sounds basically at the other end of the spectrum than most of the other microphones .
Would I recommend this microphone if you mostly shoot interiors with lots of reflective , hard surfaces ?
No , I would not .
In those sorts of environments , the sound could become a bit brittle .
I would recommend the 4073a if you shot in a lot of absorptive environments .
Picture a room in which you are shooting an interview .
The room has silk wall covering , plush thick carpets and rugs and large , puffy furniture .
In an environment like this , many of the other mics would present with a muffled , probably too bassy sound .
Not the AT4073a , it would be perfect for this sort of situation .
Its crispness would really cut through such muffled acoustics .
Same thing with exteriors .
If you are booming and cannot locate the microphone a proper booming distance of 1 - 2 feet from the subject , the AT4073a would be an excellent choice .
With it 's increased sensitivity ; it would probably pick up at least adequate sound from as far away as 4 - 6 feet from the subject .
This microphone is an excellent example of why I suggest your kit contains at least two Shotgun / Cardioid variant mics .
This microphone is outstanding in certain physical environments and not as impressive in others .
If you combine the AT4073a with a microphone with smoother sound and less high - end response , between the two , you would have a lot of different audio situations covered .
Beyerdynamic MC 836
The Beyerdynamic MC - 836 represented an interesting enigma .
I liked how it sounded overall but it did not seem to be a standout performer in any of the test situations except the exterior test .
I would say that the main term that comes to mind when evaluating the test clips is balanced .
The MC - 836 did not seem to be particularly impressive on the interior tests although it did not do badly on any of them either .
The unusual thing about this microphone is that even in it 's test results , the microphone was balanced .
There were other microphones that excelled in certain areas but they also tended to have more distinct disadvantages as well .
Not the Beyerdynamic MC - 836 , it did at least decently in all of the tests .
The microphone really came into it's own on the exterior test , I liked it 's sound much more for exteriors than I did for interiors .
I did also really like the detailed smoothness that this mic presented , the smoothness was on par with some of the much more expensive microphones .
This MC - 836 presents with emphasis on the mid-range , so if you have soft spoken or whispery voiced talent , this microphone could be a viable alternative for helping to emphasize this voice .
Neumann KMR81i
The Neumann KMR - 81i lives in the sound bags of a lot of working sound mixers .
Neumann has quite a reputation for building outstanding world - class large diaphragm studio condenser microphones and from what I experienced , Neumann has successfully managed to infuse the KMR - 81 i with much of the same sound quality and mystique .
The KMR - 81i has a very rich and detailed sound that I found extremely pleasant to work with .
I used it on a project that featured interviews with several students at a design school .
The area we had to shoot the interviews in was not a good sound location ; it was situated in between two open classrooms just off of a heavily trafficked hallway .
The results were outstanding ; we hardly picked up any of the din from down the hallway that was totally apparent to our ears .
On the other hand , I recorded with this microphone in a few instances where I would have liked to hear a bit more " room tone " mixed in with the voice .
The isolation from off - axis sound is almost too good with this microphone sometimes .
In certain quiet environments ; it can be nice to hear a bit more of the environment mixed in with the voice .
Just keep in mind that these situations are much more rare than shooting in environments with too much ambient noise .
In a few of the recording situations , this microphone almost sounded like a really full bodied sweet sounding lavaliere , it sounded close mic'd even though the microphone was almost two feet from the talent .
The off - axis rejection is top notch ; the quality of sound is outstanding .
This microphone is n't inexpensive but it is worthy of your consideration as a top of the line sound tool that will last you for many years , and will be useful in many different sound situations .
If you want a premium sound and are willing to pay for it , definitely consider the KMR - 81i .
Oktava MK - 012
Talk about baggage .
The Oktava came to me with some reputation .
I had heard a lot of different buzz about the MK - 012 from users and the forums .
Some describe it as a " poor man 's Schoeps " , others have been dismissive about it .
The Oktava is unusual in that it is made in Russia and is quite well accepted and popular all over the world .
One feature that I thought would be very appealing to me was that the Oktava MK - 012 is available as a three capsule set with an Omnidirectional , Cardioid and Hypercardioid included along with a - 10 dB capsule to reduce sensitivity .
If you are an all - around sound recordist , this kit is a great value , the Omni and Cardioid capsules are great in the recording studio and in the field .
If you mainly shoot video / film sound , you will find that the Hypercardioid capsule is the best for most video / film situations so you may be able to save some money by purchasing the power supply with only the Hypercardioid capsule , although I liked the Cardioid capsule for certain situations as well .
The Oktava sounded great .
The MK - 012 is an amazing value considering it 's low price .
The MK - 012 is also physically tiny , which for many sound for picture situations can be handy .
The Oktava was a solid performer in all of the tests , save the handling noise test .
It is true that the MK - 012 is more susceptible to handling noise than many of the other mics tested .
If you are planning on hand booming with the MK - 012 , my advice it to purchase the best microphone mount you can find and practice with it for a while before shooting .
A professional boom operator can probably deal with the handling noise just fine but an amateur boom operator like me would have issues with it .
Oh yeah , to my ear , the Oktava did n't sound as full , smooth and uncolored as either Schoeps but it did sound amazing for it 's modest cost .
Sanken CS -1
To me , the Sanken CS - 1 fulfilled my expectations .
I expected it to have more detailed and smoother sound than the other $ 1,000.00 and under microphones .
It did .
I expected that it would not sound as detailed or smooth as the $ 1,000.00 plus microphones .
It did n't .
I have heard a lot of satisfied owners on the sound forums talking up the CS - 1 , saying that it is the best thing since sliced bread , so to speak .
It was interesting to test both the CS - 1 and CS - 3e together .
To my ear , I found the sound of the CS - 1 to be clear , clean and detailed .
The CS - 1 did not have the warmth or bass emphasis that some of the more expensive microphones seemed to have ; it probably has a less colored sound .
I also get the impression that the CS - 1 may have been primarily designed as an on - camera mic , much like the Audio - Technica AT875R .
It 's handling noise was very low , I would say the best of the sub - $ 1,000.00 microphones .
The CS - 1 is one of the microphones that presents with a little more room tone than some of the longer shotguns .
This is neither good or bad overall .
If you were recording in a very noisy environment , this mic could pick up too much ambient sound but in a quieter environment , I really liked hearing a bit of the environment .
Some of the longer shotguns almost sounded sterile , the CS - 1 sounds more " real " as far as integrating the voice with it 's surrounding environment .
This is another point for owning more than one of this type microphone ; there is no ideal mic for all sound situations .
The CS - 1 was a solid performer ; it 's great reputation is well deserved .
Sanken CS - 3e
I had a sense of Déjà vu as I first listened to the Sanken CS - 3e .
Hmm ... I have heard a mic that sounds like this before .
Which one was it ?
Oh yeah , the Sanken CS - 1 .
I should clarify , the CS - 3e sounds better than the CS - 1 .
It sells for almost twice as much so it should .
I found that the better bass response and considerably better off - axis rejection of the CS - 3e makes it an outstanding microphone .
This is a classic case of the CS - 1 being very good and the CS - 3e being better .
The CS - 3e also did very well in the mic handling test , suggesting that this could be an ideal handheld boom mic for interiors and exteriors .
The CS - 3e also did very well in the exterior test with a nice mixture of isolating the voice but also letting in a natural sounding amount of ambient .
For female voices , I really liked what the CS - 3e could do , it made the talent sound open and natural .
I felt that the Sanken CS - 3e offered basically a similar level of performance and sound quality as the more expensive German mics yet sounds different than the German mics .
You would have to determine if you prefer its sound over the more expensive Neumann , Schoeps and Sennheisers .
I really liked it and would be very happy to have one in my sound bag .
Schoeps CMC641
Much like the Neumann KMR - 81i , the Schoeps CMC641 is , frankly , an audio legend .
It is expensive , like the Neumann , and you will find it in MANY professional sound mixers ' kits .
Schoeps mics are also perhaps a bit more difficult to find , although I have noticed that one popular NYC " box house " is now carrying this particular microphone .
So , to get right to it did the Schoeps CMC641 live up to it 's reputation ?
In a word , definitely .
The Schoeps had a natural , uncolored sound that really made me forget I was listening to a recording .
If I recorded lousy sounds with Schoeps , they sounded lousy , as they should .
If I recorded a great sounding source , it sounded great .
The Schoeps gives you what is probably the most realistic sound picture of any of the mics I tested , what you hear from it is what you get .
The Schoeps is , like the Neumann , a serious piece of German workmanship .
From the gold colored engraved name and model number to the no-nonsense crackle enamel finish , the Schoeps feels like a solid piece of gear .
I hesitate to even use too many adjectives to describe the sound of the CMC641 , other than to say it is VERY accurate and uncolored .
I also feel that the Schoeps delivers what you are paying for .
In this case , I feel that " industry standard " is a well - deserved badge of endorsement .
If you knew how many television shows and how many feature films you have heard through this microphone , you would probably shake your head in disbelief .
It 's that good .
If you can afford this one , you probably wo n't need to buy another main microphone for decades , if not longer .
That said , if you treasure microphones that impart some of their own personality to your sound as most of the other mics did , you may be happier with some of the other models .
Schoeps CMIT5u
The Schoeps CMIT5u was a very interesting microphone .
In some ways , it turns the industry on its side .
Let 's go down the list .
First of all , it 's a Schoeps !
Schoeps has never made a shotgun and for many years , sound mixers have wished that Schoeps would distill some of the audio magic from mics like the CMC641 into a shotgun form factor .
Check .
Next , it has active electronics built into the microphone body with really cool little buttons with LED indicator lights .
Besides looking interesting and high - tech , the boosts and roll offs are much easier to implement than with the traditional small , cheap dipswitch .
Personally , I have to be reminded by bad rumble usually to implement the roll off on most of the mics that I use that have the roll off .
With the CMIT5u , I found myself often just clicking through the switches because it was so easy and convenient .
The light show has another practical feature , as a shooter , I can look over and at a glance , receive visual confirmation about which boosts and or roll offs I am using , very handy .
Lastly , Schoeps has really gone all out to ensure that anyone who sees this microphone notices that it is something different .
The color and finish on the CMIT5u is beautiful and not in an ostentatious way .
The blue anodized finished is simply exquisite .
Nope , it does n't make it sound any better but it does make it a joy to use because it is just so cool looking .
( Sorry , I can't help it , I love the way it looks ) .
Check .
Last unique feature , the weight !
Man , this mic is long and rather large in comparison to the CMC641 but it weighs a LOT less than the CMC641 .
If you are hand booming , you will fall in love with this mic , it has low handling noise , great off axis rejection and it is incredibly light .
Interestingly , to my ear , the CMIT5u does n't sound exactly like a shotgun version of the CMC641 .
The two mics have a distinctly different sound quality although they are in the same neighborhood .
Neither is better or worse , they are just different .
The CMIT5u obviously has better off - axis rejection yet the basic quality of the sound is slightly more colored , but in a good way .
The CMIT5u was the second most expensive mic I tested and to be honest , I felt it was easily worth every penny .
You will discover if you shop for this microphone , nobody seems to offer discounts on it .
That should tell you something .
It 's a superb shotgun .
Sennheiser MKH-50
The Sennheiser MKH - 50 was a microphone that I was really interested in evaluating .
I have shot with the MKH - 60 and MKH - 416 for years but have never had a chance to use the MKH - 50 .
It displayed a distinctly different sound than both the 60 and 416 .
It 's difficult to put it into words but the MKH - 50 had a very exciting sound .
It made subjects sound big and dynamic .
The MKH - 50 is a very popular microphone ; I have seen quite a few at work on the Hollywood television and film sets that I frequent .
Sennheisers are very well built and smartly engineered .
The look is low key and black .
To my ear , the MKH - 50 presents the sound with bass and mid-range emphasis .
As always , I would seriously consider this type of sound if you record a lot of female talent , child talent or males with thinner voices .
The MKH - 50 makes them sound robust and gives their voices some authority .
If I had to make a film analogy , this microphone sounds like an action thriller .
It 's exciting , dynamic and a blast to record with .
If you look at sound characteristics as a palette , this sort of sound would be good for warmth and authority .
If your talent already has a very deep or authoritative sort of voice , this microphone might not be the number one choice .
I really liked how this microphone made my voice sound and I do have a fairly penetrating and deep voice so who knows , it 's just a matter of taste and preference .
Sennheiser has created a classic with the MKH - 50 .
Sennheiser MKH - 60
Unlike it 's sibling , the MKH - 50 , the Sennheiser MKH - 60 had a slightly more balanced sound overall .
It produced less bass coloration on exteriors , had excellent off - axis rejection and did extremely well in the mic handling tests .
In exteriors , the MKH - 60 seemed to compare more to the Sanken CS - 3e than the other German microphones .
After reviewing both of these Sennheisers , I could see that teaming the two of them together would result in a very complimentary microphone package , if not an inexpensive one .
I have shot many hundreds of interviews with the MKH - 60 over the years and it presents a very well balanced sound picture with a slight mid-range emphasis .
Personally , I find that I really enjoy using the MKH - 60 although it becomes rather transparent , like the Schoeps CMC641 .
After a while , you just do n't notice the microphone 's characteristics at all , you just notice the sound it recorded .
I feel that the Schoeps is less colored than the Sennheiser but both of them present a very realistic sound .
The MKH - 60 holds the distinction of having the highest list price ( $ 2,000.00 ) of any of the mics tested although actual street prices result in the MKH - 60 generally selling for less than the Schoeps CMIT5u .
The Neumann is another world - class microphone from Sennheiser .
It was a joy to work with .
In The End
I hope that you have found this article a quality resource .
Choosing the correct audio gear for your needs is always challenging .
Fortunately , microphones do n't have a tendency to change much ; several of the models reviewed here have basically stayed the same for the past 5 - 10 years .
A few of the models are newer and have introduced some new technology and new quality levels for unheard of price points .
The most important thing to remember as you decide which microphone (s ) to purchase is to buy quality and buy the product that best suits your needs .
You should always challenge yourself to not scrimp and to buy the best quality audio gear that you can afford .
Unlike cameras and computers , audio gear can really be an investment .
With care , it will last you many years and will not need to be replaced by the newest , latest and greatest .
Quality audio gear will also pay for itself quickly in saved rental fees .
As with all other aspects of sound for picture , it 's the skill of the operator that really makes the most difference .
Having the most expensive or best performing microphone on the market wo n't make any difference in the quality of your sound unless you know when , where and how to use it .
In order for any of the microphones in this article to work to their full potential , you need a quality microphone mount , wind protection , boom pole , cable , mixer and recording device .
As you can see , the microphone is merely the first device in the chain .

Terbutaline can relax your involuntary smooth muscle when it 's causing problems : in constricted airways during an asthma attack , or in the uterus during contractions .
But if you 've taken terbutaline , you 've probably also noticed another effect : it can induce a pounding , racing heartbeat .
How can one drug produce such opposite effects - relaxing smooth muscle in some parts of your body , while making your cardiac muscle work harder ?
The answer is that terbutaline switches on a common information - processing module , called a signaling pathway , which gets used over and over in different cells to perform very different jobs .
This information - processing module can be plugged into different cell types , where it will transmit signals from the environment outside the cell to the inside where the information is processed and acted upon .
Because our cells use a common set of information - processing modules to carry out so many different jobs , it 's easy for drugs that act on these modules to produce a wide range of side - effects .
Anatomy of an Information Processing Module
Let 's take a look at one of these information - processing modules to see how terbutaline produces it 's varied effects .
Terbutaline closely resembles a hormone produced by your body , epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) .
Like epinephrine , terbutaline switches on a signaling pathway when it binds to a protein on the surface of a cell , a protein called a beta - adrenergic receptor .
( Aficionados will know that there are several types of these receptors , and they have somewhat different roles in different tissues ; terbutaline acts primarily on beta - 2 receptors . )
Once terbutaline binds the receptor , we get a cascade of chemical reactions like this :
1 . The receptor activates a G - protein .
2 . The G - protein turns on an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase .
3. Adenylyl cyclase produces a molecule called cAMP .
4. cAMP activates a protein called Protein Kinase A , or PKA .
5. PKA initiates many different downstream processes that produce a change in the cell ( stronger muscle contractions in your heart , relaxation in your smooth muscle cells , and other effects in your gut and liver ) .
Like components in your computer , this pathway can be plugged into a variety of contexts .
Connect the pathway to a different input at the top ( say , a different receptor for a different hormone ) , and / or a different output at the bottom ( make different PKA targets available ) , and voila : your information - processing module can do something else .
Many of these pathways are very ancient modules , found in organisms from yeast to worms to flies to mammals .
These modules have been so well conserved , that you can take take a human receptor , pop it into yeast , and that receptor will hook up with the yeast G - protein and start the cascade of chemical reations .
Why These Modules Work This Way
The module I outlined above may not make very much sense at first glance .
Why does it work this way ?
There are two particularly important things this pathway does .
1. Just like a photomultiplier tube , which produces a detectable electric current from a single photon , this signaling pathway amplifies the intial signal .
When one molecule of terbutaline turns on a receptor , that receptor turns on a G - protein , which turns on adenylyl cyclase .
Adenylyl cyclase produces many molecules of cAMP , which can diffuse through the cell and activate all of the PKA around .
If one active receptor produced only one molecule of cAMP , your signal would quickly fizzle out inside the cell ( this is still true even when you allow for the fact that in a real cell you have hundreds of receptors getting activated by terbutaline ) .
Molecules like cAMP are called second messsengers ; they are ' messengers ' slightly downstream of the activating signal which are produced in large numbers , large enough to get the message conveyed everywhere it needs to go .
2 . This signaling pathway relays information spatially - from the surface of the cell , where the receptor sits , monitoring the environment , down into the guts of the cell , such as the nucleus , where genes get switched on and off , or internal calcium storage sites , which can produce a whole host of different effects in the cell ( such as changing the electrical activity of heart muscle cells ) .
Receptors and G - proteins hang out around the surface of the cell , but the small second messenger cAMP can diffuse away from the membrane , and over to the places where PKA can do its job .
Now that we 've seen how these pathways work , we can come back to our original question about terbutaline : why are we set up to get such different responses from a drug that turns on beta- adrenergic receptors ?
We can find a clue by looking for the hormone that normally binds these beta- adrenergic receptors when externally - administered terbutaline is not around : epinephrine .
Epinephrine is a major player in our fight - or - flight response : when trouble is brewing , our body gears up to survive the oncoming crisis by preparing to fight it out , or ( more likely in my case ) run away .
To do either , we need plenty of oxygen and lots of blood flow ( and obviously no labor contractions ) .
Thus , epinephrine activates the information - processing module that gets our heart to pump more blood , and our airways to relax and open for more oxygen .
The economy involved here is extremely elegant : instead of using a brand new signaling pathway for each different function , our cells use universal parts that help our bodies coordinate the complex responses we need in our day - to - day lives .
Dr. Michele Morgan migrated last fall from Detroit to Phoenix , taking a job as a psychiatrist .
She expected her husband , Sam Kirkland , to soon join her , since he was accepting an early retirement package from his employer , General Motors .
But he cannot move , he says , because he has not been able to sell the four - bedroom family home .
“ As things now stand , ” said Mr. Kirkland , who is 51 and intends to seek work in Phoenix , if he ever gets there , “ my wife might decide to give up her job in Phoenix and come back to Detroit for a while , until we can sell the house . ”
The rapid decline in housing prices is distorting the normal workings of the American labor market .
Mobility opens up job opportunities , allowing workers to go where they are most needed .
When housing is not an obstacle , more than five million men and women , nearly 4 percent of the nation ’s work force , move annually from one place to another  to a new job after a layoff , or to higher - paying work , or to the next rung in a career , often the goal of a corporate transfer .
Or people seek , as in Dr. Morgan ’s case , an escape from harsh northern winters .
Now that mobility is increasingly restricted .
Unable to sell their homes easily and move on , tens of thousands of people like Mr. Kirkland and Dr. Morgan are making the labor force less flexible just as a weakening economy puts pressure on workers to move to wherever companies are still hiring .
If laws banning the use of force are relaxed when an intruder crawls in your window and you ’re home , should n’t stringent F.D.A. regulations bend when you ’re backed into a dark corner by a terminal illness ?
That was the gist of an argument made by the U.C.L.A. law professor Eugene Volokh in the May issue of The Harvard Law Review .
Citing the concept of “ medical self - defense , ” Volokh contended that a dying American should have the right to buy any drug that has passed the F.D.A. ’s preliminary safety tests .
Currently , the F.D.A. insists that most terminally ill patients await , like everyone else , full proof of a drug ’s safety and efficacy .

Volokh ’s inspiration for the article was a court decision .
In 2006 , a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that the terminally ill ought to be able to buy drugs that have passed Phase 1 F.D.A. testing ( of three phases ) .
One judge in the majority was a staunch conservative , the other a Clinton appointee .
The full Court of Appeals , however , set aside the panel decision and then , in August , ruled 8 to 2 against the plaintiff , the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs .
The court agreed with the F.D.A. ’s arguments that the government has a strong interest in protecting even the terminally ill from brutal side effects and a premature death , and that only the full testing regimen can do that .
The court also stressed that the states ’ efforts to regulate drugs dated to 1736 and observed that the Supreme Court had rejected a “ medical necessity ” argument in the case of medical marijuana .
And it wondered where the right to self - defense would end — could a dying patient force a drug company to hand over drugs ?
In a vigorous dissent , Justice Douglas Ginsburg said it was “ startling ” that the court failed to give the right to self - defense its due .
Volokh continues to hold that both the common law and the Constitution support a right to obtain the best available medicine , despite the risks .
In his view , a terminal cancer patient is in precisely the same situation as a home - intrusion victim or , you might add , a victim of a rampaging bear , both of whom are exempted from certain legal prohibitions .
( You do n’t have to check endangered - species regulations before knifing or shooting the bear . )
“ Medical self - defense is not an analogy , ” Volokh says .
“ It is self - defense . ”
Tim Bray , the co-creator of XML turned Ruby on Rails enthusiast , has told developers to face up to lingering performance problems in the scripting stack .
In a keynote at the Silicon Valley Ruby Conference last week , Bray called Rails " a big deal , a hot deal " .
And the Sun Microsystems director of web technologies is walking it likes he talks it : he 's using a lot of Ruby for his development .
But ...
" Let 's face the facts : Ruby is too slow , " Bray told delegates .
He says Ruby 1.8.6 - which dominates the enterprise landscape - is up to 20 times slower than Java .
And , despite tests , the cause of the problem remains unclear - is it compilation of Ruby or " some pretty freaking complex and scary stuff " in Rails .
" When you start to run Rails , you get wildly non-linear performance .
Rails has worked well on Ruby 1.8.6 ... everything else is a work in progress .
It 's weird and it's hard to understand , " Bray said .
" Ruby is richly festooned with core libraries and APIs that are n't built in Ruby , they are built in C , " he said .
Fellow keynote speaker John Lam , a Microsoft project manager who 's leading work porting Ruby to the .NET Framework with IronRuby , also noted " strange anomalies " in the way Ruby works .
Various initiatives are underway to address the Ruby speed problem .
These include the Smalltalk - inspired Rubinius that Sun is supporting ; the somewhat obscure Maglev ; and - of course - JRuby .
This runs on the Java Virtual Machine and is up to five times faster than Ruby , according to Bray .
In spite of the go slow , Bray delivered a robust endorsement of Ruby on Rails .
For him , the Rails framework drives Ruby 's success and gives Ruby an edge over PHP and Sun 's beloved Java in speed of development , scalability and maintainability .
" The majority of Ruby in the world is driven by Rails , " he said .
Rails offers a clean , prescribed and predictable framework that - like PHP - get some of their advantage from choosing to do less .
Java Enterprise Edition , meanwhile , is designed for " infinite flexibility " .
PHP is widespread and is used in massive applications such as Facebook and Wikipedia , but the accompanying PHP frameworks such as CakePHP , have not followed in terms of deployment , breeding " spaghetti code " that 's difficult to fix and extend .
According to Bray , the prescriptive nature of the Rails framework suits most web front - ended applications ' database batch needs when it comes to create , repeat , update and delete .
The downside ?
If you need your database calls to do something a little different , you 're on your own .
Rails also encourages best practices , through the use of test - driven development to improve construction and model view controller to help maintain applications .
Speed of development is the number - one reason that CTOs at big banks and airlines are calling Bray in to advise on Ruby .
" They 've heard it gives them applications in months rather than years .
That 's why Ruby came out of nowhere , " he said .
" You can get something done faster in Ruby once you 've got it built , you can do updates and maintenance faster than you can in PHP . "
Other languages could learn a thing or two from Rails and Bray predicts frameworks would become more " Rails - like " - meaning the future does not belong to Ruby on Rails alone . ®
In anticipation of Gen. David Petraeus ’ congressional testimony , which begins today , Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) boasted in a Wall Street Journal op - ed today about how right they think they are .
Indeed , Lieberman and Graham , two of the less restrained cheerleaders of the Bush policy in Iraq , appear comfortable taking a victory lap , convinced of their own rectitude .
No one can deny the dramatic improvements in security in Iraq achieved by Gen .
Petraeus , the brave troops under his command , and the Iraqi Security Forces .
From June 2007 through February 2008 , deaths from ethno- sectarian violence in Baghdad have fallen approximately 90 % .
American casualties have also fallen sharply , down by 70 % .
Those are , to be sure , encouraging numbers , but as Think Progress noted , Lieberman and Graham conveniently skipped over numbers from March 2008 — which they had access to , but chose to ignore .
That ’s because Iraqi deaths and civilian casualties saw a significant increase in March , a point the pro-war senators no doubt found inconvenient .
Al Qaeda in Iraq has been swept from its former strongholds in Anbar province and Baghdad .
The liberation of these areas was made possible by the surge , which empowered Iraqi Muslims to reject the Islamist extremists who had previously terrorized them into submission .
I assume Lieberman and Graham realize the Awakening began months before the surge , but they found this fact inconvenient , too .
In recent months , the Iraqi government , encouraged by our Ambassador in Iraq , Ryan Crocker , has passed benchmark legislation on such politically difficult issues as de-Baathification , amnesty , the budget and provincial elections .
I ’d really hoped we were past this .
That the surge policy has not produced the political progress promised is so obvious , it ’s hardly worth emphasizing anymore .
Indeed , perhaps Lieberman and Graham missed this report from the weekend : “ A new assessment of U.S. policy in Iraq by the same experts who advised the original Iraq Study Group concludes that political progress is ’ so slow , halting and superficial ’ and political fragmentation ’ so pronounced ’ that the United States is no closer to being able to leave Iraq than it was a year ago . ”
[ I ] n launching the recent offensive in Basra , Mr. Maliki has demonstrated that he has the political will to take on the Shiite militias and criminal gangs , which he recently condemned as “ worse than al Qaeda . ”
First , Basra was a failure for Maliki .
Second , Lieberman and Graham still want to make the events of two weeks ago about good vs. bad ; they were far more complex than that .
Today ’s antiwar politicians have effectively turned John F. Kennedy ’s inaugural address on its head , urging Americans to refuse to pay any price , or bear any burden , to assure the survival of liberty .
Is that what Lieberman and Graham think we ’re doing in Iraq ?
Assuring the “ survival of liberty ” ?
One wonders if they actually believe such nonsense , or if they ’re counting on the rest of us to be so foolish as to buy this drivel .
Thanks to the surge , Iraq today is looking increasingly like Osama bin Laden ’s worst nightmare : an Arab country , in the heart of the Middle East , in which hundreds of thousands of Muslims – both Sunni and Shiite – are rising up and fighting , shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers , against al Qaeda and its hateful ideology .
First , I do n’t know what country Lieberman and Graham are watching , but if they see Sunnis , Shi’ia , and Americans fighting “ shoulder to shoulder , ” they probably need to start laying off the hallucinogens .
Second , far from bin Laden ’s “ nightmare , ” the terrorist leader has actually said that al - Qaeda ’s strategy “ is to cripple the U.S. economy by dragging us into quagmires abroad … .
A smallish number of people with no base of resources can’t possibly defeat us unless we shoot ourselves in the foot repeatedly as Bush and McCain propose . ”
Lieberman and Graham , for some reason , seem anxious to help .
Last Sunday , David Barstow of the New York Times revealed just how effectively the Pentagon orchestrated a propaganda campaign for “ information dominance ” when it came to the president ’s various wars ( and prisons ) .
Pentagon officials , from the secretary of defense on down , put together a “ rapid reaction force ” of retired generals and other retired military officers ( aka “ message force multipliers ” or “ surrogates ” ) .
With copious Pentagon help and perks , these “ experts ” became key go - to guys for the mainstream media when it came to the War on Terror and the war in Iraq .
As the Nation ‘s Katrina vanden Heuvel put the matter , “ This was an all out effort at the highest levels of the Bush administration , continuing to this day , to dupe , mislead and lie to the American people  using propaganda dressed up and cherry - picked as independent military analysis .
As one participant described it , ’It was psy - ops on steroids . ' ”
The Pentagon ’s Brent T. Kreuger put it another way , speaking of the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq : “ We were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks [ the retired military men ] were up there delivering our message .
You ’d look at them and say , ‘ This is working . ' ”
But let ’s face it , as today ’s TomDispatch post indicates , the Pentagon , however unseen , is increasingly everywhere in our world .
That it ’s been in bed with cable news , the major TV and radio networks , and our leading newspapers via retired - generals - tied - to - military - contractors - turned - pundits , ca n’t really shock anyone who ’s bothered to listen to anything this bevy of talking - heads has had to say these last years .
The fact is the Pentagon is now the most incestuous organization in America .
If it regularly embeds reporters in its ranks to ensure decent coverage of its operations ( think of this as a military version of Stockholm Syndrome ) and , as Jon Stewart recently pointed out , embeds its retired generals in the media , it ’s also regularly in bed with itself in a way that can only be called perverse .
Take a simple example of such in - beddedness , a $ 50 million Air Force contract involving another of those retired generals .
Given our near trillion - dollar defense budget , the sum itself is military chump change .
As the Washington Post ‘s Josh White described the process , a seven - person “ selection team ” charged with picking a contractor to “ jazz up the Air Force ’s Thunderbirds air show with giant video boards , ” under pressure from a higher - ranking officer , gave the contract to Strategic Message Solutions , “ a company that barely existed in an effort to reward a recently retired four - star general and a millionaire civilian pilot who had grown close to senior Air Force officials and the Thunderbirds . ”
It ’s hardly surprising that taxpayer dollars in amounts that would have staggered Croesus have led to a revolving - door system of rampant corruption ; more surprising is just how much that system is linked into your everyday life .
In a sense , the militarization of America is happening right in your apartment or house .
The Complex : How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives , the new book by Nick Turse , who has long written for TomDispatch on Pentagon matters , makes this point strikingly .
( By hook or by crook , it should be on your bookshelf . )
You ’ll get the idea as , in the adaptation of the book ’s first chapter below , with the fictional “ Rick ” you live through an all - too - real , all - American militarized morning at home .
( And while you ’re at it , just imagine some of those retired generals offering lulling , Pentagon - inspired commentary in the background about how all of this is healthy , none of it really matters . )
Tom
The Real Matrix
The Pentagon invades your life
by Nick Turse
Rick is a mid-level manager in a financial services company in New York City .
Each day he commutes from Weehawken , New Jersey , a suburb only a stone ’s throw from the Big Apple , where he lives with his wife , Donna , and his teenage son , Steven .
A late baby boomer , Rick just missed the Vietnam era ’s antiwar protests , but he ’s been against the war in Iraq from the beginning .
He thinks the Pentagon is out of control and considers the military - industrial complex a danger to the country .
If you asked him , it ’s a subject on which he would rate himself as knowledgeable .
He puts effort into educating himself on such matters .
He reads liberal Web sites , subscribes to progressive - minded magazines , and is a devotee of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
In fact , he has no idea just how deep the Pentagon rabbit hole goes or how far down it his family already is .
Rick believes that , despite its long reach , the military - industrial complex is a discrete entity far removed from his everyday life .
Now , if this were 1961 , when outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned the country about the “ unwarranted influence ” of the “ military - industrial complex ” and the “ large arms industry ” already firmly entrenched in the United States , Rick might be right .
After all , he does n’t work for one of the Pentagon ’s corporate partners , like arms maker Lockheed Martin .
He is n’t in the Army Reserve .
He ’s never attended a performance of the Marine Corps band ( not to mention the Army ’s , Navy ’s , or Air Force ’s music groups ) .
But today ’s geared - up , high - tech Complex is nothing like the olive - drab outfit of Eisenhower ’s day :
It reaches deeper into American lives and the American psyche than Eisenhower could ever have imagined .
The truth is that , at every turn , in countless , not - so - visible ways Rick ’s life is wrapped up with the military .
So wake up with Rick and sample a single spring morning as the alarm on his Sony ( Department of Defense contractor ) clock interrupts his final dream of the night .
Donna is already up and dressed in fitness apparel by Danskin ( a Pentagon supplier that received more than $ 780,000 in DOD dollars in 2004 and another $ 456,000 in 2005 ) and Hanes Her Way ( made by defense contractor and cake seller Sara Lee Corporation , which took in more than $ 68 million from the DOD in 2006 ) .
Committed to a healthy lifestyle , she ’s wearing sneakers from ( DOD contractor ) New Balance and briskly jogging on a treadmill made by ( DOD contractor ) True Fitness Technology .
Rick drags himself to the bathroom ( fixtures by Pentagon contractor Kohler , purchased at defense contractor Home Depot ) .
There , he squeezes the Charmin , brushes with Crest toothpaste , washes his face with Noxzema ; then , hopping into the shower , he lathers up with Zest and chooses Donna ’s Herbal Essences over Head & Shoulders 
“ What the hell , ” he mutters , “ I deserve an organic experience . ”
( The manufacturer of each of these products , Procter & Gamble , is among the top 100 defense contractors and raked in a cool $ 362,461,808 from the Pentagon in 2006 . )
In go his ( DOD supplier ) Bausch and Lomb contact lenses and down goes a Zantac ( from DOD contractor GlaxoSmithKline ) for his ulcer .
Heading back to the bedroom , he finds Donna finished with her workout and making the bed  with the TV news on  and lends her a hand .
( Their headboard was purchased from Thomasville Furniture , the mattress from Sears , the pillows were made by Harris Pillow Supply , all Pentagon contractors . )
They exchange grim glances as , on their Samsung set ( another DOD contractor ) the Today Show chronicles the latest in chaos in Iraq .
“ Thank god we never supported this war , ” Rick says , thinking of the antiwar rally Donna and he attended even before the invasion was launched .
NBC , which produces the Today Show , is owned by General Electric , the 14th - largest defense contractor in the United States , to the tune of $ 2.3 billion from the DOD in 2006 , and has worked on such weapons systems as the UH - 60 Blackhawk helicopters and F / A - 18 Hornet multimission fighter / attack aircraft , both in use in Iraq .
A Who ’s Who of Your Life
Of course , the Pentagon has long poured U.S. tax dollars into private coffers to arm and outfit the military and enable it to function .
At the time of Eisenhower ’s farewell address , New York Times reporter Jack Raymond noted that the Pentagon was spending “ $ 23,000,000,000 a year for services and procurement of guns , missiles , airplanes , electronic devices , vehicles , tanks , ammunition , clothing , and other military goods . ”
Today , that would equal around $ 200 billion .
In 2007 , the Department of Defense ’s stated budget was $ 439 billion .
Counting the costs of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the number jumps to over $ 600 billion .
Factoring in all the many related activities carried out by other agencies , actual U.S. national security spending is nearly $ 1 trillion per year .
Back in Eisenhower ’s day , arms dealers and mega- corporations , such as Lockheed and General Motors , held sway over the corporate side of the military - industrial complex .
Companies like these still play an extremely powerful role today , but they are dwarfed by the sheer number of contractors that stretch from coast to coast and across the globe .
Looking at the situation in 1970 , almost 10 years after Eisenhower ’s farewell speech , Sidney Lens , a journalist and expert on U.S. militarism , noted that there were 22,000 prime contractors doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense .
Today , the number of prime contractors tops 47,000 with subcontractors reaching well over the 100,000 mark , making for one massive conglomerate touching nearly every sector of society , from top computer manufacturer Dell ( the 50th - largest DOD contractor in 2006 ) to oil giant ExxonMobil ( the 30th ) to package - shipping titan FedEx ( the 26th ) .
In fact , the Pentagon payroll is a veritable who ’s who of the top companies in the world : IBM ; Time - Warner ; Ford and General Motors ; Microsoft ; NBC and its parent company , General Electric ; Hilton and Marriott ; Columbia TriStar Films and its parent company , Sony ; Pfizer ; Sara Lee ; Procter & Gamble ; M&M Mars and Hershey ; Nestlé ; ESPN and its parent company , Walt Disney ; Bank of America ; and Johnson & Johnson , among many other big - name firms .
But the difference between now and then is n’t only in scale .
As this list suggests , Pentagon spending is reaching into previously neglected areas of American life : entertainment , popular consumer brands , sports .
This penetration translates into a remarkable variety of forms of interaction with the public .
Rick and Donna ’s home is full of the fruits of this incursion .
As they putter around in their kitchen , getting ready for the day ahead , they move from the wall cabinets ( purchased at DOD contractor Lowe ’s Home Center ) to the refrigerator ( from defense contractor Maytag ) , choosing their breakfast from a cavalcade of products made by Pentagon contractors .
These companies that , quite literally , feed the Pentagon ’s war machine , are the same firms that fill the shelves of America ’s kitchens .
Today , just about every supermarket staple  from Ballpark Franks ( Sara Lee ) and Eggo waffles ( Kelloggs ) to Jell - O ( Kraft ) and Coffee Mate ( Nestle )  has ties to the Pentagon .
The same holds for many household appliances .
In Rick and Donna ’s dining room , a small Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner buzzes around the floor .
Rick thought it would be cute to have the little mechanical device trolling around the house making their hectic lives just a tad easier .
Little did he know that Roomba ’s manufacturer , iRobot , takes in U.S. tax dollars ( $ 51 million of them from the DOD in 2006 , more than a quarter of the company ’s revenue ) and turns them into PackBots , tactical robots used by U.S. troops occupying Iraq and Afghanistan , and Warrior X700s  250 - pound semiautonomous robots armed with heavy weapons such as machine guns , that are now deployed in Iraq .
In addition to selling millions of Roombas to civilian consumers , the company uses government tax dollars to make money on the civilian side of its business .
According to the company ’s December 2006 annual report ( which listed as its “ Research Support Agencies ” the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [ DARPA ] , the U.S. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command , the U.S. Army Tank - Automotive and Armaments Command , and the U.S. Army Armament Research , Development , and Engineering Center ) , government funding “ allows iRobot to accelerate the development of multiple technologies . ”
Yet iRobot retains “ ownership of patents and know - how and [ is ] generally free to develop other commercial products , including consumer and industrial products , utilizing the technologies developed during these projects . ”
It ’s a very sweet deal .
And iRobot is hardly alone .
Entering the Digital World with Guns Blazing
Sitting on the dining room table is Rick ’s HP ( Hewlett - Packard ) notebook computer .
HP is another company that has grown its civilian know - how with generous military contracts , like the multiyear , multimillion - dollar deal it signed in 2005 with DARPA to “ develop technologies to improve the performance of mission - critical computer networks used during combat and other vital operations . ”
A spokesman for the company noted , “ Our work for DARPA is aimed at significantly improving the performance of the Internet .
If we can successfully create new approaches to the way Internet traffic is detected and routed , we may start seeing the Internet used as the de facto communications and information network in areas where it previously would ’ve been thought too risky . ”
Success would certainly translate into more lucrative civilian work , as well .
Meanwhile , Rick and Donna ’s son , Steven , is still upstairs , having a hard time tearing himself away from his computer game .
His room is a veritable showcase of the new entertainment / sports / high tech / pop culture dimension of the 21st - century Complex : there are NASCAR posters ( in 2005 , more than $ 38 million in taxpayer money was spent on U.S. armed forces ’ racecars ) ; National Football League ( NFL ) jerseys and baseball caps ( the NFL has partnered with the Pentagon to create military profiles aired during TV broadcasts of regular and postseason games , while individual NFL teams have hosted “ military appreciation ” events ) ; X - Men comic books ( the Pentagon teamed up with Marvel Comics to produce limited - edition , “ military - exclusive ” comic books , with pro-Pentagon themes , that are now sought after by civilian collectors ) ; and a wastebasket filled with empty Mountain Dew bottles ( the Air Force was one of the sponsors of the Dew Action Sports Tour , a traveling show featuring skateboarding , BMX , and freestyle motocross contests ) .
During
Ike ’s time , when civilian firms like Ford and AT&T were the big military suppliers , the payroll showed an utter lack of cool companies .
Now , the Pentagon is reaching into virgin territory in new ways with new partners .
Today , hip firms like Apple , Google , and Starbucks are also on DOD contractors ’ lists .
And while Ike ’s complex was typified by brass bands and patriotic parades , today ’s variant is a flashy digitized world of video games , extreme sports , and everything cool that appeals to potential young recruits .
Steven finally shuts down Tropico : Paradise Island  a nation - building simulation video game where the player , as “ El Presidente , ” attempts to lure tourists to his / her fun - in - the - sun resort .
Neither father nor son is remotely aware that the software maker , Breakaway Games , does taxpayer - funded work for such military clients as DARPA , the Joint Forces Command , the Office of the Secretary of Defense , and the United States Air Force  as well as having developed 24 Blue , a simulator used to improve aircraft carrier - based operations .
They are blissfully unaware of even the existence of Breakaway ’s Pentagon - funded video game that could conceivably lead to more effective bombing of targets abroad .
Steven grabs his iPod MP3 player ( from DOD contractor Apple Computer ) and heads downstairs to leave with his father .
On his way to the door , Rick goes to his bookshelf and scans a selection of progressive texts whose publishers just happen to be DOD contractors , including a reissue of Rachel Carson ’s Silent Spring ( Houghton Mifflin ) , Bushwhacked : Life in George W. Bush ’s America by Lou Dubose and Molly Ivins ( Random House ) , and Jon Stewart ’s America ( The Book ) ( Warner Books ) , before choosing the Hugo Chavez - approved Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky ( ahem , Metropolitan Books from Macmillan publishers ) .
As the last one out , Donna sets the ADT alarm system .
( ADT took in more than $ 16 million from the Pentagon in 2006 , while its parent company , Tyco International , cleaned up to the tune of over $ 187 million . )
The Pentagon on Wheels
Rick and Steven hop into the Saturn parked in the driveway .
Rick is proud of his car choice  after all , Saturn has such a people - friendly ( even antiDetroit establishment ) vibe .
Admittedly , he is aware that General Motors owns not only the Saturn but the Hummer brand  the civilian version of the U.S. military ’s Humvee  but he believes that , in this world , you ca n’t be squeaky - clean perfect .
But Hummer is n’t the half of it .
How could Rick have known that , in 1999 , GM formally entered the Army ’s COMBATT ( COMmercially BAsed Tactical Truck ) vehicle development program ?
Or that GM actually had its own military division , General Motors Defense , when his Saturn was made ?
Nor could Rick have known that GM Defense formed a joint venture with defense giant General Dynamics to create the GM - GDLS Defense Group ( which was awarded in excess of $ 1.5 billion in DOD contract dollars in 2005 ) .
Or that GM took in $ 87 million from the Pentagon in 2006 .
Or that , in 2007 , GM entered into a 50 - year lease agreement to build a $ 100 million test track on the U.S. Army ’s Yuma Proving Grounds .
Or that the maker of his Saturn ’s tires , Goodyear , was America ’s 69th - largest defense contractor in 2004 , with DOD contracts worth nearly $ 357 million .
Rick might be an aging baby boomer , but he still tries to look cool ( to Steven ’s embarrassment ) .
As he pulls the Saturn out of the driveway , he dons a pair of Oakley sunglasses .
Oakley supplies goggles and boots to U.S. troops .
And while the military purchased goggles from firms such as the American Optical Company during the 1940s , it ’s unlikely that anyone ever called that company ’s designs “ badass , ” as Powder , a skiing magazine that runs Army recruitment ads on its
Web site , called one of Oakley ’s products .
Driving along , Rick glances over at his son .
“ Are those the Wolverine boots we just got you ? ”
“ Yeah , Dad , ” answers Steven , looking down at his now ratty footwear .
Rick ’s already thinking about the next pair he ’ll need to buy his son , not about the five - year , multimillion - dollar contract the company signed in 2003 to supply the Army with an upgraded infantry combat boot , or the other deals , worth tens of millions of dollars , that Wolverine signed with the Pentagon in 2004 , 2006 , and 2007 .
As they drive to his school , Steven perks up .
“ That ’s it , Dad ! ” he says , pointing at a Ford Escape that just pulled into the high school parking lot .
“ Whaddaya say , Dad ?
Next year , when I get my license ? ”
Rick remembers hearing on the radio that Ford makes an Escape hybrid-electric vehicle .
“ You know what , son ?
I think maybe we just might look into it . ”
He experiences a little burst of satisfaction .
Not only can he feel like a good dad , but as a bonus he can even help the environment .
( Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries have , of course , garnered rafts of defense contracts and aided the Army and Navy in various projects . )
Overjoyed , Steven shoots his father a big smile as he opens the car door , “ All right !
Well , I ’ll see you tonight , Dad . ”
“ Do you have your cell phone ? ” Rick asks .
Steven whips a Motorola from his pocket .
( Motorola made almost $ 308 million from the Department of Defense in 2004 , while the phone ’s service provider , Verizon , took home more than $ 128 million in DOD contracts , and $ 50 million more from the Department of Homeland Security , in 2006 . )
The Real Matrix
With Steven at school , Rick heads for work .
He gives the local Exxon station ( ExxonMobil took in more than $ 1.17 billion in DOD dollars in 2006 ) a pass and instead pulls into Shell , which likes to portray itself as a kinder , greener oil giant .
As he signs the receipt of his Bank of America credit card ( a firm which issues special credit cards to Pentagon employees to streamline the process of buying supplies for the DOD ) , Rick has no way of knowing that Shell ’s parent company , N.V. Koninklijke Nederlansche , was the 31st - largest defense contractor in 2006 , reaping more than $ 1.15 billion dollars in DOD contracts .
Entering the Holland Tunnel on his way to Manhattan , Rick realizes that , with Steven driving next year , he can start taking mass transit to work .
The PATH train into the city  recently restored under the watchful eye of Bechtel , the 15th - largest defense contractor of 2004 and the recipient of more than $ 1.7 billion in DOD contracts that year  will , he believes , lessen his “ footprint ” on the planet .
Keep in mind , Rick is now only a couple of hours into his long day .
In fact , no part of the hours to come will be lacking in products produced by Pentagon contractors  from the framed photographs of Donna and Steven on his desk ( taken by an Olympus camera and printed on Kodak paper ) to the beer he drinks with lunch ( Budweiser ) to most of the products around his office , including : 3M Post - It notes , Microsoft Windows software , Lexmark printers , Canon photocopiers , AT&T telephones , Maxwell House Coffee , Kidde fire extinguishers , Xerox fax machines , IBM servers , paper from International Paper , Duracell batteries , an LG Electronics refrigerator , and paper towels by Marcal Paper Mills .
Rick is , of course , a fiction , but the rest of us are n’t  and neither is the existence of the real Matrix .
In the 1999 sci - fi movie classic of the same name , the Matrix is an artificial reality ( resembling the Western world at the dawn of the 21st century ) created by sentient machines .
Humans , who are grown as energy sources and wired in to the Matrix using cybernetic implants , are kept in a coma - like state  ignorant of the very existence of the artificial reality that they “ live ” in .
In explaining the situation to Neo , the movie ’s protagonist , Morpheus , a leader of a group of unplugged free humans who wage a guerrilla struggle against the machines , reveals :
“ The Matrix is everywhere .
It is all around us .
Even now , in this very room .
You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television .
You can feel it when you go to work , when you go to church , when you pay your taxes .
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth . ”
At one point in his farewell speech , Eisenhower presaged this point , suggesting , “ The total influence  economic , political , even spiritual  [ of the conjunction of the military establishment and the large arms industry ] is felt in every city , every state house , every office of the Federal government . ”
But only Hollywood has yet managed to capture the essence of today ’s omnipresent , all - encompassing , cleverly hidden system of systems that invades all our lives ; this new military - industrial - technological - entertainment - academic - scientific - media - intelligence - homeland security - surveillance - national security - corporate complex that has truly taken hold of America .

An astronomer , activist , and novelist , Carl Sagan did n't hesitate to share his views on the world , notably giving several quotes on the topic of religion .
The famous scientist was born Nov. 9 , 1934 , into a family of Reform Jews .
His father , Samuel Sagan , reportedly was n't very religious , but his mother , Rachel Gruber , actively practiced her faith .
Although Sagan credited both of his parents with shaping him into a scientist - he became enamored with the universe as a child - he admitted they knew nothing about science .
As a small child , he began to take trips alone to the library to learn about the stars because no one could explain their function to him .
He likened reading about the stars to a " religious experience . "
It was an apt description given that Sagan rejected traditional religion in favor of science .
Sagan may have been atheist , but that did n't stop him from speaking extensively on religion .
The quotes that follow reveal his thoughts on God , faith and more .
On Faith
Sagan suggested that people believed in God to rekindle the wonder of childhood and because it 's nice to believe someone is looking out for humanity .
He was n't among such individuals .
Faith is clearly not enough for many people .
They crave hard evidence , scientific proof .
They long for the scientific seal of approval , but are unwilling to put up with the rigorous standards of evidence that impart credibility to that seal .
You can't convince a believer of anything ; for their belief is not based on evidence , it 's based on a deep seated need to believe .
[ Dr. Arroway in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ]
My faith is strong I do n't need proofs , but every time a new fact comes along it simply confirms my faith .
[ Palmer Joss in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ) , p. 172 . ]
Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe , and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy .
The Rigidity of Religion
Religion has remained rigid , even in the face of evidence that has proven it wrong , Sagan believed .
According to him :
In science it often happens that scientists say , ' You know that 's a really good argument ; my position is mistaken , ' and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again .
They really do it .
It does n't happen as often as it should , because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful .
But it happens every day .
I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion .
[ Carl Sagan , 1987 CSICOP keynote address ]
The major religions on the Earth contradict each other left and right .
You can't all be correct .
And what if all of you are wrong ?
It 's a possibility , you know .
You must care about the truth , right ?
Well , the way to winnow through all the differing contentions is to be skeptical .
I 'm not any more skeptical about your religious beliefs than I am about every new scientific idea I hear about .
But in my line of work , they 're called hypotheses , not inspiration and not revelation .
[ Dr. Arroway in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ) , p. 162 . ]
At the extremes it is difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from rigid , doctrinaire religion .
[ Carl Sagan , On God
Sagan rejected the idea of God and perceptions of such a being in society .
He said :
The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous .
But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe , then clearly there is such a God .
This God is emotionally unsatisfying ... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity .
In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing .
But this is mere temporizing .
If we wish courageously to pursue the question , we must , of course ask next where God comes from ?
And if we decide this to be unanswerable , why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed ?
[ Carl Sagan , Cosmos , p. 257 ]
Anything you do n't understand , Mr. Rankin , you attribute to God .
God for you is where you sweep away all the mysteries of the world , all the challenges to our intelligence .
You simply turn your mind off and say God did it .
[ Dr. Arroway in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ) , p. 166 . ]
Many statements about God are confidently made by theologians on grounds that today at least sound specious .
Thomas Aquinas claimed to prove that God cannot make another God , or commit suicide , or make a man without a soul , or even make a triangle whose interior angles do not equal 180 degrees .
But Bolyai and Lobachevsky were able to accomplish this last feat ( on a curved surface ) in the 19th century , and they were not even approximately gods .
[ Carl Sagan , Scripture
The Bible and other ancient texts did not represent God well , Sagan believed .
He said :
What I 'm saying is , if God wanted to send us a message , and ancient writings were the only way he could think of doing it , he could have done a better job .
[ Dr. Arroway in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ) , p. 164 . ]
You see , the religious people -- most of them -- really think this planet is an experiment .
That 's what their beliefs come down to .
Some god or other is always fixing and poking , messing around with tradesmen 's wives , giving tablets on mountains , commanding you to mutilate your children , telling people what words they can say and what words they can't say , making people feel guilty about enjoying themselves , and like that .
Why can't the gods leave well enough alone ?
All this intervention speaks of incompetence .
If God did n't want Lot 's wife to look back , why did n't he make her obedient , so she 'd do what her husband told her ?
Or if he had n't made Lot such a s-- thead , maybe she would 've listened to him more .
If God is omnipotent and omniscient , why did n't he start the universe out in the first place so it would come out the way he wants ?
Why 's he constantly repairing and complaining ?
No , there 's one thing the Bible makes clear :
The biblical God is a sloppy manufacturer .
He 's not good at design ; he 's not good at execution .
He'd be out of business if there was any competition .
[ Sol Hadden in Carl Sagan 's Contact ( New York : Pocket Books , 1985 ) , p. 285 . ]
Afterlife
Although the idea of an afterlife appealed to Sagan , he ultimately rejected the possibility of one .
He said :
I would love to believe that when I die I will live again , that some thinking , feeling , remembering part of me will continue .
But much as I want to believe that , and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife , I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking .
The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth , that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there 's little good evidence .
Far better it seems to me , in our vulnerability , is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides .
[ Carl Sagan , 1996 - " In the Valley of the Shadow , " Parade Magazine .
If some good evidence for life after death were announced , I 'd be eager to examine it ; but it would have to be real scientific data , not mere anecdote .
As with the face on Mars and alien abductions , better the hard truth , I say , than the comforting fantasy .
[ Carl Sagan , Reason and Religion
Sagan spoke at length about reason and religion .
He believed in the former but not in the latter .
Here 's what he had to say :
One prominent
In a democracy , opinions that upset everyone are sometimes exactly what we need .
We should be teaching our children the scientific method and the Bill of Rights .
[ Carl Sagan & Ann Druyan ]
Think of how many religions attempt to validate themselves with prophecy .
Think of how many people rely on these prophecies , however vague , however unfulfilled , to support or prop up their beliefs .
Yet has there ever been a religion with the prophetic accuracy and reliability of science ?
[ Carl Sagan , ( When asked merely if they accept evolution , 45 percent of Americans say yes .
The figure is 70 percent in China . )
When the movie Jurassic Park was shown in Israel , it was condemned by some Orthodox rabbis because it accepted evolution and because it taught that dinosaurs lived a hundred million years ago -- when , as is plainly stated at every `and every Jewish wedding ceremony , the Univers
Not content with the current ( and already massive ) statutory damages allowed under copyright law , the RIAA is pushing to expand the provision .
The issue is compilations , which now are treated as a single work .
In the RIAA 's perfect world , each copied track would count as a separate act of infringement , meaning that a copying a ten - song CD even one time could end up costing a defendant $ 1.5 million if done willfully .
Sound fair ?
Proportional ?
Necessary ?
Not really , but that does n't mean it wo n't become law .
The change to statutory damages is contained in the PRO - IP
Act that is currently up for consideration in Congress .
We 've reported on the bill before , noting that Google 's top copyright lawyer ( and the man who wrote a seven - volume treatise on the subject of copyright law ) , William Patry , called the bill the most " outrageously gluttonous IP bill ever introduced in the US . "
The industries pushing it ( music , especially ) have an " unslakable lust for more and more rights , longer terms of protection , draconian criminal provisions , and civil damages that bear no resemblance to the damages suffered , " he said .
Public Knowledge head Gigi Sohn testified before Congress last year that statutory damages are already " disproportionate penalties for infringement , " pointing that it hardly seems fair to bill someone like Jammie Thomas more than $ 9,000 per song when each track costs a buck .
Even accounting for a punitive penalty , that seems absurdly high .
Both Patry and Sohn attended a Copyright Office roundtable on statutory damages a few days ago , and Public Knowledge 's staff attorney Sherwin Siy has posted a fascinating writeup of the closed - door session .
The meeting was a small affair , with only 30 or so stakeholders in attendance , and it quickly became clear that even content owners had different takes on the situation .
The Magazine Publishers Association , for instance , argued for maintaining the current law .
If the PRO - IP Act passes , anyone found guilty of copying a magazine could be liable for hundreds of separate acts of infringement ( at the judge 's discretion ) , but magazine accused of copyright violations would face similarly huge penalties .
Patry was n't pleased with the PRO - IP Act , nor was Public Knowledge .
On the other side , the argument seemed to be that people could take advantage of the law to copy " greatest hits " albums or other compilations but be liable for less damages than if they had ripped the songs from ten individual albums .
As Siy points out , no one in the room could offer any actual evidence of such " crafty defendants , " and the change in law would likely do little to change the behavior of file - swappers .
Given the huge amounts already available to copyright holders ( who can always collect actual damages if the statutory damages truly are n't large enough to cover their costs ) , an increase in statutory damages seems only useful when pursuing true " pirates " and large - scale infringers .
Unfortunately , the PRO - IP
Act would would make the damages an option in small - scale file - swapping cases , the kinds of cases that the European Court of Justice does n't seem real worried about .
When it comes to casual , non-commercial users , current awards are high enough already .

The president made the unprecedented gesture of greeting the Pope 's plane Pope Benedict XVI has received an unprecedented presidential greeting from George W Bush after arriving for his first official visit to the US .
Mr Bush and his wife Laura were waiting on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base when the Pontiff 's plane touched down .
During his six - day visit , the head of the Catholic Church will address the UN and lead prayers at Ground Zero .
Before arriving the Pope told reporters on board his plane that he was " deeply ashamed " of sexual abuse by US clergy .
Pope Benedict , who was elected three years ago , vowed to work against a recurrence of the crisis , which tarnished the Church 's reputation , saying " we will absolutely exclude paedophiles from the sacred ministry " .
In recent years , the US Catholic Church , which has around 65 million followers , has paid $ 2bn ( £ 1 bn ) to settle clergy sexual abuse cases .
The BBC's David Willey , who is travelling with the Pope , says that damage limitation over past scandals is not the main purpose of the Pontiff 's first trip to the US though .
Our correspondent says he wants to deliver a message of Christian hope to American Catholics and non-Catholics alike , describing his journey as a pilgrimage to a " great people and a great country " .
Pilgrimage Hundreds of spectators had turned out for Pope Benedict 's arrival at Andrews Air Force Base , near Washington .
The crowds cheered and clapped as he made his way onto the runway to be met by Mr Bush , his wife Laura and daughter Jenna .
On Wednesday , the Pope will pay a formal call upon Mr Bush at the White House .
It is more important to have good priests than many priests
Pope Benedict XVI
Pope 's tour : Reporter 's diary Latinos welcome Pope 's words During the flight from Italy , he said he would talk to Mr Bush about the plight of some Hispanic immigrants in the US , our correspondent says .
The US Church has been changing in recent years with the arrival of millions of new Latino immigrants .
The Pope also paid tribute to the fact that there was no state religion in the US , adding that a secular state where all religions can be welcomed is a positive model from which Europe can learn , our correspondent adds .
During the visit the Pope is due to celebrate two huge Masses at baseball stadiums in Washington and New York , as well as praying at Ground Zero , the New York site where the World Trade Centre was destroyed on 11 September 2001 .
Birthday dinner
Although there have been 24 previous meetings between a sitting US president and a Pope - and Benedict XVI 's predecessor , John Paul II , visited the White House in 1979 - there will be numerous firsts during this visit .

Advertisement A crowd expected to number 10,000 will gather on the White House 's South Lawn on Wednesday to mark his official arrival .
The unprecedented crowd , even larger than the 7,000 who greeted Queen Elizabeth II during a 2007 visit , will hear the anthems of both the US and the Holy See , as well as a 21 - gun salute .
Mr Bush is due to host a lavish dinner in the White House 's East Room to mark Pope Benedict 's 81st birthday on Wednesday .
The meal 's Bavarian - style menu will celebrate the Pope 's German heritage , although the Pontiff himself is unable to attend .
Instead , he is expected to lead US bishops in a prayer service in Washington .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says the theologically conservative Pope may get a warmer reception for his views in the US than in Europe .
Mr Bush is close to the Pontiff in opposing abortion , gay marriage and stem cell research .
But the two differ on issues including the war in Iraq and capital punishment , both of which the Vatican has opposed .
Personal suffering
On board his flight to Washington , the Pope briefed reporters on his handling of the clerical sex - abuse crisis .
The sexual abuse by clergy had been a great suffering for the US Catholic Church and for him personally , he said .
" I am deeply ashamed and will do whatever is possible so that this does not happen in the future , " he said .
" It is more important to have good priests than many priests .
We will do everything possible to heal this wound . "
The Pope has been asked to meet some victims of clerical abuse and their families during his visit but has so far declined to do so .

What are these ?
US Airways pilots voted for change today and have elected the US Airline Pilots Association ( USAPA ) to replace the Airline Pilots Association , Intl . ( ALPA ) , as their new bargaining agent .
The results of the election were announced by The National Mediation Board today at 2:00 PM , EST .
The new union will collectively represent over 5,000 mainline US Airways pilots from the merger of US Airways and America West Airlines .
“ The US Airways pilots have spoken for a change in union representation , ” said USAPA interim President , Captain Stephen Bradford .
“ USAPA is ready on day one to begin a new era for all US Airways pilots , East and West .
We will join the other great independent airline pilot unions on the national front , while our pilots enjoy single carrier union representation , solely focused on our pilots needs and fully accountable only to them . ”
“ In addition to providing quality services to the US Airways pilots , USAPA will approach management in a more businesslike fashion to address the deficiencies of the collective US Airways pilots ’ contracts , both East and West ; contracts which were originally accepted by the pilots during the hardships placed on the airlines during the post 9/11 era , ” said Captain Bradford .
The US Airways pilots are one of the most senior and experienced pilot groups in the United States .
We fly a large fleet of jet aircraft , including the Boeing B-737-300/400 and B -757/767 series , the Airbus A319/320/321 series , and the 266 - seat Airbus A330 .
US Airways pilots fly their passengers safely to more than 180 destinations , including Europe , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean , Hawaii and in the near future , China .
USAPA represents over 5,000 US Airways pilots in seven domiciles across the United States .

Economy Sputters With 0.6 % GDP Growth
Some say current quarter growth will be even lower amid finance , housing crises .
March 27 , 2008  --
The economy nearly sputtered out at the end of the year and is probably faring even worse now amid continuing housing , credit and financial crises .
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product increased at a feeble 0.6 percent annual rate in the October - to - December quarter .
The reading — unchanged from a previous estimate a month ago — provided stark evidence of just how much the economy has weakened .
In the prior quarter , the economy clocked in at a sizzling 4.9 percent growth rate .
The gross domestic product ( GDP ) measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States and is the best barometer of the country 's economic health .
Many economists say they believe growth in the current January - to - March quarter will be even weaker than the 0.6 percent figure of the previous quarter .
A growing number also say the economy may actually be shrinking now .
Under one rough rule , the economy needs to contract for six straight months to be considered in a recession .
The government will release its estimate for first - quarter GDP in late April .
" The economy just kept its head above water " in the fourth quarter , said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at Global Insight .
" We think that GDP will decline , albeit slightly , during the first half of 2008 , " he said .
" The first half outlook is bleak . "
On Wall Street , stock were down in morning trading .
In another report , fewer people signed up for unemployment benefits last week , although that did n't change the broader picture of a deteriorating jobs market .
The Labor Department said jobless claims fell by 9,000 to 366,000 , a better showing than many economists were forecasting .
Still , unemployment is expected to rise this year given all the problems clobbering the economy .
The newly released fourth - quarter GDP figure matched analysts ' expectations .
Thursday 's report underscored the damage to the economy from the collapse in the housing market , which has dragged down housing prices , pushed home foreclosures up to record highs and has led to a glut of unsold homes .
Against that backdrop , builders slashed spending on housing projects by a whopping 25.2 percent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter , the biggest cut in 26 years .
To limit the damage from the crises , the Federal Reserve has taken a number of extraordinary actions .
It has slashed a key interest rate over the last two months by the most in a quarter century .
And to relieve turmoil on Wall Street , which intensified after the crash of the country 's fifth - largest investment firm , Bear Stearns , the Fed has resorted to its greatest expansion of lending authority since the 1930s .
Big securities firms will temporarily be allowed to go to the Fed directly for loans — a privilege that had been afforded only to commercial banks .
With the nation 's economic woes a top concern for voters , the White House and Democrats in Congress have been scrambling to provide relief .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Thursday called for an overhaul of financial regulations .
Consumers , whose spending is indispensable to the economy 's vitality , boosted buying at a 2.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter .
That was better than the 1.9 percent growth rate previously estimated but still marked a slowing from the third quarter 's 2.8 percent pace .
Businesses — nervous about customers ' waning appetite to buy given all the problems in the economy — cut back sharply on their inventories of unsold goods .
That shaved 1.79 percentage points off fourth - quarter GDP , the most in more than two years .
Spending by businesses on equipment and software , meanwhile , rose at a pace of 3.1 percent in the final quarter of last year .
That was slightly less than previously estimated and marked a slowdown from the prior quarter 's 6.2 percent growth rate .
Businesses ' profits also took a hit in the final quarter .
A measure linked to the GDP report showed that after - tax profits fell 3.3 percent at the end of last year , after being flat in the prior quarter .
There was a bright spot in the mostly gloomy report , however .
Sales of U.S. goods and services to other countries grew at a 6.5 percent pace .
That was better than the 4.8 percent growth rate previously estimated , although it was down sharply from the prior quarter 's blistering 19.1 percent growth rate .
U.S. exports have been helped by the sinking value of the U.S. dollar , which makes U.S. goods less expensive to foreign buyers .
The U.S. dollar recently plunged to record lows against the euro and has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen .
The drooping dollar can aggravate inflation pressures .
An inflation measure linked to the GDP report showed that overall prices increased at a rate of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter .
That was not as high as previously estimated but marked a big pickup from the third quarter 's 1.8 percent pace .
Another gauge showed that " core " prices — excluding food and energy — grew at a rate of 2.5 percent at the end of last year .
That was down from a previous estimate of a 2.7 percent pace but was up from the prior quarter 's 2 percent growth rate .
The new core inflation figure is above the Fed 's comfort zone — the upper bound of which is a 2 percent inflation rate .
Although the Fed's No. 1 job is trying to save the economy from a deep and prolonged recession , it is also keeping close tabs on inflation and soaring energy prices .
Oil prices are topping $ 105 a barrel .
Gasoline prices have marched higher , too .
High energy prices can spread inflation if lots of companies boost prices charged to customers for a wide range of goods and services .
High energy prices also can be a drag on overall economic growth by crimping consumer spending .
The combination of slowing economic growth and rising inflation make the Fed 's job more difficult .
It also has raised fears the country may be headed for a bout of stagflation , a scenario the U.S. has n't experienced since the 1970s .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , however , has said that 's not the case .
The Fed 's rate reductions along with the government 's $ 168 billion stimulus package of tax rebates for people and tax breaks for businesses should help revive economic growth in the second half of this year , economists said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N on Thursday posted a quarterly loss of $ 2 billion and said it planned to cut 2,900 jobs after recording more than $ 9.5 billion in write - downs and losses on subprime mortgages and other risky assets .
The results were worse than analysts ’ gloomy expectations , and shares of the world ’s largest brokerage fell more than 2 percent in premarket trading .
Chief Executive John
Thain is trying to turn the company around as it struggles with the aftermath of bad bets on subprime mortgages and repackaged debt .
He is increasing the investment bank ’s business in emerging markets and cutting costs to help offset write - downs .
Merrill Lynch reported losses , write - downs and reserve increases of $ 1.5 billion on collateralized debt obligations , $ 925 million on loans financing leveraged buyouts , $ 3.5 billion on an investment portfolio , more than $ 800 million on residential mortgages , and $ 3 billion for exposure to bond insurers .
Merrill Lynch ’s first - quarter net loss was $ 1.96 billion , compared with a year - earlier profit of $ 2.16 billion .
Including preferred stock dividends , the loss was $ 2.14 billion , or $ 2.19 per share , and compared with a profit of $ 2.11 billion , or $ 2.26 a share , a year earlier .
The loss from continuing operations was $ 2.20 per share , wider than the analysts ’ average forecast of $ 1.96 , according to Reuters Estimates .
Net revenue declined 69 percent to $ 2.93 billion .
Analysts expected $ 3.35 billion .
Thain said that despite the loss , Merrill Lynch remained “ well - capitalized . ”
The company had already recorded more than $ 24 billion of write - downs in prior quarters , spurring it to raise more than $ 12 billion of new capital .
Thain said this month that he did not expect to raise more capital in the foreseeable future .
A $ 2.1 billion benefit from widening credit spreads partly offset the write - downs and losses on risky assets .
Merrill Lynch shares were down 2.2 percent at $ 43.91 in trading before the market opened .
At Wednesday 's close , Merrill Lynch 's shares had fallen 16.4 percent year to date , compared with a roughly 25 percent decline in the Amex securities broker - dealer index .XBD .
The frogfish is an unusual creature because of the way it catches its food .
Long threads that look like fishing lines grow out of the frogfish ’s head .
At the end of these threads are barbs , resembling the notched ends of a fishing hook .
As the frogfish waits for its prey , it lets these threads float in the water .
Smaller fish , thinking these threads are worms , take a nibble .
But that nibble hooks them on the barb and they are immediately eaten by the “ fisherman . ”
Jerry Seinfeld Flips 1967 Fiat BTM and Walks Away ( Photos )
flipped his vintage 1967 Fiat BTM Saturday night while driving in East Hampton , NY .
The accident occurred around 7:40 pm after the brakes failed .
The comedian unsuccessfully tried using the emergency brake and cut the wheel to the right to avoid heading into traffic , causing the car to roll , stopping just short of the intersection .
Fortunately , the comedian walked away unharmed .
According to Jerry 's wife , Jessica :
" He was a little shocked when he walked in and it started to dawn on him what happened , " she said .
" I was extremely relieved and grateful and I 'm feeling very lucky that nothing happened . "
" It could have been a lot worse , obviously , and thank God it was n't .
He 's fine , " she said .
Seinfeld is an avid car collector and is reported to own 47 Porsches .
Now that we know Jerry is okay , the real mystery of this story is not how he walked away from the accident unscathed , but what is a 1967 Fiat BTM ?
It is apparently a hard top version of the Fiat Dino , pictured below .
Nairobi , Kenya
WHEN you find yourself at a wedding discussing how more than 800 people have been killed and more than 250,000 kicked out of their homes for having certain ethnic origins , you know there is something terribly wrong with your country .
Living in Nairobi the past few months has been like living in a relatively comfortable glass cave in the middle of hell .
What began in late December as protests against election irregularities has spiraled into killings based on which tribe your identity card and speech indicate you belong to .
English and Swahili , the languages that were supposed to unite us , have now been rendered useless .
In these times , when belonging or not belonging to a particular tribe can be the difference between not being dead or being seriously dead , what chance does a person like me have ?
I was born to a Luhya father and a Taita mother , but I speak the Kikuyu language of Kiambu , where I was raised .
The politicians no longer have the ability to stop the violence , despite their posturing that they could do so at the snap of their fingers .
We see Kofi Annan , the former secretary general of the United Nations , posing with the rival contenders , President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga , in photo sessions where the two antagonists shake hands and smile and call for peace .
But the political rhetoric seems a joke ; we know that revenge and counter - revenge are what the various ethnic groups really seek  to “ do to what they did to our tribe mates . ”
Daily life is a constant kaleidoscope of languages for those of us who are of mixed ethnic heritage .
We must gauge what sort of street or village we are in and , like a chameleon , speak the “ correct ” tongue .
Will computers think for themselves ?
Will humans be able to reprogram our own biology , making us “ super human ” ?
Will our kids be born into a world where every item is “ smart ” .
Michio Kaku , another one of my favorite modern philosophers and Great Minds tackles these questions in “ Visions of the Future : The Intelligence Revolution “
This video does a great job illustrating the vast changes underway on our world .
By 2020 a microchip with the computing power of a modern cellphone will cost about $ .01 .
As this draws nearer , chips will begin to be embedded in everything truly leading to the “ ubiquity era ” with thousands of computers per user .
Humans will then ( if not already ) begin hard - wiring our minds with more processing power and altering our DNA to dramatic results .
Humans may no longer be Homo Sapien and may self selectively evolve into Cyber Sapiens .
THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR !
Question of the Day :
Do you think humans will achieve this great change in our very essence ?
You can usually tell when a company thinks one version of the game they 've worked on is better than the other ; just look at what copy of the game you 're given to review .
In many cases , you 'll be given the 360 version only , and that 's usually a tip - off that some corners were cut while making the game run on the PlayStation 3 .
I 'm happy to report that when I opened my Dark Sector package , a copy of the game for both the PS3 and 360 came out .
At GDC , we spoke to members of the development team at Digital Extremes , and they seemed proud , if not a little surprised , that they were able to get the PS3 version looking as good the Xbox 360 title .
They also stressed that this was mostly because of having more time to work on the 360 version , but it does n't matter .
After playing around with both versions of the game , I can say with some certainty that they 're both very strong graphically ; you 're not missing out on anything by picking it up for one system or the other .
There are a few differences , though .
The game features a glaive as its main weapon — a sort of over - sized throwing star with a few interesting properties — and during the game you can control it in - flight .
On the 360 , this is done with the right analog stick , but on the PS3 , it 's done using the Sixaxis motion - control .
The 360 features rumble right now , while you 'll have to wait for the Dual Shock 3 on the PS3 to experience it .
The multiplayer also has a few different differentiating features , as " only the X360 gives players a Quick game option , a Custom game option , and a Ranked game option .
The Quick game option will pick a game for the player based on their preference of Infection or Epidemic .
The Custom game option allows players to set up their own games with the customizable settings of time limit , score limit , number of players , and the availability of bots .
Ranked games are directly linked to the X360 Leaderboard ...
The PS3 allows players to search for or create multiplayer games . "
Having Quick and Ranked game options are nice , but their non-existence certainly is n't a deal - breaker .
So there you have it .
This is a great - looking and - playing game across both platforms , and the forums can thankfully take the fanboy angst to other titles .
We 'll have our full review of Dark Sector in the coming days .
I was just on Radio 4 ’s PM program talking about the acupuncture study that ’s in the news today , you can listen to it here ( 37 minutes in to the programme ) :
www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/pm/
Here are some references and background bits and bobs .
The paper itself was very interesting .
It took 1200 people , with an average of 8 years back pain each : we can assume not been helped by biomedical treatments .
They were split into three groups : one group had medical treatment ; one group had proper , real , bells and whistles , needles in the “ meridiens ” acupuncture ; and one group were treated with pretend acupuncture .
The results were fascinating : they set a threshold for “ improved ” ( which was either a 33 % improvement in 3 aspects of one score , or 12 % improvement on another measuring scale ) .
They found that people having acupuncture were almost twice as likely to reach this level of improvement in back pain as people on medical treatment ( which had already let them down for 8 years of course ) .
But even more interestingly , the pretend acupuncture group , where they just bunged needles in any old place with a bit of ceremony , did just as well as the people having proper , posh , theatrical , genuine acupuncture .
The press release is here , and the full academic paper is here :

I ’ll try tomorrow to encourage them to make it free as always .
[ edit 26/9/07 : the American Medical Association have basically said no I think . ]
I ’ve written about the placebo before , how it about much more than a pill , but is about the cultural meaning of a treatment , our expectations , and more .
It ’s worth seeing these fascinating acupuncture results in that context :
www.badscience.net/?cat=41
Here ’s what I wrote just last week on the subject :
There ’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of giving out sugar pills .
The placebo effect can be very powerful , because it ’s not just about the pill , it ’s about the cultural meaning of the treatment : so we know from research that four placebo sugar pills a day are more effective than two for eradicating gastric ulcers ( and that ’s not subjective , you measure ulcers by putting a camera into your stomach ) ; we know that salt water injections are a more effective treatment for pain than sugar pills , not because salt water injections are medically active , but because injections are a more dramatic intervention ; we know that green sugar pills are a more effective anxiety treatment than red ones , not because of any biomechanical effect of the dyes , but because of the cultural meanings of the colours green and red .
We even know that packaging can be beneficial .
It ’s also really worth checking out this fascinating paper , comparing two different placeboes : a placebo pill , up against an elaborate placebo ritual involving a medical device ( it was modelled on acupuncture ) .
They found that the more elaborate placebo ritual was more effective than the tablet .
www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7538/391
More even than that , I think back pain is incredibly interesting : in 90 % no cause is found , and we know that things like psychosocial stressors , work problems , bed rest and depressive symptoms are significant risk factors for moving from a twinge to chronic enduring pain .
There is no doubt that eg brief educational interventions ( do n’t avoid exercise , do avoid rest , do avoid specific exercises ) are helpful .
Back pain is clearly a problem which requires more than simply pharmaceutical pills .
The question is whether an elaborate , expensive , gimmicky and theatrical placebo ritual is an effective use of money , or whether other , cheaper , more pragmatic , honest psychosocial interventions might be more appropriate and cost effective .
Here is an excellent review of causes and treatments for back pain , setting out the clear evidence for keeping active , avoiding rest , and the role of psychosocial factors in the move from acute to chronic .
I ’ve pulled out some key quotes for people with lazy clicking fingers .

What are the most important prognostic indicators for chronicity ?
Early identification of patients with low back pain at risk for long term disability and sick leave is theoretically and practically important because early and specific interventions may be developed and used in this subgroup of patients .
This is of special importance because recovery for people who develop chronic low back pain and disability is increasingly less likely the longer the problems persist .
The transition from acute to chronic low back pain seems complicated , and many individual , psychosocial , and workplace associated factors may play a part .
In this respect , increasing evidence indicates the importance of psychosocial factors .w7
A recently published systematic review of prospective cohort studies found that distress , depressive mood , and somatisation are associated with an increased risk of chronic low back pain .
13 Table 1 shows a list of individual , psychosocial , and occupational factors , which have been identified as risk factors either for the occurrence of low back pain or for the development of chronicity .
“ Yellow flags ” have been developed for the identification of patients at risk of chronic pain and disability .
A screening instrument based on these yellow flags has been validated for use in clinical practice .
14
The predictive value of the yellow flags and the screening instrument need to be further evaluated in clinical practice and research .
How effective are treatments in acute low back pain ?
The evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs relieve pain better than placebo is strong .
Advice to stay active speeds up recovery and reduces chronic disability .
Muscle relaxants relieve pain more than placebo , strong evidence also shows , but side effects such as drowsiness may occur .
Conversely , strong evidence shows that bed rest and specific back exercises ( strengthening , flexibility , stretching , flexion , and extension exercises ) are not effective .
These interventions mentioned were equally as effective as a variety of placebo , sham , or as no treatment at all .
Moderate evidence shows that spinal manipulation , behavioural treatment , and multidisciplinary treatment ( for subacute low back pain ) are effective for pain relief .
Finally , no evidence shows that other interventions ( for example , lumbar supports , traction , massage , or acupuncture ) are effective for acute low back pain .

Some Consequences of Four Incapacities Charles S. Peirce Journal of Speculative Philosophy ( 1868 ) 2 , 140-157 .
Descartes is the father of modern philosophy , and the spirit of Cartesianism -- that which principally distinguishes it from the scholasticism which it displaced -- may be compendiously stated as follows :
1 . It teaches that philosophy must begin with universal doubt ; whereas scholasticism had never questioned fundamentals .
2 . It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is to be found in the individual consciousness ; whereas scholasticism had rested on the testimony of sages and of the Catholic Church .
3 . The multiform argumentation of the middle ages is replaced by a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses .
4. Scholasticism had its mysteries of faith , but undertook to explain all created things .
But there are many facts which Cartesianism not only does not explain but renders absolutely inexplicable , unless to say that " God makes them so " is to be regarded as an explanation .
In some , or all of these respects , most modern philosophers have been , in effect , Cartesians .
Now without wishing to return to scholasticism , it seems to me that modern science and modern logic require us to stand upon a very different platform from this .
1 . We cannot begin with complete doubt .
We must begin with all the prejudices which we actually have when we enter upon the study of philosophy .
These prejudices are not to be dispelled by a maxim , for they are things which it does not occur to us can be questioned .
Hence this initial skepticism will be a mere self - deception , and not real doubt ; and no one who follows the Cartesian method will ever be satisfied until he has formally recovered all those beliefs which in form he has given up .
It is , therefore , as useless a preliminary as going to the North Pole would be in order to get to Constantinople by coming down regularly upon a meridian .
A person may , it is true , in the course of his studies , find reason to doubt what he began by believing ; but in that case he doubts because he has a positive reason for it , and not on account of the Cartesian maxim .
Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts .
2 . The same formalism appears in the Cartesian criterion , which amounts to this : " Whatever I am clearly convinced of , is true . "
If I were really convinced , I should have done with reasoning and should require no test of certainty .
But thus to make single individuals absolute judges of truth is most pernicious .
The result is that metaphysicians will all agree that metaphysics has reached a pitch of certainty far beyond that of the physical sciences ; -- only they can agree upon nothing else .
In sciences in which men come to agreement , when a theory has been broached it is considered to be on probation until this agreement is reached .
After it is reached , the question of certainty becomes an idle one , because there is no one left who doubts it .
We individually cannot reasonably hope to attain the ultimate philosophy which we pursue ; we can only seek it , therefore , for the community of philosophers .
Hence , if disciplined and candid minds carefully examine a theory and refuse to accept it , this ought to create doubts in the mind of the author of the theory himself .
3 . Philosophy ought to imitate the successful sciences in its methods , so far as to proceed only from tangible premisses which can be subjected to careful scrutiny , and to trust rather to the multitude and variety of its arguments than to the conclusiveness of any one .
Its reasoning should not form a chain which is no stronger than its weakest link , but a cable whose fibers may be ever so slender , provided they are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected .
4 . Every unidealistic philosophy supposes some absolutely inexplicable , unanalyzable ultimate ; in short , something resulting from mediation itself not susceptible of mediation .
Now that anything is thus inexplicable can only be known by reasoning from signs .
But the only justification of an inference from signs is that the conclusion explains the fact .
To suppose the fact absolutely inexplicable , is not to explain it , and hence this supposition is never allowable .
In the last number of this journal will be found a piece entitled " Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man , " which has been written in this spirit of opposition to Cartesianism .
That criticism of certain faculties resulted in four denials , which for convenience may here be repeated :
1 . We have no power of Introspection , but all knowledge of the internal world is derived by hypothetical reasoning from our knowledge of external facts .
2 . We have no power of Intuition , but every cognition is determined logically by previous cognitions .
3 . We have no power of thinking without signs .
4 . We have no conception of the absolutely incognizable .
These propositions cannot be regarded as certain ; and , in order to bring them to a further test , it is now proposed to trace them out to their consequences .
We may first consider the first alone ; then trace the consequences of the first and second ; then see what else will result from assuming the third also ; and , finally , add the fourth to our hypothetical premisses .
In accepting the first proposition , we must put aside all prejudices derived from a philosophy which bases our knowledge of the external world on our self - consciousness .
We can admit no statement concerning what passes within us except as a hypothesis necessary to explain what takes place in what we commonly call the external world .
Moreover when we have upon such grounds assumed one faculty or mode of action of the mind , we cannot , of course , adopt any other hypothesis for the purpose of explaining any fact which can be explained by our first supposition , but must carry the latter as far as it will go .
In other words , we must , as far as we can do so without additional hypotheses , reduce all kinds of mental action to one general type .
The class of modifications of consciousness with which we must commence our inquiry must be one whose existence is indubitable , and whose laws are best known , and , therefore ( since this knowledge comes from the outside ) , which most closely follows external facts ; that is , it must be some kind of cognition .
Here we may hypothetically admit the second proposition of the former paper , according to which there is no absolutely first cognition of any object , but cognition arises by a continuous process .
We must begin , then , with a process of cognition , and with that process whose laws are best understood and most closely follow external facts .
This is no other than the process of valid inference , which proceeds from its premiss , A , to its conclusion , B , only if , as a matter of fact , such a proposition as B is always or usually true when such a proposition as A is true .
It is a consequence , then , of the first two principles whose results we are to trace out , that we must , as far as we can , without any other supposition than that the mind reasons , reduce all mental action to the formula of valid reasoning .
But does the mind in fact go through the syllogistic process ?
It is certainly very doubtful whether a conclusion -- as something existing in the mind independently , like an image -- suddenly displaces two premisses existing in the mind in a similar way .
But it is a matter of constant experience , that if a man is made to believe in the premisses , in the sense that he will act from them and will say that they are true , under favorable conditions he will also be ready to act from the conclusion and to say that that is true .
Something , therefore , takes place within the organism which is equivalent to the syllogistic process .
A valid inference is either complete or incomplete .
An incomplete inference is one whose validity depends upon some matter of fact not contained in the premisses .
This implied fact might have been stated as a premiss , and its relation to the conclusion is the same whether it is explicitly posited or not , since it is at least virtually taken for granted ; so that every valid incomplete argument is virtually complete .
Complete arguments are divided into simple and complex .
A complex argument is one which from three or more premisses concludes what might have been concluded by successive steps in reasonings each of which is simple .
Thus , a complex inference comes to the same thing in the end as a succession of simple inferences .
A complete , simple , and valid argument , or syllogism , is either apodictic or probable .
An apodictic or deductive syllogism is one whose validity depends unconditionally upon the relation of the fact inferred to the facts posited in the premisses .
A syllogism whose validity should depend not merely upon its premisses , but upon the existence of some other knowledge , would be impossible ; for either this other knowledge would be posited , in which case it would be a part of the premisses , or it would be implicitly assumed , in which case the inference would be incomplete .
But a syllogism whose validity depends partly upon the non-existence of some other knowledge , is a probable syllogism .
A few examples will render this plain .
The two following arguments are apodictic or deductive :
1 . No series of days of which the first and last are different days of the week exceeds by one a multiple of seven days ; now the first and last days of any leap - year are different days of the week , and therefore no leap - year consists of a number of days one greater than a multiple of seven .
2 . Among the vowels there are no double letters ; but one of the double letters ( w ) is compounded of two vowels : hence , a letter compounded of two vowels is not necessarily itself a vowel .
In both these cases , it is plain that as long as the premisses are true , however other facts may be , the conclusions will be true .
On the other hand , suppose that we reason as follows : --" A certain man had the Asiatic cholera .
He was in a state of collapse , livid , quite cold , and without perceptible pulse .
He was bled copiously .
During the process he came out of collapse , and the next morning was well enough to be about .
Therefore , bleeding tends to cure the cholera . "
This is a fair probable inference , provided that the premisses represent our whole knowledge of the matter .
But if we knew , for example , that recoveries from cholera were apt to be sudden , and that the physician who had reported this case had known of a hundred other trials of the remedy without communicating the result , then the inference would lose all its validity .
The absence of knowledge which is essential to the validity of any probable argument relates to some question which is determined by the argument itself .
This question , like every other , is whether certain objects have certain characters .
Hence , the absence of knowledge is either whether besides the objects which , according to the premisses , possess certain characters , any other objects possess them ; or , whether besides the characters which , according to the premisses , belong to certain objects , any other characters not necessarily involved in these belong to the same objects .
In the former case , the reasoning proceeds as though all the objects which have certain characters were known , and this is induction ; in the latter case , the inference proceeds as though all the characters requisite to the determination of a certain object or class were known , and this is hypothesis .
This distinction , also , may be made more plain by examples .
Suppose we count the number of occurrences of the different letters in a certain English book , which we may call A .
Of course , every new letter which we add to our count will alter the relative number of occurrences of the different letters ; but as we proceed with our counting , this change will be less and less .
Suppose that we find that as we increase the number of letters counted , the relative number of e's approaches nearly 11 1 / 4 per cent of the whole , that of the t's 8 1 / 2 per cent , that of the a's 8 per cent , that of the s's 7 1/ 2 per cent , etc .
Suppose we repeat the same observations with half a dozen other English writings ( which we may designate as B , C , D , E , F , G ) with the like result .
Then we may infer that in every English writing of some length , the different letters occur with nearly those relative frequencies .
Now this argument depends for its validity upon our not knowing the proportion of letters in any English writing besides A , B , C , D , E , F and G .
For if we know it in respect to H , and it is not nearly the same as in the others , our conclusion is destroyed at once ; if it is the same , then the legitimate inference is from A , B , C , D , E , F , G and H , and not from the first seven alone .
This , therefore , is an induction .
Suppose , next , that a piece of writing in cipher is presented to us , without the key .
Suppose we find that it contains something less than 26 characters , one of which occurs about 11 per cent of all the times , another 8 1 / 2 per cent , another 8 per cent , and another 7 1 / 2 per cent .
Suppose that when we substitute for these e , t , a and s , respectively , we are able to see how single letters may be substituted for each of the other characters so as to make sense in English , provided , however , that we allow the spelling to be wrong in some cases .
If the writing is of any considerable length , we may infer with great probability that this is the meaning of the cipher .
The validity of this argument depends upon there being no other known characters of the writing in cipher which would have any weight in the matter ; for if there are -- if we know , for example , whether or not there is any other solution of it -- this must be allowed its effect in supporting or weakening the conclusion .
This , then , is hypothesis .
All valid reasoning is either deductive , inductive , or hypothetic ; or else it combines two or more of these characters .
Deduction is pretty well treated in most logical textbooks ; but it will be necessary to say a few words about induction and hypothesis in order to render what follows more intelligible .
Induction may be defined as an argument which proceeds upon the assumption that all the members of a class or aggregate have all the characters which are common to all those members of this class concerning which it is known , whether they have these characters or not ; or , in other words , which assumes that that is true of a whole collection which is true of a number of instances taken from it at random .
This might be called statistical argument .
In the long run , it must generally afford pretty correct conclusions from true premisses .
If we have a bag of beans partly black and partly white , by counting the relative proportions of the two colors in several different handfuls , we can approximate more or less to the relative proportions in the whole bag , since a sufficient number of handfuls would constitute all the beans in the bag .
The central characteristic and key to induction is , that by taking the conclusion so reached as major premiss of a syllogism , and the proposition stating that such and such objects are taken from the class in question as the minor premiss , the other premiss of the induction will follow from them deductively .
Thus , in the above example we concluded that all books in English have about 11 1 / 4 per cent of their letters e's .
From that as major premiss , together with the proposition that A , B , C , D , E , F and G are books in English , it follows deductively that A , B , C , D , E , F and G have about 11 1 / 4 per cent of their letters e's .
Accordingly , induction has been defined by Aristotle as the inference of the major premiss of a syllogism from its minor premiss and conclusion .
The function of an induction is to substitute for a series of many subjects , a single one which embraces them and an indefinite number of others .
Thus it is a species of " reduction of the manifold to unity . "
Hypothesis may be defined as an argument which proceeds upon the assumption that a character which is known necessarily to involve a certain number of others , may be probably predicated of any object which has all the characters which this character is known to involve .
Just as induction may be regarded as the inference of the major premiss of a syllogism , so hypothesis may be regarded as the inference of the minor premiss , from the other two propositions .
Thus , the example taken above consists of two such inferences of the minor premisses of the following syllogisms :
1. Every English writing of some length in which such and such characters denote e , t , a , and s , has about 11 1 / 4 per cent of the first sort of marks , 8 1/ 2 of the second , 8 of the third , and 7 1 / 2 of the fourth .
This secret writing is an English writing of some length , in which such and such characters denote e , t , a , and s , respectively :
[ Ergo , ]
This secret writing has about 11 1 / 4 per cent of its characters of the first kind , 8 1 / 2 of the second , 8 of the third , and 7 1 / 2 of the fourth .
2 . A passage written with such an alphabet makes sense when such and such letters are severally substituted for such and such characters .
This secret writing is written with such an alphabet .
[ Ergo , ]
This secret writing makes sense when such and such substitutions are made .
The function of hypothesis is to substitute for a great series of predicates forming no unity in themselves , a single one ( or small number ) which involves them all , together ( perhaps ) with an indefinite number of others .
It is , therefore , also a reduction of a manifold to unity .
Every deductive syllogism may be put into the form
If A , then B ;
But A :
[ Ergo , ] B .
And as the minor premiss in this form appears as antecedent or reason of a hypothetical proposition , hypothetic inference may be called reasoning from consequent to antecedent .
The argument from analogy , which a popular writer upon logic calls reasoning from particulars to particulars , derives its validity from its combining the characters of induction and hypothesis , being analyzable either into a deduction or an induction , or a deduction and a hypothesis .
But though inference is thus of three essentially different species , it also belongs to one genus .
We have seen that no conclusion can be legitimately derived which could not have been reached by successions of arguments having two premisses each , and implying no fact not asserted .
Either of these premisses is a proposition asserting that certain objects have certain characters .
Every term of such a proposition stands either for certain objects or for certain characters .
The conclusion may be regarded as a proposition substituted in place of either premiss , the substitution being justified by the fact stated in the other premiss .
The conclusion is accordingly derived from either premiss by substituting either a new subject for the subject of the premiss , or a new predicate for the predicate of the premiss , or by both substitutions .
Now the substitution of one term for another can be justified only so far as the term substituted represents only what is represented in the term replaced .
If , therefore , the conclusion be denoted by the formula ,
S is P ;
and this conclusion be derived , by a change of subject , from a premiss which may on this account be expressed by the formula ,
M is P ,
then the other premiss must assert that whatever thing is represented by S is represented by M , or that
Every S is an M ;
while , if the conclusion , S is P , is derived from either premiss by a change of predicate , that premiss may be written
S is M ;
and the other premiss must assert that whatever characters are implied in P are implied in M , or that
Whatever is M is P .
In either case , therefore , the syllogism must be capable of expression in the form ,
S is M ; M is P :
[ Ergo , ] S is P .
Finally , if the conclusion differs from either of its premisses , both in subject and predicate , the form of statement of conclusion and premiss may be so altered that they shall have a common term .
This can always be done , for if P is the premiss and C the conclusion , they may be stated thus :
The state of things represented in P is real ,
and
The state of things represented in C is real .
In this case the other premiss must in some form virtually assert that every state of things such as is represented by C is the state of things represented in P .
All valid reasoning , therefore , is of one general form ; and in seeking to reduce all mental action to the formulæ of valid inference , we seek to reduce it to one single type .
An apparent obstacle to the reduction of all mental action to the type of valid inferences is the existence of fallacious reasoning .
Every argument implies the truth of a general principle of inferential procedure ( whether involving some matter of fact concerning the subject of argument , or merely a maxim relating to a system of signs ) , according to which it is a valid argument .
If this principle is false , the argument is a fallacy ; but neither a valid argument from false premisses , nor an exceedingly weak , but not altogether illegitimate , induction or hypothesis , however its force may be over - estimated , however false its conclusion , is a fallacy .
Now words , taken just as they stand , if in the form of an argument , thereby do imply whatever fact may be necessary to make the argument conclusive ; so that to the formal logician , who has to do only with the meaning of the words according to the proper principles of interpretation , and not with the intention of the speaker as guessed at from other indications , the only fallacies should be such as are simply absurd and contradictory , either because their conclusions are absolutely inconsistent with their premisses , or because they connect propositions by a species of illative conjunction , by which they cannot under any circumstances be validly connected .
But to the psychologist an argument is valid only if the premisses from which the mental conclusion is derived would be sufficient , if true , to justify it , either by themselves , or by the aid of other propositions which had previously been held for true .
But it is easy to show that all inferences made by man , which are not valid in this sense , belong to four classes , viz . : 1 . Those whose premisses are false ; 2 . Those which have some little force , though only a little ; 3 . Those which result from confusion of one proposition with another ; 4 . Those which result from the indistinct apprehension , wrong application , or falsity , of a rule of inference .
For , if a man were to commit a fallacy not of either of these classes , he would , from true premisses conceived with perfect distinctness , without being led astray by any prejudice or other judgment serving as a rule of inference , draw a conclusion which had really not the least relevancy .
If this could happen , calm consideration and care could be of little use in thinking , for caution only serves to insure our taking all the facts into account , and to make those which we do take account of , distinct ; nor can coolness do anything more than to enable us to be cautious , and also to prevent our being affected by a passion in inferring that to be true which we wish were true , or which we fear may be true , or in following some other wrong rule of inference .
But experience shows that the calm and careful consideration of the same distinctly conceived premisses ( including prejudices ) will insure the pronouncement of the same judgment by all men .
Now if a fallacy belongs to the first of these four classes and its premisses are false , it is to be presumed that the procedure of the mind from these premisses to the conclusion is either correct , or errs in one of the other three ways ; for it cannot be supposed that the mere falsity of the premisses should affect the procedure of reason when that falsity is not known to reason .
If the fallacy belongs to the second class and has some force , however little , it is a legitimate probable argument , and belongs to the type of valid inference .
If it is of the third class and results from the confusion of one proposition with another , this confusion must be owing to a resemblance between the two propositions ; that is to say , the person reasoning , seeing that one proposition has some of the characters which belong to the other , concludes that it has all the essential characters of the other , and is equivalent to it .
Now this is a hypothetic inference , which though it may be weak , and though its conclusion happens to be false , belongs to the type of valid inferences ; and , therefore , as the nodus of the fallacy lies in this confusion , the procedure of the mind in these fallacies of the third class conforms to the formula of valid inference .
If the fallacy belongs to the fourth class , it either results from wrongly applying or misapprehending a rule of inference , and so is a fallacy of confusion , or it results from adopting a wrong rule of inference .
In this latter case , this rule is in fact taken as a premiss , and therefore the false conclusion is owing merely to the falsity of a premiss .
In every fallacy , therefore , possible to the mind of man , the procedure of the mind conforms to the formula of valid inference .
The third principle whose consequences we have to deduce is , that , whenever we think , we have present to the consciousness some feeling , image , conception , or other representation , which serves as a sign .
But it follows from our own existence ( which is proved by the occurrence of ignorance and error ) that everything which is present to us is a phenomenal manifestation of ourselves .
This does not prevent its being a phenomenon of something without us , just as a rainbow is at once a manifestation both of the sun and of the rain .
When we think , then , we ourselves , as we are at that moment , appear as a sign .
Now a sign has , as such , three references : first , it is a sign to some thought which interprets it ; second , it is a sign for some object to which in that thought it is equivalent ; third , it is a sign , in some respect or quality , which brings it into connection with its object .
Let us ask what the three correlates are to which a thought - sign refers .
(1) When we think , to what thought does that thought - sign which is ourself address itself ?
It may , through the medium of outward expression , which it reaches perhaps only after considerable internal development , come to address itself to thought of another person .
But whether this happens or not , it is always interpreted by a subsequent thought of our own .
If , after any thought , the current of ideas flows on freely , it follows the law of mental association .
In that case , each former thought suggests something to the thought which follows it , i.e. , is the sign of something to this latter .
Our train of thought may , it is true , be interrupted .
But we must remember that , in addition to the principal element of thought at any moment , there are a hundred things in our mind to which but a small fraction of attention or consciousness is conceded .
It does not , therefore , follow , because a new constituent of thought gets the uppermost that the train of thought which it displaces is broken off altogether .
On the contrary , from our second principle , that there is no intuition or cognition not determined by previous cognitions , it follows that the striking in of a new experience is never an instantaneous affair , but is an event occupying time , and coming to pass by a continuous process .
Its prominence in consciousness , therefore , must probably be the consummation of a growing process ; and if so , there is no sufficient cause for the thought which had been the leading one just before , to cease abruptly and instantaneously .
But if a train of thought ceases by gradually dying out , it freely follows its own law of association as long as it lasts , and there is no moment at which there is a thought belonging to this series , subsequently to which there is not a thought which interprets or repeats it .
There is no exception , therefore , to the law that every thought - sign is translated or interpreted in a subsequent one , unless it be that all thought comes to an abrupt and final end in death .
(2) The next question is :
For what does the thought - sign stand -- what does it name -- what is its suppositum ?
The outward thing , undoubtedly , when a real outward thing is thought of .
But still , as the thought is determined by a previous thought of the same object , it only refers to the thing through denoting this previous thought .
Let us suppose , for example , that Toussaint is thought of , and first thought of as a Negro , but not distinctly as a man .
If this distinctness is afterwards added , it is through the thought that a Negro is a man ; that is to say , the subsequent thought , man , refers to the outward thing by being predicated of that previous thought , Negro , which has been had of that thing .
If we afterwards think of Toussaint as a general , then we think that this negro , this man , was a general .
And so in every case the subsequent thought denotes what was thought in the previous thought .
(3) The thought - sign stands for its object in the respect which is thought ; that is to say , this respect is the immediate object of consciousness in the thought , or , in other words , it is the thought itself , or at least what the thought is thought to be in the subsequent thought to which it is a sign .
We must now consider two other properties of signs which are of great importance in the theory of cognition .
Since a sign is not identical with the thing signified , but differs from the latter in some respects , it must plainly have some characters which belong to it in itself , and have nothing to do with its representative function .
These I call the material qualities of the sign .
As examples of such qualities , take in the word " man , " its consisting of three letters -- in a picture , its being flat and without relief .
In the second place , a sign must be capable of being connected ( not in the reason but really ) with another sign of the same object , or with the object itself .
Thus , words would be of no value at all unless they could be connected into sentences by means of a real copula which joins signs of the same thing .
The usefulness of some signs -- as a weathercock , a tally , &c. -- consists wholly in their being really connected with the very things they signify .
In the case of a picture such a connection is not evident , but it exists in the power of association which connects the picture with the brain - sign which labels it .
This real , physical connection of a sign with its object , either immediately or by its connection with another sign , I call the pure demonstrative application of the sign .
Now the representative function of a sign lies neither in its material quality nor in its pure demonstrative application ; because it is something which the sign is , not in itself or in a real relation to its object , but which it is to a thought , while both of the characters just defined belong to the sign independently of its addressing any thought .
And yet if I take all the things which have certain qualities and physically connect them with another series of things , each to each , they become fit to be signs .
If they are not regarded as such they are not actually signs , but they are so in the same sense , for example , in which an unseen flower can be said to be red , this being also a term relative to a mental affection .
Consider a state of mind which is a conception .
It is a conception by virtue of having a meaning , a logical comprehension ; and if it is applicable to any object , it is because that object has the characters contained in the comprehension of this conception .
Now the logical comprehension of a thought is usually said to consist of the thoughts contained in it ; but thoughts are events , acts of the mind .
Two thoughts are two events separated in time , and one cannot literally be contained in the other .
It may be said that all thoughts exactly similar are regarded as one ; and that to say that one thought contains another , means that it contains one exactly similar to that other .
But how can two thoughts be similar ?
Two objects can only be regarded as similar if they are compared and brought together in the mind .
Thoughts have no existence except in the mind ; only as they are regarded do they exist .
Hence , two thoughts cannot be similar unless they are brought together in the mind .
But , as to their existence , two thoughts are separated by an interval of time .
We are too apt to imagine that we can frame a thought similar to a past thought , by matching it with the latter , as though this past thought were still present to us .
But it is plain that the knowledge that one thought is similar to or in any way truly representative of another , cannot be derived from immediate perception , but must be an hypothesis ( unquestionably fully justifiable by facts ) , and that therefore the formation of such a representing thought must be dependent upon a real effective force behind consciousness , and not merely upon a mental comparison .
What we must mean , therefore , by saying that one concept is contained in another , is that we normally represent one to be in the other ; that is , that we form a particular kind of judgment of which the subject signifies one concept and the predicate the other .
No thought in itself , then , no feeling in itself , contains any others , but is absolutely simple and unanalyzable ; and to say that it is composed of other thoughts and feelings , is like saying that a movement upon a straight line is composed of the two movements of which it is the resultant ; that is to say , it is a metaphor , or fiction , parallel to the truth .
Every thought , however artificial and complex , is , so far as it is immediately present , a mere sensation without parts , and therefore , in itself , without similarity to any other , but incomparable with any other and absolutely sui generis .
Whatever is wholly incomparable with anything else is wholly inexplicable , because explanation consists in bringing things under general laws or under natural classes .
Hence every thought , in so far as it is a feeling of a peculiar sort , is simply an ultimate , inexplicable fact .
Yet this does not conflict with my postulate that that fact should be allowed to stand as inexplicable ; for , on the one hand , we never can think , " This is present to me , " since , before we have time to make the reflection , the sensation is past , and , on the other hand , when once past , we can never bring back the quality of the feeling as it was in and for itself , or know what it was like in itself , or even discover the existence of this quality except by a corollary from our general theory of ourselves , and then not in its idiosyncrasy , but only as something present .
But , as something present , feelings are all alike and require no explanation , since they contain only what is universal .
So that nothing which we can truly predicate of feelings is left inexplicable , but only something which we cannot reflectively know .
So that we do not fall into the contradiction of making the Mediate immediable .
Finally , no present actual thought ( which is a mere feeling ) has any meaning , any intellectual value ; for this lies not in what is actually thought , but in what this thought may be connected with in representation by subsequent thoughts ; so that the meaning of a thought is altogether something virtual .
It may be objected , that if no thought has any meaning , all thought is without meaning .
But this is a fallacy similar to saying , that , if in no one of the successive spaces which a body fills there is room for motion , there is no room for motion throughout the whole .
At no one instant in my state of mind is there cognition or representation , but in the relation of my states of mind at different instants there is .
In short , the Immediate ( and therefore in itself unsusceptible of mediation -- the Unanalyzable , the Inexplicable , the Unintellectual ) runs in a continuous stream through our lives ; it is the sum total of consciousness , whose mediation , which is the continuity of it , is brought about by a real effective force behind consciousness .
Thus , we have in thought three elements : first , the representative function which makes it a representation ; second , the pure denotative application , or real connection , which brings one thought into relation with another ; and third , the material quality , or how it feels , which gives thought its quality .
That a sensation is not necessarily an intuition , or first impression of sense , is very evident in the case of the sense of beauty ; and has been shown , elsewhere , in the case of sound .
When the sensation beautiful is determined by previous cognitions , it always arises as a predicate ; that is , we think that something is beautiful .
Whenever a sensation thus arises in consequence of others , induction shows that those others are more or less complicated .
Thus , the sensation of a particular kind of sound arises in consequence of impressions upon the various nerves of the ear being combined in a particular way , and following one another with a certain rapidity .
A sensation of color depends upon impressions upon the eye following one another in a regular manner , and with a certain rapidity .
The sensation of beauty arises upon a manifold of other impressions .
And this will be found to hold good in all cases .
Secondly , all these sensations are in themselves simple , or more so than the sensations which give rise to them .
Accordingly , a sensation is a simple predicate taken in place of a complex predicate ; in other words , it fulfills the function of an hypothesis .
But the general principle that every thing to which such and such a sensation belongs , has such and such a complicated series of predicates , is not one determined by reason ( as we have seen ) , but is of an arbitrary nature .
Hence , the class of hypothetic inferences which the arising of a sensation resembles , is that of reasoning from definition to definitum , in which the major premiss is of an arbitrary nature .
Only in this mode of reasoning , this premiss is determined by the conventions of language , and expresses the occasion upon which a word is to be used ; and in the formation of a sensation , it is determined by the constitution of our nature , and expresses the occasions upon which sensation , or a natural mental sign , arises .
Thus , the sensation , so far as it represents something , is determined , according to a logical law , by previous cognitions ; that is to say , these cognitions determine that there shall be a sensation .
But so far as the sensation is a mere feeling of a particular sort , it is determined only by an inexplicable , occult power ; and so far , it is not a representation , but only the material quality of a representation .
For just as in reasoning from definition to definitum , it is indifferent to the logician how the defined word shall sound , or how many letters it shall contain , so in the case of this constitutional word , it is not determined by an inward law how it shall feel in itself .
A feeling , therefore , as a feeling , is merely the material quality of a mental sign .
But there is no feeling which is not also a representation , a predicate of something determined logically by the feelings which precede it .
For if there are any such feelings not predicates , they are the emotions .
Now every emotion has a subject .
If a man is angry , he is saying to himself that this or that is vile and outrageous .
If he is in joy , he is saying " this is delicious . "
If he is wondering , he is saying " this is strange . "
In short , whenever a man feels , he is thinking of something .
Even those passions which have no definite object -- as melancholy -- only come to consciousness through tinging the objects of thought .
That which makes us look upon the emotions more as affections of self than other cognitions , is that we have found them more dependent upon our accidental situation at the moment than other cognitions ; but that is only to say that they are cognitions too narrow to be useful .
The emotions , as a little observation will show , arise when our attention is strongly drawn to complex and inconceivable circumstances .
Fear arises when we cannot predict our fate ; joy , in the case of certain indescribable and peculiarly complex sensations .
If there are some indications that something greatly for my interest , and which I have anticipated would happen , may not happen ; and if , after weighing probabilities , and inventing safeguards , and straining for further information , I find myself unable to come to any fixed conclusion in reference to the future , in the place of that intellectual hypothetic inference which I seek , the feeling of anxiety arises .
When something happens for which I cannot account , I wonder .
When I endeavor to realize to myself what I never can do , a pleasure in the future , I hope .
" I do not understand you , " is the phrase of an angry man .
The indescribable , the ineffable , the incomprehensible , commonly excite emotion ; but nothing is so chilling as a scientific explanation .
Thus an emotion is always a simple predicate substituted by an operation of the mind for a highly complicated predicate .
Now if we consider that a very complex predicate demands explanation by means of an hypothesis , that that hypothesis must be a simpler predicate substituted for that complex one ; and that when we have an emotion , an hypothesis , strictly speaking , is hardly possible -- the analogy of the parts played by emotion and hypothesis is very striking .
There is , it is true , this difference between an emotion and an intellectual hypothesis , that we have reason to say in the case of the latter , that to whatever the simple hypothetic predicate can be applied , of that the complex predicate is true ; whereas , in the case of an emotion this is a proposition for which no reason can be given , but which is determined merely by our emotional constitution .
But this corresponds precisely to the difference between hypothesis and reasoning from definition to definitum , and thus it would appear that emotion is nothing but sensation .
There appears to be a difference , however , between emotion and sensation , and I would state it as follows :
There is some reason to think that , corresponding to every feeling within us , some motion takes place in our bodies .
This property of the thought - sign , since it has no rational dependence upon the meaning of the sign , may be compared with what I have called the material quality of the sign ; but it differs from the latter inasmuch as it is not essentially necessary that it should be felt in order that there should be any thought - sign .
In the case of a sensation , the manifold of impressions which precede and determine it are not of a kind , the bodily motion corresponding to which comes from any large ganglion or from the brain , and probably for this reason the sensation produces no great commotion in the bodily organism ; and the sensation itself is not a thought which has a very strong influence upon the current of thought except by virtue of the information it may serve to afford .
An emotion , on the other hand , comes much later in the development of thought -- I mean , further from the first beginning of the cognition of its object -- and the thoughts which determine it already have motions corresponding to them in the brain , or the chief ganglion ; consequently , it produces large movements in the body , and independently of its representative value , strongly affects the current of thought .
The animal motions to which I allude , are , in the first place and obviously , blushing , blenching , staring , smiling , scowling , pouting , laughing , weeping , sobbing , wriggling , flinching , trembling , being petrified , sighing , sniffing , shrugging , groaning , heartsinking , trepidation , swelling of the heart , etc. , etc .
To these may , perhaps , be added , in the second place , other more complicated actions , which nevertheless spring from a direct impulse and not from deliberation .
That which distinguishes both sensations proper and emotions from the feeling of a thought , is that in the case of the two former the material quality is made prominent , because the thought has no relation of reason to the thoughts which determine it , which exists in the last case and detracts from the attention given to the mere feeling .
By there being no relation of reason to the determining thoughts , I mean that there is nothing in the content of the thought which explains why it should arise only on occasion of these determining thoughts .
If there is such a relation of reason , if the thought is essentially limited in its application to these objects , then the thought comprehends a thought other than itself ; in other words , it is then a complex thought .
An incomplex thought can , therefore , be nothing but a sensation or emotion , having no rational character .
This is very different from the ordinary doctrine , according to which the very highest and most metaphysical conceptions are absolutely simple .
I shall be asked how such a conception of a being is to be analyzed , or whether I can ever define one , two , and three , without a diallelon .
Now I shall admit at once that neither of these conceptions can be separated into two others higher than itself ; and in that sense , therefore , I fully admit that certain very metaphysical and eminently intellectual notions are absolutely simple .
But though these concepts cannot be defined by genus and difference , there is another way in which they can be defined .
All determination is by negation ; we can first recognize any character only by putting an object which possesses it into comparison with an object which possesses it not .
A conception , therefore , which was quite universal in every respect would be unrecognizable and impossible .
We do not obtain the conception of Being , in the sense implied in the copula , by observing that all the things which we can think of have something in common , for there is no such thing to be observed .
We get it by reflecting upon signs -- words or thoughts ; we observe that different predicates may be attached to the same subject , and that each makes some conception applicable to the subject ; then we imagine that a subject has something true of it merely because a predicate ( no matter what ) is attached to it -- and that we call Being .
The conception of being is , therefore , a conception about a sign -- a thought , or word ; and since it is not applicable to every sign , it is not primarily universal , although it is so in its mediate application to things .
Being , therefore , may be defined ; it may be defined , for example , as that which is common to the objects included in any class , and to the objects not included in the same class .
But it is nothing new to say that metaphysical conceptions are primarily and at bottom thoughts about words , or thoughts about thoughts ; it is the doctrine both of Aristotle ( whose categories are parts of speech ) and of Kant ( whose categories are the characters of different kinds of propositions ) .
Sensation and the power of abstraction or attention may be regarded as , in one sense , the sole constituents of all thought .
Having considered the former , let us now attempt some analysis of the latter .
By the force of attention , an emphasis is put upon one of the objective elements of consciousness .
This emphasis is , therefore , not itself an object of immediate consciousness ; and in this respect it differs entirely from a feeling .
Therefore , since the emphasis , nevertheless , consists in some effect upon consciousness , and so can exist only so far as it affects our knowledge ; and since an act cannot be supposed to determine that which precedes it in time , this act can consist only in the capacity which the cognition emphasized has for producing an effect upon memory , or otherwise influencing subsequent thought .
This is confirmed by the fact that attention is a matter of continuous quantity ; for continuous quantity , so far as we know it , reduces itself in the last analysis to time .
Accordingly , we find that attention does , in fact , produce a very great effect upon subsequent thought .
In the first place , it strongly affects memory , a thought being remembered for a longer time the greater the attention originally paid to it .
In the second place , the greater the attention , the closer the connection and the more accurate the logical sequence of thought .
In the third place , by attention a thought may be recovered which has been forgotten .
From these facts , we gather that attention is the power by which thought at one time is connected with and made to relate to thought at another time ; or , to apply the conception of thought as a sign , that it is the pure demonstrative application of a thought - sign .
Attention is roused when the same phenomenon presents itself repeatedly on different occasions , or the same predicate in different subjects .
We see that A has a certain character , that B has the same , C has the same ; and this excites our attention , so that we say , " These have this character . "
Thus attention is an act of induction ; but it is an induction which does not increase our knowledge , because our " these " covers nothing but the instances experienced .
It is , in short , an argument from enumeration .
Attention produces effects upon the nervous system .
These effects are habits , or nervous associations .
A habit arises , when , having had the sensation of performing a certain act , m , on several occasions a , b , c , we come to do it upon every occurrence of the general event , l , of which a , b and c are special cases .
That is to say , by the cognition that
Every case of a , b , or c , is a case of m ,
is determined the cognition that
Every case of l is a case of m .
Thus the formation of a habit is an induction , and is therefore necessarily connected with attention or abstraction .
Voluntary actions result from the sensations produced by habits , as instinctive actions result from our original nature .
We have thus seen that every sort of modification of consciousness -- Attention , Sensation , and Understanding -- is an inference .
But the objection may be made that inference deals only with general terms , and that an image , or absolutely singular representation , cannot therefore be inferred .
" Singular " and " individual " are equivocal terms .
A singular may mean that which can be but in one place at one time .
In this sense it is not opposed to general .
The sun is a singular in this sense , but , as is explained in every good treatise on logic , it is a general term .
I may have a very general conception of Hermolaus Barbarus , but still I conceive him only as able to be in one place at one time .
When an image is said to be singular , it is meant that it is absolutely determinate in all respects .
Every possible character , or the negative thereof , must be true of such an image .
In the words of the most eminent expounder of the doctrine , the image of a man " must be either of a white , or a black , or a tawny ; a straight or a crooked ; a tall , or a low , or a middle - sized man . "
It must be of a man with his mouth open or his mouth shut , whose hair is precisely of such and such a shade , and whose figure has precisely such and such proportions .
No statement of Locke has been so scouted by all friends of images as his denial that the " idea " of a triangle must be either of an obtuse - angled , right - angled , or acute - angled triangle .
In fact , the image of a triangle must be of one , each of whose angles is of a certain number of degrees , minutes , and seconds .
This being so , it is apparent that no man has a true image of the road to his office , or of any other real thing .
Indeed he has no image of it at all unless he can not only recognize it , but imagines it ( truly or falsely ) in all its infinite details .
This being the case , it becomes very doubtful whether we ever have any such thing as an image in our imagination .
Please , reader , to look at a bright red book , or other brightly colored object , and then to shut your eyes and say whether you see that color , whether brightly or faintly -- whether , indeed , there is anything like sight there .
Hume and the other followers of Berkeley maintain that there is no difference between the sight and the memory of the red book except in " their different degrees of force and vivacity . "
" The colors which the memory employs , " says Hume , " are faint and dull compared with those in which our original perceptions are clothed . "
If this were a correct statement of the difference , we should remember the book as being less red than it is ; whereas , in fact , we remember the color with very great precision for a few moments ( please to test this point , reader ) , although we do not see anything like it .
We carry away absolutely nothing of the color except the consciousness that we could recognize it .
As a further proof of this , I will request the reader to try a little experiment .
Let him call up , if he can , the image of a horse -- not of one which he has ever seen , but of an imaginary one -- and before reading further let him by contemplation fix the image in his memory . . . .
Has the reader done as requested ?
for I protest that it is not fair play to read further without doing so .
--
Now , the reader can say in general of what color that horse was , whether grey , bay , or black .
But he probably cannot say precisely of what shade it was .
He can not state this as exactly as he could just after having seen such a horse .
But why , if he had an image in his mind which no more had the general color than it had the particular shade , has the latter vanished so instantaneously from his memory while the former still remains ?
It may be replied , that we always forget the details before we do the more general characters ; but that this answer is insufficient is , I think , shown by the extreme disproportion between the length of time that the exact shade of something looked at is remembered as compared with that instantaneous oblivion to the exact shade of the thing imagined , and the but slightly superior vividness of the memory of the thing seen as compared with the memory of the thing imagined .
The nominalists , I suspect , confound together thinking a triangle without thinking that it is either equilateral , isosceles , or scalene , and thinking a triangle without thinking whether it is equilateral , isosceles , or scalene .
It is important to remember that we have no intuitive power of distinguishing between one subjective mode of cognition and another ; and hence often think that something is presented to us as a picture , while it is really constructed from slight data by the understanding .
This is the case with dreams , as is shown by the frequent impossibility of giving an intelligible account of one without adding something which we feel was not in the dream itself .
Many dreams , of which the waking memory makes elaborate and consistent stories , must probably have been in fact mere jumbles of these feelings of the ability to recognize this and that which I have just alluded to .
I will now go so far as to say that we have no images even in actual perception .
It will be sufficient to prove this in the case of vision ; for if no picture is seen when we look at an object , it will not be claimed that hearing , touch , and the other senses , are superior to sight in this respect .
That the picture is not painted on the nerves of the retina is absolutely certain , if , as physiologists inform us , these nerves are needlepoints pointing to the light and at distances considerably greater than the minimum visibile .
The same thing is shown by our not being able to perceive that there is a large blind spot near the middle of the retina .
If , then , we have a picture before us when we see , it is one constructed by the mind at the suggestion of previous sensations .
Supposing these sensations to be signs , the understanding by reasoning from them could attain all the knowledge of outward things which we derive from sight , while the sensations are quite inadequate to forming an image or representation absolutely determinate .
If we have such an image or picture , we must have in our minds a representation of a surface which is only a part of every surface we see , and we must see that each part , however small , has such and such a color .
If we look from some distance at a speckled surface , it seems as if we did not see whether it were speckled or not ; but if we have an image before us , it must appear to us either as speckled , or as not speckled .
Again , the eye by education comes to distinguish minute differences of color ; but if we see only absolutely determinate images , we must , no less before our eyes are trained than afterwards , see each color as particularly such and such a shade .
Thus to suppose that we have an image before us when we see , is not only a hypothesis which explains nothing whatever , but is one which actually creates difficulties which require new hypotheses in order to explain them away .
One of these difficulties arises from the fact that the details are less easily distinguished than , and forgotten before , the general circumstances .
Upon this theory , the general features exist in the details : the details are , in fact , the whole picture .
It seems , then , very strange that that which exists only secondarily in the picture should make more impression than the picture itself .
It is true that in an old painting the details are not easily made out ; but this is because we know that the blackness is the result of time , and is no part of the picture itself .
There is no difficulty in making out the details of the picture as it looks at present ; the only difficulty is in guessing what it used to be .
But if we have a picture on the retina , the minutest details are there as much as , nay , more than , the general outline and significancy of it .
Yet that which must actually be seen , it is extremely difficult to recognize ; while that which is only abstracted from what is seen is very obvious .
But the conclusive argument against our having any images , or absolutely determinate representations in perception , is that in that case we have the materials in each such representation for an infinite amount of conscious cognition , which we yet never become aware of .
Now there is no meaning in saying that we have something in our minds which never has the least effect on what we are conscious of knowing .
The most that can be said is , that when we see we are put in a condition in which we are able to get a very large and perhaps indefinitely great amount of knowledge of the visible qualities of objects .
Moreover , that perceptions are not absolutely determinate and singular is obvious from the fact that each sense is an abstracting mechanism .
Sight by itself informs us only of colors and forms .
No one can pretend that the images of sight are determinate in reference to taste .
They are , therefore , so far general that they are neither sweet nor non-sweet , bitter nor non-bitter , having savor nor insipid .
The next question is whether we have any general conceptions except in judgments .
In perception , where we know a thing as existing , it is plain that there is a judgment that the thing exists , since a mere general concept of a thing is in no case a cognition of it as existing .
It has usually been said , however , that we can call up any concept without making any judgment ; but it seems that in this case we only arbitrarily suppose ourselves to have an experience .
In order to conceive the number 7 , I suppose , that is , I arbitrarily make the hypothesis or judgment , that there are certain points before my eyes , and I judge that these are seven .
This seems to be the most simple and rational view of the matter , and I may add that it is the one which has been adopted by the best logicians .
If this be the case , what goes by the name of the association of images is in reality an association of judgments .
The association of ideas is said to proceed according to three principles -- those of resemblance , of contiguity , and of causality .
But it would be equally true to say that signs denote what they do on the three principles of resemblance , contiguity , and causality .
There can be no question that anything is a sign of whatever is associated with it by resemblance , by contiguity , or by causality : nor can there be any doubt that any sign recalls the thing signified .
So , then , the association of ideas consists in this , that a judgment occasions another judgment , of which it is the sign .
Now this is nothing less nor more than inference .
Everything in which we take the least interest creates in us its own particular emotion , however slight this may be .
This emotion is a sign and a predicate of the thing .
Now , when a thing resembling this thing is presented to us , a similar emotion arises ; hence , we immediately infer that the latter is like the former .
A formal logician of the old school may say , that in logic no term can enter into the conclusion which had not been contained in the premisses , and that therefore the suggestion of something new must be essentially different from inference .
But I reply that that rule of logic applies only to those arguments which are technically called completed .
We can and do reason --
Elias was a man ;
[ Ergo , ] .
He was mortal .
And this argument is just as valid as the full syllogism , although it is so only because the major premiss of the latter happens to be true .
If to pass from the judgment " Elias was a man " to the judgment " Elias was mortal , " without actually saying to one 's self that " All men are mortal , " is not inference , then the term " inference " is used in so restricted a sense that inferences hardly occur outside of a logic - book .
What is here said of association by resemblance is true of all association .
All association is by signs .
Everything has its subjective or emotional qualities , which are attributed either absolutely or relatively , or by conventional imputation to anything which is a sign of it .
And so we reason ,
The sign is such and such ;
[ Ergo , ]
The sign is that thing .
The sign is almost ( is representative of ) that thing .
We come now to the consideration of the last of the four principles whose consequences we were to trace ; namely , that the absolutely incognizable is absolutely inconceivable .
That upon Cartesian principles the very realities of things can never be known in the least , most competent persons must long ago have been convinced .
Hence the breaking forth of idealism , which is essentially anti-Cartesian , in every direction , whether among empiricists ( Berkeley , Hume ) , or among noologists ( Hegel , Fichte ) .
The principle now brought under discussion is directly idealistic ; for , since the meaning of a word is the conception it conveys , the absolutely incognizable has no meaning because no conception attaches to it .
It is , therefore , a meaningless word ; and , consequently , whatever is meant by any term as " the real " is cognizable in some degree , and so is of the nature of a cognition , in the objective sense of that term .
At any moment we are in possession of certain information , that is , of cognitions which have been logically derived by induction and hypothesis from previous cognitions which are less general , less distinct , and of which we have a less lively consciousness .
These in their turn have been derived from others still less general , less distinct , and less vivid ; and so on back to the ideal first , which is quite singular , and quite out of consciousness .
This ideal first is the particular thing - in - itself .
It does not exist as such .
That is , there is no thing which is in - itself in the sense of not being relative to the mind , though things which are relative to the mind doubtless are , apart from that relation .
The cognitions which thus reach us by this infinite series of inductions and hypotheses ( which though infinite a parte ante logice , is yet as one continuous process not without a beginning in time ) are of two kinds , the true and the untrue , or cognitions whose objects are real and those whose objects are unreal .
And what do we mean by the real ?
It is a conception which we must first have had when we discovered that there was an unreal , an illusion ; that is , when we first corrected ourselves .
Now the distinction for which alone this fact logically called , was between an ens relative to private inward determinations , to the negations belonging to idiosyncrasy , and an ens such as would stand in the long run .
The real , then , is that which , sooner or later , information and reasoning would finally result in , and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you .
Thus , the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a COMMUNITY , without definite limits , and capable of a definite increase of knowledge .
And so those two series of cognition -- the real and the unreal -- consist of those which , at a time sufficiently future , the community will always continue to re-affirm ; and of those which , under the same conditions , will ever after be denied .
Now , a proposition whose falsity can never be discovered , and the error of which therefore is absolutely incognizable , contains , upon our principle , absolutely no error .
Consequently , that which is thought in these cognitions is the real , as it really is .
There is nothing , then , to prevent our knowing outward things as they really are , and it is most likely that we do thus know them in numberless cases , although we can never be absolutely certain of doing so in any special case .
But it follows that since no cognition of ours is absolutely determinate , generals must have a real existence .
Now this scholastic realism is usually set down as a belief in metaphysical fictions .
But , in fact , a realist is simply one who knows no more recondite reality than that which is represented in a true representation .
Since , therefore , the word " man " is true of something , that which " man " means is real .
The nominalist must admit that man is truly applicable to something ; but he believes that there is beneath this a thing in itself , an incognizable reality .
His is the metaphysical figment .
Modern nominalists are mostly superficial men , who do not know , as the more thorough Roscellinus and Occam did , that a reality which has no representation is one which has no relation and no quality .
The great argument for nominalism is that there is no man unless there is some particular man .
That , however , does not affect the realism of Scotus ; for although there is no man of whom all further determination can be denied , yet there is a man , abstraction being made of all further determination .
There is a real difference between man irrespective of what the other determinations may be , and man with this or that particular series of determinations , although undoubtedly this difference is only relative to the mind and not in re .
Such is the position of Scotus .
Occam 's great objection is , there can be no real distinction which is not in re , in the thing - in - itself ; but this begs the question for it is itself based only on the notion that reality is something independent of representative relation .
Such being the nature of reality in general , in what does the reality of the mind consist ?
We have seen that the content of consciousness , the entire phenomenal manifestation of mind , is a sign resulting from inference .
Upon our principle , therefore , that the absolutely incognizable does not exist , so that the phenomenal manifestation of a substance is the substance , we must conclude that the mind is a sign developing according to the laws of inference .
What distinguishes a man from a word ?
There is a distinction doubtless .
The material qualities , the forces which constitute the pure denotative application , and the meaning of the human sign , are all exceedingly complicated in comparison with those of the word .
But these differences are only relative .
What other is there ?
It may be said that man is conscious , while a word is not .
But consciousness is a very vague term .
It may mean that emotion which accompanies the reflection that we have animal life .
This is a consciousness which is dimmed when animal life is at its ebb in old age , or sleep , but which is not dimmed when the spiritual life is at its ebb ; which is the more lively the better animal a man is , but which is not so , the better man he is .
We do not attribute this sensation to words , because we have reason to believe that it is dependent upon the possession of an animal body .
But this consciousness , being a mere sensation , is only a part of the material quality of the man-sign .
Again , consciousness is sometimes used to signify the I think , or unity in thought ; but the unity is nothing but consistency , or the recognition of it .
Consistency belongs to every sign , so far as it is a sign ; and therefore every sign , since it signifies primarily that it is a sign , signifies its own consistency .
The man -sign acquires information , and comes to mean more than he did before .
But so do words .
Does not electricity mean more now than it did in the days of Franklin ?
Man makes the word , and the word means nothing which the man has not made it mean , and that only to some man .
But since man can think only by means of words or other external symbols , these might turn round and say : " You mean nothing which we have not taught you , and then only so far as you address some word as the interpretant of your thought . "
In fact , therefore , men and words reciprocally educate each other ; each increase of a man 's information involves and is involved by , a corresponding increase of a word 's information .
Without fatiguing the reader by stretching this parallelism too far , it is sufficient to say that there is no element whatever of man 's consciousness which has not something corresponding to it in the word ; and the reason is obvious .
It is that the word or sign which man uses is the man himself .
For , as the fact that every thought is a sign , taken in conjunction with the fact that life is a train of thought , proves that man is a sign ; so , that every thought is an external sign , proves that man is an external sign .
That is to say , the man and the external sign are identical , in the same sense in which the words homo and man are identical .
Thus my language is the sum total of myself ; for the man is the thought .
It is hard for man to understand this , because he persists in identifying himself with his will , his power over the animal organism , with brute force .
Now the organism is only an instrument of thought .
But the identity of a man consists in the consistency of what he does and thinks , and consistency is the intellectual character of a thing ; that is , is its expressing something .
Finally , as what anything really is , is what it may finally come to be known to be in the ideal state of complete information , so that reality depends on the ultimate decision of the community ; so thought is what it is , only by virtue of its addressing a future thought which is in its value as thought identical with it , though more developed .
In this way , the existence of thought now depends on what is to be hereafter ; so that it has only a potential existence , dependent on the future thought of the community .
The individual man , since his separate existence is manifested only by ignorance and error , so far as he is anything apart from his fellows , and from what he and they are to be , is only a negation .
This is man ,
" . . . proud man ,
Most ignorant of what he 's most assured ,
His glassy essence . "

" The name of hypothesis is more emphatically given to provisory suppositions , which serve to explain the phenomena in so far as observed , but which are only asserted to be true , if ultimately confirmed by a complete induction . " -- Ibid. , p. 364 .
" When a phenomenon is presented which can be explained by no principle afforded through experience , we feel discontented and uneasy ; and there arises an effort to discover some cause which may , at least provisionally , account for the outstanding phenomenon ; and this cause is finally recognized as valid and true , if , through it , the given phenomenon is found to obtain a full and perfect explanation .
The judgment in which a phenomenon is referred to such a problematic cause , is called a Hypothesis . " -- Ibid. , pp. 449 , 450 .

" An hypothesis is any supposition which we make ( either without actual evidence , or on evidence avowedly insufficient ) , in order to endeavor to deduce from it conclusions in accordance with facts which are known to be real ; under the idea that if the conclusions to which the hypothesis leads are known truths , the hypothesis itself either must be , or at least is likely to be true . " -- Logic ( 6th Ed. ) , vol. 2 , p. 8 .
Kant . --
" If all the consequents of a cognition are true , the cognition itself is true .
. . .
It is allowable , therefore , to conclude from consequent to a reason , but without being able to determine this reason .
From the complexus of all consequents alone can we conclude the truth of a determinate reason . . .
The difficulty with this positive and direct mode of inference ( modus ponens ) is that the totality of the consequents cannot be apodeictically recognized , and that we are therefore led by this mode of inference only to a probable and hypothetically true cognition ( Hypotheses ) . " -- Logik by Jäsche ; Werke , Ed. Rosenk . and Sch. , vol. 3 , p. 221 .
" A hypothesis is the judgment of the truth of a reason on account of the sufficiency of the consequents . " -- Ibid. , p. 262 .

3 . Observe that I say in itself .
I am not so wild as to deny that my sensation of red today is like my sensation of red yesterday .
I only say that the similarity can consist only in the physiological force behind consciousness -- which leads me to say , I recognize this feeling the same as the former one , and so does not consist in a community of sensation .

6 . No person whose native tongue is English will need to be informed that contemplation is essentially ( 1 ) protracted , ( 2 ) voluntary , and ( 3 ) an action , and that it is never used for that which is set forth to the mind in this act .
A foreigner can convince himself of this by the proper study of English writers .
Thus , Locke ( Essay concerning Human Understanding , Book II , chap. 19 , § 1 ) says , " If it [ an idea ] be held there [ in view ] long under attentive consideration , ' tis Contemplation " ; and again ( Ibid. , Book II , chap .
10 , § 1 ) " keeping the Idea which is brought into it [ the mind ] for some time actually in view , which is called Contemplation . "
This term is therefore unfitted to translate Anschauung ; for this latter does not imply an act which is necessarily protracted or voluntary , and denotes most usually a mental presentation , sometimes a faculty , less often the reception of an impression in the mind , and seldom , if ever , an action .
To the translation of Anschauung by intuition , there is , at least , no such insufferable objection .
Etymologically , the two words precisely correspond .
The original philosophical meaning of intuition was a cognition of the present manifold in that character ; and it is now commonly used , as a modern writer says , " to include all the products of the perceptive ( external or internal ) and imaginative faculties ; every act of consciousness , in short , of which the immediate object is an individual , thing , act , or state of mind , presented under the condition of distinct existence in space and time . "
Finally , we have the authority of Kant 's own example for translating his Anschauung by Intuitus ; and indeed this is the common usage of Germans writing Latin .
Moreover , intuitiv frequently replaces anschauend or anschaulich .
If this constitutes a misunderstanding of Kant , it is one which is shared by himself and nearly all his countrymen .
