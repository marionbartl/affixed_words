On August 15th , 2008 October 1 , 2008 we will begin phasing out support for Internet Explorer 6 across all 37signals products .
In order to continue using the products without any hiccups , Internet Explorer 6 users should upgrade to a newer browser :
Download Internet Explorer 7
Download Firefox
Download Safari
The Internet Explorer 6 browser was released back in 2001 , and Internet Explorer 7 , the replacement , was released nearly two years ago in 2006 .
Modern web browsers such as IE 7 , Firefox , and Safari provide significantly better online experiences .
Since IE 6 usage has finally dipped below a small minority threshold of our customers , it 's time to finally move beyond IE 6 .
What are the implications of this transition ?
As of August 15th , 2008 October 1 , 2008 , future features and any improvements made to existing features may not work with IE 6 .
If you are using IE 7 , Firefox 2 or 3 , or Safari , you do n't have to do anything — everything will continue as is for you .
However , if you are using IE 6 , and you want to make sure everything works , you will need to upgrade your browser to either IE 7 , Firefox , or Safari .
All of these browsers are free and all of them will deliver a much better overall experience .
The web will be a lot better for you .
Special note for people using Basecamp with clients :
If your clients are using IE 6 ( you 'll want to ask them ) you may want to provide them some assistance in upgrading their browser .
Why are we making this change ?
IE 6 is a last - generation browser .
This means that IE 6 can't provide the same web experience that modern browsers can .
Continued support of IE 6 means that we can't optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps .
Supporting IE 6 means slower progress , less progress , and , in some places , no progress .
We want to make sure the experience is the best it can be for the vast majority of our customers , and continuing to support IE 6 holds us back .
Thanks again
Thanks again for your continued support .
We look forward to dropping the rusty weight of IE 6 and improving the overall customer experience moving forward .
Updated :
We have extended the IE 6 transition from August 15 , 2008 to October 1 , 2008 .
We hope this extension gives you additional time to make the necessary arrangements to upgrade your web browsers .
Government subsidies to airlines
There 's a discussion on Dave Farber 's Interesting - People mailing list about the ways that governments subsidize commercial passenger airlines .
As I 've been writing about for years , airlines whine about " regulations " and " freedom of the skies " , but in fact they receive a wide range of subsidies , tax preferences , and other forms of special treatment from Federal , state , and local governments in the USA .
( The phenomenon is widespread elsewhere in the world , even if the details vary from country to country . )
How ?
Let me count the ways ( in no particular order ) :
Airports and air trafffic control infrastructure are built and operated by tax - exempt government entities ( consider the real estate and other taxes that would be paid by privately owned airports on huge tracts of land in prime urban and suburban locations ) with below - market capital costs ( tax - exempt government bonds ) .
Employee training for pilots , mechanics , etc. is provided by the military at no cost to airlines .
( Ex-military pilots and mechanics may require additional training and certification for specific civilian aircraft types , but they 've already logged thousands of very expensive hours of jet aircraft experience . )
Air traffic control and other services to airlines are provided by the government .
( Airlines will claim that they pay for this in user fees , but that ignores the taxes that would be paid on private ATC infrastructure , and the artificially depressed labor costs :
As government employees , air traffic controllers and many other civil aviation workers are forbidden to strike , enabling the government unilaterally to impose below - market wages . )
Airlines are paid all the time , even when their aircraft are n't being used , for agreeing to make their planes available on demand to the government as part of the Reserve Air Fleet .
But the times when they are needed -- times of war -- are generally times of reduced civilian air travel , when they would otherwise be idle .
And when the " Reserve Air Fleet " is used , airlines are paid market rates for government charters .
Government funding for military aircraft subsidizes production and operation of civilian aircraft : Manufacturers of aircraft and associated equipment pay nothing for knowledge transfers from government - funded military aircraft research and development , prototyping , testing , maintenance experience , etc. to civilian aircraft .
Military aviation provides critical support for economies of scale and continuity of operations for manufacturers of aircraft , support equipment , and related services during cyclical declines in civilian aircraft demand .
Many civilian aircraft types are sold directly to the military , and these sales are often essential to enlarging production runs to the break - even point .
Airlines have a statutory exemption from Federal anti-trust law to allow them to participate in IATA " traffic conferences " to fix standard " industry fares " .
Under the preemption clause of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 , airlines are exempt from state and local truth - in - advertising and other consumer protection laws .
( This would n't matter if the Federal government enforced similar rules , But , as state Attorneys General have pointed out , the Feds allow many practices that enhance airline profits but would be forbidden under state and local fraud laws . )
Airlines based in the USA are protected by Federal law from all foreign competition :
No airline based anywhere else in the world is allowed to carry passengers between points in the USA , and no foreign entity is allowed to own more than 25 % of the voting stock in any airline based in the USA .
This applies even to US colonies :
It 's illegal to buy a through ticket on a foreign airline between Guam and the mainland USA via e.g.
Seoul , Taipei , or Tokyo ( even though travel agents occasionally issue such tickets by mistake ) , no matter how much cheaper that would be than a ticket on Continental Micronesia , the only USA airline with service between those places .
You have to buy 2 separate tickets , and claim and re-check your luggage at the transfer point .
Under " Buy American " rules , all travel funded , even in part , by the US government must be on a US - flag airline , no matter how much more it costs than a foreign - flag competitor .
Where , as is often the case , there is often only one US - flag airline serving a given destination , this gives them a de facto monopoloy on government - funded travel , a large and often high - revenue ( last minute business travel by government contractors , etc. ) portion of the traffic on some routes .
Fuel for international airline flights has been exempted from all taxes and duties by provisions of the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation and many other bilateral and multilateral international aviation treaties to which the USA is party .
If airlines really want to be free of government regulation and oversight , they first should have to agree to give up their government subsidies and special privileges and protections .
The mob account ( the name a tribute to the paper Mob Software : The Erotic Life of Code ) is . a way to enable anonymous push access for your project .
This is largely an experiment and may be scrapped in the future if it will not get widespread use , but we think it 's an interesting try .
The idea is to provide unmoderated side channel for random contributors to work on a project , with similar rationale as e.g.
Wikipedia - that given enough interested people , the quality will grow rapidly and occassional " vandalism " will get fixed quickly .
Of course this may not work nearly as well for software , but here we are , to give it a try .
For Repository Admins
How it works ?
First , you need to add the mob user to the list of users allowed to push in your project .
mob is a keyless , passwordless user that anyone can use to push , without any special setup .
But this does not mean that your project is now in the hands of raging mindless mob !
The mob user has a special restriction : it can push only to an existing mob branch .
This means that the second step you need to take is to create a mob branch in the repository ( e.g. git checkout - b mob && git push origin mob ) .
Then the mob user will be able to push to this and only this branch , and it wo n't be able to push whatsoever until you take the second step .
To sum it up : Anonymous pushes are allowed only to the mob branch and only if you add a mob user and do an initial pushout of the mob branch .
For Users
After cloning the repository , do git checkout mob to move to the mob branch .
Note that you are taking a huge security risk on yourself if you just blindly grab the mob branch and run it on your system .
For Developers
Just commit on the mob branch you 've checked out and git push when the time is ripe .
Have fun and enjoy , you are making the history !
Personal Mob Branches
If the mob user has push permission to a project , but your user does not , then you may push to a personal mob area .
You must Register user in order to use the personal mob area .
This personal mob area is kept under refs / mob / mob.username and refs / mob / mob_username/ and coexists independently with the single global mob branch .
The refs in the personal mob area need not be created first to be used and may also be freely deleted by the user .
Also note that changes to any refs in the personal mob area will not generate any email notifications .
There are two possible ways to use the personal mob area :
A single ref like mob.username or Multiple refs located under mob_username /
As a convenience to personal mob ref users who do not also have general push permission for a project , pushes to refs / heads / mob.username and refs / heads / mob_username / * are automatically mapped to the corresponding refs / mob / mob ... location which makes it somewhat easier to push branches to the personal mob area .
More details and examples may be found below here and here .
In Detail Examples
Pushing to the global mob branch with ssh
Nothing special is needed except to remember to set the mob user name in the push url :
cd /tmp git clone - b mob git://repo.or.cz/mobexample.git cd mobexample git remote set-url -- push origin ssh://mob@repo.or.cz /mobexample.git echo ' It worked ! ' >>
example .
txt git add example .
txt git commit -m ' example commit ' git push origin mob
Note that it ’s not strictly necessary to fetch with the git protocol , the ssh protocol can also be used for fetching .
Pushing to the global mob branch with https
In order to push with https , several things will be needed first :
The mob user certificate
This can be fetched from here and will be assumed to be saved to /tmp/rorcz_mob_user.pem in the push example .
cd /tmp && curl - O https://repo.or.cz/rorcz_mob_user.pem
The mob user private key
This can be fetched from here and will be assumed to be saved to /tmp/rorcz_mob_key.pem in the push example .
Normally , of course , private keys are never shared , but as described above , since everyone is allowed to push to the mob branch the private key for the mob user must be shared with everyone .
cd /tmp && curl - O https://repo.or.cz/rorcz_mob_key.pem
With the prerequisites out of the way , here ’s the mob ssh example redone to use the smart http protocol :
cd /tmp git clone - b mob https://repo.or.cz/mobexample.git cd mobexample git config http.sslCert /tmp/rorcz_mob_user.pem git config http.sslKey /tmp/rorcz_mob_key.pem git remote set-url -- push origin https://repo.or.cz/mobexample.git echo ' It worked ! ' >>
example .
txt git add example .
txt git commit -m ' example commit ' git push origin mob
If using git version 1.8.5 or later , the http.sslCert and http.sslKey values can be set just once in the Git global configuration file so they apply only to a specific URL ( such as https://repo.or.cz ) .
Note that it ’s not strictly necessary to fetch with the http protocol , the https protocol can also be used for fetching .
However , if using a version of Git older than version 1.8.5 , it can be a bother to get the two certificates and the key set properly without a project - specific place to configure them yet ( this is not a problem with Git version 1.8.5 or later ) .
See the output of git config help for more information about configuring certificates and keys .
Pushing to the personal mob area
Pushing should be configured as though your user had push permission to the project .
Any supported push URL may be used .
Here ’s a mob.$user example using the ssh protocol :
# assume that $ HOME /.ssh / config has been set up to automatically provide # the ssh key for user alice when pushing to example .com git clone ssh://example.com/someproject.git cd someproject # this is the single personal mob ref technique git checkout - b mob.alice git push -u origin mob.alice
It ’s just that simple .
Here ’s a mob_$user /... ref example using the https protocol :
# assume that git config http.sslCert and http.sslKey have been properly # set up to provide the user authentication certificate for user bob # when pushing to example .com git clone https://example.com/someproject.git cd someproject # this is the multiple personal mob ref technique git checkout - b mob_bob / master git push -u origin mob_bob / master # additional refs may be pushed to mob_bob /...
Of course the ssh protocol can be used with the multiple ref technique and the https protocol can be used with the single ref technique .
Cloning the personal mob area
Since the personal mob area is intentionally sequestered under refs / mob / a little extra work is needed to clone from a personal mob ref to start with .
This example will clone both user alice and user bob ’s personal mob areas , merge them and then push them to user eve ’s personal mob area .
# assume that $ HOME /.ssh / config has been set up to automatically provide # the ssh key for user eve when pushing to example .com git clone -n ssh://example.com/someproject.git cd someproject # optionally we may first check which personal mob refs are available git ls- remote origin | grep ' refs / mob / '
# we can see from the output that alice has a mob.alice branch and # and bob has a mob_bob / master branch .
# since nothing under refs / mob is normally fetched we must add instructions # to fetch the personal mob area of both alice and bob being careful to # match the refs we need git config -- add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/mob/mob.alice:refs/remotes/origin/mob.alice ' git config -- add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/mob/mob_bob/*:refs/remotes/origin/mob_bob/*'
# alternatively , this mapping will just get every personal mob ref # but this is not really recommended # git config -- add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/mob/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
# now fetch the new refs git fetch # merge mob.alice and mob_bob / master and push to mob.eve git checkout mob.alice git checkout mob_bob / master git checkout - b mob.eve git merge mob.alice git push -u origin mob.eve
Not so difficult , but a little bit of extra work to clone from a personal mob area .
Is Virtue What We Buy or What We Sell ?
If we judge politicians by what they buy , then Eliot Spitzer has clearly violated the public ’s trust : he purchased the services of a high - priced prostitute , and may well end his political career as a result .
But what if we judge politicians by what they sell ?
On this score , Spitzer may be one of the few politicians who has not prostituted himself to special interests .
An insightful new contribution to the emerging “ forensic economics ” literature by my frequent co-author Eric Zitzewitz makes the case that Spitzer is extraordinary because of the high price he placed on his integrity .
Let me explain .
Spitzer made his name politically as New York ’s attorney general , where he launched a number of high - profile investigations into the securities industry .
The trouble with evaluating an attorney general ’s performance is that it is very difficult for outsiders to make any inferences about the most important power used by the office — prosecutorial discretion .
It may be that an attorney general settles for small fines against a wrongdoer because he is in their pocket ; but equally , it may be that the evidence was weak , or the conduct at issue was n’t that egregious .
Zitzewitz ’s analysis focuses on analyzing the set of cases involving mutual fund market timing and late trading .
Using available data , he develops some useful proxies of what he calls “ the dilution of long - term fund shareholders from arbitrage trading . ”
Eric is too polite : this is a measure of how much money unsavory fund managers allowed to be diverted from our mutual fund savings .
This all occurred because select friends of these managers were given the right to buy into the fund at this morning ’s low price , rather than this afternoon ’s higher price ( even after the markets had risen ) .
In these cases , the evidence was uniformly strong , and by measuring this “ dilution , ” Zitzewitz can measure how egregious the misconduct by these firms was .
All told , he compiles estimates of the harm — and public records on the restitution ordered — in 20 SEC - negotiated settlements .
Of these , 16 involved the New York attorney general , and the resulting restitution typically amounted to about 80 percent of the harm — pretty close to full restitution .
But in the 4 settlements in which Spitzer ’s office was not involved , the SEC was willing to settle on a figure closer to 7 percent of the total harm .
What causes this different treatment ?
It ca n’t be the expertise and manpower of the New York Investor Protection Bureau , which has only about 30 employees , relative to the 1,200 folks working in the SEC ’s Enforcement Division .
And it is n’t that Spitzer was only interested in the big fish or big headlines : the finding of differential treatment is robust when controlling for the fund ’s ability to pay or the timing of the settlement .
Zitzewitz also obtains similar results when he uses two useful instrumental variables for whether the New York attorney general will be involved : whether a firm is headquartered in New York , and the percentage of its investors who are residents .
So what explains this disparity ?
Zitzewitz ’s analysis suggests that the key is the SEC ’s laxity , rather than Spitzer ’s excess zeal .
Often we economists worry about “ regulatory capture , ” and I ’m concerned about the SEC ’s “ revolving door ” personnel policy , in which young securities lawyers spend a few years at the SEC before moving on to greener pastures ( e.g. , working for financial firms against the SEC ) .
Given these incentives , it seems pretty likely that these young lawyers do n’t really want to upset potential future employers .
It seems to me that the truly important violations of the public trust are when the power we give our government officials is sold , rather than what government officials choose to buy .
Yet our political scandals are too often dominated by private mistakes , rather than public misdeeds .
This is why I ’m more worried about what the SEC is selling than what Eliot Spitzer has been buying .
' Donkey Punch is the vilest film I 've ever seen , ' says AMANDA PLATELL
Already the buzz around Donkey Punch is building .
After a rave reception at the Sundance film festival earlier this year , it 's rapidly emerging as the must - see movie of the summer - ' a gravely serious psychological horror thriller ' according to one critic , ' frighteningly plausible ' says another .
British director and co-writer Oliver Blackburn describes this , his debut feature film , as ' provocative ' .
Well , I suppose that 's one way to describe a morally bankrupt tale of teenage group sex , violence , drugs and sadism which left me sickened to the core .
Scroll down for more
A real horror : Donkey Punch is a tale of teenage group sex , violence , drugs and sadism
But Donkey Punch is no ordinary softporn slasher flick .
Blackburn claims the characters in his tale are ' socially realistic ' - typical of many young men and women of his generation .
' Everything in the film is rooted in reality , ' says the 36 - year - old director .
' We just took the stuff that 's out there and made it into a story . '
In which case , I despair for the future of Britain .
' Typical of his generation ' : Olly Blackburn , director of Donkey Punch
The key thing to know about Donkey Punch is that the film takes its name from a potentially lethal and possibly mythical sado - masochistic act involving anal sex .
I apologise for being so explicit , but unless you understand the central premise of the film you cannot comprehend what a vile production it is .
The plot , if it can be dignified as such , goes as follows : three girls from Leeds travel to Majorca for a weekend 's fun as an antidote to a cheating boyfriend .
They meet four posh British boys who are crewing a 76 - foot yacht during their summer holidays .
And while the owner is away , they decide to play .
And play hard .
Within hours of meeting , they all sail off into the sunset and are soon so out of it on a cocktail of drink and drugs they lose all inhibitions and start having group sex , taking it in turns to film the assorted couplings .
Egged on by his friends , one of the men then attempts to perform the notorious ' Donkey Punch ' on a girl , with fatal consequences .
What follows is as absurd as it is disturbing , with the remaining characters subjecting one another to increasingly vile acts of cruelty until there 's no one left to maim or murder .
It is , quite simply , the most distasteful , depraved and nihilistic film I have ever had the misfortune to sit through .
I freely confess that there were times I felt physically ill simply watching it .
Certainly , I would have walked out long before the end had I not had to write about it .
It 's not that I can't stomach any horror movie .
Gory as it was , I adored Silence Of The Lambs for the psychological brilliance of its storyline and the Oscar - winning acting of Anthony Hopkins .
The Blair Witch Project showed how the horror genre can still reinvent itself , even on a shoestring budget .
But Donkey Punch has no such merits .
Indeed , it has no redeeming features whatsoever .
There is not a single shred of humanity , imagination or creativity detectable anywhere among its 99 long minutes .
Its sole purpose seems to be to suggest that , as far as British youth is concerned , all women are sluts , all men are sadists , everyone takes drugs , group sex with strangers is par for the course and sado - masochism 's the norm .
But that 's not the worst of it .
No , the most depressing thing about Donkey Punch is that we paid for it .
It received half of its £ 1 million funding from the government backed UK Film Council and could not have been made without National Lottery funding .
What possible justification can there be for almost half a million pounds of lottery money being spent on this tripe ?
Lottery money is supposed to help create a better Britain - not coarsen it .
Because that 's what Donkey Punch is all about - the coarsening of society to the point where films that revel in sadism , savagery and deviant sex are somehow hailed as authentic social commentary deserving of public funding .
For the sad truth about films like Donkey Punch is that they not only apparently glorify the worst of human behaviour , they also serve to normalise it .
They desensitise a society where young people are unsure of the rules any more , where children can be led to think it 's not cool to say ' No ' to anything - not to drugs , to knives , to sex , to violence .
Thus the old liberal mantra that ' anything is acceptable between consenting adults ' has been extended to encompass behaviour that is not just distasteful but dangerous .
And we wonder why violent sex acts are on the increase !
It 's not just a criminal underclass who get sucked into this amoral orbit , either .
Take the case of Jessica Davies .
Nice middle - class Jessica - the niece of a former Tory MP - was just 28 when she reportedly confessed to slitting her lover 's throat after a knife she was holding allegedly slipped during a sex game at her Paris apartment last year .
You have to read that sentence again to realise how utterly horrific it is .
Needless to say , she was out of her mind on drugs and alcohol at the time , so cannot remember the precise details of what took place .
French Police suspect Jessica may have been ' inspired ' by the Meredith Kercher case , in which the pretty English student was murdered as part of what police believe to have been a warped sex game involving Meredith 's female flatmate and two men .
Again , drink and drugs were involved .
This is the warped world that Donkey Punch inhabits .
It portrays a world in which group sex , violence and drugs are part of a typical night out for British youth .
In which working - class tarts are there to be abused by posh bastards .
In which all traditional codes of behaviour are to be mocked as meaningless .
Which brings me back to the director 's assertions that his film simply reflects ' what 's out there in society ' .
Really ?
Or is society shaped by what 's out there on the screen ?
I 'm not suggesting that all those who go to see Donkey Punch will somehow emerge as sexual sadists or mass murderers .
That would be absurd .
But I do believe that such ' torture porn ' films , as they have been dubbed , contribute towards a society in which sexual savagery is no longer perceived as extreme or exceptional , but increasingly regarded as acceptable and commonplace .
I 'm thinking here of the footballers and rugby players who ' roast ' girls in group sex sessions .
Of the teenagers who film themselves having sex then post it on the internet .
Of the dramatic rise in sexually transmitted diseases among 16 to 24 - year - olds whose laissez - faire attitude to sex now accounts for half of all such infections in Britain .
And yet as a society we not only fail to condemn casual sex - and the drink and drug culture that fuels it .
We actually pay puerile first - time directors like Oliver Blackburn - the Oxford educated son of a lawyer and an art curator - hundreds of thousands of pounds to make films that apparently actively revel in it .
Now that really is scary .
In truth , this film is the sort of low - grade , low - intelligence sewage that we expect to seep out of Hollywood 's ' straight to video ' gutters .
The fact that its director is now being hailed as one of our most promising young talents speaks volumes about the liberal establishment that controls Britain 's arts subsidies .
Every charity whose genuine attempts to improve British society have been denied Lottery funding will have every right to feel Donkey Punch is a kick in the face .
David Cook Shows Feisty Attitude in Rolling Stone Interview ( Photos )
will appear in an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine .
The June 26th issue features an interview with the American Idol Season Seven winner and gives some insight into his mindset going into the competition and now that he has captured the crown .
Cook received 55 million votes from his adoring fans - Hillary Clinton should have been so lucky !
The AI winner wants you to know that he did n't have a burning desire to be the next Idol .
Rather , he appeared at an AI audition in Omaha , NE , as moral support for his brother , Andrew .
Cook laughs at the news media 's insistence that he has become an instant success story .
He said during an interview in NYC :
The overnight thing is nice and romantic , but in this particular instance , it 's not the case . "
Cook first sang in public as a second grader , and he played first the violin , and next , the guitar , during his childhood .
He entered talent contests and formed his first band as a freshman in high school .
He has been all about entertainment people since he was a elementary school kid .
The AI title earned Cook a record deal with 19 Recordings / RCA .
Eleven of his Idol competition songs registered on Billboard 's Hot 100 according to Rolling Stone - a record only once before bested by the Beatles in 1964 .
David has been compared to AI alum Chris Daughtry .
He told Rolling Stone : " I do n't want to make a Chris Daughtry record , I want to make a David Cook record .
I feel like I know who I am . "
Do we detect a little bit of attitude ?
We get that you did n't ask for it and now that you 've gotten it you 'll chart your own course and be your own man .
Kelly Clarkson had that same attitude when she won the title .
She managed to short circuit a promising career that may never recover .
Tread lightly David Cook .

A while back I wrote a caching decorator for chrss .
It ’s mostly used for the rss feeds , to help avoid having over - zealous rss readers slowing the site down .
However I ’m also now running it on a few other pages that were a bit slow ( notably generating PGN files for games ) .
After letting it sit for a while Ian and Kyran also started using it on ShowMeDo .
That was a couple of months ago .
So now that I can be fairly certain it works it seemed like time to share it with the world .
So first off here ’s a few features / comments :
It ’s shamelessly based on code from Django ( the caching backends at least )
It features an “ anti- dogpiling ” mechanism to try and make sure only one thread triggers a cache refresh
Multiple backends supported :
dummy – does no caching ( for testing / development use )
– does no caching ( for testing / development use )
simple – just uses a dictionary ( for testing / development use )
– just uses a dictionary ( for testing / development use )
localmem – thread - safe cache for use in process
– thread - safe cache for use in process
file – uses file - system to cache data ( this is what ’s used with chrss and ShowMeDo )
– uses file - system to cache data ( this is what ’s used with chrss and ShowMeDo )
memcache – uses memcached for caching ( it should work , but not massively tested at the moment )
Now for some example usage :
from turbogears import expose , controllers from cache import cache_result class MyController ( controllers .
Controller ) : @expose ( content_type= " text / plain " ) @cache_result ( ) def cache_some_text ( self ) : ''' no template so it 's pretty straightforward - expose just has to come first ''' return ' this will be cached ' @expose ( template = " my_template ) @cache_result ( ) def cache_data_only ( self ) : ''' with a template we can just cache the data and not rendered html ''' return dict ( value= ' this dictionary will be cached ' ) @ expose ( ) @cache_result ( ) @expose ( template = " my_template ) def cache_html ( self ) : ''' or we can cache the rendered html , but we have to use an outer expose ( ) to make the method public ''' return dict ( value= ' will be cached with the html ' )
To see how you can use the @cache_result ( ) you are probably best looking
at the source ( there ’s a fairly detailed comment explaining it ) .
The following parameters can
be passed in :
key_fn – function used to derive a key to store the data in ( default uses current url and user identity )
– function used to derive a key to store the data in ( default uses current url and user identity ) version_fn – can be used to control how a cached value expires ( defaults to a function that returns the same value everytime )
– can be used to control how a cached value expires ( defaults to a function that returns the same value everytime ) timeout_seconds – how many seconds until the value start to expire
The default key function can be controlled via the config parameter cache.decorator.anon_only .
If set to True ( the default ) it will only look in the cache for data when users are not logged in .
Otherwise when users are logged in it will use a key just for them .
The default is handy if you just want to avoid problems with a flood of anonymous users ( e.g. from Slashdot / Digg etc ) .
The version function can be used to force expire cached values .
The value of the version function is compared to the value stored in the cache and if different this triggers a cache refresh .
For example if the version function was based on the number of comments in a blog post , then whenever a comment was added to the blog post the cache would get refreshed .
This avoids having to wait for the cache to expire .
timeout_seconds specifies how many seconds before a value expires .
It defaults to the value set in cache.decorator.timeout_seconds in your config file ( or 1800 seconds if not set there ) .
anti-dogpiling
So first I ’ll explain what I mean by “ dogpiling ” with respect to cache expiry .
The standard way to use a cache is to do something like :
value = cache.get ( ' key ' , None ) if value is None : value = recompute_cached_value ( ) cache [ ' key ' ] = value return value
Now this is fine normally .
When the cached value expires the next request will simply call recompute_cached_value ( ) and the cache will be updated for future requests .
The trouble arises when recompute_cached_value ( ) takes a long time to run and you have have a lot of other requests running at the same time .
If a request is still recalculating the value and another request comes along , then that will also attempt to recalculate the value .
This will in turn probably slow down the calculation going on , making it more likely that the next request to arrive will also trigger a recalculation and so on .
Very quickly you can end up with tens / hundreds / thousands of request all attempting to recalculate the cached value and you have lost most of the advantage of caching in the first place .
So to handle this situation more gracefully this caching decorator employs a two stage expiry .
First there is a hard cut off expiry that works like normal .
This is set to occur later than the other expiry time and is the value that would be fed to memcache or equivalent .
The second expiry time set is the one normally used .
Basically when we store / retrieve the cached data we also have access to this expiry time ( and the version ) .
If we see that we need to recalculate the value ( due to the expiry time being in the past or the version being different ) , then we attempt to grab a lock to recalculate the value .
If we do n’t grab the lock , we assume another thread is doing the recalculation and rather than wait around we simply serve up the old ( stale ) data .
This should mean that one thread ( potentially per-process ) will end up doing the recalculation rather than several .
This also means that we do n’t have to remove a value from the cache to force a refresh ( which might cause dogpiling ) .
Instead we can update whatever value we use in our version function , to trigger a graceful refresh .
conclusion
So that ’s a basic intro to this caching decorator .
It ’s quite a handy quick way of adding some caching to your turbogears app .
You ’ll need to see how well it works for you .
I ’m providing it “ as is ” and making no claims about anything .
Feel free to incorporate it into your code and modify as you see fit .
Just let me know if you have any issues or feedback .
bonus decorator
The cache code also includes a simple decorator to control the Expires header sent out with a response :
def expires ( seconds=0 ) : ''' set expire headers for client - size caching ' '' def decorator ( fn ) : def decorated ( * arg , **kw ) : cherrypy.response.headers [' Expires ']=formatdate ( _current_time ( ) + seconds ) return fn( * arg , ** kw ) return decorated return decorator
It ’s handy for getting the client to cache some data for us too .
I use it on some of the PIL generated images served up via my app .

The job fell to me , as it does at times , to do a radio interview .
And the topic was — what else ?
— Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the state of the banking system in the United States .
While preparing for this interview , I felt an unusual sense of foreboding .
Why was this , I wondered ?
My usual attitude going into such exchanges is one of optimism , because the message of economics is essentially optimistic .
And I am optimistic — about the economy , its resiliency , and the good times ahead , no matter the current state of affairs .
Life is too short for despair , and my study of the economy rarely justifies it .
But not this time .
I could not think of much positive to say about Fannie and Freddie , the quasi-public entities that purchase mortgages from banks for resale to investors as mortgage - backed securities , nor about the quality of the political and professional class calling the shots now that they are insolvent , nor about what was likely to result from the proposed solutions to their problems .
Also , this is a complex issue — one that is not well suited for radio , where matters requiring deep thought or reflection tend not to work .
Trying to describe this banking crisis recalls the proverb of the blind men trying to describe the elephant .
They each latch on to a particular part , describe it correctly , and walk away with completely different and insufficient explanations for what an elephant is all about .
Some History First
There were enough confused people out there misdiagnosing this issue , and making it worse , that I thought I had to get my two cents in .
So I resolved to tell the host what I knew about the history of Fannie and Freddie and what brought us to the situation we are in today .
It is easy to say today that FDR was wrong to start Fannie Mae back in the 1930s to promote home ownership through a banking industry that he had effectively demonized .
In my opinion , with all of the crowding out that the New Deal programs were causing — meaning the upward pressure on interest rates resulting from the government 's raiding of the loanable funds market to finance an unprecedented expansion of government —
Fannie was created to avert the political backlash against the unintended effects of 1930s - era economic policies .
From the beginning , first Fannie and then Freddie ( which was created in 1970 ) served the purpose of shielding the public from the adverse effects of expansive government — and bad fiscal policy in particular .
This makes government relatively more tolerable to the rank and file .
The creation of both entities , I told the host , was a mistake , because it created greater investment in housing and home ownership than would have been justified by market forces .
The result is an inefficient use of resources — a malinvestment .
Furthermore , entities like Fannie and Freddie forced out private firms that otherwise would have satisfied the demand for housing , but could n't , because they lacked the preferential treatment from which Fannie and Freddie benefited , especially in terms of taxes and regulations .
By the 1960s , Fannie was turned into a GSE — a government - sponsored enterprise .
( Freddie was created as a GSE from the beginning . )
This structured their operations so that they would become more like private firms , required to offer stock and compete in the marketplace , with the understanding that they would finance themselves out of their own profits .
This is not an arrangement that has worked well for the post office or Amtrak , but with the first of the baby boomers getting their starter homes , and then later when the dollar 's last remaining ties to gold were severed , it worked better for Fannie and Freddie , especially since they were allowed to maintain some of the privileges denied their competitors .
For most of their history , Fannie and Freddie were ( in my opinion ) relatively benign .
They never should have been created , but they did n't do much harm .
This would change in the 1990s , when they became big players in the economy .
That is when the current problems began .
This is when a man who came from a working - class family in Seattle became the head of Fannie Mae , and its purpose seemed to change .
Franklin Raines was a political appointee and operative , and during his reign , Fannie and Freddie 's importance to the political class changed .
There was , it seemed to me , an agreement that emerged that in exchange for political support , Fannie and Freddie would target mortgage activity by congressional districts .
What 's more , certain parts of the country that were facing adverse economic times could also receive an influx of credit , thanks to Fannie and Freddie 's efforts .
They were n't lenders of last resort — that was the Fed , of course — but they could make sure that by aggressively targeting where mortgages would be bought up , they could enhance the short - term economic effects of money creation , by state or region .
Also under Raines , Fannie and Freddie began taking on riskier investments , including a large exposure to financial derivatives , based on the assumption that their growing political importance meant that they would not pay the full price if such investments failed .
Their protected status made for a good deal for investors , who stood to profit if these investments increased in value , but a bad deal for taxpayers , who assumed the risk if they did n't .
It was this exposure that cost Raines his job eventually , although he exited Fannie a multimillionaire .
Who says public service does n't pay ?
Nonetheless , Raines established Fannie ( and Freddie by extension ) as indispensable to the political class .
Then 9/11 happened .
Crisis and Leviathan
By now , I wonder if I have lost my host .
Is he nodding off over there in the studio ?
No , but it is time for a commercial break , and he still wants to go into how we got to the current situation .
During the break , I wonder how I can improve my presentation .
This is , after all , economic history , and practically dry by definition .
Would a football analogy work ?
Is there even one that would apply ?
I pondered this point until the commercials ended and we resumed our discussion .
I told the host that after 9/11 , an insecure federal government — with its credibility threatened — embarked on one of those expansions of the state that have become both predictable and generational .
As with the Progressive Era , the New Deal , and the Great Society , the United States was due for another period of government expansion , and the Federal Reserve stood ready to abet it by allowing the largest increase in the money supply in its history .
Money went out into the banking system , and banks were flush with excess reserves , allowing new money to be created out of thin air ( through multiple deposit expansion , which I failed to define for the listeners ) .
It was sort of a Hail Mary , I said , in reference to the football play .
The host thought I meant the prayer , and I resolved to leave sports analogies to sports shows .
They are beyond my competence .
But the growth of government in the 2000s expanded the welfare , warfare , and corporate states — and with a vengeance .
Such efforts always create malinvestments , class division , dependency , and unforeseen consequences ; to counter these effects , Fannie and Freddie grew even more important to the political classes .
They continued targeting spending to politically important regions while taking on risky loans that were necessitated when all that new liquidity showed itself in a housing bubble .
The bubble priced middle - class workers out of the housing market , thus creating adverse selection for lenders .
Middle - class wage earners may leave California if they can't afford the $ 400,000 for old houses that might have been priced in the five figures just two years before .
It does n't take much use of the old gray cells to know that there 's increased risk that they will default on their mortgages .
Under normal circumstances , the banks would n't approve them .
But since California is — among other politically important regions in the country — an important electoral state , banks made many of these loans .
They could only do this because of the knowledge that Fannie or Freddie would take those loans off their books .
Such activity fed the housing bubble , as Fannie and Freddie took on a growing number of increasingly risky loans .
Complex hedge funds , employing sophisticated algorithms to help balance risk , started buying them as well , even when the bubble grew to the point at which housing could only become affordable through riskier , adjustable - rate mortgages , some of which did not even require proof of income .
Such risk was welcomed , and if it could have been balanced , it would not necessarily have been a bad thing .
But in this case it was a bad thing , because so many loans went into default .
The result is that Fannie and Freddie are bankrupt today , along with many banks .
I went through this history , and my patient host announced another break .
When we returned , he asked me to discuss the proposed solutions .
What Now ?
This was the part of my interview that I had been dreading .
Up until then , I had played the role of economic historian , but my less - than - optimistic side , which rarely shows up , was about to rear its ugly head .
The fact is that I think I have a pretty good idea of what needs to happen .
Fannie and Freddie should be shuttered .
Their corporate ownership should be subjected to the Enron treatment , and their assets should be auctioned off to private mortgage guarantors .
Also , the Fed 's complicity in this affair needs to be made well known , especially the role of one former Fed chairman who encouraged the use of subprime mortgages in the early 2000s .
In hindsight , his statements look like desperate attempts to minimize the adverse effects of his post - 9/11 monetary policies and shield himself and the political establishment from the backlash that rightly follows periods of monetary inflation .
This is my optimistic scenario .
Think of the housing market that would follow .
As housing prices adjust downward , the role of housing as a middle - class inflation hedge would end .
Millions of mortgage holders would foreclose , and many millions more would find themselves upside down .
This would be a disaster for many , sure , especially for undiversified households with equity primarily in their houses .
But consider the upside as well .
Housing would become affordable , which would be a true godsend compared to both today 's market and what will follow if Fannie and Freddie are bailed out .
What 's more , the quality of mortgages after the bubble bursts would be much better than what exists today .
Imagine : a mortgage market dominated by debtors of financial means !
There would be short - term pain in the economy , but in the long run the housing market would be sustainable again , and general prices would fall , thus raising real incomes .
The Fed , if it survives , would be more chastened and independent than it has been in many years .
Besides , sticking the knife into Fannie and Freddie is the kind of market reform that the United States regularly urges developing nations to carry out , sometimes even requiring it in exchange for foreign aid .
The US economy would reap huge dividends .
As Joshua Rosner wrote recently in the Financial Times ,
Instead of protecting those who made bad bets , we should use our rule of law to address the situation .
That would mean we allow weak players either to fail or to reorganize through an orderly transfer of good assets from weak hands to strong hands .
This would protect the once - mighty US dollar and affect the necessary repricing of assets to sustainable equilibrium .
Doing so would also decrease moral hazard and send a strong message of faith in our great system as the model for global financial advancement .
But , unfortunately , I do not see the situation resolving itself in this manner .
What I see instead is another case of Westley 's Law : the public sector is held to lower standards than are applied to the private sector , and the government will grow as a result .
Instead of roadblocks placed on the road to serfdom , we 'll be greasing the skids .
So I became , on the radio , for the first time in my professional capacity , a grumpy economist .
Fannie and Freddie are going to be bailed out by taxpayers , I told the host , and the resulting inflation will make a weak dollar weaker and prop up corrupt banks that market forces would otherwise force out of business .
Congress will hold hearings next year to demonize the productive , to find scapegoats ( will Volcker be reappointed to the Fed ? ) , and to otherwise deflect attention from its role in this mess , while wealthy investors who deserve to lose their shirts will be bailed out by the hapless taxpayer ( again ) .
A U - shaped ( prolonged ) recession will sink in some time after the November elections .
Indeed , if it were n't for the impending elections , the political classes would have given in to the economic inevitable months ago .
Every economic crisis creates an opportunity to allow market order to reassert itself .
The current case is no exception .
But such crises are more often seized as opportunities to expand the level of state intervention in the economy , even when previous episodes of intervention caused the current crisis .
Fannie and Freddie should be shut down .
The bad news is that , at great cost , they wo n't be .
I hope I am wrong .
It has happened before .
But what made me think this message would make for good radio ?
Remember the " hilarious " pin being sold at the Texas Republican Convention , asking " If Obama is president … will we still call it the White House ? "
( Ho ho . )
Well , evidently , it was n't the only " hilarious " novelty item being hawked there that featured a " hilarious " racist joke at Obama 's expense :
Oh , those clever Republicans !
The reason it 's funny is because it 's so true !
Remember when Obama plotted and orchestrated a terrorist attack against the US that left thousands of people dead ?
… No ?
Ha ha , well , he tacitly supports universal health insurance — and that 's practically the same thing !
[ H/ T to Lauredhel , who hat tips Sully . ]
I ca n’t even begin to imagine the complexity of rolling out something as big as the iPhone 3G / 2.0 .
You have to coordinate retail , marketing , web services , support , manufacturing , shipping , and many of other business and tech units months in advance .
They all have to be ready by a a date determined by guesswork , pressure , and wishful thinking .
Which means that you essentially have to make the call that the product is going to be done long before it actually is .
For the iPhone 1.0 launch , that bet paid off .
The software for the phone felt solid .
Everything just worked well .
Fondling with the phone for the first time was intoxicating .
It just tasted so incredibly Apple .
With the iPhone 2.0 launch , not so much .
I ’ve been using the phone every day for about a week now and it just is n’t up to the great expectations set by the first version .
Everything feels so incredibly fragile .
Here are just a few of the griefs I ’ve felt :
Annoying delays all over the place .
Changing to the SMS view can take more than 10 seconds at times .
view can take more than 10 seconds at times .
Transitions between apps are being dropped entirely or cut short ( the latter looks like a UI stutter ) .
It some times requires 3 clicks on the fast - forward button in iTunes to get a response .
The screen will freeze for 4 - 5 seconds not accepting any input , then replay ALL your feverous tapping when it finally returns .
your feverous tapping when it finally returns .
Some times the keyboard will not keep up with your input ( and I ’m not that fast of a typer ) .
I ’ve had applications crash numerous times .
The entire phone has crashed twice .
Restarting the phone kinda helps some of these problems , but not for long and it feels so dirty and Windows - like to do .
Now all of this could probably have been overlooked and forgiven if the payback from the new features was immense , but to me , it just is n’t .
I have two screens of applications installed , but do n’t really use them that much .
3rd party apps does n’t make up for it
Twitterific is nice , but not much of a step up from just using the iPhone - optimized web version .
I like WeatherBug too to get a doppler radar reading , but nothing a bookmark to weather .com did n’t do almost as well .
I ’ve installed but not actually used AIM , NetNewsWire , Yelp , Movies.app , Facebook , PayPal , NYTimes , Light , Sketches , and VNC yet .
It seems like the biggest new thing is the games .
I ’ve been playing some Tetris , some Super Monkey Ball , and a few others .
And they ’re really impressive !
The graphics are great and controlling with the accelerometer often works better than you ’d think .
3G is bliss and bastard all in one
The hardware features are also a nice improvement .
The built - in GPS is fast and accurate .
The 3G is a lot more mixed bag , though .
When it works , it ’s absolutely fantastic .
It ’s so much faster than Edge and really takes the experience that 2.0 - like step up .
The voice quality is also significantly up .
But it ’s just so incredibly unreliable .
Getting a 3G signal in central Chicago is like playing the corner on roulette .
And when it drops back to edge , you lose all your chips of joy .
I actually kinda like getting ultra fast just 20 % of time and slowpoke speeds 80 % of the time less than just being slow always .
As to double down on the insult , the battery life is absolutely terrible with 3G turned on .
You ’re absolutely required to recharge every day and it ’s not unlikely that you ’ll flame out in the middle of a day either with heavy use .
The cumulative effect of small problems is exponential
Combined , it ’s a rather big disappointment .
I ’m surprised just how much impact the small griefs have when they add up to a lack of confidence in the system .
It ’s a great example of the cumulative effects of problems .
They have an exponential damage on the experience .
And I have n’t even gone into much detail on how ridiculously bad the buying experience is compared to the first time around .
Jason and I bought a EVDO card in a Sprint store the other day and we spent probably 30 minutes there .
We joked about how lame that experience was .
Buying the iPhone 3G took almost as long and felt almost as bad .
That ’s not to say that the iPhone is n’t the best phone I ’ve ever had .
It is .
By a wide margin .
But the 2.0 launch itself has been a big disappointment and that ’s too bad .
It feels a little like Apple got swept up in knocking down every single detraction point from 1.0 that they lost sight of what everyone loved about the first version .
Yes , it got cheaper ( not really ) , faster ( some times ) , installable apps , and GPS , but it lost a bit of Apple soul in the process .
Change is the only constant in the music business , and that goes double for the digital music business .
Nonetheless , we 've assembled a list of the 10 hottest digital music websites in the world .
Criteria were simple and admittedly subjective : Sites were chosen based not only on what they currently do for music fans , but also on their potential to impact the future development of the music industry .
Based on how things go with the first iteration , this list could be updated periodically and opened for voting .
Without further ado , here 's are Wired.com Listening Post 's top 10 hottest digital music websites :
( Sites are listed in alphabetical order . )
Imeem
You may have noticed that we use imeem 's music - embedding feature quite a bit when covering music on the Listening Post blog .
This is not becausewe have some sort of business deal in place with them ; imeem is simply thebest option we 've found for embedding music without worrying about getting permission from a label .
In most cases , we 're able to find a full songor two to embed from their catalog .
Our only quibble with this systemis that they only allow 30 seconds of certain songs to be embedded , andthere 's no way to tell until you preview the post .
There 's a lot more to imeem than just their blog strategy , of course , which is so powerful in part due to the company 's deals with all four major labels
for free , on - demand music .
The site also includes social networkingfeatures , videos and loads of free music .
And even songs that can only beembedded as a 30 - second version stream in their entirety if you playthem while you 're signed in to imeem .
IVideoSongs
This may seem like an odd choice , but bear with me .
IVideosongs isone of a handful of new sites that teach the guitar online through thevideo medium .
Demand is only growing for these sites , as the GuitarHero and Rock Band videogames spawn a new generation of axe - wielding would - be shredders .
Some of their tutorials are free , others cost a small fee .
At the highend of the price scale ( $ 10 ) , you 'll find songs being taught by theperson who wrote them , or who was associated with their recording ( George Martin 's son teaches Beatles songs on the site , for instance ) .
Online music education has huge potential , and the guitar is at theforefront of the movement for a number of reasons .
From what we 'veseen , iVideoSongs is currently the best option out there .
In May , six of the top 20 podcasts
in the iTunes store were iVideosongs tutorials .
The site has licensingdeals in place with the big five music publishers as well as smallermusic publishers .
Their high - definition videos play full screen on acomputer or on iPods and other portable devices .
Omnifone
This UK - based music service charges cellphone subscribers a lowmonthly fee for unlimited access to over a million tracks from their phones .
This is a fine deal as it is , but we likethe frosting too : a feature that tailors your news feeds based on theartists you listen to the most , and a social networking feature thatlets you share tracks with your friends .
When I tested Omnifone 's MusicStation service , the company fronted the expensiveroaming fees required for me to test the service fromAmerica , using a phone its CEO Rob Lewis deliveredto me in person .
Although the service is not yet available in the United States ,
Lewis said he is in talks with labels about rolling the service out here .
He expects the U.S. version of the service to cost less than a current monthly Rhapsodysubscription – around $ 7.50 per month .
MOG
I actually do n't use this site , but it 's not because I do n't like it .
After a full day of covering music and digital music news onListening Post , it would n't make sense to spend my free timeblogging about music on MOG .
But the one million or so people who visit MOG eachmonth have been writing up a storm , and the site recently added lyricsand a video hub to give them even more to talk about .
According to a MOG spokeswoman , some of its users are gaining netfame , like indiepixie ,
whose MOG profile currently lists her MOG meter status as " blazing . "
The site also offers a smattering of celebrity bloggers including BenGibbard of Death Cab for Cutie , Questlove of The Roots and Greg Saunierof Deerhoof , but their posting schedule is far slacker than those ofMOG 's non-touring users .
You can't listen to much music on the site without a Rhapsodyaccount , but its plentiful YouTube videos make up for that to a certainextent , and the site 's navigation , design and proliferation ofmusic - oriented communication features were enough to put it on our list .
Muxtape
Some might look at Muxtape and wonder why its features are so limited .
Why can't I search ?
Why can't I customize the look of the player ?
Andwhy are the fonts so big ?
The thing is , there are hordes of sites out there that offer morefunctions than most people will ever use .
Muxtape doesone thing , and it does it very , very well :
It allows people to createonline MP3 mix tapes in a matter of minutes , no expertise or hassletolerance required .
Despite servers crashing when the site first launched and asubsequent loss of a small percentage of newly created mixes , the siteis back on track and has plenty of room for expansion .
Muxtape ' screator told us that while he wo n't rule out advertising completely , heplans to keep Muxtape super simple in subsequent releases , which isgood news for anyone who likes to share music without jumping throughhoops .
RCRD LBL
When the guy who founded Engadget and Gizmodo joins forces with theguy who runs Downtown Records , one would expect interesting things to happen .
Indeed , RCRD LBL , the joint venture between Peter Rojas and JoshDeutsch , is gaining traction among music fans who want free music .
Their site merges two major online trends , blogs and free music , ina way that gets everybody paid .
RCRD LBL pays recording artists and remixers a flat fee for a song ranging up to $ 5,000 , andthen offers free MP3 downloads , streams , widgets and radio stationsusing the resulting music catalog to its users .
As I wrote back when they launched , " how they make money from thatis their business " ( advertising and sponsorships ) .
The company is in the process of banding with a fewother independent music - oriented blogs to present a larger chunk ofpageviews for advertisers .
SeeqPod
Imagine a big , invisible net that could haul in all of the fish that are hiding under variousrocks and crags of the world 's oceans ... except the fish stay just where theyare , despite the fact that you get as many fish as you want .
That 's basically what SeeqPod does for music .
It scours the netfor MP3s in all sorts of locations , presenting them through a simple searchbox , a moving tracker that showcases the site 's latest discoveries and an iPhoneinterface that turns the internet into a music collection for your iPhone .
In addition , you can ( https://www.wired.com/music/2007/11/seeqpod-music-w.html) anywhere HTML is used .
As with many innovators before it , SeeqPod is currentlystaring down a major - label lawsuit .
But as a directory that doesn ' thost any music , it would appear to have certain legal protections .
Sellaband / SlicethePie
Paradoxically , as more people seem to be investing time rather thanmoney to acquire music , a growing number of fans are ponying up coldhard cash to invest in bands themselves .
Once they reach a certainlevel of fan investment , bands on Sellaband and SlicethePie get to use a pool of theirinverstors ' money ranging from $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 to record and market an album .
Not only do investors get a copy of that album , but they see a returnon album sales and can trade shares in bands as they would a company 's stock .
Sellaband was the first company to pioneer this approach , but we 're including SlicethePie here too , since the companies employ slightly different approaches .
TuneCore
If you 've ever tried to puzzle your way through iTunes ' musicsubmission process , you know how labyrinthine and tedious it can be .
Now , multiply that hassle by the number of digital music outlets in theworld , and you start to see why TuneCore is so important .
In case you have n't heard of it , TuneCore allows anyone to distributesongs or albums to iTunes , Amazon , Rhapsody , eMusic and so on , forpreposterously low fees .
None other than Trent Reznor used TuneCore todistribute his 36 - song opus Ghosts I - IV to iTunes , Amazon , Rhapsody and other outlets for a mere $ 38 .
This company is a true Long Tail
enabler , and TuneCore 's latest move could make it even more disruptive .
The company recently released an API that gives anyone the ability todistribute other peoples ' music digitally , worldwide ( with permission ,
of course ) .
Whatever the next version of the record label is , it 's probably going to require a distributor that looks a lot like TuneCore .
YouTube
This is another sort of counterintuitive choice .
Is n't YouTube a video site ?
Guess again , says a certain digital music insider , who once said to me , " Want to see the best on - demand music service in the world ?
Go to YouTube and close your eyes . "
He was right .
Thanks to licensing deals with the labels , hordes of loyal users scouring the dustbins of history for every last scrap of available footage , and a generous embedding policy , no list of the best music sites in the world would be complete without YouTube .
Honorable Mentions
Blogspot , for hosting so many music blogs ( as suggested by Michael Calore of monkey_bites ) .
He writes , " I have no idea why everyone 's choosing that platform in particular , but when I want to find either advance releases or obscure , out - of - print ' 70s Turkish psyche - prog vinyl rips , i add " blogspot " to my google search and there they are .
CloudTrade combines some of the biggest trends in music : ad - supported content , cellphones and social networks .
Although the company has only signed deals with a few labels , itspotential is huge – especially in the youth market .
Kids and teenswith cellphones but not credit cards and time but not money will likelysee the value in watching an ad or playing a videogame with a corporatelogo in order to download free music to their cellphones .
Hype Machine scrapes scores of music blogs so you do n't have to , but the sheer volume of music on the site can be sort of overwhelming .
Last.fm has an awesome scrobbling feature that lets your friends know what you 've been listening to , great social features , and a royalty program that compensates indie artists , unlike MySpace .
But it needed a bigger selection of on - demand music even before Warner Music Group pulled out .
MySpace is still the king of band pages , but now that sites like imeem have on - demand streaming and allow external embedding , its importance could diminishing .
Plus , if ad - supported music is the future , that future only includes major labels , as far as MySpace is concerned .
Pandora probably would have made thelist if its catalog were larger and if the Copyright Royalty Boardwas n't threatening to drive it out of business with its high royalty rates .
Qtrax , " the world 's first free and legal P2P service , " has had a rocky start , with a couple of miscued launches , despite having deals in place withtwo of the big four record labels .
The company still has a long way to gobefore it realizes its full potential , but oh , what a potential that is .
Qtrax 's vision is to bring vast amount of music on P2P networks –- asmany as 25 or 30 million songs ( over three times what 's available oniTunes ) –- back onto the reservation by cleaning them up , wrapping themin DRM ( partially so that playcounts can be easily tabulated ) andpresenting them to users for free in an ad- supported environment .
The labels are apparentlyconsidering allowing this to be done , but have n't yet fully committedto the concept .
As a result , Qtrax 's catalog of official label releasescurrently reside on its own servers .
Slacker has already impressed us , but it could become a household name if they implement their plan to use Ku-band satellites to keep music updated on the devices in cars .

Hello , everyone !
It ’s been a while since I ’ve used this blog to do something more than repeat the announcements for new releases , or for changes in the Git repository .
Let ’s break the streak , and outline some of the changes that have happened in the last few months in the Clutter repository in preparation for the 1.22 release .
As you may have noticed , the development pace has slowed down considerably from the heyday of the 1.10 and 1.12 development cycles — no more apocalypses are scheduled for you .
Most of the resources I have are currently being spent on the Clutter - inside - GTK project , which is called GSK and has been outlined on my blog .
This does not mean that the development of Clutter has ceased ; since Clutter is still in use , bug fixes and new features are planned and landing in the Git repository .
Let ’s start with the biggest change , if not in terms of size of the commit at least in terms of impact for users and application developers : the GDK backend is now the default backend on Linux , instead of the X11 one .
What does this mean for users ?
It likely means that Clutter - based applications will behave much better when it comes to system integration .
GDK is the GTK + windowing system abstraction API , and it has a lot more features than Clutter ’s own .
You ’ll start noticing that things like making the ClutterStage full screen works a lot better with Clutter 1.22 , for instance , as it will respect details like the current primary monitor , as well as the monitor geometry .
For application developers this change means that you now have access to the GDK API from Clutter , and you can modify things like window decorations , or input shape , without having to resort to writing X11 - specific code using Xlib .
If your application requires the X11 backend , though , you can ( and should ) enforce this dependency using the clutter_set_windowing_backend ( ) function , which was added in Clutter 1.16 , about two years ago .
The change to using the GDK backend by default has been the result of a lot of work from Lionel Landwerlin .
Still from the backend news department , we have a new windowing system backend for the Mir display server , courtesy of Marco Treviño Trevisan .
This means that Clutter - based applications will be able to run natively under Mir .
We also have improvements in the input backends based on X11 and libinput ; changes in the latter have been driven by GNOME Shell running as a Wayland compositor , and are the result of many hours of work from Rui Matos , Jonas Ådahl , and Carlos Garnacho .
One final addition , written by Owen Taylor , for the X11 backend is the ability to tell Clutter to set up visuals using the GLX stereo buffers bit ; this means that you can set up rendering of Clutter actors differently for the right and left “ eye ” buffers .
In terms of new API , we have two changes related to how actors compute their preferred size .
The first one is a new ClutterRequestMode enumeration value , CLUTTER_REQUEST_CONTENT_SIZE
.
This new mode tells a ClutterActor to use the preferred size of its ClutterContent ( if one is assigned ) to determine its own natural size .
Since it ’s the natural size , if the actor gets allocated a smaller size by its parent , the content ’s gravity will do the rest , and control how the content is sized with regards to the actor ’s allocation .
The other new API is inside ClutterConstraint , and allows a constraint to control the preferred size of the actor using it , just like it controls the allocation .
ClutterActor will query all constraints associated to an instance and compute the preferred size depending on them .
This allows you to query an actor ’s preferred size and get sensible values , even in the case it ’s using constraints .
After getting helpful feedback on the Clutter mailing list , the documentation with regards to the deprecation notices has been improved ; the deprecated classes and functions now should all point to their replacements ( where applicable ) .
The Clutter 1.22 release is planned alongside the GNOME 3.16 release , so you can expect it by the end of March .

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is facing more accusations of racial profiling stemming from his ongoing crackdown on illegal immigrants .
This time , four U.S. citizens claim they were stopped and mistreated by sheriff 's deputies because they are Latino .
In one case , a brother and sister say deputies unnecessarily stopped them in front of their north Phoenix auto - repair shop and forced them out of the car with weapons raised .
In another , a husband and wife say sheriff 's deputies improperly asked for a Social Security card after they encountered a roadblock while leaving Bartlett Lake with their two children .
The accusations were added Wednesday to a federal lawsuit that alleges the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office is targeting Latinos to investigate immigration status by using unfounded traffic stops , racially motivated questioning and baseless arrests in a series of crime sweeps .
Sheriff 's officials rebutted the accusations and said the crime - suppression sweeps will continue .
They have taken place in Phoenix , Guadalupe and most recently in Mesa .
" The Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office does not racially profile , " said Capt .
Paul Chagolla , a spokesman for the office .
The lawsuit " will not stop Sheriff Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office from doing its work enforcing all the laws , including state and federal immigration laws . "
Chagolla said Arpaio was out of town and the office would not comment Wednesday about incidents described in the lawsuit .
The suit was first filed in December based on a legal immigrant 's complaint that he was improperly detained by sheriff 's deputies for nine hours .
The suit contends that the sweeps are a pretext for arresting illegal immigrants in violation of an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
It says sheriff 's deputies are also discriminating against Latinos as part of their day - to - day operations .
" Claiming authority under a limited agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that actually prohibits the practices challenged here , ( Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office ) have launched a series of massive so - called ' crime suppression sweeps ' that show a law enforcement agency operating well beyond the bounds of the law , " the suit says .
Vincent Picard , a spokesman for ICE , said the Sheriff 's Office has not violated the agreement .
The agreement allows up to 160 specially trained sheriff 's deputies and jail officers to enforce federal immigration laws .
The accusations filed on Wednesday attempt to add muscle to the existing lawsuit and involve U.S. citizens .
On Dec. 2 , according to the lawsuit , David and Jessica Rodriguez were leaving Bartlett Lake with their two young children when deputies pulled them over after they encountered a washed - out area of road and made a U - turn .
The suit says deputies asked David Rodriguez for a Social Security card , driver 's license , vehicle registration and proof of insurance but did not ask for documentation from other drivers who had also driven down the same closed road .
When Jessica Rodriguez asked why the deputy needed to see a Social Security card , the deputy responded , " standard procedure , " the suit says .
The suit says David Rodriguez was cited for failure to obey a traffic - control device while other drivers who were White got warnings .
On March 28 , Velia Meraz and her brother , Manuel Nieto Jr. , said they were mistreated by sheriff 's deputies in front of their family 's business , Manuel 's Auto Repair , on Cave Creek Road near East Nisbet Road .
Sheriff 's deputies were conducting a crime sweep not far from the family 's business .
The sister and brother said they had just come from a nearby convenience store where they saw a sheriff 's deputy talking to two Latino - looking men in handcuffs .
The officer yelled at them to leave , and when Meraz asked why , the deputy threatened to arrest them for disorderly conduct , the lawsuit says .
When Meraz and Nieto drove to the auto - repair shop 50 yards away , four police vehicles descended on them , blocking the street and the business , the suit says .
The officers jumped out of their vehicles with their weapons raised , and Nieto was pulled out of his car and pressed face first against his car , and handcuffed .
The officers let Nieto go after running his driver 's license information through a computer .
He was not cited .
Meraz said she and her brother were born in Chicago and moved to Arizona 17 years ago .
" I was very upset , " she said .
" I ca n't even put into words how I felt . "
" What he is doing is overstepping the line .
It 's not right , " Meraz added about Arpaio .
The incident in the December lawsuit involved Mexican immigrant Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres .
On Sept. 26 , Ortega , who was in the country legally , said he was passenger in a vehicle driven by a White driver stopped by sheriff 's deputies in Cave Creek .
Ortega said deputies detained him for nine hours .
The lawsuit is the latest legal salvo by civil liberties and Latino groups trying to prove Arpaio is using racial profiling to arrest illegal immigrants .
The suit is supported by the American Civil Liberties Union , the ACLU of Arizona and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund .
The lead attorney is David Bodney of the Phoenix firm Steptoe & Johnson .
Bodney also represents The Arizona Republic on First Amendment issues .
Proving racial profiling is a difficult task .
Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that police cannot target someone to investigate based on race because it violates equal - protection rights under the U.S. Constitution and the 1964 civil - rights act .
But proving the discrimination was intentional , as required , has become harder in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks because of concerns over limiting law enforcement 's ability to apprehend terrorists .
What McCain is claiming today :
What McCain actually said during the early days of the war :
EARLY 2003 : MCCAIN PREDICTED A SHORT WAR IN IRAQ , SAYING “ WE WILL BE WELCOMED AS LIBERATORS ”
McCain : Predicted a “ Brief , Successful War In Iraq . ”
In March 2003 , just prior to the start of military operations in Iraq , McCain said on the floor of the Senate , “ The costs of these enterprises are not known with any degree of certainty at this time .
Nor are the costs we will incur after what I believe , what I fervently , hope , will be a brief , successful war in Iraq , as we seek to establish the foundations for a peaceful , stable and democratizing Iraq . ”
McCain also added , “ I believe the war in Iraq can be concluded successfully in a relatively brief time . ”
( Congressional Record , 3/18/03 )
McCain Proclaimed “ There ’s No Doubt In My Mind … That We Will Be Welcomed As Liberators . ”
“ There ’s no doubt in my mind that once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators , ” McCain said on MSNBC ’s Hardball in March 2003 .
( MSNBC , “ Hardball ” , 3/24/03 )
McCain : Iraq War Will Be “ Relatively Short . ” During a March 2003 interview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” McCain said , “ I believe that this conflict is still going to be relatively short .
I believe we ’ve achieved significant goals and successes . ”
( NBC , “ Meet the Press , ” 3/30/03 )
McCain : End of Iraq War “ Very Much In Sight . ”
In interview on ABC ’s Good Morning America , McCain was asked “ At what point will America be able to say the war was won ? ” McCain replied .
“ We ’ve still got the oil fields in the north that have to be secured .
Tikrit , Saddam Hussein ’s hometown , I would imagine there ’ll be some die hards there that , but I think that we , it , it ’s clear that the end is very much in sight , and today I think Americans should be very proud of their leadership , their technology …
There are still some foreigners , Syrians and others hanging around .
But it wo n’t be long .
It will be a fairly short period of time , but this happens in wars .
I ’m confident that once they are confident the area is no longer a threat to the Marines and to or army troops that they ’ll start imposing discipline .
In the meantime , we ’ll have a short period of chaos . ” ( ABC , “ Good Morning America ” , 4/9/03 )
McCain Said He Was “ Sure ” The End Of Conflict In Iraq Was Near .
During an appearing on “ Lou Dobbs Moneyline , ” McCain was asked , “ Is it your judgment that we are near the end of this conflict ? ” McCain replied , “ Oh , I ’m sure that ’s true . ” ( CNN , “ Lou Dobbs Moneyline , ” 4/10/03 )
· SUMMER 2003 : MCCAIN SAID THE “ MAJOR CONFLICT ” WAS OVER IN IRAQ
McCain : “ The Major Conflict ” Is Over. McCain said in 2003 , “ I have said a long time that reconstruction of Iraq would be a long , long , difficult process ,
But the conflict , the major conflict is over …
The regime change is accomplished . ”
( Fox News , “ Your World with Neil Cavuto , ” 6/11/03 )
McCain Proclaimed “ Massive Victory ” in Iraq and Credited Combat - Readiness for “ Our Victory ” in Afghanistan and Iraq .
“ Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom demonstrated to the world what we saw just 12 years ago .
We went to war as the most combat - ready force in the world .
The value of that readiness is clear .
We won a massive victory in a few weeks , and we did so with very limited loss of American and allied lives .
We were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life , and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of Afghani and Iraqi citizens .
. . .
Our technology edge in Afghanistan and Iraq would have been meaningless if we did not have men and women trained to use it .
Having the best weapons system platforms in the world would not have given us our victory if we had not had the right command and control facilities , maintenance capabilities , and munitions . ”
( Congressional Record , 5/22/03 )
McCain : The Mission Is “ Accomplished . ”
In an interview with Salon.com .
McCain said , “ I just think — as I said — I think we will find weapons of mass destruction .
Now , I think it ’s entirely appropriate now that regime change has been orchestrated — and though the danger is certainly not over , the mission is ‘ accomplished ’ — it ’s appropriate to have a hearing . ”

The Wall Street Journal is reporting FDIC Faces Mortgage Mess After Running Failed Bank .
Federal officials heap much of the blame for the subprime mortgage mess on lenders , claiming they recklessly made too many high - cost home loans to borrowers who could n't afford them .
It turns out that the U.S. government itself was one of the lenders giving out high - interest , subprime mortgages , some of them predatory , according to government documents filed in federal court .
The unusual situation , which is still bedeviling bank regulators , stems from the 2001 seizure by federal officials of Superior Bank FSB , then a national subprime lender based in Hinsdale , Ill .
Rather than immediately shuttering or selling Superior , as it normally does with failed banks , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. continued to run the bank 's subprime - mortgage business for months as it looked for a buyer .
With FDIC people supervising day - to - day operations , Superior funded more than 6,700 new subprime loans worth more than $ 550 million , according to federal mortgage data .
The FDIC then sold a big chunk of the loans to another bank .
The Superior situation could be costly for the FDIC .
Texas - based Beal Bank SSB , which bought a portfolio of Superior loans , about half of them originated under the FDIC , is suing the agency in U.S. District Court in Washington .
The suit claims many of the loans were made improperly and are plagued with problems .
In a recent court filing , the FDIC estimated that about 1,500 of the 5,315 loans it sold to Beal either have defaulted or are nonperforming .
The FDIC already has bought back another 247 of the mortgages , most of them for violations of federal anti-predatory - lending laws intended to protect borrowers from unreasonably high fees or deceptive practices .
Beal Bank has said in court filings that 73 of the repurchased loans were originated while the FDIC was running Superior .

Introduction
When President Bush appointed General David Petraeus Commander ( head ) of the Multinational Forces in Iraq , his appointment was hailed by the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post as a brilliant decision :
A general of impeccable academic and battlefield credentials and a warrior and counter - insurgency ( terrorist ) intellectual .
The media and the President , the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and Congress , described his appointment as ‘ America ’s last best hope for salvation in Iraq ’ .
Senator Hilary Clinton joined the chorus of pro-war politicians in praise and support of Petraeus ’ ‘ professionalism and war record ’ in Northern Iraq .
In contrast , Admiral William Fallon , his predecessor and former commander , had called Petraeus ’ briefings ‘ a piece of brown - nosing chicken shit . ’
In theory and strategy , in pursuit of defeating the Iraqi resistance , General Petraeus was a disastrous failure , an outcome predictable from the very nature of his appointment and his flawed wartime reputation .
In the first instance , Petraeus was a political appointment .
He was one of the few high military officials who shared Bush and the Zioncons ’ assessment that the ‘ war could be won . ’
Petraeus argued that his experience in Northern Iraq were replicable throughout the rest of the country .
Moreover Petraeus , unlike most military analysts , was willing to ignore the heavy costs of multiple prolonged tours of duty on US troops .
Petraeus ’ willingness to ignore the larger costs of prolonged military engagement in Iraq has weakened the capacity of the US to sustain its world - wide imperial interests .
For Petraeus , sacrificing the overall cohesion and structure of the US military in Iraq , the global interests of the empire and the US domestic budget were worth securing Bush ’s appointment as Commander of the Forces in Iraq .
Shortly after taking office and in the face of massive domestic , international and Iraq demands for the withdrawal of US troops , Petraeus took the path dictated by the US and pro Israeli militarists in the Bush Administration and their powerful ‘ Lobby . ’
He escalated the war , by calling up more troops , what he euphemistically referred to as ‘ the surge ’ — a massive call - up of 40,000 more mission - weary infantry and marines .
An analysis and critique of the failure of military - driven imperialism and its militarily dangerous consequences requires an objective critical analysis of Petraeus ’ media - inflated military record prior to taking command .
Equally important Petraeus close ideological and political linkages with Israel ’s militarist approach toward Iran ( and the rest of the Middle East countries opposing it ) dates back to his close collaboration with Israel ’s ( unofficial ) military advisers and intelligence operatives in Kurdish Northern Iraq .
Petraeus ’ Phony Success in Northern Iraq
Petraeus ’ vaunted military successes in Northern Iraq — especially in Nineveh province in Northern Iraq was based on the fact that it is dominated by the Kurdish warlord tribal leaders and party bosses eager to carve an independent country .
The relative stability of the region has little or nothing to do with Petraeus ’ counter - insurgency theories or policies and more to do with the high degree of Kurdish ‘ independence ’ or ‘ separatism ’ in the region .
Put bluntly , the US and Israeli military and financial backing of Kurdish separatism has created a de facto independent Kurdish state , one based on the brutal ethnic purging of large concentrations of Turkmen and Arab citizens .
General Petraeus , by giving license to Kurdish irredentist aspirations for an ethnically purified ‘ Greater Kurdistan , ’ encroaching on Turkey , Iran and Syria , secured the loyalty of the Kurdish militias and especially the deadly Peshmerga ‘ special forces ’ in eliminating resistance to the US occupation in Nineveh .
Moreover , the Peshmerga has provided the US with special units to infiltrate the Iraqi resistance groups , and to provoke intra-communal strife through incidents of terrorism against the civilian population .
In other words , General Petreaus ’ ‘ success ’ in Northern Iraq is not replicable in the rest of Iraq .
In fact , his very success in carving off Kurd - dominated Iraq has heightened hostilities in the rest of the country and provoked Turkish attacks in the region .
Petraeus : Armchair Strategist
His theory of ‘ securing and holding ’ territory presumes a highly motivated and reliable military force capable of withstanding hostility from at least eighty percent of the colonized population .
Petraeus , like Bush and the Zionist militarists , ignores the fact that the morale of US soldiers in Iraq and those scheduled to be sent to Iraq is very low .
The ranks of those who are seeking a quick exit from military service now include career soldiers and non-commissioned officers — the backbone of the military .
The soldiers being recruited include convicted felons , mentally unstable young men , uneducated and impoverished immigrants and professional mercenaries .
Unauthorized absences ( AWOLs ) have shot up — 14,000 between 2000 - 2005 .
In March 2007 , over one thousand active - duty and reserve soldiers and marines petitioned Congress for a US withdrawal from Iraq .
By April 2008 , a record 69 % opposed Bush ’s war strategy and economic policy .
The opposition of retired and active Generals to Bush ’s escalation of troops percolates down the ranks to the ‘ grunts ’ on the ground , especially among reservists on active duty whose tours of duty in Iraq have been repeatedly extended ( the ‘ backdoor draft ’ ) .
Demoralizing prolonged stays or rapid rotation undermines any effort of ‘ consolidating ties ’ between US and Iraqi officers and certainly undermines most efforts to win the confidence of the local population .
If the US troops are deeply troubled by the war in Iraq and increasingly subject to desertion and demoralization , how less reliable is the Iraqi mercenary army ?
Iraqis recruited on the basis of hunger and unemployment ( caused by the US war ) , with kinship , ethnic and national ties to a free and independent Iraq do not make reliable soldiers .
Every serious expert has concluded that the divisions in Iraqi society are reflected in the loyalties of the soldiers .
The attempt by Petraeus and US puppet Prime Minister Maliki to invade Basra in Southern Iraq turned into a military fiasco as thousands of Iraqi soldiers joined the insurgents .
General Petraeus could not count on his Iraqi troops because scores were defecting and perhaps thousands will in the future .
An empty drill field , or worse a widespread barracks revolt , is a credible scenario .
The continued high casualty rates among US soldiers and Iraqi civilians , during his 18 months as Commander suggests that ‘ holding and securing ’
Baghdad failed to alter the overall situation .
While the addition of 30,000 US troops saturating Baghdad initially reduced civilian and military casualties there , fighting intensified in other regions and cities .
More important , the decline of violence had less to do with Petraeus ’ ‘ surge ’ and had more to do with the temporary political cease - fire reached with the anti-occupation forces of Muqtada al Sadr .
This was clear when the US and its client Prime Minister Maliki launched an offensive against Sadr ’s forces in March - April 2008 and casualties shot up , and even the US ‘ Green Zone bunker ’ came under daily rocket attacks .
After 18 months under Commander Petraeus , the Iraqi troops showed little willingness to fight their own compatriots engaged in resistance .
Thousands turned their arms over to the anti-colonial popular militias and several hundreds joined them
Petraeus ‘ rule book ’ prioritizes “ security and task sharing as a means of empowering civilians and prompting national reconciliation . ”
‘ Security ’ is elusive because what the US Commander considers ‘ security ’ is the free movement of US troops and collaborators based on the insecurity of the colonized Iraqi majority .
They continue to subject the civilian Iraqis to arbitrary house - to - house searches , break - ins and humiliating searches and arrests .
While the death toll of civilians declined from ‘ hundreds a day ’ to ‘ hundreds a week , ’ it demonstrated Petraeus ’ failure to achieve his most elementary goal .
Task Sharing as defined by Petraeus and his officers is a euphemism for Iraqi collaboration in ‘ administrating ’ his orders .
‘ Sharing ’ involves a highly asymmetrical relation of power : the US orders and the Iraqis comply .
Petraeus defines the ‘ task ’ as informing on insurgents .
The Iraqi population is supposed to provide ‘ information ’ on their families , friends and compatriots , in other words betray their own people .
The concept sounded more feasible in his manual than in practice .
US troops still are ambushed on a daily basis and insurgents , operating among the population , bomb their armored carriers .
‘ Empowering civilians , ’ another prominent concept in Petraeus ’ manual , assumed that those who ‘ empower ’ give up power to the ‘ others . ’
In other words , that the US military cedes territory , security , financial resource management and allocation to a colonized people or to the local armed forces .
During his 18 months in command , it is the ‘ empowered ’ people who protect and support insurgents and oppose the US occupation and its puppet regime .
In fact , what Commander Petraeus really meant was ‘ empowering ’ a small minority of civilians who were willing collaborators of an occupying army .
They were frequently the deadly target of the insurgents .
The civilian minority ‘ empowered ’ by the Petraeus formula requires heavy US military protection to withstand retaliation .
In practice no neighborhood civilian collaborators have been delegated real power and those who were delegated authority , are dead , hiding or secretly allied with the resistance .
Petraeus ’ goal of ‘ national reconciliation ’ has been a total failure .
The Iraqi regime is paralyzed into squabbling sects and warlords .
Reconciliation between warring parties is not on the horizon .
What Petraeus fails to recognize , but even his puppet allies publicly state , is that US colonization of Iraq is a blatant denial of the conditions for reconciliation .
Commander Petraeus and his army and the dictates of the Zionist White House play off the warring parties undermining any negotiation toward ‘ conciliation . ’
Like all preceding colonial commanders , Petraeus fails to recognize that Iraqi popular sovereignty is the essential precondition for national reconciliation and stability .
Military imposed ‘ reconciliation ’ among warring collaborator groups with no legitimacy among the Iraqi electorate has been a disaster .
Former Clintonite , Sarah Sewall ( ex - Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Harvard - based ‘ foreign affairs expert ’ ) was ecstatic over Petraeus ’ appointment .
Yet she claimed the ‘ inadequate troop to task ratio ’ would undermine his strategy .
The ‘ troop to task ratio ’ forms the entire basis of Israel and the Zioncon Democratic Senators ’ Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer ’s ’ ‘ critique ’ of Bush ’s Iraq policy .
Their solution is ‘ send more troops ’ .
While Petraeus did increase the troops with the surge , it is militarily and politically unable to mobilize 500,000 more to meet Sewall ’s ‘ troop to task ratio . ’
This argument begs the question : Inadequate numbers of troops reflects the massiveness of popular opposition to the US occupation .
The need to improve the ‘ ratio ’ ( greater number of troops ) is due to the level of mass Iraqi opposition and is directly related to increasing neighborhood support for the Iraqi resistance .
If the majority of the population and the resistance did not oppose the imperial armies , then any ratio would be adequate — down to a few hundred soldiers hanging out in the Green Zone , the US Embassy or some local brothels .
Petraeus ’ prescriptions borrowed heavily from the Vietnam War era , especially General Creighton Abram ’s Clear and Hold counter - insurgency doctrine .
Abrams ordered a vast campaign of chemical warfare spraying of thousands of hectares with the deadly Agent Orange to ‘ clear ’ contested terrain .
He approved of the Phoenix Plan — the systematic assassination of 25,000 village leaders to ‘ clear ’ out local insurgents .
Abrams implemented the program of ‘ strategic hamlets , ’ the forced re-location of millions of Vietnamese peasants into concentration camps .
In the end , Abram ’s plans to ‘ clear and hold ’ failed because each measure extended and deepened popular hostility and increased the number of recruits to the Vietnamese national liberation army .
Israel ’s brutal occupation policies in the West Bank have followed the same strategy with equally disastrous results , which does n’t prevent its advisers from selling it to the US military .
Petraeus is following the Abrams - Israeli doctrine with the same disastrous civilian casualties .
Large - scale bombing of densely populated Shia and Sunni neighborhoods has taken place since he took command .
Mass arrests of suspected local leaders accompanied by the tight military encirclement of entire neighborhoods .
Arbitrary , abusive house - to - house searches turn the poor sectors of Baghdad into one big shooting gallery and concentration camp .
Paraphrasing his predecessor , General Creighton Abrams , Petraeus wants to ‘ destroy Iraq in order to save it . ’
In fact his policy is merely punishing the civilians and deepening the hostility of the population .
In contrast , the insurgents blend into the huge slum neighborhood of Sadr City population or into the surrounding provinces of Al - Anbar , Diyala , and Salah and Din. Petraeus was able to ‘ hold ’ a people hostage with armored vehicles but he has not been able to rule with guns .
The failure of General Creighton Abrams was not due to the lack of ‘ political will ’ in the US , as he complained , but was due to the fact that ‘ clearing ’ a region of insurgents is temporary , because the insurgency is founded on its capacity to blend in with the people and then re-emerge to fight the occupation army .
Petraeus ’ fundamental ( and false ) assumptions are based on the notion that the ‘ people ’ and the ‘ insurgents ’ are two distinct and opposing groups .
He assumed that his ground forces and Iraqi mercenaries could distinguish and exploit this divergence and ‘ clear out ’ the insurgents and ‘ hold ’ the people .
The four - year history of the US invasion , occupation and imperial war , including his 18 months in command , provides ample evidence to the contrary .
With upward of 170,000 US troops and close to 200,000 Iraqi and over 50,000 foreign mercenaries , Petraeus has failed to defeat the insurgency .
The evidence points to very strong , extensive and sustained civilian support for the insurgency .
The high ratio of civilian to insurgent killings by the combined US - mercenary armies suggests that US troops have not been able to distinguish ( nor are interested in the difference ) between civilians and insurgents .
Even the puppet government complains of civilian killings and widespread destruction of popular neighborhoods by US aerial bombing .
The insurgency draws strong support from extended kin ties , neighborhood friends and neighbors , religious leaders , nationalists and patriots : these primary , secondary and tertiary ties bind the insurgency to the population in a way which can not be replicated by the US military or its puppet politicians .
Early on , General Petraeus ’ plan to ‘ protect and secure the civilian population ’ was a failure .
He flooded the streets of Baghdad with armored vehicles but was quickly forced to acknowledge that the ‘ anti - government … forces were regrouping north of the capital . ’
Petraeus was condemned to play what Lt. General Robert Gaid un-poetically called ‘ whack - a- mole : Insurgents will be suppressed in one area only to re-emerge somewhere else . ’
General Petraeus made the presumptuous assertion that the Iraqi civilian population did not know that the ‘ special operations ’ forces of the Occupation , which he directed , is responsible for fomenting much of the ethno- religious conflict .
Investigative reporter Max Fuller in his detailed examination of documents , stressed that the vast majority of atrocities … attributed to ‘ rogue ’ Shiite or Sunni militias “ were in fact the work of government - controlled commandos of ‘ special forces , ’ trained by the Americans , ‘ advised ’ by Americans and run largely by former CIA agents . ”
Petraeus ’ attempt to play Good Cop / Bad Cop in order to ‘ divide and rule ’ has been unable to weaken the opposition and has instead destabilized and fragmented the Maliki regime .
While Petraeus was able to temporarily buy the loyalty of some Northern Sunni tribal leaders , their dubious loyalties depends on multi-million dollar weekly payoffs .
In theory , Petraeus recognized the broader political context of the war : “ There is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq , to the insurgency …
In Iraq , military action is necessary to help improve security … but it is insufficient .
There needs to be a political aspect . ”
Yet the key ‘ political aspect , ’ as he put it , is the reduction , not escalation , of US troops , the ending of the endless assaults on civilian neighborhoods , the termination of the special operations and assassinations designed to foment ethnic - religious conflict , and above all a timetable to withdraw US troops and dismantle the chain of US military bases .
During his 18 - month tenure , Petraeus increased the number of troops , increased the bombing of the very people he was supposed to win over and fortified the 102 acres of US bases .
General Petraeus was not willing or in a position to implement or design the appropriate political context for ending the conflict because of his blind implementation of the Bush - Zionist ‘ war to victory ’ policy .
The gap between Petraeus ’ ‘ theoretical ’ discourse on the centrality of politics and his practice of prioritizing military victory can be explained by his desire to please the Bush - Zioncons in Washington in order to advance his own military career ( and future political ambitions ) .
The result was an exceptionally mediocre military performance , underwritten by dismal political failures and the achievement of his personal ambitions .
In April 2008 , the Bush Administration named Petraeus as head of the US Central Command , overseeing the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , Somalia and the rest of the Horn of Africa .
Petraeus replaced Navy Admiral William Fallon who was forced to resign his command by the White House and the Zioncons over his opposition to their war plans against Iran .
Even prior to his retirement , Fallon had expressed his contempt for Petraeus ’ shameful truckling to the Zionists in Northern Iraq and the Bush Know Nothings in charge of Iraq and Iran policy planning .
It is clear that Petraeus ensured his promotion on April 16 , 2008 , through his senate testimony , one week earlier ( April 8 - 9 , 2008 ) with his bellicose speech implicating Iran in the fighting deaths of US troops in Iraq .
With the purge and intimidation of military officials not willing to act as White House / Zionist poodles , Petraeus had few competitors .
Petraeus ’ promotion to the top military post , just days after his senate testimony pointing to war with Iran could not be attributed to his ( failed ) military performance , but to his slavish adherence to Bush ’s and Israel ’s push for heightened confrontation with Iran .
Blaming Iran for his failed military policies served a double purpose : it covered up his incompetence and it secured the support of leading Zionist Senators like Joseph Lieberman .
Petraeus reference to the “ need to engage in talks with some groups of insurgents ” fell on deaf ears .
His proposal was seen by the insurgents as a continuation of the divide and conquer ( or ‘ salami ’ ) tactics .
The only ‘ talks ’
Petraeus secured were with tribal leaders who demanded millions of dollars up front .
Otherwise he failed to attract any sector of the insurgency .
Petraeus proved to be an armchair tactician , wise on public relations ‘ techniques , ’ but mediocre in coming to grips with the ‘ decolonization ’ political framework in which tactics might work .
Petraeus Double Discourse
Commander Petraeus was quick to grasp the difficulty of his colonial mission .
Just a month after taking command , he engaged in the same sophistry and double discourse of any colonial general confronted with an unwinable war .
To keep the flow of funds and troops from Washington he talked of the “ reduction of killings and discontent in Baghdad , ” cleverly omitting the increase of civilian and US deaths elsewhere .
He mentioned ‘ a few encouraging signs ’ but also admitted that it is ‘ too early to discern significant trends . ’
In other words the ‘ encouraging signs ’ he expressed to the White House were of no military importance !
From the beginning Petraeus gave himself an open - ended mission by extending the time frame to secure Baghdad .
He shifted the goal posts from days and weeks to ‘ months ’ and years .
Playing with indefinite time frames in which to evaluate his performance , was a coy way to prepare the US public for prolonged warfare — with few positive results .
There is nothing like a failed general acting as a political panderer covering his ass in anticipation of military defeat .
As a military intellectual , Petraeus surely has read George Orwell ’s 1984 because he was so fluent in double - speak .
In one breath he spoke of “ no immediate need to request more US troops to be sent to Iraq , ” on the other he called for 30,000 additional troops as part of what he called ‘ the surge . ’
In March 2008 , he spoke of big advances in security and one month later he demanded a ‘ pause ’ because the puppet regime and army were not capable of defending themselves without US backing .
Petraeus ’ political manipulation of troop numbers and his blatant lies about the security situation in Iraq prepared the ground for a greater military escalation in the region .
“ Right now we do not see other requests ( for troops ) looming out there .
That ’s not to say that some emerging mission or emerging task will not require that , and if it does then we will ask for that . ” [ my emphasis ]
First there ’s a ‘ surge ’ then there is an ‘ emerging mission ’ and suddenly there are another fifty thousand troops on the ground and in the meat - grinder that is Iraq , seven battleship and aircraft carriers off the Persian and Lebanese coasts , thousands more troops in Afghanistan and $ 175 billion dollars in military spending added to the 2008 federal budget .
Petraeus Political Ambitions
The General is a fine master of ‘ double speak . ’
Yet despite superb media performances before his colleagues in the White House and Congress , Petraeus ’ military strategy is doomed to go down the same road of political - military defeat as his predecessors in Indo - China .
His military police have jailed tens of thousands of civilians and killed and injured many more .
They were interrogated , tortured and perhaps some were ‘ broken . ’
But many more took their place turning the Green Zone into a war zone under siege .
Petraeus ’ real security policy through intimidation ‘ held ’ only as long as the armored cars patrolled each neighborhood , pointing their cannons at every building .
That proved to be a temporary solution .
As soon as the troops moved on , the insurgents returned .
The insurgents re-emerge after a week because they live and work there , whereas the Marines do not and neither do the Iraqi collaborators dare .
Petraeus ran a costly colonial army , which suffers endless casualties and is not politically sustainable .
Petraeus knows that , so he chose a political route upward and out of immediate command in Iraq , shifting the burden for failure to his replacement Lieutenant General Ray Odierno .
General Petraeus realized his long - term political ambitions exceeded his military abilities .
Militarism is a stepping - stone to a higher post in Washington .
Since only winning generals or draft dodgers are elected President , Petraeus , like McCain , must present failure as success .
In his Senate testimony of April 8 - 9 , 2008 , Petraeus lied to Congress and the American people about the US military failures , fabricating accounts of progress , in order to bolster the sagging fortunes of his political patron , President Bush .
His Senate testimony and press conferences were designed to bolster Bush ’s total loss of credibility : he claimed that the war was being won , Iraq was stabilized , security and peace were ‘ around the corner ’ and that we should go to war with Iran .
If the media uncritically swallowed Petraeus testimony , the public did n’t and a host of former generals and admirals were chagrined , embarrassed and outraged that he was advancing his career by sucking up to President Bush and Israel at the expense of the troops serving under him .
Petraeus Panders to Israel ’s Fifth Column : The Iran Threat
By the spring of 2008 , as the war turned from bad to worse , as the insurgency grew in power and his leadership and strategy was transparently a sham , Petraeus played his last formidable political card .
To sustain his position and cover up his defeats in Basra , and his inability to lower US casualties or even defend the Green Zone , he blamed Iran .
It was Petraeus who charged Iranian weapons were blowing up US armored carriers ; Iranian agents were training the Iraqi resistance and defeating his army of 200,000 Iraqi collaborators .
Petraeus could not face the fact that he was losing Iraq .
He deflected attention from the failure of his entire military - political strategy in Iraq by dragging in Iran as a key military player .
In pointing to Iran , Petraeus played the dangerous game of echoing the Israeli line and providing support for a military attack on Iran promoted by the leadership of the Major American Jewish Organizations .
Even while Petraeus was covering up his failure by blaming Iran , the Iraqi puppet government was praising the Iranian government for helping to stabilize the country , using its influence on the Shia militias to hold their fire .
Puppet Prime Minister Maliki invited the Iranian President to Baghdad , signed trade agreements and praised their co-operation and efforts to stabilize the country .
The only organized group , which took up Petraeus ’ , campaign to blame Iran for the US defeats was the Zionist Power Configuration in the US .
In the Congress , media and public forums , Zionists amplified and backed Petraeus .
They see him as a critical ally in countering the National Intelligence Report absolving Iran of having a program to develop nuclear weapons .
No other high military commander , in Europe or the US , took up Petraeus call to arms against Iran… except the Israeli military command .
It is a sad commentary on the state of the US military when generals advance to the highest posts by flattering and propagandizing for the most discredited American president in memory and advance the agenda of power brokers for a foreign power .
General Petraeus , in his advance from Commander of US and ‘ allied ’ forces in Iraq to head of the US Central Command overseeing current US wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , Somalia and overseeing future wars with Iran , Lebanon and Syria , has left behind a bitter legacy of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian deaths , an unreliable Iraqi ‘ quisling ’ army , a failed client regime and a vast US bunker under constant attack .
Every military official and most experts know that he was ‘ Bush ’s man ’ and his advances were very much a product of the White House and its pro-Israel backers in the Congress .
Conclusion
The advance of Petraeus is a victory of the Zionist Power Configuration in its quest for American military leaders willing to pursue Israel ’s agenda of sanctions and war against Iran .
That is why the ZPC was a factor in the ousting of Admiral William Fallon , and why the main propaganda bulletin ( the Daily Alert ) of the Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations worked for and hailed his promotion to military overseer of the Middle East wars .
AIPAC and their bought and bonded Senators ensured Petraeus an easy time during his confirmation hearing and his unanimous endorsement .
His appointment marks the first time that the Zionist Power Configuration has trumped the views and opinions of the majority of active and retired American military officers .
How far Petraeus will go in ‘ paying back ’ his debt to his long - term Zionist backers for his meteoric rise remains to be seen .
What is certain is that they will demand that he line up with the State of Israel in pushing forth toward a war with Iran .
It is neither military honor , nor patriotism , which will restrain Petraeus from pursuing the Zionist War for Israel agenda — but his future presidential ambitions .
He will have to calculate whether a second Middle East war , which will please Israel and billionaire American (? )
Zionist political fundraisers can offset voter discontent resulting from a war in which the price of oil will rise to $ 300 dollars a barrel and cost several tens of thousands of American casualties , will further his political ambitions .
The US has degenerated into a sorry state of affairs when its future course depends on the political calculus of a feckless General , a failed counter - insurgency ‘ expert ’ and ambitious politician pandering to billionaire political contributors working for a foreign colonial power .

So many creeps , so little time .
The bronze goes to the owners of the Phillips 66 station in Marion , Kansas , who fired their employee who was robbed at gunpoint , because at the time of the robbery there was more than $ 150 in the till .
The problem was that the employee was in the process of transferring $ 100 to the safe at the time the robber entered the building to rob it .
Those guys are really strict , are n't they ?
I bet they charged their employees for the little plastic creamer tubs for their coffee too .
The silver goes to perennial nominee Bill O'Reilly , whose ego is incapable of understanding that this little feud that he has going with Keith Olbermann is only increasing Olbermann 's ratings share .
Billo knows better than to point to Olbermann by name , so his has been a campaign of slurs against the parent company of MSNBC , GE .
On this program , he tried to tie GE to sales to Iran via a German company that sold software developed by a GE subsidiary .
Of course , Bill has neither the integrity or the intellectual honesty to admit that the German company , Draeger , admitted wrongdoing and had nothing at all to do with GE .
And finally , the gold goes to Roger " Jabba the Hut " Ailes , president of FoxNews for the singularly most perplexing entertainment news since Lynn Spears announced she was writing a book on motherhood .

Wait , Rog , you guys fired a P.A. for publicly endorsing the Republican presidential nominee while in front of your own Fox cameras ?

Does this mean you ’re now going to fire everyone there ?
And not to get all tin-foil hattish on you , but McCain 's response : " You 're not supposed to reveal that , " struck me as oddly phrased , in light of what Locke said .
I would have expected " Thank you for your support " or " Well , we 're trying ... " but " You 're not supposed to reveal that " ?

We call values that loosely evaluate to false “ falsy . ”
What does “ loosely ” mean in this context ?
There are two comparison operators to test equivalence in JavaScript ( == and === ) .
The first is loose , and the second is strict .
The results of the loose form are sometimes surprising , as you ’ll soon find out .
What sorts of things are falsy ?
Douglas Crockford lists these : 0 , NaN , the empty string ( ” or “ ” ) , false , null , undefined .
In essence , they are the zero or false or empty versions of JavaScript ’s various types .
Tripped Up
The worst trouble I have with falsy values are when I ’m comparing to a number and I forget that 0 might be one of the numbers I ’m going to get .
I did this recently in my sorting post in the final bit of code .
I used == when I should have used === .
( Note : I ’ve since fixed the code in that post . )
I ’ve had this blog post in my mind for about a month .
I ’ve been waiting for a stroke of brilliance to come so I could make all this falsy stuff completely clear once and for all .
The stroke of brilliance never came , so I ’ve decided to make a table for you that tell what falsy values loosely and strictly equal other falsy values .
== / === false 0 NaN null undefined “ ” ( empty string ) ” ” ( white space ) [ ] {} false yes / yes yes / no no / no no / no no / no yes / no yes / no yes / no no / no 0 yes / no yes / yes no / no no / no no / no yes / no yes / no yes / no no / no NaN no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no null no / no no / no no / no yes / yes yes / no no / no no / no no / no no / no undefined no / no no / no no / no yes / no yes / yes no / no no / no no / no no / no “ ” ( empty string ) yes / no yes / no no / no no / no no / no yes / yes no / no yes / no no / no ” ” ( white space ) yes / no yes / no no / no no / no no / no no / no yes / yes no / no no / no [ ] yes / no yes / no no / no no / no no / no yes / no no / no no / no no / no {} no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no no / no
In the table above , you see the result of each value when compared loosely ( with == ) , then when compared strictly ( with === ) .
The next table tries to convert each value logically by negating the negation of it .
value !! value false false 0 false NaN false null false undefined false “ ” ( empty string ) false ” ” ( white space ) true [ ] true {} true
Eye - Popping Results
Most interesting observations from the tables ?
How about NaN , which does n’t even loosely equal itself ?
The empty object {} is the same way .
They are the ultimate Dr. No’s .
Interestingly , the empty array loosely equals false , 0 , and the empty string .
A string of white space loosely equals more than I thought it would .
0 and false are pretty damned close to each other .
According to the first chart , NaN , null , undefined , and {} are not falsy , because they do n’t equal false in a loose comparison .
In the second chart , ” ” ( white space ) , [ ] , and {} and not falsy .
So , now you know why it ’s safer to use === .
If you find a good use for == , make sure you ’ve thought hard about things that might go wrong .
I might even go so far as to say you should comment every usage of == , because it ’s bound to be misunderstood in many cases .
Can you tell falsies when you see them ?
I used to think I could , but now I ’m not so sure .
James F. Millican
A 21 year - old man has been arrested after a road rage altercation in Southeast Portland last night .
A Portland Police Bureau press release says that James F. Millican , who was driving a Ford Escort , chased down 37 year - old Jason Rehnberg after Rehnberg “ yelled at Millican to slow down . ”
Millican has been arrtested on one count each of Attempted Assault in the Second Degree ( felony ) , DUII , Criminal Mischief in the Third Degree and Reckless Driving ( all misdemeanors ) .
He is being held by the Multnomah County Sheriff ’s Office on $ 11,000 bail .
The incident occurred in the area of Southeast 58th Avenue and SE Washington Street .
Here ’s how it reportedly went down ( emphasis mine ) :
“ Rehnberg , who admitted that his remarks may have included profanity , stated that he rode his bicycle into the neighborhood in an effort to get away from the suspect .
When he thought Millican had driven away , the victim drove back out onto Southeast 58th Avenue .
A short time later , the victim saw the suspect who was now back in his car and ahead of the victim .
The victim stated that the suspect then backed up in an attempt to hit him with the car .
The victim jumped off the bike just before the suspect hit the bike , damaging it .
Rehnberg and two other witnesses then stood in front of Millican ’s car stating that they wanted to get the number of his license plate .
As they did so , the suspect drove his car toward the three people .
The two witnesses were able to get out of the way , but Rehnberg ended up on the hood of the suspect ’s car .
With the victim hanging on to the suspect ’s windshield wipers , the suspect drove northbound on 58th at a high rate of speed .
When the suspect reached Southeast 60th Avenue , he slowed down enough for the victim to get off the car . ”
The police say they ’ve got a video of the incident that they are holding as evidence .
( UPDATE : The Portland Mercury claims this is the video . )
This comes one week after another headline - grabbing road - rage incident in southeast Portland .
Not surprisingly , the local media are sure to pay close attention to this case .
In a post to their blog , the Willamette Week writes , “ … last week ’s battle between a motorist and a cyclist may turn into an all - out war . ”
Despite what is sure to be another onslaught of “ Car vs. Bike ” coverage , let ’s hope cooler heads prevail .

Why Do Beautiful Women Sometimes Marry Unattractive Men ?
It may be that the unattractive man has a lot of money , or some other compelling attribute .
But a new study by Satoshi Kanazawa , an evolutionary psychologist at the London School of Economics , suggests it may be a simple supply - and - demand issue : there are more beautiful women in the world than there are handsome men .
Why ?
Kanazawa argues it ’s because good - looking parents are 36 % more likely to have a baby daughter as their first child than a baby son — which suggests , evolutionarily speaking , that beauty is a trait more valuable for women than for men .
The study was conducted with data from 3,000 Americans , derived from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health , and was published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology .
According to this news article , “ Selection pressure means when parents have traits they can pass on that are better for boys than for girls , they are more likely to have boys .
Such traits include large size , strength and aggression , which might help a man compete for mates .
On the other hand , parents with heritable traits that are more advantageous to girls are more likely to have daughters . ”
Beauty is apparently just one “ female ” trait .
Kanazawa has done previous research suggesting that nurses , social workers and kindergarten teachers — those with “ empathic ” traits — also had more daughters than sons .
Meanwhile , he found that scientists , mathematicians and engineers are more likely to have sons than daughters .
It is good that Kanazawa is only a researcher and not , say , the president of Harvard .
If he were , that last finding about scientists may have gotten him fired .

The Nazis ' final atrocity : why , as they were surrendering , did one unit wipe out an entire village ?
Speeding South out of Paris on the A10 autoroute this summer , driving through the Loire countryside en route to their holiday homes , thousands of Britons will flash past the little village of Maillé without noticing .
A cluster of houses beside the main Paris - Bordeaux railway line and the motorway , it is an unremarkable little place with a few hundred inhabitants and half - a- dozen streets , one of them named Rue du 25 Aout .
In any other French community , this would commemorate a great day of national rejoicing - August 25 , 1944 , when Paris was liberated after four years of German occupation .
Death and destruction :
The French village of Maillé , just days after the slaughter of its people by German soldiers
But in Maillé , it signifies a terrible anniversary .
Because on that warm summer 's day , while the rest of France was celebrating its deliverance , Maillé 's inhabitants were wiped out by soldiers of the Third Reich bent on vengeance .
In all , 124 men , women and children - the oldest 89 , the youngest three months - were butchered .
Ten were from one family alone , eight from another , as the soldiers rampaged through the village with guns , grenades and flame - throwers .
Maillé 's fate went largely unnoticed .
In Paris , Free French soldiers advanced down the Champs Elysees and the people flooded the boulevards , tearing down swastika flags and singing the Marseillaise .
These heady , heroic scenes were what mattered , not more tragedy .
Its timbers still smouldering , Maillé quietly buried its dead in a mass grave , and the survivors - those who had fled in time or who had managed to hide in cellars and not been dragged out to die - began the process of rebuilding their lives .
The atrocity was cited as a war crime at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 .
Six years later , a Lieutenant Gustav Schlueter , a supplies officer in the Wehrmacht , the Germany Army , was tried in absentia for ordering the killings and sentenced to death by a military tribunal in Bordeaux .
But his conviction was largely meaningless .
He remained free in Germany until his natural death in 1965 .
Now , 64 years after Maillé's ' martyrdom ' , the case is being re-opened - by the Germans themselves .
This week , a prosecutor from the Nazi war crimes bureau in Dortmund arrived in the village , accompanied by two senior detectives .
Nazi war crimes prosecutor Ulrich Mass , right , and Maillé 's mayor Bernard Eliaume , third from right , at the start of a three - day visit
Their visit is unprecedented - it is the first time Germans have come onto French soil to investigate the war crimes of their own countrymen , according to Philip Varin , the regional prosecutor in Tours .
' We are providing every assistance and all surviving witnesses will be re-interviewed , ' he said .
' Perhaps the perpetrators will finally be brought to justice . '
Seventy - four - year - old Serge Martin will be one to tell his story .
Then the ten - year - old son of the village blacksmith , he was staying with his grandparents at their house just outside the village and listening to the Free French wireless station broadcasting news of the imminent surrender of German forces in Paris , 170 miles to the north .
The noise of machine - gunfire sent him scuttling to hide in the cellar from what he thought was yet another attack by the RAF on the nearby railway .
He recalls a knot tightening in his stomach as , instead of planes , he heard ' half - track ' military vehicles revving their engines and German officers barking orders .
This was no air raid .
He was listening to the sound of family , friends and neighbours being slaughtered - his own parents , his brother and two sisters among them .
Survivors Christine Truffie - Blanc , left , and Claude Daumin will give evidence
The troops had arrived in trucks at 8 am and blockaded the village .
Gendarmes who came from a nearby village to investigate the commotion were met by a hail of bullets and forced away .
In the 50 or so homes , the villagers were going about the normal business of a Friday morning .
Madame Meunier was opening up the grocery shop .
Monsieur Creuzon was chatting to a neighbour and getting ready to go to his allotment .
The postman was on his way to collect mail from another village when he saw the cordon of soldiers and froze .
He turned round , went home , scooped up his teenage wife and their 15 - month - old daughter and sought refuge in the cellar under the village school .
At 9 am , in their khaki camouflage overalls , the troops advanced , slowly and mercilessly moving through Maillé from south to north , killing anyone they could find .
Some were blown apart by grenades ; some machine - gunned ; some burned alive by flame - throwers ; some left to die slowly with their throats slashed by daggers .
In her shop , Madame Meunier was with her mother , grandmother , two - year - old son Jean and four - year - old daughter Annie when three soldiers walked in and casually opened fire .
' I was holding Jean in my arms , ' she said in statements collected by the parish priest , Abbe Peyron , in the immediate aftermath .
' The bullets grazed my lips but my little boy 's left arm was blown off and his left leg mutilated .
I collapsed to the floor , playing dead , as the soldiers were reloading their guns .
They shot my poor little Annie , killing her outright . '
The killers left to hunt out more victims , ' but I did n't dare move as soldiers were continually passing by outside .
I managed to take off my smock and lie little Jean on it .
He cried a lot to begin with , but as he lost blood , his cries became increasingly feeble .
' An hour passed , more Germans came in and I kept still , hardly able to breathe .
Jean was dead by then .
They smashed the windows with the butts of their rifles , laughing all the time , then they set fire to the place . '
Madame Meunier escaped in the thick smoke , taking her son's body with her .
' But I did n't have the strength or courage to get my other child ; she burned in the shop . '
Monsieur Creuzon was standing near the church with his neighbour when 50 soldiers , he estimated , walked towards them , firing at will .
His 18 - year - old cousin , Fernand , was washing himself at the village water trough and began to run .
A shot in the back killed him .
The two others hid in the forge , behind the blacksmith 's workbench , and were soon joined there by half a dozen other frightened villagers .
Outside , gunfire resounded .
The house next door burst into flames .
As the fire spread , they knocked out planks at the back of the building to escape .
But the blacksmith , 34 - year - old Rene Martin , refused to leave .
He could not believe what was happening .
' People do n't get shot just like that , ' he told the others .
He had a white handkerchief .
' I 'll wave this with my hands up and shout " Kamerad " , ' the German for friend .
He never got the chance .
Soldiers came into the yard and hit him with their first shot .
He fell screaming in agony .
His wife and three children were gunned down , too .
Creuzon leapt through the hole in the wooden wall and ran away blindly until he caught sight of a group of villagers cowering in a pile of firewood .
Gratefully , he pulled himself in alongside them .
Unusually , ten members of the Confolent family were at home together when the gunfire started .
In the kitchen , 17 - year - old Rene was the first to hear the gate creak open and footsteps outside .
' Papa , it 's the Germans , ' he whispered to his father .
Bravely , Monsieur Confolent went to confront them .
' A soldier burst in like a madman , ' he recalled , ' firing his sub- machine - gun . '
Like other villagers , he was incredulous .
Why were the Germans doing this ?
They had been stationed in the area since 1940 and many were quartered in local homes .
He tried to explain to the soldiers that they were civilians but another hail of bullets sent him diving .
Another son , Yves , also tried to reason with the soldiers but was mown down .
One German spun round , firing in every direction .
Rene fell with a bullet in his side .
His 14 - year - old sister Héléne was hit in the thigh .
The rest hurled themselves to the floor and played dead until the soldiers left .
The terrible silence was broken only by the mortally wounded Rene reciting the Catholic act of confession .
But their ordeal was not over .
Another ' assassin ' appeared , finished off Hélélne with a bullet to the heart and shot Madame Confolent .
One by one the family fell , until Confolent had lost four of his five sons and both daughters .
Their grandmother burned to death in her bedroom .
He hid , cradling his wife until she died .
He listened in terror to the mayhem beyond the walls of his house .
' Shots fired in the street shook the shutters , and bullets thudded into the wall .
I heard Madame Martin , the blacksmith 's wife scream : " Do n't kill my child ! "
Then firing silenced her . '
It was late afternoon before Confolent emerged , with just one remaining hope - that his eldest son , Pierre , who had been away from the house working , might have survived .
But the young man must have come back because he , too , lay dead in the yard .
On the garden path , Monsieur Confolent laid out nine bodies , his entire family .
By then , the village lay in ruins .
At midday , after the troops withdrew , heavy guns opened up to flatten everything within range .
Only the church and a café remained standing .
Now , the shocked survivors emerged from their hiding places , overwhelmed by the destruction and the bodies of family and friends in the streets .
That night , while the rest of France toasted victory , the Maillé survivors could only wonder why their village had been marked out for this eleventh hour slaughter ?
The harsh fact is that these were the most dangerous of times .
Ever since the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944 , the Germans had been hair - trigger edgy .
Emerging Resistance fighters across the country made them nervier still .
The Maillé area , strategically situated on the north - south railway line , was a magnet for the Resistance , who had attempted to blow up the line and twice launched attacks on the station .
Then , on August 11 , the Germans were angered when an RAF pilot who baled out over the village was spirited away by locals before he could be captured .
On the evening of August 24 , tensions were at breaking point .
Some German forces were holding their ground , as Hitler had instructed .
Others were in full retreat .
It was a time for caution rather than bravado .
But at around seven o'clock that evening , a truck of Resistance fighters drove into a farmyard near Maillé to commandeer supplies .
Simultaneously , two German Army vehicles arrived at the same place .
A fire - fight broke out .
Armed with Sten guns dropped to them by a British plane , the partisans had the upper hand , and a number of German soldiers were killed .
Immediately afterwards - and in accordance with policy laid down by Hitler and Himmler on how to deal with ' terrorists ' - a family on a nearby farm were lined up to be shot as a reprisal .
But the executioner 's gun jammed and they ran for their lives .
One of the officers caught in the fight with the Resistance was Schlueter , who , back at his barracks , telephoned his superiors in Tours .
' Should I act against them ? ' he is said to have asked .
The reply was emphatic : ' Yes. Attack Maillé .'
The order was ambiguous .
Was he being told to take a patrol into the village to root out partisans ?
Or was he to initiate mass slaughter as a lesson - just as at Oradour - sur - Glane , 100 miles to the south where , six weeks earlier , the Das Reich division of the Waffen SS systematically slaughtered 642 villagers as a reprisal for Resistance activity ?
Either way , the soldiers who descended on Maillé acted as if everyone they came across was guilty .
Their barbaric job done , they left behind scribbled notes , two of which survive to this day , proclaiming : ' This is punishment for the terrorists and their accomplices . '
Now the German investigators who are visiting Maillé this week will hope to discover the precise order , who gave it and how high up the chain of command it went .
Unprecedented : Maillé 's mayor , Bernard Eliaume , left , shakes hands with German war crime investigator Ulrich Mass
But they will also have to examine a bigger question : who actually carried out the killings ?
German documents have never been found to identify the unit responsible .
' Rogue killings ' was one official explanation .
Gustav Schlueter - the man found guilty in absentia by a war crimes tribunal - was a Wehrmacht officer in command of a logistics unit and , though a Nazi Party member , there must be grave doubts that he led his men in murder on such a scale and carried out with such savagery .
Did he have help ?
It turns out that in the area at the time were battle - hardened troops of the feared Waffen SS - the elite of the Nazi military , owing direct allegiance to Hitler .
The men of the 17th Gˆtz von Berlichingen panzer division were retreating from Normandy where they had sustained heavy losses after weeks of fighting Allied troops .
They had taken a beating and , exhausted , were heading for the German border to regroup .
They had scores to settle .
They were a brutal bunch , named fittingly after a scary medieval German knight who had brandished a prosthetic iron hand in place of the one hacked off in battle .
Many were not German but recruits from Romania , which had sided with the Nazis in 1940 .
The division as a whole was implicated in numerous war crimes , including the murder of wounded American paratroopers after D - Day .
According to military historian Jean - Luc Leleu of Caen University , an acknowledged expert on the Waffen SS , the 17th division are ' strong suspects ' .
They have been accused before , but exonerated because they were never armed with heavy guns of the sort that flattened the village after the massacre .
But , says Leleu , in the chaos at this stage of the war , it was entirely possible that elements of the 17th were fighting with members of the regular Wehrmacht .
Previously , there was also an issue over the uniforms worn by the killers .
Survivors recalled their khaki combats , not the black uniforms associated with the SS .
But , says Leleu , a mechanised SS infantry division like the 17th routinely wore camouflage .
' It is a mistake to imagine that the bad guys were in black and the ordinary soldiers in green .
The distinction was frequently blurred , ' he says .
He believes that , unlike Oradour , where the populace was first assembled in the town square before being systematically executed , the Maillé massacre was spontaneous , with very little planning - ' that 's why there are so few records of what happened ' .
But there are still the memories of those who survived , though , over the years , they have largely been ignored .
The truth is the slaughter of their families and friends has been the forgotten massacre .
The world remembers Oradour , not least because General de Gaulle , the French leader , decreed it should remain a ruin as a memorial of Nazi cruelty .
But Maillé , rebuilt by the end of the 1940s and displaying nothing of its agony apart from a single memorial stone with 124 names on it , slipped through the net of remembrance .
Six decades later , is there a real chance of the perpetrators being made to pay for their crimes , even supposing any are still alive ?
' Germany has been very active in setting up the latest inquiry , ' says Leleu , ' but we will have to see how rigorous it will be in pursuing guilty parties . '
Meanwhile , Serge Martin waits for answers and explanations for the murder in cold blood of his parents , his nine - year - old brother Raymond , four - year - old sister Josiane and baby Danielle , six months .
Their loss still haunts him .
' I think about what happened all of the time .
Unspeakable acts were carried out by men incapable of showing any mercy .
We need to know who they were and why they did it .'
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted on Tuesday to put a one - year ban on new fast - food restaurants in one of the city ’s poorest areas , marking the latest effort by a municipality to fight rising obesity rates .

If approved by the mayor , the ordinance would put a moratorium on construction of new fast - food outlets in a 32 - square - mile ( 82 - sq - km ) area of Los Angeles .
The measure could also be extended for a second year .
The change would affect about half a million Angelenos living in an area that supporters say already has about 400 fast - food eateries and few grocery stores or other outlets for fresh , healthy food .
The 13 - 0 vote came about a year after research found that roughly 30 percent of children living in the South Los Angeles , West Adams , Baldwin Hills and Leimert Park areas are obese compared to about 21 percent in the rest of the city .
The moratorium would also be accompanied by moves to encourage more grocery chains and fresh food stores to open for business , supporters said .
Fast - food chains opposed the measure , saying that their industry was being unfairly blamed for causing the childhood obesity epidemic .
“ Obesity is principally related to what and how much a consumer eats , not where he eats , ” Andrew Puzder , Chief Executive of Carl ’s Jr parent CKE Restaurants Inc , said in a letter to Council President Eric Garcetti .
Andrew Casana , spokesman for the California Restaurant Association , said fast - food companies were working to block ordinance or to make amendments to it .
“ We have not ruled out lawsuits , ” Casana said .
Several U.S. cities have adopted measures forcing the restaurant industry to adopt healthier standards .
California banned the sale of soft drinks in middle and elementary schools in 2003 and a new law requires fast - food restaurants in New York to post calorie counts above the service counter .
Tofu is a widely eaten soy product Eating high levels of some soy products - including tofu - may raise the risk of memory loss , research suggests .
The study focused on 719 elderly Indonesians living in urban and rural regions of Java .
The researchers found high tofu consumption - at least once a day - was associated with worse memory , particularly among the over - 68s .
The Loughborough University - led study features in the journal Dementias and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders .
Soy products are a major alternative protein source to meat for many people in the developing world .
This kind of research into the causes of Alzheimer 's could lead scientists to new ways of preventing this devastating disease .

But soy consumption is also on the increase in the west , where it is often promoted as a " superfood " .
Soy products are rich in micronutrients called phytoestrogens , which mimic the impact of the female sex hormone oestrogen .
There is some evidence that they may protect the brains of younger and middle - aged people from damage - but their effect on the ageing brain is less clear .
The latest study suggests phytoestrogens - in high quantity - may actually heighten the risk of dementia .
Lead researcher Professor Eef Hogervorst said previous research had linked oestrogen therapy to a doubling of dementia risk in the over - 65s .
She said oestrogens - and probably phytoestrogens - tended to promote growth among cells , not necessarily a good thing in the ageing brain .
Alternatively , high doses of oestrogens might promote the damage caused to cells by particles known as free radicals .
A third theory is that damage is caused not by the tofu , but by formaldehyde , which is sometimes used in Indonesia as a preservative .
The researchers admit that more research is required to ascertain whether the same effects are found in other ethnic groups .
However , previous research has also linked high tofu consumption to an increased risk of dementia in older Japanese American men .
Fermented product Professor David Smith , of the University of Oxford , said tofu was a complex food with many ingredients which might have an impact .
However , he said : " There seems to be something happening in the brain as we age which makes it react to oestrogens in the opposite way to what we would expect . "
The latest study also found that eating tempe , a fermented soy product made from the whole soy bean , was associated with better memory .
Professor Hogervorst said the beneficial effect of tempe might be related to the fact that it contains high levels of the vitamin folate , which is known to reduce dementia risk .
" It may be that that the interaction between high levels of both folate and phytoestrogens protects against cognitive impairment . "
She also stressed that there was no suggestion that eating tofu in moderation posed a problem .
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , which funded the study , said more research was needed to pin down the potential risks and benefits of so - called superfoods .
However , she said : " This kind of research into the causes of Alzheimer 's could lead scientists to new ways of preventing this devastating disease .
" As over half a million people have Alzheimer 's in the UK today , there is a desperate need to find a new prevention or cure . "

America 's Most Walkable Cities
America 's most walkable cities are also among America 's most sustainable cities , its healthiest and most prosperous communities and its happiest places .
Where people live in proximity to shops , schools and jobs , and where sidewalks and other pedestrian pathways create safe attractive environments , walking is a way of life .
There are fewer fuel - burning vehicles , less pollution , more commerce , higher property values and , often , more parks and outlying open spaces preserved for posterity .
There are community gathering points for farmers ' markets and outdoor entertainment .
Plus , people use their legs to do more than switch from the gas pedal to the brake .
That 's why when it comes to sustaining the quality of the environment , the biggest gains often come from improving inner cities .
America
Walks has recently updated its list of America 's Most Walkable Cities , to highlight the places making the most progress .
It compares Census data and a variety of parameters in 2,500 U.S. cities to determine its Walk Score rankings based on principles of New Urbanism .
If you live in one of these communities , feel pride .
And if you 're traveling , consider making one of these cities a destination .
The Pentagon is pulling out all the stops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It is sending " mine - resistant , ambush - protected " vehicles into the battlefield .
It is also using cutting - edge biometric technologies to identify insurgents .
But that is not all .
The US military has developed a new programme known as the Human Terrain System ( HTS ) to study social groups in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The HTS depends heavily on the co-operation of anthropologists , with their expertise in the study of human beings and their societies .
Steve Fondacaro , a retired special operations colonel overseeing the HTS , is keen to recruit cultural anthropologists .
" Cultural anthropologists are focused on understanding how societies make decisions and how attitudes are formed .
They give us the best vision to see the problems through the eyes of the target population , " he said .
But very few anthropologists in the US are willing to wear a uniform and receive the mandatory weapons training .
In fact , a group known as the Network of Concerned Anthropologists has already circulated a pledge of non-participation in the Pentagon 's counter - insurgency efforts .
' Collective genius ' The Human Terrain System currently includes six teams embedded in military units at the brigade and division levels in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Each team is composed of at least one social scientist , usually an anthropologist , a language specialist , and retired army personnel or reservists from special operations , intelligence , and civil affairs backgrounds .
I feel the need to protect the safety , well - being and interests of those who shared with me their knowledge and histories Anthropologist against the HTS " You have social scientists to understand the deep complexity of the problems on the ground in the society and the military personnel who then take that information and help apply it to the military decision - making process , " says Col Fondacaro .
" Together they bring collective genius to the problems , " he adds .
The cost of this " collective genius " is about $ 400,000 ( ? 200,000 ) annually for each civilian member of the team , including the soaring cost of kidnapping insurance .
As with many programmes , the Pentagon has partially outsourced the HTS , and defence contractor BAe Systems hires the social scientists .
' Weaponised anthropology ' Winning the trust of the indigenous populations " is at the heart of the struggle between coalition forces and the insurgents " , BAe 's job advertisement for field anthropologists emphasises .
But it has not convinced many anthropologists in the US .
Last year , their largest professional organisation , the American Anthropological Association ( AAA ) , called for an end to the Iraq war .
Since then , AAA has set up a national commission to review the involvement of anthropologists in national security work .
Many anthropologists in the US consider it unethical to work with the HTS teams .
They are worried about the potential risks to the human subjects of their studies .
" I feel the need to protect the safety , well - being and interests of those who shared with me their knowledge and histories .
My ultimate responsibility is to protect them , " says a social anthropologist specialising in the Middle East .
A vocal critic , Roberto Gonzalez , professor of anthropology at San Jose State University , accuses the Pentagon of trying to , as he puts it , " weaponise " anthropology .
He believes that HTS units are likely to operate " as full - blown counterinsurgency teams akin to what the British employed in the colonies over a half - century ago " .' Alienation ' But Col Fondacaro dismisses such criticism , insisting that the programme is misunderstood .
" This is different from anything we have faced before .
It is a new doctrine , new organisation , new task , and new purpose .
People are uncomfortable with new things , " he says .
Col Fondacaro believes that since the Vietnam War , many social scientists in the US have been alienated from government service .
He acknowledges that recruiting a qualified social scientist is a significant challenge .
" There is a very brave and very courageous group of young anthropologists helping .
They are taking significant risks professionally and physically , " he says .
One of these is Dr Marcus B Griffin , professor of anthropology and sociology at Christopher Newport University in Virginia , who blogs actively from Iraq .
" I am working out regularly .
I cut my hair in a high and tight style and look like a drill sergeant ...
I shot very well with the M9 and M4 last week at the range , " writes Dr Griffin .
Dr Griffin is not a Middle East Expert .
He says on his blog that he specialises in human populations , the environment , and food .
For Dr Montgomery McFate , a main architect of the HTS , anthropologists ' " unique set of skills , methodologies and perspectives " are key .
"
If the lead social scientist in the team does not have a background in the Middle East , other members must have a strong background in the region to make up for that person .
It is a team effort , " says Dr McFate , a cultural anthropologist .
She rejects the criticism that she is trying to " militarise " anthropology but rather " anthropologise " the Pentagon .
Rapid expansionUS
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has authorised $ 40 m ( ? 20 m ) to expand the Human Terrain System .
The US Central Command ( Centcom ) is looking to increase the programme 's number of teams in Iraq and Afghanistan from six to 28 .
According to Col Fondacaro , the new teams will be larger ; they will have nine members , including two social scientists .
He also says that officials at the new US Africa Command ( Africom ) and the US Pacific Command ( Pacom ) have also indicated interest in the Human Terrain teams .
The programme , which was being tested on a small scale , is now set to be expanded very quickly despite the strong objections of many anthropologists .

Former shadow home secretary David Davis has eased to victory in the Haltemprice and Howden by - election with a 15,355 majority and 72 % of the vote .
He quit as an MP in June over the government 's plans to detain terror suspects for up to 42 days .
The Tory MP said voters had delivered a " stunning message to the government " .
The turnout was 34 % , with the Green Party coming second on 1,758 votes and the English Democrats third on 1,714 .
The Lib Dems and Labour did not stand .
' Ransacked ' Mr Davis said : " We have fired a shot across the bows of Gordon Brown 's arrogant , arbitrary and authoritarian government . "
He said he would return to Westminster on Monday with a mandate " to fight Gordon Brown 's vision of Big Brother Britain tooth and nail , to stop 42 days in its tracks , to prevent the disaster of ID cards before it happens , to protect our personal privacy from being ransacked by the ever - intrusive state " .
We have fired a shot across the bows of Gordon Brown 's arrogant , arbitrary and authoritarian government
David Davis MP
By-election : Full results
He admitted it was unlikely that Tory leader David Cameron would invite him back onto the party 's front bench .
" I took on board that I would lose my shadow cabinet post and probably my shadow cabinet future , " he said .
" I accept that . "
Mr Davis denied that he would become a " single - issue campaigner " , but promised to " put a lot of effort " into opposing 42 days ' detention .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " The trouble with this is , from the beginning , the Westminster village has n't really understood that someone wants to take a stand on a matter of principle that may have some effect on themselves . "
' Vain stunt '
Mr Davis also accused the government of " spectacular cowardice " for not fielding a candidate .
But Home Office minister Tony McNulty called the by - election had been " a vain stunt that became and remains a farce " .
He added : " Labour never believed a parliamentary by - election should be held at taxpayers ' expense to resolve tensions at the top of the Conservative Party . "
The Green Party questioned Mr Davis 's stance on some civil liberties issues - including his support for the 28 - day limit on holding terror suspects without charge , increased from 14 days in 2005 , and his views on capital punishment and gay rights .
Rape law campaigner Jill Saward , who stood as an independent , criticised his opposition to extending the DNA database and CCTV - which she sees as " the very tools the police need to keep us safe " .
Out of a record 26 by - election candidates , 23 lost their deposits after failing to attract 5 % of the vote .
At the last general election Mr Davis won the seat with a 5,116 majority .
However , the 17,113 votes he polled were fewer than the 22,792 he achieved at the 2005 election , and turnout was also down from 70.2 % .
The Lib Dems - who came second in 2005 - chose not to run because they also opposed the government 's plans to extend the time limit on holding terrorism suspects .
Labour refused to stand , describing the by - election as a farce and a waste of more than £ 80,000 of public money .
After the result was declared , Mr Davis said that before he resigned his seat , polls showed 69 % of people supported the government on 42 days .
That figure now stood at 39 % , he added .
Among those who backed his campaign and attended debates in the constituency were Bob Geldof , Iraq war veteran Col Tim Collins and Labour MP Bob Marshall Andrews .
Other parties who contested the election included the English Democrats and Christian Party .

Yahoo
Inc executives dismissed a search - advertising deal with Google due to antitrust concerns , one day before Microsoft Corp made its takeover offer earlier this year , according to court documents made public on Monday .
The position came to light in a complaint filed by attorneys representing two Michigan pension funds in a shareholder lawsuit that aims to revoke Yahoo takeover defenses and press the company to renew merger talks with Microsoft .
" We are focused on long - term value creation rather than short - term gains , " said a Yahoo document prepared for Yahoo executives ahead of an " all hands " internal meeting on January 30 -- the day before Microsoft made its merger offer .
Bracing for employee questions over whether Yahoo should outsource its search - ad sales to Google , executives were prepared to argue that any short - term gains would derail Yahoo's long - term push to become a " must buy " for advertisers .
" Short - term analysis of the revenue potential of outsourcing monetization may not take into account the longer term impact on the competitive market if search becomes an effective monopoly , " an excerpt from the company document said .
Monetization refers to sales of search - related ads .
These comments appear to contrast with Yahoo's subsequent position when it announced on April 9 that it was conducting a test with rival Google , the market leader in Web search and related advertising , to rely on Google to sell its search ads .
TURNABOUT
The turnabout was part of a strategy by Yahoo management to seek alternatives for its business instead of settling for Microsoft 's cash - and - stock offer at $ 31 per share , which the company 's board had rejected as undervaluing Yahoo's assets .
Microsoft challenged the possible Google - Yahoo tie - up as anti-competitive , citing Google 's growing dominance of the Web search business and its even larger share of ad sales tied to Web search results .
Government regulators also rushed to say they would investigate any Google - Yahoo partnership .
Web search is increasingly strategic as most people find information on the Internet via such systems .
Search - based advertising , because of its high degree of targeting , has become a great money spinner for Google .
Yahoo has acknowledged that a gap exists between what it makes running its own advertising alongside its search results and the improved payback it could see by using Google 's ad - sales systems in conjunction with Yahoo 's search operation .
" We , in fact , have some understanding of what they ( Google ) could do for us and what we could do for them , " Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang told a conference last week .
A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled on Monday that excerpts from confidential Yahoo company documents could be made public in the investor suit after initially sealing some of the information in a filing made last month .
A Yahoo statement said the company was disappointed at the judge 's ruling to unseal Yahoo internal documents but said it would have little bearing on the outcome of the case .
A company spokeswoman would not comment on papers revealed in the case .
It is ok to be a woman .
It is ok to be a homemaker .
When I was young , I was what you would call today a slut .
Nobody thought anything of it , nobody commented or judged .
But I did get hurt and damaged by it .
So desperate for someone 's approval , so hungry for somebody 's love , I fell in love with all the wrong men .
This generation 's men are mostly damaged goods too , not just women .
When I grew up , during the 80s , there was a long string of divorces by men in their 40s , who after reached the heights for their success , wanted a younger model .
" She " , the now wife of over 15 years , was frequently discarded like an old shoe , something to be embarrassed about .
I noticed and so did many girls .
In your posts , you often discuss the importance of men taking leadership in a relationship .
I have never ever experienced that .
If I did n't do what was required and lead , nothing happened .
Also , I am an intelligent , extremely well - educated woman with a wide range of interests .
Most men are intimidated by it .
Others just want another mother .
It is not after I became a proper Christian and after my divorce , that I heard some proper preaching or explanation about what relationships ought to be .
Moreover , my father , who was at home with my mom and my sister , never ever sat me down to explain life to me .
Not he or my mom talked to me what my worth is or what type of man I should be looking for , what to expect from a long term relationship and what to do when things get difficult .
Somebody else was always more important or something bad was happening .
We had long - term family issues , so I just grew up , the pretty , well behaved , good girl with very good reports at school and generally good success .
I wish somebody had talked to me .
Would have saved me and my ex-husband a lot of grief .
And maybe my fantastic kids could have their dad at home .
My now - husband , a much older man , talks to me , listens to me and explains things to me .
I am 50 - years - old now and we have been together for 8 years .
It is with him that for the first time in my life I feel safe in a relationship .
He will not leave me for some tart and he taught me how to talk things out .
I learned with him how to apologise and make up .
He gives me all the space I need and yet we are always together .
May the Lord forgive us women for our sins and help us how to do right by Him .
May the Lord help us to forgive the hurts we have received .
May the Lord deliver us from this satanic , Communist evil that has poisoned our collective minds .
In Jesus Name Amen .
The fictional scenario of mobs of crazed women defecting to Mr. McCain is just one subplot of the master narrative that has consumed our politics for months .
The larger plot has it that the Democratic Party is hopelessly divided , and that only a ticket containing Mrs. Clinton in either slot could retain the loyalty of white male bowlers and other constituencies who tended to prefer her to Mr. Obama in the primaries .
This is reality turned upside down .
It ’s the Democrats who are largely united and the Republicans who are at one another ’s throats .
Yet the myth of Democratic disarray is so pervasive that when “ NBC Nightly News ” and The Wall Street Journal presented their new poll results last week ( Obama , 47 percent ; McCain , 41 percent ) they ignored their own survey ’s findings to stick to the clichéd script .
Both news organizations ( and NBC ’s sibling , MSNBC ) dwelled darkly on Mr. Obama ’s “ problems with two key groups ” ( as NBC put it ) : white men , where he is behind 20 percentage points to Mr. McCain , and white suburban women , where he is behind 6 points .
Since that poll gives Mr. Obama not just a 19 - point lead among all women but also a 7 - point lead among white women , a 6 - point deficit in one sliver of the female pie is hardly a heart - stopper .
Nor is Mr. Obama ’s showing among white men shocking news .
No Democratic presidential candidate , including Bill Clinton , has won a majority of that declining demographic since 1964 .
Mr. Kerry lost white men by 25 points , and Mr. Gore did by 24 points ( even as he won the popular vote ) .
“ NBC Nightly News ” was so focused on these supposedly devastating Obama shortfalls that there was no mention that the Democrat beat Mr. McCain ( and outperformed Mr. Kerry ) in every other group that had been in doubt : independents , Catholics , blue - collar workers and Hispanics .
Indeed , the evidence that pro-Clinton Hispanics are flocking to Mr. McCain is as nonexistent as the evidence of a female stampede .
Mr. Obama swamps Mr. McCain by 62 percent to 28 percent  a disastrous G.O.P. setback , given that President Bush took 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004 , according to exit polls .
No wonder the McCain campaign no longer lists its candidate ’s home state of Arizona as safe this fall .

There are many ways that Mr. Obama can lose this election .
But his 6 - percentage - point lead in the Journal - NBC poll is higher than Mr. Bush ’s biggest lead ( 4 points ) over Mr. Kerry at any point in that same poll in 2004 .
So far , despite all the chatter to the contrary , Mr. Obama is not only holding on to Mrs. Clinton ’s Democratic constituencies but expanding others ( like African - Americans ) .
The same cannot be said of Mr. McCain and the G.O.P. base .
The digital music revolution has been compromised , according to Kid Rock , because digital music stores and record labels still manage to hoard the lion 's share of music revenue .
He advises fans to download his music for free from P2P services , although he himself does n't have to .
" I do n't steal things , " he told the BBC .
" I 'm rich . "
As for everyone else , he says , " Download it illegally , I do n't care .
I want you to hear my music so I can play live . "
Rock 's tirade was apparently precipitated by a request from his record label , Warner Music Group 's Atlantic Records , that he publicly denounce file sharing .
His response : " Wait a second , you 've been stealing from the artists for years .
Now you want me to stand up for you ? "
Ouch .
It seems there 's no one way that artists are responding to the opportunities and challenges presented by the internet .
It 's official now :
They 're all over the map when it comes to downloads , DRM , file sharing and the rest of it , no longer offering the same rationales for completely different conclusions .
" ITunes takes the money , the record company takes the money , andthey do n't give it to the artists , " added the country rock rapper .
Instead , he says , the internet offers a " great opportunity for everyoneto be treated fairly , for the consumerto get a fair price , for the artist to be paid fairly , for the recordcompanies to make some money . "
This makes a lot of sense , and it's the sort of thing that thedigital music optimists among us have been saying for years .
However ,
Rock expands on the idea , positing that anyone who needs somethingshould just take it : " I do n't mind people stealingmy music , that 's fine .
But I think they should steal everything .
Youknow how much money the oil companies have ?
If you need some gas , justgo fill your tank ( up ) and drive off , they 're not going to miss it . "
Kid Rock 's iTunes boycott is in full effect .
As of rightnow , none of his Warner - era albums are available on iTunes , where onlyhis rarely heard debut – 1990's Grits Sandwiches for Breakfaston Zomba Recordings – is available ( clicking the link spawns iTunes ) .
Meanwhile , Metallica has been busy apologizing for its management company 's testosterone - fueled deletion of early reviews of their upcoming album – more on that soon .
( Update : See " Pasture of Muppets : Inside The Metallica Reviews Scandal " ) .

Fishing in the stream of consciousness , researchers now can detect our intentions and predict our choices before we are aware of them ourselves .
The brain , they have found , appears to make up its mind 10 seconds before we become conscious of a decision -- an eternity at the speed of thought .
Their findings challenge conventional notions of choice .
" We think our decisions are conscious , " said neuroscientist John - Dylan Haynes at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin , who is pioneering this research .
" But these data show that consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg .
This does n't rule out free will , but it does make it implausible . "
Through a series of intriguing experiments , scientists in Germany , Norway and the U.S. have analyzed the distinctive cerebral activity that foreshadows our choices .
They have tracked telltale waves of change through the cells that orchestrate our memory , language , reason and self - awareness .
In ways we are only beginning to understand , the synapses and neurons in the human nervous system work in concert to perceive the world around them , to learn from their perceptions , to remember important experiences , to plan ahead , and to decide and act on incomplete information .
In a rudimentary way , they predetermine our choices .

Just as the title says .
The saddest achievements ( in the Xbox sense ) you 've ever , uhm , achieved .
For me , the saddest is Little Rocket Man in Half - Life 2 Episode 2 .
I spent all that time in the game escorting and protecting that little garden gnome .
He became like a friend to me , a stalwart companion to both Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance .
And then , out of some twisted whim , the " good " doctor throws wee gnomey into the rocket 's payload area and closes the door .
I was devastated .
All that time and effort keeping my gnome nearby and safe , and just like that he 's gone .
I almost cried .

I remember one thing that happened to me in Sims 2 that kind of made me sad .
I had 4 Sims , a mom , a dad , a little boy and a teenage daughter .
One day , the dad was cooking something , and the house went on fire .
The dad ran to the phone , but he could n't get it because a bed was blocking it .
Eventually , the dad and the teenage daughter burnt to a crisp .
The mother was so depressed by the loss of her husband and daughter , she would n't even feed her son .
Eventually , they took the boy away from her .
Finally , the mother sim died of depression .
And that was the end of my Sim family ... [ sad ]

If you have enough money at that point , well she rides off in the sunset with you , but if you do n't , then the gold - digging bitch prances off on her own .
I was eleven years old .
Guess which ending I got .
Anyone remember the old game Tin Star ?
Anyone ?

The Washington Post devoted 4300 words of its April 13 magazine to an article about “ Humans vs. Zombies , ” a small phenomenon that started at Baltimore ’s Goucher College and has since spread to larger universities like Penn State and Cornell .
( Read the article here . )
The game is essentially a glorified version of tag — one player starts as the “ Original Zombie ” and the rest start as “ humans ” that get tagged and converted to the mock undead .
The ranks of either side grow based on strategy and planning until one is declared a winner .
Most people probably passed time in a similar way throughout their childhood .
But “ H v. Z , ” as it ’s commonly abbreviated , is n’t meant as a pleasant way to spend a spring day .
At Goucher , where the Post profile was set , the game includes 200 students , frequently lasts a week or more , and requires plenty of firepower in the form of Nerf guns .
Max Temkin , a ringleader of Goucher ’s human division and the main subject of the Post piece , was more than happy to exhibit all of his 10 Nerf weapons to reporter Laura Wexler .
He pontificates about his “ inner child ” and the “ weird kid ” camaraderie that H v. Z promotes , unmoved by anyone who might feel threatened by roving packs of gun-toting students prowling their campus ( wearing , in his own case , “ steel - toed ‘ zombie - stomping boots ’ ” ) .
He also never makes it clear why , of all days , Goucher students chose to start the spring 2008 H v. Z game on April 16 , the one - year anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings perpetrated by Seung Hui Cho , another nerd with a penchant for artillery .
No , Temkin did n’t address such things because a school shooting is a serious matter , and nerds of this intensity are incapable of confronting serious issues head - on .
In the May 8 , 2007 edition of The Quindecim , Goucher ’s school paper , Temkin called H v. Z “ a peculiarity that exists at Goucher that you could n’t find at any other school . ”
Now that the game has been embraced by students at a dozen - odd other colleges , we can see its proponents for what they really are : kids who view college as a four - year playground .
These students exists at any school — hence the popularity of H v. Z at bigger campuses like the University of Maryland and Bowling Green State — but it ’s telling that this game originated on a 1350 - person campus like Goucher ’s ; something about the self - contained small communities of liberal arts colleges enables students to waste their time in such needlessly complicated ways .
As a recent alumnus of such a school , I ’ve seen that most undergraduate humanities majors were able obtain a GPA in the B range while doing barely any work .
( The same ca n’t be said for science majors , it should be noted . )
I have no idea what kind of work ethic Temkin and his cohorts have , nor do I know the average grades of H v. Z players , but they are familiar types insofar as the Post portrays them .
Their confidence suddenly boosted after leaving high school ( and home ) , these proudly “ weird ” kids find themselves with a dearth of necessary schoolwork and a whole new audience to impress with their superficial quirks .
Maybe they wear a funky hat or cut their hair into a Mohawk .
Maybe they stop wearing shoes around campus or start throwing a Frisbee in obviously inappropriate spots .
Or maybe they buy 10 Nerf guns and stop going to class , the better to focus on their 24 - hour - a - day zombie fantasy .
“ [ A ] player ’s life can be entirely consumed by the game ” during H v. Z , writes Quindecim interviewer Asa Eisenhardt .
The Post article abounds with descriptions of the participants ’ months - long preparation , the time - consuming strategy involved , and , of course , the necessary hours spent convincing the administration that H v. Z is a legitimate way to spend time .
It ’s not , and that ’s what makes the participants “ nerds ” as opposed to plain - old dedicated students .
Young people who attend to their classes and reading , or who campaign on campus for a social issue — these are examples of students who appreciate college for what is : four years with relatively little responsibility and commitment , where free time is yours to fill in productive ways .
Alternatively , you can become Jonathan Suss , a Goucher freshman in the Post profile who tagged a key human by “ waiting in the shower stall in the bathroom for eight hours . ”
Clearly the Goucher administration have this image in mind when they claim in their marketing materials that their students “ engage the world as true global citizens . ”
Of course , it ’s the liberal arts academic mentality that allows this type of student to float by undeterred .
Throughout my own experience , seminar instructors hardly ever told students they were wrong , and they instead opted for gentler retorts like , “ Well , can you find any examples in the text ? ”
The result is a nationwide army of students who know a few academic buzzwords and talking points , but who lack any kind of true intellectual seriousness .
By and large , these students grew up expecting to go to college , viewing it more as a rite of passage than a privilege .
When they show up and a thesis on Dave Eggers or Chuck Palahniuk is valued the same as one on Adam Smith or Aristotle , what could seem more mundane ?
This type of academia merely reinforces and bolsters a student ’s existing personality by piling on jargon ; I ’m reminded of the time I sat in the cafeteria and heard a junior philosophy major unironically describe his squalid campus bedroom as “ a Hobbesian state of nature . ”
Three years of philosophy classes and no one had sufficiently emphasized that Hobbes was concerned with man ’s natural proclivity to conflict and war , not a bongwater stain on the carpet .
Put yourself in the position of such a young person :
You arrive to college after years of being told you ’ll be there , and you find that the student body is n’t much bigger ( probably even smaller ) than your high school , and much more socially forgiving .
The institution “ prides itself on encouraging students to be individuals ” ( Wexler ’s description of Goucher ) , which in actuality means no one will ever tell you you ’re wrong , even if you run around campus with fake firearms on the anniversary of a school shooting .
You soon find a group of like - minded “ individuals ” and all realize that the barest minimum of academic work will secure you a B or C average .
Possessing a small vocabulary ’s worth of academic jargon , and with no impetus to interact with life outside a self - contained campus , you ’re free to pass the time however your zombie - loving heart pleases .
Suddenly you end up being profiled by The Washington Post , agreeing that your preposterously complicated version of tag provokes questions about “ the balance of security and freedom . ”
Again , this kind of attention - getting “ quirkiness ” no doubt happens in bigger schools , but it ’s harder to get noticed in an environment like Bowling Green ( undergraduate population : 29,000 ) .
Hence the events of April 8 at Alfred University ( total student population : 2300 ) , where an H v. Z participant was seen walking around campus with a large gun peeking out of his shirt .
A frightened student justifiably called the college police , who instituted a campus - wide lockdown for over two hours .
All this so a guy could take out a “ zombie ” with maximum efficiency .
“ How has the Virginia Tech shooting affected me personally ? ” Temkin rhetorically asks Wexler .
“ It ’s reduced my individual liberty as a student because of the reaction to it .
I obviously think school shootings are a tragedy …
But I just do n’t see how they connect to our game of tag . ”
In other words , he sees no connection between gun-related violence on campuses and a weeks - long game that requires participants to carry realistic - looking toy guns , with some players dressed “ all in black , wearing leg and shoulder holsters , ” as Goucher student Sutton Ashby is described in the Post .
And why would he see such a connection , when the administration refuses to call a fool a fool ?
Wexler quotes Goucher president Sanford Ungar ’s comments from the recent alumni quarterly : “ We will not seek to label as ‘ dangerous ’ every student who is merely different …
We must make our decision with an eye toward striking a delicate balance between security and personal freedom . ”
These students are n’t so “ different , ” though , as proven by the participation of 200 Goucher undergraduates in the game , far more than any official campus club .
They ’re just kids who do n’t appreciate the opportunity they have to attend college , so they ’ve turned it into a 287 - acre playpen in which to act out adolescent games .
Are they aware that only 35 % of Americans get to attend college in the first place , or that the average total cost of a private institution is $ 25,200 a year ?
Tuitions keep rising so colleges can provide students with more opportunities and more luxurious campus settings , but too few people are asking whether or not it ’s a good deal to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars so your kid can spend his time “ killing zombies ” for four years .
In preparation for the recent games , Temkin claims to have read The Art of War .
He must have skipped over one well - known piece of Sun Tzu ’s advice : “ Opportunities multiply as they are seized . ”
As media pounces on Obama relationships , McCain gets a pass Nick Juliano
Published : Monday May 5 , 2008

Print This Email This Mastermind of Nixon 's Watergate break - in calls McCain an ' old friend '
It 's a classic pattern in politics , is n't it ?
A young , fresh , charismatic , upstart candidate bursts onto the campaign trail to glowing reviews from the press that covers him only to have those same reporters and pundits aim their BB guns toward his rising balloon just as it's ready to crest the horizon .
While that arc seems to be playing out now for Barack Obama , whose faced relentless recrimination over his associations with controversial pastors and former radicals in recent weeks , the media largely let John McCain float by unscathed .
Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Chapman explores McCain's " own radical friend . "
" Obama has been justly criticized for his ties to former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers , who in 1995 hosted a campaign event for Obama and in 2001 gave him a $ 200 contribution , " Chapman wrote .
" The two have also served together on the board of a foundation .
When their connection became known , McCain minced no words : ' I think not only a repudiation but an apology for ever having anything to do with an unrepentant terrorist is due the American people . ' "
" What McCain did n't mention , " Chapman adds , " is that he has his own Bill Ayers in the form of G. Gordon Liddy .
Now a conservative radio talk - show host , Liddy spent more than 4 years in prison for his role in the 1972 Watergate burglary .
That was just one element of what Liddy did , and proposed to do , in a secret White House effort to subvert the Constitution .
Far from repudiating him , McCain has embraced him . "
Liddy did n't just have a role : he was the chief operative for Nixon 's White House " plumbers " unit , who , along with E. Howard Hunt , masterminded the break - in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate hotel in 1972 .
Following prison , Liddy started a countersurveillance private security firm .
The company filed for bankruptcy in 1998 .
He entered talk radio in 1992 , and is now syndicated in 160 markets as well as Sirius and XM satellite radio .
While right - wing blogs continue to fume over Obama 's connection to the former anti-war radical , little has been written about Liddy and McCain , who appear to be much better friends .
Liddy has donated $ 5,000 to McCain 's political campaigns since 1998 -- sending 25 times as much money to the Arizona senator than Ayers did to Obama .
Liddy also greeted McCain as " an old friend " when hosting the candidate on his talk radio show , Chapman writes , and McCain gushed at the " pleasure " he took in appearing and praised Liddy's " adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great . "
Muses Chapman , " Which principles would those be ?
The ones that told Liddy it was fine to break into the office of the Democratic National Committee to plant bugs and photograph documents ?
The ones that made him propose to kidnap anti-war activists so they could n't disrupt the 1972 Republican National Convention ?
The ones that inspired him to plan the murder ( never carried out ) of an unfriendly newspaper columnist ? "
The Obama - Ayers connection has not received near the amount of coverage as Rev. Jeremiah Wright , but it continues to roil the conservative blogosphere .
ABC 's George Stephanopoulos thrust Ayers into the spotlight during last month 's Democratic debate asking a question suggested by at least two conservative talk - show hosts .
Whether the crimes of Watergate will be revisited in any serious way as they relate to McCain remains to be seen .
Attacks on Obama associations have taken a toll
It is the Wright eruption that has caused Obama the most headaches over the last month and a half .
And as the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz notes , Obama 's reception from the press has grown quite chilly over the last few weeks .
Obama 's image has undergone something of a transformation .
In March , feeding the curiosity about his background , a Newsweek cover story focused on " When Barry Became Barack " in college , while a Time cover profiled the candidate 's mother .
By last week , Newsweek 's cover piece was exploring why he seems " strange , " " exotic " and , to some , " haughty " and " a bit of an egghead . "
How did Obama , cast by some journalists as the new JFK , come to be depicted as what the New Republic 's John Judis says may be " The Next McGovern " ? [... ]
As a newcomer to the national scene -- as well as the first African American with a serious shot at the presidency -- Obama is something of a blank canvas for political writers , especially compared with a former first lady .
His long association with Wright prompted journalistic questions , however belated , about what Obama believes and why he remained at Wright 's church despite the pastor 's anti-American rhetoric .
[ St. Petersburg Times media critic Eric ]
Deggans says the coverage of Wright and the flag - pin flap " kind of bugged me .
. . .
It 's a weird universe where you 've got some journalists who are looking for a story that is going to change the game significantly because that 's how they make their bones . "
But on the pastor issue , too , Obama is alone in scrutiny while McCain remains relatively unscathed .
New York Times columnist Frank Rich examines the disturbing discrepancy -- and its racial undertones .
Mr. McCain says he does not endorse any of Mr. Hagees calumnies , any more than Barack Obama endorses Mr. Wrights .
But those who try to give Mr. McCain a pass for his embrace of a problematic preacher have a thin case .
It boils down to this : Mr. McCain was not a parishioner for 20 years at Mr. Hagees church .
That defense implies , incorrectly , that Mr. McCain was a passive recipient of this bigots endorsement .
In fact , by his own account , Mr. McCain sought out Mr. Hagee , who is perhaps best known for trying to drum up a pre-emptive holy war with Iran .
( This preacher s rantings may tell us more about Mr. McCains policy views than Mr. Wrights tell us about Mr. Obamas . )
Even after Mr. Hagees Catholic bashing bubbled up in the mainstream media , Mr. McCain still did not reject and denounce him , as Mr. Obama did an unsolicited endorser , Louis Farrakhan , at the urging of Tim Russert and Hillary Clinton .
Mr. McCain instead told George Stephanopoulos two Sundays ago that while he condemns any anti- anything remarks by Mr. Hagee , he is still glad to have his endorsement . 
I wonder if Mr. McCain would have given the same answer had Mr. Stephanopoulos confronted him with the graphic video of the pastor in full  Great Whore glory .
But Mr. McCain didnt have to fear so rude a transgression .
Mr. Hagees videos have never had the same circulation on television as Mr. Wrights .
A sonorous white preacher spouting venom just doesnt have the telegenic zing of a theatrical black man .
Perhaps thats why virtually no one has rebroadcast the highly relevant prototype for Mr. Wrights fiery claim that 9/11 was Americas chickens coming home to roost .
That would be the Sept. 13 , 2001 , televised exchange between Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , who blamed the attacks on Americas abortionists , feminists , gays and A.C.L.U. lawyers .
( Mr. Wright blamed the attacks on Americas foreign policy . )
Had that video re-emerged in the frenzied cable - news rotation , Mr. McCain might have been asked to explain why he no longer calls these preachers agents of intolerance  and chose to cozy up to Mr. Falwell by speaking at his Liberty University in 2006 .
With Democrats Obama and Hillary Clinton maintain their focus on each other during this interminable primary campaign , the job of official criticism of McCain has fallen to the Democratic National Committee .
They 've focused on his own words about the possibility of keeping troops for " 100 years " in Iraq and perceptions that he is out - of - touch on the economy .
Maybe the press is waiting for the general election to play the same round of guilt - by - association gotcha with McCain as they have been with Obama .
So far , though , the indication seems that his base is keeping itself in line .
“ The numbers are big enough that clearly this thing is profitable for AT&T , ” said Michael Mace , a principal at Rubicon .
“ The big financial leverage is on the people who switch carriers .
It ’s not like you have to add new cell towers for them ; they ’re almost all profit .
And those people are hard to come by , because you have to switch them off somebody else ’s network . ”

Google ' burglar 's charter ' street cameras given the all clear by privacy watchdog
The Google Earth spy car takes images of individual streets for inclusion on the StreetView website
Plans by Google to photograph millions of British homes and publish them online have been given the all clear by a privacy watchdog .
The Information Comissioner 's Office ( ICO ) has been investigating complaints about the launch of Google 's Street View service , which will allow anyone in the world to type in a UK address or postcode and instantly see a 360 - degree picture of the street .
In a statement , the ICO said ' We are satisfied that Google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals , including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in Street View images . '
They said that Google would also offer the opportunity for those concerned about their privacy to request the removal of their images from the system .
Concerns about Street View were raised by campaign group Privacy International , which warned that the website could be a massive invasion of privacy .
The group had written to Google requesting information about how information such as car registration numbers would be hidden .
Critics say the site is a ' burglar 's charter ' that makes it easy for criminals to check out potential victims .
It will include close - ups of buildings , cars and people , as well as pictures showing people leaving and entering hospitals , health clinics , adult shops and hotels .
Although their faces are deliberately blurred , many could still be recognised by their clothing and hair colour .
The site was launched in major American cities last year .
Google has confirmed it is now in the process of photographing Britain as part of the Street View project .
Cars emblazoned with the company 's logo and carrying massive 360 - degree cameras have been spotted circling the streets of British cities in recent weeks .
A Google spokeswoman said : ' Google works hard to make sure that our products respect both users ' expectations of privacy , and local privacy laws , in each country in which they are launched .
Google Maps Street View is no exception .'
Street View is designed to complement Google Earth , a collection of satellite pictures that covers every square mile of the globe .
Google Earth has come under fire for the level of detail in its overhead pictures , which have become enormously popular .
The pictures do n't just show which homes have swimming pools or tennis courts , they can reveal the model and colour of cars , whether gardens have furniture and even sunbathers lying outside .
Critics say the site can be used by burglars planning escape routes from homes and by terrorists looking for military bases .
The site has even been used by teenagers arranging unauthorised swimming parties in unoccupied homes .
Users of the new Street View website can either browse maps of towns before clicking on a street view , or type in an address or postcode .
By clicking on arrows on the screen , users will feel like they are walking down the street and will be able to look right , left or behind them during their virtual tour .
The images show which homes belong to wealthy owners , which have easy access for burglars , which have expensive cars parked outside and which have alarm boxes .
And although the pictures are not ' live ' - they will be updated once every few years - the website has also raised concerns about people photographed by the roving cameras .
In America , its launch has provoked complaints about intrusions into privacy .
One image , since removed , showed a woman accidentally exposing her underwear as she got out of a car in an American city street .
The scene was captured by a passing camera car and posted online without her permission .
Other Street Views show two men gazing at a woman as she bends over in the street , a man apparently entering an adult book store , a man apparently scaling a security fence , and two women sunbathing on the lawn of Stanford University campus .
Internet experts in America are waiting for the first high - profile lawsuit from someone photographed in a compromising or embarrassing position .
The Information Commissioner 's Office said Google would have to avoid showing people 's faces .
A spokesman said : ' There is a risk that Street View could identify individuals alongside their place of work or places they are visiting .
' In most instances this will not have a serious impact on people 's privacy , however identifying an individual outside some premises , for instance health clinics and hospitals , could raise serious privacy issues .
Paul Gilbert , a media lawyer at London law firm Finers Stephens Innocent , said taking pictures at street level and joining them up to create a map did not breach privacy laws in the UK .
' However , if the pictures captured the inside of a person 's house by taking a photograph through the window , then the homeowner may be justified in claiming a breach of privacy , ' he said .
Google makes money from its websites through advertising .
It believes Street View will be popular with tourists picking holiday destinations , housebuyers wanting to explore neighbourhoods , and shoppers trying to find stores .
It wants to encourage businesses to include links to the site on their own homepages .
A spokesman said : ' We will not launch in UK until we are comfortable Street View complies with local law , including law relating to the display of images of individuals .
We will use technology , like face - blurring , and operational controls , such as image removal tools , so Street View remains useful and in keeping with local norms wherever it is available . '
Anyone who thinks their face is recognisable can email Google and ask to have the image disguised , he said .
In Britain , anyone is allowed to take a picture of a house or a street and put it on the Internet .
But if some pictures show the inside of someone 's house , even inadvertently , then homeowners could show their privacy has been breached under common law .
Similarly , we are legally entitled to take pictures of people , even complete strangers , and post them on the Internet .
But if a man is photographed walking past an adult store - but not going in - giving the wrong impression that he is a customer , then the image could defame his character .
The heaviest elements are a shy , retiring bunch .
No sooner are they created than they disappear in a puff of smoke .
The heaviest , ununoctium , has an atomic number of 118 and an atomic weight of 294 .
The Russians made a single atom of the stuff back in 2002 only to discover that it hung around for all of a millisecond .
But it has long been thought that islands of stability exist higher up in the periodic table , where much heavier elements might exist for much longer .
Today Chhanda Samanta from the University of Richmond in Virginia , gives the low down on what to expect .
One important factor turns out to be the number of neutrons an element posseses , with islands of stability thought to exist at N=162 and 184 .
Around N=162 , Samanta says keep an eye out for seaborgium - 268 with a half life of 3.2 hours .
And at N=184 he points to darmstadtium - 294 , which looks as if it ’ll hang around for at least 311 years and seaborgium - 290 which has a half life of a whopping 10^8 years .
The race is on to find these elements and the main players are the Russians at Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna and the Americans at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California .
( Although in the true spirit of post cold war co-operation they ’ve together formed a collaboration called the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research . )
What ’s the betting we ’ll see one of these superheavies within the year ?

The 26 beliefs that drive modern medicine and the FDA
All herbs are dangerous and might kill you .
Vitamins and dietary supplements are not only useless ; they 're so dangerous that they should be regulated or banned .
The only thing more dangerous than dietary supplements is allowing the public to have access to accurate information about dietary supplements .
To maintain control , the public must be kept ignorant of the medicinal uses of all substances other than patented chemicals .
Most diseases are caused by pharmaceutical deficiencies and can only be treated with pharmaceutical supplementation .
Botanicals interfere with pharmaceuticals , not the other way around .
There is no such thing as a pharmaceutical that interferes with an herb .
Scientific progress is measured by the degree to which man dominates nature .
Free speech should only be protected for drug companies , not nutritional supplement companies .
The 300 + synthetic chemicals now found in the blood of nearly everyone are completely harmless and have no negative health effects .
The FDA is incapable of making mistakes , and therefore , drug companies should be granted full immunity against consumer lawsuits surrounding the injuries and deaths caused by FDA - approved pharmaceuticals .
It is impossible for an FDA - approved drug to cause the death of anyone , because the FDA is infallible .
There is no need to safety test chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products because the skin does n't absorb chemicals .
Unless , of course , we 're talking about transdermal drug delivery products like the anti-smoking patch , in which case the skin readily absorbs chemicals .
Nature can not be trusted .
All herbs must be " standardized " to be safe .
And even then , they 're still useless .
Phytochemicals only act in isolation .
Scientists can understand the physiological action of plant chemicals by isolating them , synthesizing them , and testing them one by one .
There is no such thing as " synergistic action " with phytochemicals .
The only use for plant chemicals is to serve as ideas from which drug companies can synthesize patented drugs .
Phytochemicals ( phytonutrients ) have no inherent value and their use for preventing , treating or curing any disease should be outlawed and stripped from modern civilization 's knowledge base .
Shamans , medicine women , herbalists , midwives and healers are all engaged in quackery based on superstition or voodoo .
There is no such thing as bioenergy , intuition , mind - body medicine , quantum physics or therapeutic touch .
The entire universe operates only on the physical and chemical levels .
There is nothing beyond those two levels yet to be discovered or explored .
We already know everything there is to know .
No new discoveries are necessary , nor are any paradigm shifts in scientific medicine .
It is important that we all reject any new ideas or beliefs that threaten our existing ideas or beliefs .
Drug corporations should be protected because they have the best interests of the general public in mind .
The future health of the entire world depends on the research being conducted right now by drug companies .
Americans are lucky to pay the highest prices in the world for medication .
Everyone else has to settle for " bargain " pricing , but Americans get the honor of knowing their dollars help fund the shareholder profits of the world 's wealthiest corporations , all of which deserve unlimited financial riches because they are saving the world from disease .
Drugs from Canada are so dangerous that they cannot be allowed to be touched or swallowed by superior Americans .
Canadian drugs might be suitable for exporting to third world nations , but not to America .
The best way to help consumers is to control them by limiting their options and minimizing their access to information that might confuse them .
Nutrition has no role in human health .
Any talk about healing with nutrition is quackery .
The human body is incapable of healing itself .
Health can only be enhanced through chemical or surgical intervention .
Patients have no role in determine their own health outcome .
" Science " is whatever we say it is .
Anything that disagrees with our definition of science is " unscientific . "
The " Scientific Method " is the process by which we decide what is science .
Conflicts of interest do n't count if we all mean well .

As clear - thinking people , natural health consumers sometimes look at the actions of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and wonder what planet its decision makers seem to be from .
It 's like the FDA is living in a completely different world than the rest of us -- a world where nutrients are dangerous , but synthetic chemicals are perfectly safe for human consumption .
In fact , the idea that FDA bureaucrats and modern medicine promoters are living in a different reality is not far from the truth .
I my view , .
They 're simply operating on a system of false beliefs and circular reasoning that justifies their efforts to protect Big Pharma profits by exploiting , misleading and directly harming the public .
Have you ever wondered what rules and beliefs actually drive FDA decisions in that alternate reality ?
As a service to NewsTarget readers , I 've assembled a few in this article .
These are the rules that define the dogma of modern " scientific " medicine and pharmacology marketing .
These rules are followed by FDA bureucrats , drug company executives , psychiatrists , doctors , hospitals and everyone who 's currently profiting from the failed system of medicine operating in the United States today .
These rules , by the way , are no joke .
This is not a satire piece .
This is a serious exploration of the beliefs under which much of modern medical science operates today .
Once you read these and understand just how deeply they are embedded in the minds and actions of conventional medicine operatives today , you 'll realize the magnitude of the medical collapse ( and the related population collapse ) that now awaits modern civilization .
There is nothing in these rules that respects life , nature , compassion or humility .
It 's all about the power of man over nature , arrogance , control , exploitation and self delusion .
What 's really interesting about these beliefs is that they stand in direct conflict to reality .
In reality , for example : •
The human body is naturally biocompatible with foods and medicines from nature . •
Pharmaceuticals interfere with normal human physiology and inevitably cause harm . •
Medicinal plants operate through synergistic action that cannot be understood by isolating and studying their chemical constituents . •
Nature has infinite wisdom ; man remains utterly ignorant of the wisdom available in the universe . •
The universe is energetic , not merely chemical or physical , and all things are energetically connected . •
The mind controls the body ; beliefs become reality in the tissue .... and so on .
We could add substantially to this list , but you get the idea .
Is n't is fortunate that the universe does n't operate from the FDA 's distorted viewpoint ?
In time , by the way , our system of modern medicine will cease to exist .
No system of medicine based on beliefs that contradict reality has any future .

Israel is Developing ' Ethnic Bomb ' for Growing Biological Weapons Arsenal
Mark Weber
Israel is working on an " ethnically targeted " biological weapon that would kill or harm Arabs but not Jews , according to Israeli military and western intelligence sources cited in a front - page report in the London Sunday Times , November 15 , 1998 ( " Israel Planning ' Ethnic ' Bomb as Saddam Caves In , " by Uzi Mahnaimi and Marie Colvin ) .
In developing this " ethno - bomb , " the British paper went on , Israeli scientists are trying to exploit medical advances by identifying distinctive genes carried by some Arabs , and then create a genetically modified bacterium or virus .
The goal is to use the ability of viruses and certain bacteria to alter the DNA inside the host 's living cells .
The scientists are trying to engineer deadly microorganisms that attack only those bearing the distinctive genes .
The secret Israel program is based at the Institute for Biological Research in Nes Tsiona , a small town southeast of Tel Aviv , the main research facility for Israel 's clandestine arsenal of chemical and biological weapons .
A scientist there said the task is very complicated because both Arabs and Jews are of Semitic origin .
But he added : " They have , however , succeeded in pinpointing a particular characteristic in the genetic profile of certain Arab communities , particularly the Iraqi people . "
Diseases could be spread by spraying organisms into the air or putting them in water supplies .
Some experts have commented that while an ethnically targeted weapon is theoretically feasible , the practical aspects of creating one are enormous .
All the same , a confidential Pentagon report warned last year that biological agents could be genetically engineered to produce new lethal weapons .
US Defense Secretary William Cohen revealed that he had received reports of countries working to create " certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic - specific . "
A senior western intelligence source confirmed that Israel is one of the countries Cohen had in mind , the Sunday Times report added .
Reliable Record
The Sunday Times report is all the more credible given the prestigious paper 's past record of reliable reporting .
In a detailed front - page report published on June 19 , 1977 , the Sunday Times first revealed to the world that Israeli authorities had been torturing Palestinian prisoners , that this torture was " widespread and systematic , " and that it " appears to be sanctioned at some level as deliberate policy . "
At the time Israeli officials and Jewish - Zionist leaders in the United States protested the Sunday Times revelations , and denied the charge .
Later , though , Israeli torture of prisoners was independently verified by Amnesty International , and others .
Another recent Sunday Times article revealed that Israeli jets have been equipped to carry chemical and biological weapons .
" There is hardly a single known or unknown form of chemical or biological weapons ... which is not manufactured at the [ Nes Tsiona ] Institute , " a biologist who is a former Israeli intelligence official told the newspaper .
And the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot , citing a foreign report , has told readers that hundreds of bottles of deadly anthrax toxin are stored at the Institute .
The " ethnic bomb " claims have been given further credence in Foreign Report , an authoritative Jane 's publication that closely monitors security and military matters .
It cites unnamed South African sources as saying that Israeli scientists , in trying to develop an " ethnic bullet " against Arabs , have made use of similar biological studies conducted by South African scientists during the Apartheid era ( and later revealed in testimony before that country 's " Truth and Reconciliation Commission " ) .
Foreign Report also says that Israelis have gained insights into the Arab genetic make - up by conducting research on " Jews of Arab origin , especially Iraqis . "
The British Medical Association has become so concerned about the lethal potential of genetically - based biological weapons that it has opened an investigation .
Dr. Vivienne Nathanson , who organized the research , said : " With an ethnically targeted weapon , you could even hit groups within a population .
The history of warfare , in which many conflicts have an ethnic factor , shows how dangerous this could be . "
A spokesman for Britain 's biological defense establishment confirms that such weapons are theoretically possible .
" We have reached a point now where there is an obvious need for an international convention to control biological weapons , " he said .
The Anti-Defamation League lost no time denouncing the Sunday Times " ethnic bomb " report .
Abraham Foxman , national director of the influential Jewish - Zionist organization , called it " irresponsible and dangerous . "
The ADL official went on : " This sensational story is reminiscent of the age - old anti-Semitic blood libel myth of Jews deviously targeting non-Jews with poison . "
Question : How does Foxman know that this report is not true ?
Do high - level Israeli officials routinely inform the ADL of the Zionist government 's top - secret military programs ?
A senior Israeli government official similarly rejected the Sunday Times report , saying " this is the kind of story that does not deserve denial . "
Such Israeli declarations are virtually worthless , however , considering that the Zionist state refuses officially to acknowledge that it has nuclear weapons , a fact that even authoritative American sources have confirmed .
' Human Guinea Pigs '
Victor Ostrovsky , a former case officer of Israel 's Mossad intelligence agency , recalled in his book The Other Side of Deception how he first learned of the Zionist state 's secret weapons center :
It was Uri who enlightened me regarding the Nes Zionna [ Tsiona ] facility .
It was , he said , an ABC warfare laboratory -- ABC standing for atomic , biological and chemical .
It was where our top epidemiological scientists were developing various doomsday machines .
Because we were so vulnerable and would not have a second chance should there be an all - out war in which this type of weapon would be needed , there was no room for error .
The [ captured ]
Palestinian infiltrators came in handy in this regard .
As human guinea pigs , they could make sure the weapons the scientists were developing worked properly and could verify how fast they worked and make them even more efficient .
As most of the world recognizes , United States policy toward countries that develop nuclear , chemical and biological weapons is sanctimonious and brazenly hypocritical .
Recently , for example , the US government sharply condemned India and Pakistan for testing nuclear weapons .
Of course , the only country ever to have actually used nuclear weapons is the United States .
In August 1945 , American forces instantly killed tens of thousands of Japanese civilians with atomic bombs , first in Hiroshima and then in Nagasaki -- even though America 's most competent military leaders held that there was no military need to use the horrific weapon .
( See : " Was Hiroshima Necessary , " in the May - June 1997 Journal , pp. 4 -12 ) .
To prevent the government of Iraq from developing " weapons of mass destruction " ( to use the currently fashionable phrase ) , the United States regularly bombs the hapless Arab country , and enforces an economic embargo that ( according to authoritative estimates ) has already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Iraqi children .
For decades , though , America 's political and intellectual leaders -- reflecting their obsequious subservience to Jewish - Zionist interests -- condone Israel 's growing arsenal of sophisticated nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .

· Findings also show fall in support for war on terror · Decline in America 's image ' all to do with Iraq '
George Bush 's six years in office have so damaged the image of the US that people worldwide see Washington as a bigger threat to world peace than Tehran , according to a global poll .
The Washington - based Pew Research Centre , in a poll of 17,000 people in 15 countries between March and May , found more people concerned about the US presence in Iraq than about Iran 's alleged nuclear weapons ambitions .
The Pew Centre said : " Despite growing concern over Iran 's nuclear ambitions , the US presence in Iraq is cited at least as often as Iran - and in many countries much more often - as a danger to world peace . "
The survey , carried out annually , shows a continued decline in support for the US since 1999 .
The US image for most of the 20th century has been relatively positive , being regularly identified with democracy , human rights and openness in spite of criticism from the left , which reached a height during the Vietnam war , and a residual suspicion in the Muslim world .
But even in the UK , Washington 's closest ally , favourable ratings have slumped from 83 % in 1999 to 56 % this year .
The pattern is similar in France , down from 62 % to 39 % , Germany 78 % to 37 % , and Spain 50 % to 23 % .
In Muslim countries with which the US has traditionally enjoyed a good relationship , such as Turkey - a member of Nato - and Indonesia , there have also been slumps .
In Indonesia favourable ratings for the US have dropped from 75 % to 30 % , and in Turkey from 52 % to 12 % .
" It 's all [ because of ] Iraq , " Carroll Doherty , associate director of the Pew Centre , said .
He added that it was a sign of how " dangerous Iraq is to the US image " that , in spite of common cause between the US and Europeans on Iran , there had been no improvement in the American position in Europe .
Mr Doherty said : " Short - term measures do have an effect .
The outpouring of US tsunami aid helped in Indonesia and India but that faded quickly , and now we see US aid for Pakistan earthquake victims only helping at the margins . "
Favourable ratings of the US in India dropped over the year from 71 % to 56 % .
He said US domestic polling indicated that Americans were well aware of how the country was perceived abroad .
The US image has become a political issue , with Republicans saying it does n't matter as long as the correct policies are being pursued overseas , while Democrats argue that repairing the country 's image and relationships will be a priority for the next president in 2009 .
The poll provides little comfort for Condoleezza Rice , who has worked hard at improving relations with Europe since becoming Secretary of State last year .
As part of the overall decline in US support , the survey also records a drop in support for the US - led " war on terror " , even in countries such as Spain , in spite of the Madrid bombings two years ago by al - Qaida that left 192 dead .
Support for the " war on terror " dropped in Spain from 26 % last year to 19 % this year .
Throughout the period the poll was conducted the crisis over Iran 's nuclear programme , intensified by hardline comments from its president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was repeatedly in the news .
Iraq , too , has been in the news on an almost daily basis , with the formation of a new Iraqi government being accompanied by fears of a civil war .
Only in the US and Germany is Iran seen as a greater danger than the US in Iraq .
Public opinion in 12 of the other countries - Britain , France , Spain , Russia , Indonesia , Egypt , Jordan , Turkey , Pakistan , Nigeria , India and China - cite the US presence in Iraq as being the greater danger .
Opinion in Japan was evenly divided .
As well as Iraq and Iran , the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is also high on the list of issues that present a danger to world peace .
Public opinion in about a third of the countries polled put it at the top of their list of threats .
In the UK , the second biggest contributor of troops in Iraq , 60 % said the Iraq war had made the world more dangerous .
Only 30 % said it had made the world safer , and 41 % of British people said the US presence in Iraq represented a great danger to world peace , with 34 % citing Iran as a big threat .
By contrast , concern about Iran has almost doubled in the US over the past two years .
Some 46 % of Americans view Mr Ahmadinejad 's government as " a great danger " to stability in the Middle East and world peace , up from 26 % in 2003 .
The concern in the US is shared in Germany , where 51 % see Iran as a great danger to world peace , against 18 % three years ago .
From Media Matters :
On the July 16 edition of his nationally syndicated radio show , Michael Savage claimed that autism is “ [ a ] fraud , a racket . ”
Savage went on to say , “ I ’ll tell you what autism is .
In 99 percent of the cases , it ’s a brat who has n’t been told to cut the act out .
That ’s what autism is .
What do you mean they scream and they ’re silent ?
They do n’t have a father around to tell them , ‘ Do n’t act like a moron .
You ’ll get nowhere in life .
Stop acting like a putz .
Straighten up .
Act like a man .
Do n’t sit there crying and screaming , idiot . ’ ” Savage concluded , “ [ I ] f I behaved like a fool , my father called me a fool .
And he said to me , ‘ Do n’t behave like a fool . ’
The worst thing he said — ‘ Do n’t behave like a fool .
Do n’t be anybody ’s dummy .
Do n’t sound like an idiot .
Do n’t act like a girl .
Do n’t cry . ’
That ’s what I was raised with .
That ’s what you should raise your children with .
Stop with the sensitivity training .
You ’re turning your son into a girl , and you ’re turning your nation into a nation of losers and beaten men .
That ’s why we have the politicians we have . ”
SAVAGE : Now , you want me to tell you my opinion on autism , since I ’m not talking about autism ?
A fraud , a racket .
For a long while , we were hearing that every minority child had asthma .
Why did they sudden — why was there an asthma epidemic amongst minority children ?
Because I ’ll tell you why :
The children got extra welfare if they were disabled , and they got extra help in school .
It was a money racket .
Everyone went in and was told [ fake cough ] , “ When the nurse looks at you , you go [ fake cough ] , ‘ I do n’t know , the dust got me . ’ ” See , everyone had asthma from the minority community .
That was number one .
Now , the illness du jour is autism .
You know what autism is ?
I ’ll tell you what autism is .
In 99 percent of the cases , it ’s a brat who has n’t been told to cut the act out .
That ’s what autism is .
What do you mean they scream and they ’re silent ?
They do n’t have a father around to tell them , “ Do n’t act like a moron .
You ’ll get nowhere in life .
Stop acting like a putz .
Straighten up .
Act like a man .
Do n’t sit there crying and screaming , idiot . ”
Autism — everybody has an illness .
If I behaved like a fool , my father called me a fool .
And he said to me , “ Do n’t behave like a fool . ”
The worst thing he said — “ Do n’t behave like a fool .
Do n’t be anybody ’s dummy .
Do n’t sound like an idiot .
Do n’t act like a girl .
Do n’t cry . ”
That ’s what I was raised with .
That ’s what you should raise your children with .
Stop with the sensitivity training .
You ’re turning your son into a girl , and you ’re turning your nation into a nation of losers and beaten men .
That ’s why we have the politicians we have .

What are these ?
The federal government is soon to be ladling out tax dollars to bail out Fannie Mae .
Who will pay for this ?
Joe Sixpack , a guy who works hard at two jobs , rents an apartment , and tries to support a couple of kids .
Who benefits ?
Stockholders in Fannie Mae. Holders of bonds issued by Fannie Mae .
The 5,000 employees of Fannie Mae , including the CEO who helped himself to $ 13.4 million in salary this year .
What do the stockholders , bondholders , and employees have in common ?
They are all richer than average Americans and they are all going to be sucking down tax dollars paid by poorer than average Americans ( plus some tax dollars from the rich , of course ) .
Joe Sixpack might have been thinking that he could finally afford to rent a nicer apartment or maybe even buy a place .
But now Congress is giving the states $ 4 billion to buy up property in crummy neighborhoods .
Joe wo n’t be getting any bargains because he will have to compete with the government when he goes home - shopping .
Suppose he remains a renter ?
Higher real estate prices will result in higher rents , which are n’t going to be too affordable for Joe because he is about to be laid off from one of his jobs .
In Roman times the employees of Fannie Mae would be decimated , i.e. , they would draw lots and 90 percent of them would beat the unlucky 10 percent to death with clubs .
What would be a modern equivalent ?
At the very least taxpayers should have the satisfaction of seeing the highest paid 100 Fannie Mae employees fired with two weeks of severance pay ( it ca n’t be that hard to find replacements given that the current staff ’s primary achievements have been accounting fraud and then insolvency ) .
The newspapers say that it is important for foreigners to have confidence that the U.S. will pay its debt .
Let ’s pay foreign bond holders in full then , using tax dollars as necessary .
After all , a guy in China could not be expected to understand that a bunch of crummy houses in Cleveland were not worth $ 250,000 each .
Let the domestic shareholders get 10 cents on the dollar and let the domestic bondholders get whatever the bonds are actually worth .
Poor Americans already subsidize wealthy homeowners through the home mortgage deduction .
Do they need to subsidize incompetent managers who have already been paid $ billions ?
Do they need to subsidize rich guys who bought Fannie Mae bonds ?
Do they need to subsidize shareholders who did n’t realize that the easy money from Fannie Mae could n’t last forever ?

The Tonight Show
*****
Johnny Carson was king of the late night talk shows for about 30 years .
Many tried to dethrone him including Joey Bishop , Dick Cavett , Merv Griffin , and quite a few others .
But he reigned supreme , and one of the reasons was beautiful Carol Wayne , who was on his show 101 times .
The following video is Carol 's last appearance onbecause she passed away suddenly not long after this interview .
Carol fit the dumb blonde stereotype perfectly , and , of course , Johnny knew exactly how to play it for the funniest effect .
Well , we have saved the best for last .
This video is from the Newlywed Game TV series which began its long run in 1966 .
The blonde in the video is a classic .
She is the piece de resistance when it comes to dumb blondes .
Despite her lack of intellect , she is very cute and surprisingly appealing .
If there was a hall of fame for dumb blonde videos , this one would be there right at the top .
Enough talk .
Watch and smile .
First off , let me start with a huge apology for not writing any sooner .
It ’s been a bit hectic here around the Feminista household as coming into finals week , the stepson has had a TON of Boy Scout events and trips , and life ’s just been incredibly busy for me .
I do need some really positive vibes from all you wonderful people out there because I interviewed today for a job that will not only afford me the time I need to be able to finish school an entire semester earlier , but will also help me save in gas and car mileage , since I drive about 25 miles a day on average , and it would dramatically drop if I were to get this job .
So please send me good vibes because I really want this job !
Now , for the reason I ’m upset .
Within the last week or two ( I forget as my weeks are meshing right now ) , I sent off letters to the members of Congress in my state over the latest Bushism that ’s going on where the conservative , right - wing , dweebs in office are trying yet again to tell me what is the right thing for my body and what values and morals I should have without even so much as getting to know me first .
In the proposal , obtained by The New York Times , the administration says it could cut off federal aid to individuals or entities that discriminate against people who object to abortion on the basis of “ religious beliefs or moral convictions . ”
Now , here ’s my issue with this : when you take an oath to practice medicine or pharmacology , you ’re taking an oath to do what is in the best interest of the patient , not your own moral beliefs .
If you have a problem with someone who is seeking birth control or is seeking to have an abortion performed , why did you enter this type of medicine then ?
And I have to wonder if these same people would object to such body modifications as breast enhancements , liposuction , etc. , that really has no medicinal value ( except in extreme cases ) other than that of vanity .
I live in Miami , I see thing things walking around the street all the time and I can’t honestly say that these people look as if they feel any better about themselves after they had all these modifications done , but the men sure do like to look at them !
As a matter of fact , I know someone who recently had breast augmentation surgery and underwent a HUGE depressive episode after the surgery .
But I ’m veering off topic here .
Body image issues is another topic for another time .
So I went on this letter writing thing using the Naral letter , and I received a response from my Senator .
Here ’s what he had to say to me :
Dear Ms. FEMINISTA : Thank you for contacting me regarding President Bush ;s proposed new Health and Human Services regulations .
I appreciate hearing from you and would like to respond to your concerns .
Throughout my career in public service , I have been consistently and strongly pro-life .
Every human life is precious , and I believe that the sanctity of life is a critical characteristic of a strong nation .
These are beliefs I have held both personally and professionally throughout my entire life , and they are beliefs that I will continue to hold and promote .
Our country is currently divided over the issue of abortion rights and my views are not shared by all Floridians .
I understand your concern about the availability of contraceptives and birth control .
However , I am opposed to drugs that can destroy an early embryo and is abortive in nature .
I believe the public has the right to access health information and services , and I will continue to support measures , such as abstinence education and adoption programs , that promote a culture of life in America .
Again , thank you for sharing your views with me .
If you have any additional questions or comments , please do not hesitate to contact me .
In addition , for more information about issues and activities important to Florida , please sign up for my weekly newsletter at http://martinez.senate.gov.
Sincerely , Mel Martinez
United States Senator
[ all emphasis mine ]
Ok , so let me break down this letter piece by piece .
First he says that he believes human life is precious and believes that the sanctity of life is a critical characteristic of a strong nation .
Firstly , considering he was born in 1946 , he was around for all the “ coat hanger abortions ” and knows about the lives lost due to the desperation these women were underwent , so he ca n’t claim ignorance .
What about the sanctity of those lives ?
What about caring what will happen to the mother who not only ca n’t get pregnant - for whatever reason - but is also not allowed birth control ?
What does this woman do than ?
Not have sex ?!
Sorry , that ’s not an option .
Now , as we all know , abstinence education does not work .
Abstinence education leads to kids being undereducated about safe sex and the options they may have and these leads to a lot more teen pregnancy , because again , assuming that these kids will not have sex simply because that ’s what you ’re supposed to be teaching them , is also not an option .
Adoptions are all great and dandy , but the truth of the matter is that there may be a lot of good parents who are willing to truly love and care for these children , but there are also a lot of bad families from bad homes who will raise unstable deviant children that will be a burden on society , and Goddess forbid , take another life later on .
What about the sanctity of that life ?
Granted , this is a very extreme situation , but it does happen , and it is possible .
Gangs are based on the neediness of adolescents and the lack of attention and affection that they receive at home , and these kids will do anything for their family / familia .
The on thing that sticks in my head most when I think about the adoption issue is the movie I watched called I Had an Abortion from Women Make Movies .
There was this one woman that they interviewed who was Christian and she ended up pregnant .
With everything that she was brought up to believe , when she became pregnant she decided to seek adoption for her unborn child , and the moment the interviewer found out that the baby would be interracial , they wanted nothing to do with her .
So , under certain circumstances , again , adoption is not an option .
Now I skipped a little because the last statement I want to discuss really shows me this man either has a lack of education or immense gullibility , I ’m not sure which one yet .
It is just about every pro-lifer who believes that contraceptives are a type of abortifacient , when it is not .
Chemical birth control does not cause and abortion , it deters an egg from implanting , or it does not release an egg , as is the case with the pill and others like it .
Is Mr. Martinez telling me then that life begins at fertilization ?
What truly bothers me is that from his standpoint , an embryo that could not come any where near sustaining life outside of my womb has more rights than I do .
When will this kind of control stop ?!
I say that the moment men start menstruating and start worrying about pregnancy and whether or not it ’s the right time for them to conceive , and what they can do in order to avoid getting pregnant , or abstain all together when they have a partner who is threatening to leave because you wo n’t “ give him some ” is the moment that these men can tell me what to do with my body .
They are not me , they do not understand my circumstances , nor my reasons to not want to conceive at this time .
Therefore they can not feign to know what is right for me , and there will be no lack of sex in my life right now so to take all these options away from me is not an option .
In the rush to develop renewable fuels from plants , converting crop residues into cellulosic ethanol would seem to be a slam dunk .
However , that might not be such a good idea for farmers growing crops without irrigation in regions receiving less than 25 inches of precipitation annually , says Ann Kennedy , a USDA - Agricultural Research Service soil scientist and adjunct professor of crop and soil sciences at Washington State University .
" With cultivation , organic matter tends to decline in most places around the world , " she said .
" In the more than 100 years that we have been cultivating soils in the Palouse , " — the wheat growing region of Eastern Washington , Northern Idaho and Northeast Oregon — " we have lost about half of the original organic matter . "
Ideally , according to Kennedy , soils in the Palouse should have about 3.5 percent organic content .
In most farm fields , she said , it is now closer to 2 percent .
She said organic matter provides nutrients crops need , helps the soil hold water and contributes to the formation of soil clods that help prevent wind erosion .
The percentage of organic matter in a given soil varies naturally from region to region , depending on climate , soil disturbance , moisture and vegetation .
Generally speaking , more moisture leads to more vegetation , which is the feedstock for the microbes that break down residue into organic matter .
" A lot of people think residue is part of organic matter , " Kennedy said , " but that is not correct .
Organic matter is well - decomposed plant material and microbes .
It is black and rich and gives soil its dark color . "
Kennedy , who researches the composition of cereal crop residues and the amount of residue needed to maintain soil quality , said that the tillage system used to prepare the soil for planting has a big effect on the conversion of residue to soil organic matter .
In no -till ( direct seed ) or one - pass tillage systems , she said , at least a ton of residue per acre per year is needed to build soil organic matter over time .
In these minimum tillage systems , the intact and slowly decomposing roots also add to organic matter .
She found that the percentage of organic matter in no -till research plots at the Palouse Conservation Field Station increased from 1.9 percent to 3.6 percent over the course of 20 years .
In fields with multiple tillage passes , on the other hand , organic matter may not increase even if all the crop residue is left in the field .
Kennedy thinks multiple tillage may mix the soil and residue too well , in essence over - feeding the microbes .
The microbes will consume the incorporated residue too quickly and release most of it into the air as carbon dioxide .
" It is like going to an all - you - can - eat restaurant every day and eating too much , " she said " You cannot adequately metabolize all the food you ate .
Cultivated soil is like a ' pig out ' for microbes . "
For the long - term health of the soil , leaving residue on the soil surface works best .
" It will tend to stay around longer , and the microbes will slowly invade it and convert it into organic matter with less lost as carbon dioxide , " said Kennedy .
And about proposals to bale off crop residue for production of biofuels ?
" You could remove the extra residue , " she said , " but it still provides surface cover and will eventually become organic matter ; this residue layer is especially important if you rotate with low - residue crops legumes and canola . "
If residue were harvested , she said , soil fertility would drop and farmers would have to find other ways to increase the amount of organic matter in their soils .
" We need to constantly replenish organic matter — so removing valuable residue , especially in areas with low rainfall , may not be the best practice . "
There was nothing very interesting in Katherine P. Rankin ’s study of sarcasm  at least , nothing worth your important time .
All she did was use an M.R.I. to find the place in the brain where the ability to detect sarcasm resides .
But then , you probably already knew it was in the right parahippocampal gyrus .
What you may not have realized is that perceiving sarcasm , the smirking put - down that buries its barb by stating the opposite , requires a nifty mental trick that lies at the heart of social relations : figuring out what others are thinking .
Those who lose the ability , whether through a head injury or the frontotemporal dementias afflicting the patients in Dr. Rankin ’s study , just do not get it when someone says during a hurricane , “ Nice weather we ’re having . ”
“ A lot of the social cognition we take for granted and learn through childhood , the ability to appreciate that someone else is being ironic or sarcastic or angry  the so - called theory of mind that allows us to get inside someone else ’s head  is characteristically lost very early in the course of frontotemporal dementia , ” said Dr. Bradley F. Boeve , a behavioral neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
“ It ’s very disturbing for family members , but neurologists have n’t had good tools for measuring it , ” he went on .
“ That ’s why I found this study by Kate Rankin and her group so fascinating . ”

When I heard the story about two female retards being fitted up with suicide bombs and sent to visit the Baghdad pet market , I had to laugh .
Who 's directing this war -- Mel Brooks ?
You can just see Dom DeLuise as the local Mahdi , telling Madeleine Kahn as a drooling bag lady , " You 're gonna see the nice puppies , yes yes yes , pretty kitties , yes yes yes , just hold still a moment , Uncle Ahmed needs to adjust your new cummerbund ! "
Like snotty film buffs love to say , " It works on so many levels . "
Preparing America's 3 - 8 year old girls to fight fire with fire in the War On Terror .
Starting with the bomb level .
These two crazy ladies managed to kill about 100 pet fanciers , a huge total for pedestrian bombs .
They must have had these two Mongoloid gals wearing explosive mumus like my fat aunt used to have , big floral burquas with plenty of room for the lady who 's retaining water , or , say , plastic explosive .
They may have been mentally retarded , but they must 've been on the Stairmaster for months to pack that much kaboom .
Dom must have told them , " Now when you see a puppy or a kitty you really really like , just pull this little string and before you can say ' ow ! ' you 'll be in heaven with 72 puppies , or 64 kitties , or as many goldfish as you want .
Now scoot down there , you differently - abled martyr , you ! "
I 'm sorry , I just can't stop .
Just the language they 're using on the news accounts -- like , when it 's some Special Olympics star who wins a gold medal for finishing the 100 - yard dash in under six minutes , nobody'd ever say " retarded . "
He 's " special . "
But interfere with all the upbeat " surge working " stories and you 're just a dead retard .
Then there 's the matter of like , how do they know ?
I mean , " retarded " compared to who -- the average suicide bomber ?
If this proves that Al Q. is " scraping the bottom of the barrel " for recruits , does that mean they had aptitude tests till now ?
" We are sorry , Rashid , but your SAT scores do not qualify you to wear a vest and pull a string . "
Until a few years ago , most healthy , normal mainstream journalists would have said that just putting on one of those vests is prima facie evidence that you 're cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs .
Does this mean we 're saying all those other suicide bombers were perfectly normal dudes ?
Because , it so happens , that 's what I 've been saying all along .
Until now , mainstream types have been screaming that these suicide bombers prove that every Muslim is insane .
Total crap , of course , unless you 're also willing to say that the Alamo proved every Texan was insane or the kamikazes prove that every Japanese is wacko .
Do n't get me wrong , it so happens that MOST Texans and Japs ARE crazy ; but it 's not being willing to sacrifice your life for the cause that makes them crazy .
I 've said lots of times that it's not that hard to get kids to die for the tribe or God or Marx or for that matter , 134th Street if that 's their local gang turf .
We 're the crazy ones , so out of touch with all our own glorious military dead that we think there 's something crazy about wanting to go out in a blaze of glory .
It actually scares me when people at coffee break in my office say they " juuuuust caaaaa n't understaaaaaaaaaand " the " mentality " of a suicide bomber .
I mean , did n't they cheer at that scene in Independence Day when Randy Quaid aims his plane up the ass of the alien ship just as it's about to fire the city - killing beam ?
Was n't that supposed to be heroic ?
Take a less ridiculous case : since the USAF was totally unprepared to defend the continental US against attack on 9/11 , the fighters they scrambled to deal with possible further attacks were sent up with no air - to - air munitions at all .
That 's a fact .
And you can see where it leads .
The brass was going to order those pilots to crash their fighters into any commercial jet they concluded might be piloted by a guy with a Koran and a Stanley knife .
That would have been a pure suicide mission .
And I would have expected the pilots to do it without hesitation .
Pilots are ego - crazy , but they 're tough .
They understand that the job involves dying sometimes .

Americans are getting poorer .
In 2007 , home equity fell below 50 percent for the first time on record since 1945 .
Total equity also fell for three straight quarters through last December .
Adjusted for inflation , the annual income of the typical working household is still below its peak before the last recession , in 2001 .
That means the Bush - era expansion is on track to be the first since the government began keeping records in the 1960s in which household income fails to hit a new high .
And yet , in the Senate , Republicans are ready to do battle on behalf of America ’s wealthiest families .
Starting in 2009 , the estate tax will apply to Americans with property at death worth more than $ 7 million per couple , or $ 3.5 million for individuals  a whopping 0.3 percent of people who die each year .
As part of the 2009 budget resolution , Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee , has proposed to keep the tax at those levels , with annual adjustments for inflation .
The proposal is expected to pass , as early as Thursday .
Everyone knows that the Baucus proposal is better than the status quo : under current law , the estate tax will be eliminated in 2010 then revert in 2011 to the far higher levels that applied in 2001 , before the Bush tax cuts .
Republicans , however , think that Mr. Baucus ’s more - than - generous fix does not do enough to shield the wealthy .
After it passes , Senator Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona , is expected to propose further cutting the estate taxes of those still covered by the 2009 rules .
Janet Wynn 's dinner guests were in for a surprise .
Poking from the evening 's salad was wood sorrel , a wild plant that looks like clover and has a tart , lemony taste .
The day before , that same wood sorrel was poking up from the ground about 5 miles from downtown Boston .
Wynn picked it during an evening walk along the Charles River led by wild - foods specialist Russ Cohen .
When the evening was over , Wynn had a perfect salad garnish , and Cohen had another convert .
" I loved the walk , " the Brookline resident said .
" I never knew anything about foraging before this .
It 's opened up a whole new world for me , and it is right here in our own backyards . "
For 35 years , Cohen has been opening up the world of foraging for folks all over New England , giving tours to people interested in free food and picking up a few survival techniques .
Lately , he 's been pretty busy .
The growing interest , he suspects , springs from a hot trend out of San Francisco that is producing " locavores , " people determined to eat only foods picked or produced locally , on a farm or in a forest .
He also grudgingly concedes that popular television shows such as " Man vs. Wild " and " Survivor " have given foraging a new cachet .
On a recent sterling evening , Cohen separated fact from fiction in a walk along the Charles sponsored by the Boston chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Watertown Citizens for Environmental Safety .
The group consisted mostly of young hikers , with a few folks more likely to relate to 1970s cereal commercials by natural - foods proponent Euell Gibbons .
Some were mildly curious , others eager , and some , like Wynn , just out for a stroll .
It did n't take long for their attentions to fix on the slightly hippyish man with a close - cropped beard who stopped the procession every few minutes to describe the virtues of plants that looked like , and in many cases were , weeds .
Milkweed , pokeweed , Japanese knotweed .
Wild garlic , wild onion , sheep sorrel , European barberry - it makes great jelly - were all found in abundance less than 20 minutes into the walk .
It seemed that the edible far outweighed the inedible , as plant after plant had some leaf , stem , root , fruit , or seed that makes a nice stir - fry , salad green , or seasoning , or tastes just like spinach when steamed .
" Just like many wild animals are said to taste a lot like chicken , a lot of wild plants are supposed to taste just like spinach , " Cohen said .
" But young mulberry leaves , when you steam them , really do taste just like spinach . "
Standing in front of the near - ripe mulberry tree some 20 feet from the river 's edge , Cohen dissected its many uses , some of which go beyond nourishment .
Not only do the super - sweet ripe mulberries make a great vinaigrette salad dressing , but the unripe fruit is reputed to have recreational properties .
" The raw , unripe fruits are alleged by one wild foods author to be hallucinogenic , " Cohen said .
" I tried it when I was younger .
I did n't experience anything .
I do n't know , maybe I did n't eat enough . "

Unless Congress closes a gaping hole in the law against war profiteering , companies ripping off taxpayers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars may never be fully prosecuted .
This is because the latest conflicts are not declared wars .
The anti-fraud law dating to World War II allows prosecution of contractors up to three years after a war ends .
But this statute of limitations was omitted from the resolutions authorizing military force in Iraq and Afghanistan , which carried no formal war declaration .
Investigators say that current war fraud runs into untold billions , including faulty ammunition and vehicles and not - so - bullet - proof vests .
Investigative officials and the inspector general for Iraq reconstruction have testified that they ’re hampered by the ongoing conflicts and need more time to catch contract thieves after they end .
The solution is a bipartisan bill clarifying that “ war ” absolutely includes Congressional authorizations of military force .
The repair also wisely allows prosecution for five years after a war .
The Senate Judiciary Committee just approved this crucial measure and the rest of Congress should quickly enact it .
Or else the loophole will continue to invite war contracting as “ a free - for - all with no criminal accountability , ” in the words of Senator Charles Grassley , the bill ’s Republican sponsor .
When you ’re debating , you ’ll come up against many styles of arguing , based on all different levels of arguing .
If you ’re in the debate to win , you ’ll have to spot the flaws in opposing arguments and point them out , or exploit them like a weak spot .
Sometimes it ’s as easy as listening for fuzzy words .
Here are some words and phrases that are easy indications of flaws :
– Solid arguments use actual numbers with references to their source .
These words can indicate implied statistics that show the debater is making up a fact rather than working off real data .
Example : “ Many Christians disagree ”
– These may be blanket statements that imply cause and effect , or assumptions about overall responses and opinions that do n’t hold up under scrutiny .
Example : “ the rich have always been getting richer ”
– including yourself in the argument can indicate thinking personal experience equals the overall trend .
If the debate is not a poll or about individual views , this can be Hasty Generalization .
Here are some examples from CreateDebate : From : Should the US have seatbelt laws ?
Someone who manages to use words from two categories : ” I always choose to wear one ” From : Man vs. Elephant : can you escape ?
“ I am much more shifty than an elephant and would be able to escape if ONE was chasing me in a large field by cutting and weaving . ” and one rebuttal that found the critical flaw : ” Elephants charge at up to 25 m ph .
Way faster than you can run … ”
So next time you ’re arguing with friends or proving your point in an online debate , listen in for these hints for weak arguments and when you make your response make it stronger by avoiding the same flaws .
Looking for that perfect home .
Look no further .

Opinion
Who is planning our next war ?
Of the Axis - of - Evil nations named in his State of the Union in 2002 , President Bush has often said , " The United States will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons . "
He failed with North Korea .
Will he accept failure in Iran , though there is no hard evidence Iran has an active nuclear weapons program ?
William Kristol of the Weekly Standard said June 22 that a U.S. attack on Iran after the election is more likely should Barack Obama win .
Presumably , Bush would trust John McCain to keep Iran nuclear free .
To start a third war in the Middle East against a nation three times as large as Iraq , and leave it to a new president to fight , would be a daylight hijacking of the congressional war power and a criminally irresponsible act .
For Congress alone has the power to authorize war .
Yet Israel is even today pushing Bush into a pre-emptive war with a naked threat to attack Iran itself should Bush refuse the cup .
In April , Israel held a five - day civil defense drill .
In June , Israel sent 100 F - 15s and F - 16s , with refueling tankers and helicopters to pick up downed pilots , toward Greece in a simulated attack , a dress rehearsal for war .
The planes flew 1,400 kilometers , the distance to Iran 's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert came home from a June meeting with Bush to tell Israelis : " We reached agreement on the need to take care of the Iranian threat .
... I left with a lot less question marks regarding the means , the timetable restrictions and American resoluteness .
...
" George Bush understands the severity of the Iranian threat and the need to vanquish it , and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term .
...
The Iranian problem requires urgent attention , and I see no reason to delay this just because there will be a new president in the White House 7 1/2 months from now . "
If Bush is discussing war on Iran with Ehud Olmert , why is he not discussing it with Congress or the nation ?
On June 6 , Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz threatened , " If Iran continues its nuclear weapons program , we will attack it . "
The price of oil shot up 9 percent .
Is Israel bluffing - or planning to attack Iran if America balks ?
Previous air strikes on the PLO command in Tunis , on the Osirak reactor in Iraq and on the presumed nuclear reactor site in Syria last September give Israel a high degree of credibility .
Still , attacking Iran would be no piece of cake .
Israel lacks the stealth and cruise - missile capacity to degrade Iran 's air defenses systematically and no longer has the element of surprise .
Israeli planes and pilots would likely be lost .
Israel also lacks the ability to stay over the target or conduct follow - up strikes .
The U.S. Air Force bombed Iraq for five weeks with hundreds of daily runs in 1991 before Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf moved .
Moreover , if Iran has achieved the capacity to enrich uranium , she has surely moved centrifuges to parts of the country that Israel cannot reach - and can probably replicate anything lost .
Israel would also have to over - fly Turkey , or Syria and U.S. - occupied Iraq , or Saudi Arabia to reach Natanz .
Turks , Syrians and Saudis would deny Israel permission and might resist .
For the U.S. military to let Israel over - fly Iraq would make us an accomplice .
How would that sit with the Europeans , who are supporting our sanctions on Iran and want the nuclear issue settled diplomatically ?
And who can predict with certitude how Iran would respond ?
Would Iran attack Israel with rockets , inviting retaliation with Jericho and cruise missiles from Israeli submarines ?
Would she close the Persian Gulf with suicide - boat attacks on tankers and U.S. warships ?
With oil at $ 140 a barrel , Israeli air strikes on Iran would seem to ensure a 2,000 - point drop in the Dow and a world recession .
What would Hamas , Hezbollah and Syria do ?
All three are now in indirect negotiations with Israel .
U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq could be made by Iran to pay a high price in blood that could force the United States to initiate its own air war in retaliation , and to finish a war Israel had begun .
But a U.S. war on Iran is not a decision Bush can outsource to Olmert .
Last Tuesday , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Adm. Michael Mullins , left for Israel .
CBS
News cited U.S. officials as conceding the trip comes " just as the Israelis are mounting a full court press to get the Bush administration to strike Iran 's nuclear complex . "
Vice President Dick Cheney is said to favor U.S. strikes .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Mullins are said to be opposed .
Moving through Congress , powered by the Israeli lobby , is House Resolution 362 , which demands that President Bush impose a U.S. naval blockade on Iran , an act of war .
Is it not time the American people were consulted on the next war that is being planned for us ?
Until recently I thought that currently popular scripting languages , which mostly evolved over last 10 years or something , must allow for easier portability across different platforms compared to ye good olde C/C ++.
After all , their development started a few decades after C , so its notorious caveats are all well - known and should be easy to avoid when designing a new language , right ?
However , PHP just brought me a new definition of “ portable ” – and that was when working with … integers .
PHP is not able to handle unsigned integers , and converts values over 2^31 to signed .
So if your IDs go slightly over 2 billion , and PHP decides to treat them as integers , you ’re in trouble .
Oh wait , no – that ’s on 32 - bit platforms only !
PHP int size is platform - dependent , and it seems to be 8 bytes on our 64 - bit boxes .
Yes , the very same ones where C/C++ int is 4 bytes , you know .
That was the easy part .
It was mostly documented .
Now , there ’s a function called unpack ( ) which essentially allows to convert different types of data from binary strings to PHP variables .
What if you try to unpack unsigned 32 - bit big endian integer ( format code “ N ” ) ?
Let ’s check the doc :
Having read the doc I personally blatantly relied upon it and expected that large unsigned 32 bit numbers would be converted to float , or string , or something , but handled properly .
However , a couple or so weeks ago the following notice suddenly appeared :
How sweet .
No , it just could not behave like documented and convert 32 - bit unsigned value to float on x32 or keep it integer on x64 – you now suddenly have to care about value size yourself .
Ah , and by the way , there ’s no official way to know what ’s int size .
To make things even better , 5.2.1 introduced a nice bug in unpack ( ) , which f..ed unpacking less - than - 16 - bit values on x64 .
( I assume you understand that “ f..ed ” means “ fixed ” ) .
It took some time and several tries to convince PHP team that x64 has enough bits to hold 16 - bit unpacked value , but thankfully its now acknowledged and assigned .
To summarize , if you need to unpack an unsigned 32 bit int from binary stream , you have to :
convert it to float or string manually ,
do that depending on int size on current platform ,
which can not be done using anything documented ,
and specifically avoid PHP 5.2.1 on x64 .
Most people could probably learn all that , and then use sprintf ( “ %u ” , $id ) , work with string IDs everywhere , avoid 5.2.1 and be happy .
Unfortunately , my final goal was to have support for 64 - bit document IDs …
Let ’s do a small time travel .
Integer types in C / C++ have always been a pain , but back in 1999 ISO commitee ratified ISO / IEC 9899:1999 standard , also known as ISO C99 , which guarantees that “ long long int ” integer type must be at least 64 bits in size .
By now , most compilers support that part perfectly .
However , designers of PHP 5 ( released in 2004 ) type system were either not aware of this change , or decided to not rely on the standard which has been out for “ only ” 5 years by then , or just thought that 31 ( no typo ) bits and 640 K should be enough for everybody .
Long story short , it ’s 2007 now but there ’s no native 64 - bit integer type in PHP .
Let me remind that built - in “ int ” might be 64 - bit , but then again it might be not , and there ’s no official way to tell .
This time , there ’s a number of routes one could take – either use ints ( and pray that the app is never run on x32 , and that “ platform dependent ” size does not change to 4 next version ) ; or use GMP or bcmath extensions if they are available .
Fine , so 99.999 % of the world would hit that , compile in bcmath , and be happy again .
Unfortunately , I needed to develop a library which could be deployed in any environment – and still work , and produce reasonable results .
The worst case is x32 , and neither GMP nor bcmath available .
And this is how the following code was born .
/// portably build 64 bit id from 32 bit hi and lo parts function _ Make64 ( $ hi , $ lo ) { // on x64 , we can just use int if ( (( int)4294967296 ) !=0 ) return ( ( ( int ) $ hi ) < < 32 ) + ( ( int ) $lo ) ; // workaround signed / unsigned braindamage on x32 $ hi = sprintf ( " %u " , $ hi ) ; $ lo = sprintf ( " %u " , $ lo ) ; // use GMP or bcmath if possible if ( function_exists ( " gmp_mul " ) ) return gmp_strval ( gmp_add ( gmp_mul ( $hi , " 4294967296 " ) , $ lo ) ) ; if ( function_exists ( " bcmul " ) ) return bcadd ( bcmul ( $hi , " 4294967296 " ) , $ lo ) ; // compute everything manually $ a = substr ( $hi , 0 , - 5 ) ; $ b = substr ( $hi , - 5 ) ; $ ac = $ a*42949 ; // hope that float precision is enough $ bd = $ b*67296 ; $ adbc = $ a*67296+$ b* 42949 ; $ r4 = substr ( $ bd , - 5 ) + + substr ( $ lo , - 5 ) ; $ r3 = substr ( $ bd , 0 , - 5 ) + substr ( $ adbc , - 5 ) + substr ( $ lo , 0 , - 5 ) ; $ r2 = substr ( $ adbc , 0 , - 5 ) + substr ( $ ac , - 5 ) ; $ r1 = substr ( $ ac , 0 , - 5 ) ; while ( $ r4>100000 ) { $ r4 - =100000 ; $ r3++ ; } while ( $ r3>100000 ) { $ r3 - =100000 ; $ r2++ ; } while ( $ r2 >100000 ) { $ r2 - =100000 ; $ r1++ ; } $r = sprintf ( " %d%05d%05d%05d " , $ r1 , $ r2 , $ r3 , $ r4 ) ; $l = strle n ( $r ) ; $ i = 0 ; while ( $ r [ $i ] == " 0 " && $ i < $l - 1 ) $ i++ ; return substr ( $r , $ i ) ; } list ( , $a ) = unpack ( " N " , " \xff\xff\xff\xff " ) ; list ( , $b ) = unpack ( " N " , " \xff\xff\xff\xff " ) ; $q = _ Make64 ( $a , $b ) ; var_dump ( $q ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 / / / portably build 64 bit id from 32 bit hi and lo parts function _ Make64 ( $ hi , $ lo ) { / / on x64 , we can just use int if ( ( ( int ) 4294967296 ) != 0 ) return ( ( ( int ) $ hi ) << 32 ) + ( ( int ) $ lo ) ; / / workaround signed / unsigned braindamage on x32 $ hi = sprintf ( " %u " , $ hi ) ; $ lo = sprintf ( " %u " , $ lo ) ; / / use GMP or bcmath if possible if ( function_exists ( " gmp_mul " ) ) return gmp_strval ( gmp_add ( gmp_mul ( $ hi , " 4294967296 " ) , $ lo ) ) ; if ( function_exists ( " bcmul " ) ) return bcadd ( bcmul ( $ hi , " 4294967296 " ) , $ lo ) ; / / compute everything manually $ a = substr ( $ hi , 0 , - 5 ) ; $ b = substr ( $ hi , - 5 ) ; $ ac = $ a * 42949 ; / / hope that float precision is enough $ bd = $ b * 67296 ; $ adbc = $ a * 67296 + $ b * 42949 ; $ r4 = substr ( $ bd , - 5 ) + + substr ( $ lo , - 5 ) ; $ r3 = substr ( $ bd , 0 , - 5 ) + substr ( $ adbc , - 5 ) + substr ( $ lo , 0 , - 5 ) ; $ r2 = substr ( $ adbc , 0 , - 5 ) + substr ( $ ac , - 5 ) ; $ r1 = substr ( $ ac , 0 , - 5 ) ; while ( $ r4 > 100000 ) { $ r4 -= 100000 ; $ r3 ++ ; } while ( $ r3 > 100000 ) { $ r3 -= 100000 ; $ r2 ++ ; } while ( $ r2 > 100000 ) { $ r2 -= 100000 ; $ r1 ++ ; } $r = sprintf ( " %d%05d%05d%05d " , $ r1 , $ r2 , $ r3 , $ r4 ) ; $l = strlen ( $r ) ; $ i = 0 ; while ( $r [ $ i ] == " 0 " && $ i < $ l - 1 ) $ i ++ ; return substr ( $r , $ i ) ; } list ( , $ a ) = unpack ( " N " , " \xff\xff\xff\xff " ) ; list ( , $ b ) = unpack ( " N " , " \xff\xff\xff\xff " ) ; $q = _ Make64 ( $ a , $ b ) ; var_dump ( $ q ) ;
For reference , this is what would the equivalent C/C++ snippet look like :
typedef unsigned long long myuint64 ; // just for brevity unsigned int a = 0xffffffffULL ; unsigned int b = 0xffffffffULL ; myuint64 c = ( myuint64 ( a ) < < 32 ) + myuint64 ( b ) ; printf ( " %llu " , c ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 typedef unsigned long long myuint64 ; / / just for brevity unsigned int a = 0xffffffffULL ; unsigned int b = 0xffffffffULL ; myuint64 c = ( myuint64 ( a ) << 32 ) + myuint64 ( b ) ; printf ( " %llu " , c ) ;

JOHANNESBURG 
After more than a month ’s delay , the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission on Friday officially announced the results of the disputed March 29 presidential election , saying that the opposition candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , had won more votes than the incumbent , Robert Mugabe , but not enough to avoid a runoff .
Mr. Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , won 47.9 percent of the vote to Mr. Mugabe ’s 43.2 percent , the election officials said .
The third major candidate , Simba Makoni , who broke away from the governing party , ZANU - PF , to run as an independent , took 8.3 percent of the vote .
Nelson Chamisa , a spokesman for the opposition , immediately denounced election officials for short - circuiting the vote verification process and “ arrogantly ” releasing the final tallies before the opposition had a chance to challenge them .
But he was noncommittal on the crucial question of whether Mr. Tsvangirai would participate in a runoff .
No date has been announced for one .
“ They did not verify the results , ” Mr. Chamisa said .
“ They did not give us an opportunity to contest the results .
They are waylaying the people ’s will .
Clearly , this is scandalous . ”

According to a recent report by Business Week , the costs of cooling data centres and providing them with operational power is growing , leading Iceland to become a forerunner in the industry .
The North Atlantic nation is currently courting Google and Microsoft to try and lure them across the Atlantic to where energy is inexpensive and the climate somewhat cooler .
Iceland offers cheaper operating costs for data centres because of the abundance of hydroelectric and geothermal energy , undeveloped land and a climate which makes cooling considerably more cost - efficient than in the US .
Business
Week reports that the cost of the energy required by data centres in the United States has doubled between 2000 and 2006 .
The US government predicts that the $ 4.6 billion expense could double again in the next three years .
“ The digital economy is pervasive , ” says Andy Karsner , Assistant US Energy Secretary for energy efficiency .
“ The demands for computing will grow exponentially , but electric consumption can’t grow the same way . ”
The growing need for power coupled with its rising price has led corporations to seek out more creative solutions .
So far Google , Microsoft and Yahoo ! are among the many international companies who have expressed interest in establishing data centres in Iceland .
Business
Week predicts that data centre energy efficiency may be the determining factor in the dominance of either Microsoft or Google in the Internet search business .

Transport for London has apologised for the Oyster card fault Thousands of people using London 's public transport network may find their electronic
Oyster card no longer works after a fault hit the system .
The system was inoperable for at least five hours on Saturday .
Some cards used during that time have since stopped working or incurred a fine .
The cards are used as payment on buses , Tube , tram and Docklands Light Railway .
Transport for London apologised and said people with a faulty card could get a replacement from Tube stations .
A spokesman said : " Customers whose cards are not working are advised to go to their nearest London Underground ticket office where they will be able to exchange their card for a replacement .
" A small number of Freedom Pass and Young Persons Oyster card holders may also have been affected .
" They will be required to apply for replacement cards through their relevant local authority and through the young persons travel card helpline respectively .
" Our staff will be instructed to allow these card holders to continue to travel whilst replacements are issued . "
' Rare ' fault
It follows a computer fault which lasted from about 0530 BST to 1030 BST on Saturday , rendering cards inoperable , although several bus routes across the city were still unable to read cards much later in the day .
Ticket barriers were left open while the problem persisted to allow passengers pass through without delay .
Free bus travel continued on the roads for longer because individual buses had to return to their garages for their systems to be reset .
Machines used to place funds on the cards were also affected by the fault .
Transport for London ( TfL ) apologised and said Oyster faults were " very rare " , adding that a problem of this nature had not happened since March 2006 .
Passengers touch the electronic card on the reader on entry or exit to a station , or when entering a bus .
Any passenger who entered the underground or DLR system while the system was down and finished their journey after it was repaired may be charged the maximum fare .
Inconvenience apology
In a statement issued after the fault occurred , TfL said : " All passengers who incur a maximum fare on Saturday 12 July will be given an automatic refund from Tuesday .
They do not need to take any action .
" We are investigating the cause of the problem , will ensure that any necessary refunds are honoured and apologise to our passengers for any inconvenience caused . "
In May , London 's transport commissioner Peter Hendy said 17 m cards had been issued since the introduction of the Oyster system in 2003 .
He added that it had successfully sped up journeys and reduced queues on the city 's public transport network .
Passengers can currently use Oyster cards as a travel card to cover fares for periods up to one year , as well as to cover single journeys for travel to London destinations including overground stations .
People using the cards can also use them on a pay - as - you - go basis by topping up the amount of money on it to cover journeys of varying distances .
Commuters within London travelling on First Great Western ( FGW ) trains will be able to use pay - as - you - go Oyster cards from September .

' Dream Ticket ' Meets Reality : Obama Looks Beyond Clinton Hillary supporters angered as Democrat considers other women for vice president .
July 31 , 2008  --
Some supporters of Hillary Clinton are voicing anger that Barack Obama may choose another woman for his vice presidential running mate .
Rumors that other high profile women politicians -- such as two - term Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and first - term Missouri Sen.
Claire McCaskill -- are fueling a backlash of sorts from some of Clinton 's most ardent supporters .
" Hillary Clinton in not a political lego block , easily replaced by another woman candidate , " Allida Black , a former Clinton national fundraising committee member , told ABCNews.com Thursday .
" Governor Sebelius , while a good leader for Kansas , is not , in any way , an acceptable substitute for Senator Clinton , " said Black , who is also director of the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project at George Washington University .
" Women voters know this , " Black said .
" Hillary is not interchangeable . "
" Here she is a candidate that received more votes than anyone in primary history and why would he discard her for another woman vice president ; that would be insulting , " said Democrat Will Bower , co-founder of PUMA , which stands for Party Unity My A** , a Washington , D.C. - based group urging Clinton to fight for the nomination all the way to the party 's Denver convention in August .
" I really do n't care who he chooses as vice president because I 'm not going to vote for him regardless , " said Bower , who said he 'll vote for Republican Sen .
John McCain if Clinton is n't at the top of the ticket .
Another Woman ?
' Incomprehensible '
Lanny Davis , former special counsel to President Bill Clinton and a longtime friend of the Clintons dating back to their time together at Yale Law School , also blasted the idea of another woman running as Obama 's vice presidential pick .
" The selection of either one of those instead of Senator Clinton I would find completely incomprehensible , " Davis told ABC News.com .
Davis argued that while he respects Sebelius and McCaskill , Clinton supporters would have a hard time accepting another woman on the ticket .
" If anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate Hillary Clinton 's female supporters , I think that 's very patronizing to women and I do n't think that that either Governor Sebelius or Senator McCaskill would disagree , " he said .
Davis , who wrote an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday titled " Why Obama Should Pick Hillary , " said he has n't given up the " dream " of an Obama - Clinton ticket .
" She helps him more and she 's more qualified , " he said , " why would he pick two females , both who are very admirable public servants , why would you pick them over her ? "
' Dream Ticket ' Faces Tough Reality
Other Clinton supporters seem less confident that an Obama - Clinton " dream ticket " lives on .
Two former Clinton campaign staffers who started the Website VoteBoth.com to urge Obama to choose Clinton as his running mate is shutting down under the assumption that she 's not on his short - list of vice - presidential candidates .
" Because Senator Obama is no longer considering putting Senator Clinton on the ticket , we do not think continuing to lobby for it helps him win , " VoteBoth.com founder and former Clinton campaign press aide Sam Arora said .
The former Clinton staffers , who have worked for Clinton for a combined 10 years , thanked " tens of thousands " of supporters who they said petitioned , called and wrote letters to Obama , urging him to pick Clinton as his running mate .
" Because of your work , Senator Obama asked Hillary to be his keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention , " Arora and VoteBoth.com co-founder Adam Parkhomenko wrote on their Website .
" Regretfully , this means that Senator Hillary Clinton is no longer under consideration as Senator Obama 's running mate . "
Parkhomenko is a former executive assistant to Patti Solis Doyle , Clinton 's former campaign manager who was fired in February and now works for the Obama campaign , awaiting the presumptive Democratic nominee 's vice - presidential pick , whom she will serve as chief of staff .
Arora , a former Clinton campaign press aide , is now attending law school .
Officially , the Democratic convention speaker schedule has not been publicly released .
And the Obama campaign is keeping the details of whom they are considering as a potential vice presidential candidate a closely guarded secret .
" The schedule for the convention has not been finalized , " Obama spokesperson Bill Burton told ABCNews.com .
" We 're not commenting about the nominee selection process . "
But Nedra Pickler of The Associated Press has reported that Obama and Clinton advisers have said Clinton is likely to speak on the second night of the party 's August convention in Denver -- coinciding with the anniversary of the ratification of the amendment giving women the right to vote .
Obama 's Search Continues
Obama spent several hours this week meeting with the co-chairs of his vice presidential committee search team Eric Holder and Caroline Kennedy in Washington .
Potential Democratic vice - presidential contenders include Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , Indiana Sen. Even Bayh , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Sebelius , a two - term governor of a traditionally red state , and McCaskill , a first - time senator from a battleground state who is close to Obama .
McCaskill campaigned with Obama in Missouri on Wednesday , but she has said she 's not being vetted , and sources close to her describe her role as a close personal advisor rather than a possible veep candidate .
This week Sebelius sidestepped speculation about being on Obama 's vice - presidential short - list .
" All the information on the vice - presidential process is really being answered by the campaign , " Sebelius told a Kansas ABC affiliate on Tuesday .
Voters Await Issues , Not Running Mates
While Washington reporters are busily chasing rumors about who's on Obama 's veep short - list , voters may be less interested .
McCain and Obama 's choice of running mates ranked dead last in importance among voters polled recently by ABC News , with only 15 percent of likely voters calling the candidates ' veep choice " extremely important . "
Of far greater concern to voters is the economy , gas prices and the Iraq war , according to the latest Washington Post / ABC News poll .
Even among Clinton 's primary supporters , only 24 percent said the choice of a running mate would be extremely important in their vote in November .
And Clinton 's name on the ticket would n't necessarily boost Obama 's support .
If Clinton were on the ticket with Obama , 23 percent said that would make them more likely to vote for the Democratic ticket , but an essentially identical 22 percent said it would make them more likely to vote for the Republican ticket , according to the July Washington Post / ABC News Poll .
Since losing the bitterly fought Democratic primary battle to Obama , questions remain about how engaged Clinton will be in Obama 's general election campaign .
In the past , Obama has said Clinton " would be on anybody 's short - list , " but there has been little activity between the two former rivals since they appeared together at a campaign rally last month in Unity , N.H. , and at subsequent fundraisers .
And Clinton has n't been a high - profile surrogate for Obama .
The former first lady has appeared preoccupied not with electing Obama but with retiring her own $ 25 million in campaign debt , sending out an e-mail to supporters this week asking for a $ 5 donation to her campaign for a chance to dine with her " under the stars . "
Clinton , who lost her bid to be the Democratic Party 's first woman presidential candidate , won 52 percent of Democratic women voters during the primaries .
Obama leads McCain 54 to 39 percent in support from likely women voters , according to the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
While some ardent Clinton supporters said they would be angry if another woman were chosen as Obama 's vice - presidential candidate , others said they would support whomever Obama chooses -- even another woman .
" If that 's going to help him secure the White House , then we need to support him , " said Dana Kennedy , 40 , a former Clinton supporter who went state - to - state campaigning for Clinton during the primary .
" The stakes are way too high not to rally behind the nominee . "
ABC News ' Gary Langer , Peyton Craighill , Tahman Bradley , Kate McCarthy and Matt Jaffe contributed to this report .
Who is responsible for $ 150 oil ?
Thanks to Nelson Schwartz 's NYT primer on 30 years of benighted US energy policy , we can list the following villains , in approximate order of responsibility .
Note the absence of " speculators , " Russia , and OPEC .
Also note the inclusion of both Democratic and Republican administrations :
The villains :
Americans , who consume 25 % of the world 's oil ( 21 million barrels a day out of 85 million used worldwide ) , despite constituting 4 % of the world 's population .
Secretly blaming the Chinese for $ 4 gas ?
We use twice as much oil every day as China and India combined .
But wait -- have n't we always been oil pigs ?
Yes , but our consumption has increased 25 % since 1990 , after remaining flat for a decade ( because in that decade , we were actually concerned about conservation and efficiency ) .
America 's transportation systems , which consume 70 % of those 21 million barrels a day , or 15 million barrels a day ( 18 % of global consumption ) .
Most of this is consumed by individual drivers .
World economic growth without oil conservation , which has helped boost global daily oil usage to 85 million barrels from 76 million in 2000 .
The US , of course , is responsible for more than 1 million of that 9 million increase , or 10 % .
The weakened dollar .
The dollar has dropped about 40 % against the Euro in the past six years and a lesser but still profound amount against other major currencies .
Absent this decline , oil might be about $ 100 a barrel ( which would still be the highest level in history , even adjusted for inflation ) .
The US Congress and Administrations of 1985 - 2007 , who ignored report after report of an eventual crisis and refused to increase energy taxes , encourage investment in alternative energy , or mandate higher fuel efficiency .
Americans like their cars big and powerful , our politicians said , as they shot down every forward - looking policy brought their way .
Never mind that Europeans once liked their cars big and powerful , too , before their leaders decided to actually lead -- by vastly increasing fuel taxes and efficiency .
Gas in Holland costs $ 10 a gallon , with $ 5.57 of thatcoming from taxes .
Gas in Britain costs $ 8.71 a gallon .
US federal taxes are about a dime per gallon .
US cars , meanwhile , average 24 miles per gallon .
European cars average 44 miles per gallon ( headed to 48 by 2012 ) .
Have Europe 's responsible policies destroyed it ?
No. Europe has adjusted .
European economies have continued to grow , and citizens have n't resorted to revolution .
Ford ( F ) , General Motors ( GM ) , and Chrysler , who lobbied fiercely against higher fuel efficiency , threatening to shut down production plants in states whose senators supported higher fuel efficiency standards .
Higher standards , the car companies argued , would hurt sales of huge gas guzzlers , thus favoring foreign competitors .
Never mind that American car companies were perfectly capable of building smaller cars , too -- they just chose not to .
Now , $ 150 is killing sales of huge gas guzzlers anyway , and American car are on the verge of bankruptcy .
American oil companies , which complain forever about not being able to drill in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge , off the Atlantic coast , and elsewhere , but do n't drill in many areas that they 're permitted to .
The companies would have to be drilling a lot more to really make a difference , however .
The best - case estimates for ANWR drilling would be to reduce oil prices by $ 1.44 a barrel by 2027 , 19 years from now .
Offshore drilling would n't reduce prices until 2030 .
It 's an election year , so it 's a good bet we wo n't hear about anything other than " speculators , " OPEC , and greedy oil companies .
But it 's worth knowing who is really to blame .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a sweeping ban on handguns in the nation 's capital violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms .
Ariel Sarousi , left , and Steve Bierfeld of Arlington , Virginia , celebrate the court 's ruling Thursday .
The justices struck down the ban in a 5 - 4 decision , with Justice Antonin Scalia writing the opinion for the majority .
Washington Mayor Adrian
Fenty said he was disappointed in the ruling but will give the district 's police department 21 days to implement a process for registering handguns .
It still will be illegal to carry handguns outside the home , and all pistols must be registered with police .
Officials said a hot line would be set up to handle questions about the new regulations .
" It is important to respect the court 's authority and to act quickly , " Fenty said .
Watch how the city will revamp its policy »
The case 's lead plaintiff , Dick Heller , applauded the decision , saying , " I 'm very happy that I am now able to defend myself and my household in my own home . "
Paul Helmke of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said his group had a mixed reaction to the decision .
Helmke said the group disagrees with the court 's interpretation of the Second Amendment but that the ruling " still allows common - sense gun control laws , restrictions to make us all safer . "
" It 's clear what the court did today is , they limited the extremes , " Helmke said .
See how iReporters are reacting to the ruling
The National Rifle Association said the high court had given it the ammunition to challenge other cities ' gun-control measures .
At issue in District of Columbia v. Heller was whether Washington 's ban violated the right to " keep and bear arms " by preventing individuals -- as opposed to state militias -- from having guns in their homes .
" Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our nation , where well - trained police forces provide personal security and where gun violence is a serious problem , " Scalia wrote .
" That is perhaps debatable , but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct . "
More on Americans ' relationship with firearms
Scalia was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas , all of whom are considered conservative voices on the court .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , often seen as a swing vote , also joined the majority .
Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer delivered dissenting opinions and were joined by their liberal counterparts Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter .
District of Columbia officials argued they had the responsibility to impose " reasonable " weapons restrictions to reduce violent crime , but several Washingtonians challenged the 32 - year - old law .
Some said they had been constant victims of crimes and needed guns for protection .
Hear the arguments presented to the high court »
Scalia wrote that the majority was sympathetic to Washington 's problems with guns and crime but banning handguns was not a solution .
" The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem , including some measures regulating handguns , " Scalia wrote .
" But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table .
These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self - defense in the home . "
Watch a gun shop owner 's reaction »
Breyer , however , argued in his dissent that the framers of the Constitution did not present self - defense as their main reason for the Second Amendment .
" The self - defense interest in maintaining loaded handguns in the home to shoot intruders is not the primary interest , but at most a subsidiary interest , " he wrote .
" The Second Amendment 's language , while speaking of a ' militia , ' says nothing of ' self - defense . ' "
Washington residents can protect themselves from crime though other means , Breyer wrote : " The law concerns one class of weapons , handguns , leaving residents free to possess shotguns and rifles , along with ammunition . "
iReport.com :
What 's your reaction to the ruling ?
In March 2007 , a federal appeals court overturned the city 's ban , which keeps most private citizens from owning handguns and keeping them in their homes .
It was the first time a federal appeals court ruled a gun law unconstitutional on Second Amendment grounds .
City attorneys urged the high court to intervene , warning , " The District of Columbia -- a densely populated urban locality where the violence caused by handguns is well - documented -- will be unable to enforce a law that its elected officials have sensibly concluded saves lives . "
There were 143 gun-related murders in Washington last year , compared with 135 in 1976 , when the handgun ban was enacted .
The Second Amendment says , " A well - regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . "
The wording repeatedly has raised the question of whether gun ownership is an individual right , or a collective one pertaining to state militias and therefore subject to regulation .
In an Opinion Research Corp. poll of 1,035 adult Americans this month , 67 percent of those surveyed said they felt that the Second Amendment gave individuals the right to own guns .
Thirty percent said it provided citizens the right to form a militia .
The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
See poll results »
The Supreme Court had avoided the question since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 .
The high court last examined the issue in 1939 but stayed away from the broad constitutional question .
Breyer expressed concern in his dissent that the majority 's ruling could jeopardize the " constitutionality of gun laws throughout the nation . "
He added , " I can find no sound legal basis for launching the courts on so formidable and potentially dangerous a mission . "
Only Chicago , Illinois , has a handgun ban as sweeping as Washington 's , though Maryland , Massachusetts and San Francisco , California , joined the Windy City in issuing briefs supporting the district 's ban .
The NRA , Disabled Veterans for Self - Defense and the transgender group Pink Pistols -- along with 31 states -- filed briefs supporting the District of Columbia 's gun owners .
After the ruling , Wayne LaPierre of the NRA said his organization would immediately file court challenges to the bans in Chicago and San Francisco .
Watch the NRA chief say there will be more lawsuits »
In a statement , President Bush also praised the decision , saying he agreed with the court 's interpretation of the Constitution .
" As a longstanding advocate of the rights of gun owners in America , I applaud the Supreme Court 's historic decision today confirming what has always been clear in the Constitution : the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear firearms , " Bush said .
" I also agree with the Supreme Court 's conclusion that the D.C. firearm laws violate this fundamental constitutional right .
The District of Columbia should now swiftly move to ensure that its residents ' rights under the Second Amendment are fully protected , " he said .
In January , Bush signed the first major gun-control legislation in 14 years , strengthening background checks on gun buyers .
Political momentum for the bill increased after the Virginia Tech shootings last year , when a student shot and killed 32 people and then himself .

" In between the areas that were cleared by bombs are pockets that were untouched .
Looking at them now , 60 years later , with detailed images of the pattern of destruction around them , you know there is a very good chance there is a bomb in the vicinity . "
We 've all been there but do n't like to admit it .
We 've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below .
As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise , the WORK POOP is inevitable .
For those who hate pooping at work , following is the Survival Guide for taking a dump at work .
Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure .
ESCAPEE
Definition : a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall .
This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment .
This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding .
If you release an escapee , do not acknowledge it .
Pretend it did not happen .
If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal , pretend you did not hear it .
No one likes an escapee , it is uncomfortable for all involved .
Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy .
JAILBREAK ( Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE )
Definition :
When forcing poop , several farts slip out at a machine gun pace .
This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover .
If this should happen , do not panic .
Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred .
COURTESY FLUSH
Definition :
The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location .
This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom .
This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME .
WALK OF SHAME
Definition : Walking from the stall , to the sink , to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom .
This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you .
As with all farts , it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist .
Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH .
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER
Definition : A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it .
You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm .
Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom .
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK ( PFN )
Definition : A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident .
This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers , and identify SAFE HAVENS .
SAFE HAVENS
Definition : A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors .
Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex .
This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom .
TURD BURGLAR
Definition : A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open .
This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work .
If this occurs , remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves .
This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact .
CAMO -COUGH
Definition : A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall .
This can be used to cover - up a WATERMELON , or to alert potential Turd Burglars .
Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE .
ASTAIRE
Definition : A subtle toe - tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall .
This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied .
If you hear an Astaire , leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace .
WATERMELON
Definition : A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water .
This is also an embarrassing incident .
If you feel a Watermelon coming on , create a diversion .
See CAMO - COUGH .
HAVANA OMELET
Definition : A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water .
Often accompanied by an Escapee .
Try using a Camo - Cough with an Astaire .
UNCLE TED
Definition : A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever .
Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot .
An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper , as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty .
This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees .
FLY BY
Definition :
The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping .
Walk in and check for other poopers .
If there are others in the bathroom , leave and come back again .
Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER .
People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom .

Voters thinking the Republican lines of attack against Sen. Barack Obama sound familiar are n’t experiencing deja vu - Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton previewed several of them during the primary campaign .
Democrats warned that the prolonged Obama - Clinton battle could give Republicans ammunition , and they have been proved right as Mrs. Clinton ’s harsher words resurface in campaign missives from Sen.
John McCain and national , state and local Republicans .
He is naive and inexperienced on foreign policy , Mrs. Clinton suggested for months .
Republicans have echoed the attacks .
Democrats now want to move past the nasty fight and Clinton backers are standing by Mr. Obama ’s side , but Republicans are n’t eager to let the opposing party forget its warring .
See related blogs : Bellantoni on Democrats , Dinan on the Republicans , POTUS Notes
See related stories : Jennifer Harper / Anti-Obama pin jabs Texas GOP , S.A. Miller / Obama picks Clinton ex-officials as advisers and Andrea Billups / Michelle reveals softer side on ‘ The View ’ .
“ We could point to many , many examples during the debates where the words ‘ irresponsible ’ and ‘ naive ’ were applied to Senator Obama , but not by a Republican , but by Hillary Clinton .
She ’ll probably be in a different position now , but these are issues that Hillary Clinton very dramatically pointed out during the Democratic primary , ” former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told reporters Wednesday .
The former Republican presidential candidate was using Mrs. Clinton ’s line to go after Mr. Obama after the Democrat ’s formation of a national security “ working group ” to advise him on the issue .
In a press conference this week , Mr. McCain of Arizona employed another familiar line against Mr. Obama - evoking his rival ’s remarks this spring that some rural voters are “ bitter ” and “ cling ” to religion and guns .
Mrs. Clinton labeled the comments “ elitist , ” and repeatedly went after Mr. Obama as having insulted voters .
“ I wo n’t tell [ the American people ] that in small towns across America and Pennsylvania that they are bitter or angry about their economic conditions , ” he said , adding that he knows why gun enthusiasts “ embrace their constitutional rights … [ and churchgoers ] embrace their religion because they ’re fundamentally good and decent people . ”
The McCain slam could have been culled from Mrs. Clinton ’s own attack in April when the “ bitter ” comments were first reported and she said it seemed Mr. Obama was blaming rural voters for opposing him .
“ He said that they cling to religion and guns and dislike people who are different from them .
I do n’t believe that , ” she said .
“ I believe that people do n’t cling to religion ; they value their faith .
You do n’t cling to guns ; you enjoy hunting or collecting or sport shooting .
I do n’t think he really gets it that people are looking for a president who stands up for you and not looks down on you . ”
This week , the Republicans are portraying Mr. Obama as a hypocrite for criticizing the 2005 energy bill even though he voted for it - another Clinton argument .
It does n’t end there - on the economy , trade issues and even Mr. Obama ’s oratorical ability , the Republicans seem to be adopting much of the Clinton attack playbook - which she retired after it became clear this spring that she had lost the nomination to the political newcomer .
The former first lady ’s most infamous line about years of experience - during which she questioned whether he had passed the “ commander - in - chief ” test - has made a cameo in Republican attack ads .
“ Senator McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign , I will bring a lifetime of experience and Senator Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002 , ” Mrs. Clinton said in March , referring to Mr. Obama ’s speech opposing the Iraq war .
She added , “ I think it ’s imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander - in - chief threshold .
And , I believe that I have done that , certainly Senator McCain has done that , and you will have to ask Senator Obama with respect to his candidacy . ”
Those comments were pulled together in a Republican National Committee ad questioning Mr. Obama ’s experience , and appear on an RNC Web site - ClintonVsObama , www.gop.com/clintonvsobama/.
Now , the candidates have come together , and Mrs. Clinton will extend her enthusiastic endorsement further next Thursday as she introduces her former opponent to her top fundraisers in the District .
A source familiar with the event ’s planning said the candidates also are looking for a date for a public appearance with the two Democrats together .
Back when they were political rivals Mr. Obama predicted that Mrs. Clinton ’s words would resurface .
“ I ’m sure that Senator Clinton feels like she ’s doing me a great favor , because she ’s been deploying most of the arguments that the Republican Party will be using against me in November , so it ’s toughening me up , ” Mr. Obama said at the Associated Press annual luncheon in April .
Indeed , it was Mrs. Clinton who first riffed on Mr. Obama ’s “ hopeful ” message , and talked about the “ audacity ” of the senator from Illinois in a reference to his book title , and now the RNC and Mr. McCain ’s team offer a snarky “ Audacity Watch ” in e-mails to reporters .
Mr. McCain also has lambasted Mr. Obama ’s “ Change You Can Believe In ” slogan , similar to Mrs. Clinton ’s label “ Change You Can Xerox ” back in February .
Mrs. Clinton hit Mr. Obama in a February debate that he had n’t held a hearing in his Foreign Relations subcommittee about Afghanistan .
Republicans have adopted the line as well .
Voters can expect the Republicans to needle Mr. Obama on his “ present ” votes in the Illinois state senate , something Mrs. Clinton often mentioned .
Mr. Obama on Wednesday gathered his new national security team , which now includes former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and retired Gen. Wesley Clark , who each previously backed Mrs. Clinton .
He told reporters that their positions were similar and that ’s why “ it ’s so easy for … senior advisers of Senator Clinton to support my candidacy . ”
Ms. Albright was not so kind last year when the Democrats sparred over whether to meet with leaders of rogue nations .
She said in July that Mrs. Clinton ’s refusal to meet with the leaders without preconditions was a perfect answer while Mr. Obama ’s idea lacked “ diplomatic spadework . ”
That argument between the Democrats - one of their main differences - morphed into the first real fight between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain .
Republicans are using words of former Clinton supporters who have said anything remotely negative about the presumed Democratic nominee against him , such as when Ohio Gov.
Ted Strickland once compared Mr. Obama ’s run for the presidency to choosing the “ next American Idol . ”
Other Clinton greatest hits the Republicans may be using this fall :
From a February speech in the Washington : “ The American people do n’t have to guess whether I understand the issues or whether I would need a foreign policy instruction manual to guide me through a crisis , or whether I ’d have to rely on advisers to introduce me to global affairs . ”
In late February in Ohio : “ We need a president who also realizes that we have real enemies .
I know it ’s true , because I went to ground zero the day after 9/11 .
We need a president who knows what it takes to protect and defend the United States . ”
In December , Mrs. Clinton said she is “ ready on Day One ” while voters risk “ put[ting ]
America in the hands of someone with little national or international experience , who started running for president the day he arrived in the U.S. Senate . ”
Clinton aides and the RNC most of the year were on the same page , e-mailing reporters negative articles about Mr. Obama - and in particular his ties to indicted real estate developer Tony Rezko - within moments of each other .
“ I never thought I ’d compliment Clinton , but she actually made some solid points in the primary about Obama ’s weak judgment , ” said RNC spokesman Alex Conant .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . —
A researcher at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory has pinpointed stem cells within the spinal cord that , if persuaded to differentiate into more healing cells and fewer scarring cells following an injury , may lead to a new , non-surgical treatment for debilitating spinal - cord injuries .
The work , reported in the July issue of the journal PLoS ( Public Library of Science ) Biology , is by Konstantinos Meletis , a postdoctoral fellow at the Picower Institute , and colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden .
Their results could lead to drugs that might restore some degree of mobility to the 30,000 people worldwide afflicted each year with spinal - cord injuries .
In a developing embryo , stem cells differentiate into all the specialized tissues of the body .
In adults , stem cells act as a repair system , replenishing specialized cells , but also maintaining the normal turnover of regenerative organs such as blood , skin or intestinal tissues .
The tiny number of stem cells in the adult spinal cord proliferate slowly or rarely , and fail to promote regeneration on their own .
But recent experiments show that these same cells , grown in the lab and returned to the injury site , can restore some function in paralyzed rodents and primates .
The researchers at MIT and the Karolinska Institute found that neural stem cells in the adult spinal cord are limited to a layer of cube - or column - shaped , cilia - covered cells called ependymal cells .
These cells make up the thin membrane lining the inner-brain ventricles and the connecting central column of the spinal cord .
" We have been able to genetically mark this neural stem cell population and then follow their behavior , " Meletis said .
" We find that these cells proliferate upon spinal cord injury , migrate toward the injury site and differentiate over several months . "
The study uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying the tantalizing results of the rodent and primate and goes one step further :
By identifying for the first time where this subpopulation of cells is found , they pave a path toward manipulating them with drugs to boost their inborn ability to repair damaged nerve cells .
" The ependymal cells ' ability to turn into several different cell types upon injury makes them very interesting from an intervention aspect : Imagine if we could regulate the behavior of this stem cell population to repair damaged nerve cells , " Meletis said .
Upon injury , ependymal cells proliferate and migrate to the injured area , producing a mass of scar - forming cells , plus fewer cells called oligodendrocytes .
The oligodendrocytes restore the myelin , or coating , on nerve cells ' long , slender , electrical impulse - carrying projections called axons .
Myelin is like the layer of plastic insulation on an electrical wire ; without it , nerve cells do n't function properly .
" The limited functional recovery typically associated with central nervous system injuries is in part due to the failure of severed axons to regrow and reconnect with their target cells in the peripheral nervous system that extends to our arms , hands , legs and feet , " Meletis said .
" The function of axons that remain intact after injury in humans is often compromised without insulating sheaths of myelin . "
If scientists could genetically manipulate ependymal cells to produce more myelin and less scar tissue after a spinal cord injury , they could potentially avoid or reverse many of the debilitating effects of this type of injury , the researchers said .

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine calculated in a recent study — whose results were published in The Lancet — that obese people consume 18 percent more calories than non -obese people .
They got to that number by considering how many calories a population of non-obese people ( those with an average BMI of 24.5 ) would need to consume to keep their weight stable with those a population of obese people ( BMIs over 29 ) would need .
Let 's leave aside for a second the fallibility of BMI ( well - documented by Kate Harding here ) as a measure of health , well - being , or , frankly , fat ; let 's ignore also the presumption that neither of these hypothetical populations exercise or do anything to increase their caloric needs other than being fat .
( Although I do n't anticipate I 'll see the headline " compulsive exercisers to blame for world 's ills " any time soon . )
Let 's even accept the study 's premise that fat people stay fat simply because they eat more .
The conclusions still do n't follow the data .
Here 's what the study found :
Because of their greater food consumption , obese people drive up global demand for food , raising food prices worldwide .
Higher demand for food also increases agriculture 's need for oil , driving fuel prices ( and thus food prices ) higher .
Finally , fat people drive more and use more fuel when they drive — all that extra weight !— which contributes to global warming and drives fuel prices higher still .
Let 's look at these conclusions one by one .
Conclusion # 1 : Fat people are to blame for global warming because they drive everywhere and cost more to move around .
First of all , the study cites no data in claiming that overweight people drive more than people of normal weight .
Assuming no physical impediments to walking ( being wheelchair - bound , for instance ) , the amount a person drives is determined far more by urban planning — how accessible and user - friendly is the transit system ?
Is the grocery store / cinema / video store within walking distance ?
Does the city encourage alternative forms of transportation like biking , or are bike paths spotty and hard to navigate ? — than by whether he or she is overweight .
You 'll see a lot more people of all shapes and sizes walking where I live , Seattle , than in Houston , Texas , the car - dependent city where I grew up .
So does n't it follow that Houston - style planning is the real problem — not whether a person 's BMI is a few ticks north of " normal " ?
As for the " drag " issue : I do n't know whether 10 or 40 extra pounds makes much difference in the amount of fuel a person uses , but I do know this :
Hauling around a big family — to say nothing of the climate impact of having a big family — has got to add more to fuel costs ( both in weight and the cost of fueling a bigger car ) than being overweight .
The reason you wo n't see a story titled " Breeding blamed for world 's ills " is that being fat is discouraged , and having children is n't .
Conclusion # 2 : Fat people are to blame for high food prices , because increased demand for food drives up production , which drives up fuel prices , increasing the cost of food .
No , no , no , no , no .
What drives production is n't demand for more food .
We have more food than we can consume — some 3,900 calories a day for every man , woman and child in the country , or nearly twice what most people consume .
Fat people are n't clamoring for still more , more , more Cherry Cokes , Twinkies , and sugar cereals — the US food system is producing them because they have to find new ways to make us eat as much as possible .
Blame the producers , not the consumers .
Meanwhile , there are plenty of reasons food costs are rising .
Among them :
An agricultural system that subsidizes commodity crops like corn , taking food crops out of the food supply ( ironically , in response to increased demand for ethanol because of rising fuel prices ) ; demand for US exports in developing countries like China , where meat production is rising ' drought and other weather crises , quite possibly the result of climate change ; and the globalization of the world 's agricultural systems , which forces small countries to import most of the food they once produced locally .
And , of course , fuel costs .
Conclusion # 3 : Fuel costs are rising because fat people are increasing the demand for gas .
This one 's the easiest to debunk .
Fuel prices are n't rising because fat people drive more ( until very recently , in fact , we were all driving more ) ; fuel prices are rising because we 're running out of easily accessible oil .
The harder oil is to get , the more it 's going to cost .
That situation is n't going to reverse itself until we invent new technologies , start investing in alternatives to driving , or both ; but blaming high gas prices on fat people is definitely the wrong place to start .
Interestingly , the conclusions of the study itself ( as opposed to the media 's hyperventilating coverage of the study ) do n't contradict that .
In the first paragraph of the Lancet article , the two men who performed the study argue that we need " argue for " greater recognition of the importance of reducing the demand for transportation fuel in resolving the struggle for energy between people and cars . "
But given the choice between encouraging people to eat less and , I do n't know , supporting alternatives to driving , I know which one I would pick .

Analysts believe it ’s “ possible ” that the software giant Microsoft could acquire an equity stake in eBay ’s PayPal and Skype .
So are we talking about minority stakes or total ownership ?
Is eBay even up for the sale ?
No matter how you slice it , Microsoft has a lot to gain if eBay is willing to sell off any of its moving parts .
We ca n’t argue against the notion that Microsoft could swallow eBay whole .
This was suggested as much three months ago .
Such a move would make sense , especially since PayPal and Skype are good fits in Microsoft ’s online strategy .
Microsoft once had dreams of taking on PayPal .
It was hoping to transform its Passport platform into a transactional medium for third parties .
PayPal was too big to compete against back then , and it ’s even bigger now .
The only real threat to PayPal these days is Google Checkout , and not even that race is close .
If Microsoft wanted to buy Yahoo !
so badly , imagine how much it would love to own the micropayments standard that ’s trouncing Google , which itself is smacking Yahoo !
around these days .
Skype is another good fit .
The leader in online chat dovetails nicely with Microsoft ’s Web - based communications efforts through Windows Live Messenger .
Then we have eBay itself .
Microsoft is no stranger to the leading consumer - to - consumer auction - listings website .
eBay is part of the program , through which Microsoft rewards buyers with rebates .
Perhaps the most important aspect eBay can offer in Microsoft ’s quest to take on Google is that eBay ’s website traffic consists of consumers with a predisposition to spend money online .
And Microsoft needs quality traffic , not simply the sheer volume of poorly monetized pages it would have gotten on a Yahoo ! deal .
Read
Under Microsoft ’s arm , eBay would probably appease sellers by lowering fees and reversing some of the site ’s recent anti-seller moves .
It would have to , just so it would n’t alienate the Power Sellers by serving up competing ads to monetize the site .
With eBay ’s enterprise value sitting at $ 33 billion , a friendly acquisition at a fair premium would run Microsoft about — if not more than — what it was willing to pay for Yahoo !
earlier this year .
This would have to be a friendly combination .
What ’s more , eBay , PayPal , and Skype — remain the undisputed market leaders in their niches .
Nor are there any shrinking market - share worries creating an urgency to sell .
As for a piecemeal approach , there ’s no reason for eBay to sell off its PayPal appendage .
It ’s the true star in eBay ’s portfolio , and it ties in perfectly with eBay ’s auction business .
Skype , on the other hand , can probably be had , probably for even less .
Skype remains a speed demon .
It now connects 309 million users , with revenue soaring 61 % this past quarter .
The rub is that it ’s still a small part of the eBay revenue mix , as attempts to squeeze more money out of the popular voice - chat application have been difficult .
If so , Microsoft would be the best suitor ?
In short , Microsoft would be hard - pressed to wrestle away PayPal and should have no problem on Skype , but it would be better off either making a play for all of eBay , or at least a significant minority stake in the company .
Microsoft has to make moves in cyberspace .
It ca n’t afford to keep bleeding market share to Google organically .
Swallowing eBay may be too much , but the Redmond giant does n’t know how much it can eat until it sizes up what ’s on the menu .
The day I visited the Iscar campus , one of its theaters was filled with industrialists from the Czech Republic , who were getting a lecture  in Czech  from Iscar experts .
The Czechs came all the way to the Israel - Lebanon border region to learn about the latest innovations in precision tool - making .
Wertheimer is famous for staying close to his customers and the latest technologies .
“ If you sleep on the floor , ” he likes to say , “ you never have to worry about falling out of bed . ”
That kind of hunger explains why , in the first quarter of 2008 , the top four economies after America in attracting venture capital for start - ups were : Europe $ 1.53 billion , China $ 719 million , Israel $ 572 million and India $ 99 million , according to Dow Jones VentureSource .
Israel , with 7 million people , attracted almost as much as China , with 1.3 billion .
Boaz Golany , who heads engineering at the Technion , Israel ’s M.I.T. , told me : “ In the last eight months , we have had delegations from I.B.M. , General Motors , Procter & Gamble and Wal - Mart visiting our campus .
They are all looking to develop R & D centers in Israel . ”
Ahmadinejad professes not to care about such things .
He was  to put it in American baseball terms  born on third base and thinks he hit a triple .
Because oil prices have gone up to nearly $ 140 a barrel , he feels relaxed predicting that Israel will disappear , while Iran maintains a welfare state  with more than 10 percent unemployment .
Iran has invented nothing of importance since the Islamic Revolution , which is a shame .
Historically , Iranians have been a dynamic and inventive people  one only need look at the richness of Persian civilization to see that .
But the Islamic regime there today does not trust its people and will not empower them as individuals .
Of course , oil wealth can buy all the software and nuclear technology you want , or ca n’t develop yourself .
This is not an argument that we should n’t worry about Iran .
Ahmadinejad should , though .
Iran ’s economic and military clout today is largely dependent on extracting oil from the ground .
Israel ’s economic and military power today is entirely dependent on extracting intelligence from its people .
Israel ’s economic power is endlessly renewable .
Iran ’s is a dwindling resource based on fossil fuels made from dead dinosaurs .
So who will be here in 20 years ?
I ’m with Buffett : I ’ll bet on the people who bet on their people  not the people who bet on dead dinosaurs .
Scientists in Sydney have identified a process , a synergistic encounter between two molecules , that may account for the extreme allergic reactions some people experience .
By silencing at least one of these molecules , it may be possible to treat allergies .
The molecules , IL - 4 and IL - 21 , are cytokines or ' chemical messengers ' produced by immune cells known as T cells .
T cells use cytokines to communicate with B cells , which then make antibodies .
When IL - 4 and IL - 21 are involved in the same ' conversation ' with a B cell , laboratory experiments show they stimulate the production of large amounts of the antibody class known as immunoglobulin E , or IgE .
IgE is a very tightly regulated antibody .
Under normal circumstances , it is present in only very small quantities and protects us against parasites .
Unfortunately , it becomes damaging when the body makes too much .
The findings , made by Danielle Avery and Dr Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research , are now published online in the prestigious international publication Blood .
Dr Tangye , a B cell biologist , is interested in understanding how the body regulates the production of antibodies , in this case the IgE class .
" IgE is such an efficient molecule that too much of it can be dangerous , " he said .
" High quantities tend to over - activate other immune cells and it's the action of those other cells that can be damaging .
High levels of IgE are associated with allergies including asthma , dermatitis and rhinitis . "
" It 's been known for many years that IL - 4 can drive IgE production in humans and mice .
Our finding shows that IL - 21 also stimulates production of IgE by human B cells , but it does this by using an entirely different pathway . "
" As it happens , the combination of IL - 4 and IL - 21 provokes a very strong IgE response , around ten times greater than either molecule in isolation . "
" Through an ongoing collaboration with Canberra 's John Curtin School of Medical Research , Canberra Hospital and Westmead Hospital , we were able to test our theory by looking at patients with mutations in the IL - 21 pathway .
If you can't activate that pathway , you do n't get the synergistic effect between the two cytokines . "
" We surmise as a result of this study that it should be possible to target the IL - 21 molecule with an antibody to block its ability to activate B cells .
This may prove an effective treatment in cases where allergic responses are caused by the synergistic effect of IL - 4 and IL - 21 . "

DAKAR ( Reuters ) - Senegal ’s president said on Thursday George W. Bush told African leaders at one stage the United States might send troops to Sudan ’s Darfur if they did not act to halt what he saw as genocide there .

President Abdoulaye Wade said Bush , who has lobbied strongly for robust international action to end the five - year - old conflict in Darfur , had made the warnings to him , but he did not specify when or in what circumstances .
Commenting on the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor ’s move this week to seek a war crimes arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir , Wade said Bush had “ always proclaimed loudly and clearly that the United States considered Bashir had committed genocide in Darfur ” .
“ I ’ve had to transmit to President Bashir and to my other African colleagues President Bush ’s warnings that if Africa did n’t do anything to end the tragedy in Darfur , the United States could bypass the ( United Nations ) Security Council and send contingents to Darfur , ” the Senegalese leader said in a statement issued in Dakar .
“ Myself and other African colleagues tried to dissuade him from this and to convince him to leave us to try to sort out this problem among us Africans , ” he added .
The United States has supported the deployment of a joint U.N. - African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur and has even helped to airlift international peacekeepers to and from the violence - torn western Sudanese region .
However Washington , stretched by heavy military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan , has stopped short of sending its own troops to Darfur , where foreign experts estimate 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in five years of political and ethnic conflict .
Asked about Wade ’s comments , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said : “ The president is committed to supporting the AU - UN peacekeeping force . ”
SUFFERING OF CIVILIANS
Wade said he had taken Bush ’s warning to send troops to Darfur “ very seriously ... especially since in the case of ( the U.S. - led invasion of ) Iraq , he ’d informed me two days in advance ” .
Wade , who has tried to mediate to help end the fighting in Darfur , said he was aware of the suffering of civilians there and , as a defender of human rights , could not stand by while a crime was being committed .
“ It ’s not up to me to defend President Bashir if he is guilty , ” he said in his statement .
Echoing a view taken by the African Union this week , Wade said the ICC prosecutor ’s indictment against Bashir could worsen the situation in Darfur and create “ indescribable chaos ” .
He added he would prefer to see a one - year suspension of any arrest warrant against the Sudanese president , which would allow investigations into his case to continue .
“ In law , you are innocent until proven guilty , ” the octogenarian Senegalese president , a lawyer by training , said .
“ Myself and other heads of state in Africa , in cooperation with the African Union Commission , will do what is necessary in relation to President Bashir so that all measures can be taken to achieve a just and lasting solution to this crisis , ” Wade said in his statement , without giving further details .

“ The chorus of ‘ yeas ’ was thunderous , ” Robert Darnton , the director of the University Library , wrote in an e-mail message .
“ I hope this marks a turning point in the way communications operate in the world of scholarship . ”
The library will oversee an Office of Scholarly Communication , which is being created to handle the project .
Professor Darnton said a Web site instructing the faculty on how to transmit articles is already up and running , and the technical work should be completed by April 1 .
Meanwhile open access took another step forward on Wednesday when Fastcase inaugurated the Public Library of Law ( www.plol.org), a free online legal research site .
What ’s going on ?
Mr. Geithner described a vicious circle in which banks and other market players who took on too much risk are all trying to get out of unsafe investments at the same time , causing “ significant collateral damage to market functioning . ”
A report released last Friday by JPMorgan Chase was even blunter .
It described what ’s happening as a “ systemic margin call , ” in which the whole financial system is facing demands to come up with cash it does n’t have .
( A financial joke making the rounds , via the blog Calculated Risk : “ Who is this guy Margin that keeps calling me ? ” )
The Fed ’s latest plan to break this vicious circle is  as the financial Web site interfluidity .com cruelly but accurately describes it  to turn itself into Wall Street ’s pawnbroker .
Banks that might have raised cash by selling assets will be encouraged , instead , to borrow money from the Fed , using the assets as collateral .
In a worst - case scenario , the Federal Reserve would find itself owning around $ 200 billion worth of mortgage - backed securities .
Some observers worry that the Fed is taking over the banks ’ financial risk .
But what worries me more is that the move seems trivial compared with the size of the problem : $ 200 billion may sound like a lot of money , but when you compare it with the size of the markets that are melting down  there are $ 11 trillion in U.S. mortgages outstanding  it ’s a drop in the bucket .
The only way the Fed ’s action could work is through the slap - in - the - face effect : by creating a pause in the selling frenzy , the Fed could give hysterical markets a chance to regain their sense of perspective .
And to be fair , that has worked in the past .
But slap - in - the - face only works if the market ’s problems are mainly a matter of psychology .
And given that the Fed has already slapped the market in the face twice , only to see the financial crisis come roaring back , that ’s hard to believe .
Ford Posts its Worst Quarter Ever
This is a guest post from Ben Nelson , forum member and electric motorcycle guru .
Thanks ,
Ben !
Back in January 2007 , the Washinton post reported how the Ford Motor Company had reported a loss of $ 12.7 billion in 2006 , the worst in its 103 year history .
In the same article , “ Ford …blamed the loss in 2006 on a profit collapse in its truck - dependent North American division . ”
Today , Ford reported a second - quarter loss of $ 8.7 billion – the worst quarter ever .
Of course most of us sort of expect that .
We hear in the news every day about the cost of food , energy , and healthcare .
We hear about the housing market and banks going bankrupt .
But we plan ahead , we change as we have to , as do the motor companies .
In May , the F - 150 , the “ best - selling vehicle in America ” was outsold by Honda ’s Civic and Accord and Toyota ’s Camry and Corolla .
None of which are pickup trucks , and all of which are know as well - built , fuel - efficient vehicles .
So , Ford is changing right ?
In June , Green Car Congress reported that “ Ford Motor Company will produce the new Ford Fiesta small car for North America at the companyâ€™s transformed CuautitlÃ¡n Assembly Plantâ€ ” currently producing F - Series ( F - 150 to F - 550 ) pickups for the Mexican marketâ€ ” beginning in early 2010 . ”
North America – that means the Fiesta may or may NOT even be for sale in the United States .
And sales two years from now are n’t doing Ford any good this summer .
Take a look at Ford ’s main web page .
In the “ Vehicle Showroom ” feature for the Ford brand , six of the vehicles are “ cars ” , everything else is a pickup , SUV or crossover .
And that ’s only if you count the Focus and Mustang twice .
While the Ford Escape Hybrid offers greatly improved city mileage over it ’s standard engine brother , it comes at a premium of about $ 8000 extra .
That ’s if you can find one .
This spring , when I checked on availability of that vehicle , I found that there was only one , literally just one , for sale at any dealership in the entire state !
For years , auto manufacturers have been saying that they just are giving the public what it wants , and that ’s trucks and SUVs .
Ford has continued its manufacturing based on outdated modes of thought about what people want in a vehicle .
Right now , what the public wants is something affordable to operate – not another gas guzzler .
Will Ford make changes to its lineup quick enough to continue as one of the major manufactureres , or will “ Built Ford Tough ” simply not be good enough ?

Interviews with executives and correspondents at television news networks suggested that while the CBS cutbacks are the most extensive to date in Baghdad , many journalists shared varying levels of frustration about placing war stories onto newscasts .
“ I ’ve never met a journalist who has n’t been frustrated about getting his or her stories on the air , ” said Terry McCarthy , an ABC News correspondent in Baghdad .
Image Lara Logan told Jon Stewart recently that war news is hard to get onto TV .

By telephone from Baghdad , Mr. McCarthy said he was not as busy as he was a year ago .
A decline in the relative amount of violence “ is taking the urgency out ” of some of the coverage , he said .
Still , he gets on ABC ’s “ World News ” and other programs with stories , including one on Friday about American gains in northern Iraq .
Anita McNaught , a correspondent for the Fox News Channel , agreed .
“ The violence itself is not the story anymore , ” she said .
She counted eight reports she had filed since arriving in Baghdad six weeks ago , noting that cable news channels like Fox News and CNN have considerably more time to fill with news than the networks .
CNN and Fox each have two fulltime correspondents in Iraq .
Richard Engel , the chief foreign correspondent for NBC News , who splits his time between Iraq and other countries , said he found his producers “ very receptive to stories about Iraq . ”
He and other journalists noted that the heated presidential primary campaign put other news stories on the back burner earlier this year .
Ms. Logan said she begged for months to be embedded with a group of Navy Seals , and when she came back with the story , a CBS producer said to her , “ One guy in uniform looks like any other guy in a uniform . ”
In the follow - up phone interview , Ms. Logan said the producer no longer worked at CBS .
And in both interviews , she emphasized that many journalists at CBS News are pushing for war coverage , specifically citing Jeff Fager , the executive producer of “ 60 Minutes . ”
CBS News won a Peabody Award last week for a “ 60 Minutes ” report about a Marine charged in the killings at Haditha .
On “ The Daily Show , ” Ms. Logan echoed the comments of other journalists when she said that many Americans seem uninterested in the wars now .
Mr. McCarthy said that when he is in the United States , bringing up Baghdad at a dinner party “ is like a conversation killer . ”
Coverage of the war in Afghanistan has increased slightly this year , with 46 minutes of total coverage year - to - date compared with 83 minutes for all of 2007 .
NBC has spent 25 minutes covering Afghanistan , partly because the anchor Brian Williams visited the country earlier in the month .
Through Wednesday , when an ABC correspondent was in the middle of a prolonged visit to the country , ABC had spent 13 minutes covering Afghanistan .
CBS has spent eight minutes covering Afghanistan so far this year .
YOU KNOW the shot :
Seen from above , the hero ( or villain ) is hurtling down the freeway , top down , one hand on the wheel and the other clutching a cellphone to his ear .
It ’s Hollywood ’s image of how deals are made , dates are broken and gossip is shared , at 65 miles per hour .
On Tuesday , that shot will be history .
California motorists -- as well as those in Washington state , where a similar law was recently passed -- will be prohibited from talking on hand - held cellular phones while driving .
Most , however , will likely continue their wireless business using headsets , speakers or other hands - free devices .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says the new law will reduce accidents .
“ Getting people ’s hands off their phones and onto their steering wheels will save lives and make California ’s roads safer , ” he said earlier this month .
That , however , is not what the research finds .
Scientists say that when mixing cellphones and driving , the number of hands available for the tasks is not the limiting factor .
Instead , it ’s a driver ’s attention and processing capacity .
These are often stretched beyond safe limits when someone juggles the complex tasks of negotiating traffic and conversing with another remotely .
Worse than being drunk
“ There are limits to how much we can multi-task , and that combination of cellphone and driving exceeds the limits , ” says David Strayer , a University of Utah psychologist who has found that by many measures , drivers yakking on cellphones are more dangerous behind the wheel than those who are drunk , whether the conversation is carried on by handset or headset .
In a 2005 study , published in the journal Human Factors , Strayer put 41 adult drivers through four sessions in a simulator , re-creating realistic driving conditions along a 24 - mile stretch of freeway .
Over three days , the subjects took the wheel in various ways : sober and off - the - phone ; legally under the influence of orange - juice - and - vodka cocktails ; while talking with a research assistant by hand - held cellphone ; and chatting over a hands - free cellphone device .
The result : Compared with drivers exceeding the legal blood alcohol limit , users of cellphones -- hand - held or hands - free -- reacted 18 % more slowly to braking by the car in front and were more likely to get in a rear - end collision .
What ’s more , the talkers seemed to compensate for their slowed response time by falling farther behind the car in front -- a pattern likely to slow traffic and exacerbate congestion .
“ And you do n’t get any better with practice , ” Strayer adds .
In his lab , subjects who reported they use a cellphone a lot when driving “ show every bit as much impairment ” than those who do so infrequently .
Although no studies looked at the safety of cellphone chatter by drivers of manual - transmission cars , Strayer acknowledged that stick - shifters may reap immediate safety improvements by switching to a hands - free device for cellphone calls .
But he cautions that , in principle , that would merely bring these motorists up to “ the same level of impairment ” as automatic - transmission drivers talking on cellphones .
He says cellphone bans that exempt hands - free devices “ are half - measures that are n’t really taking into account the available scientific evidence .
And it ’s not just one source of evidence , ” he adds ; in recent years , dozens of studies , using a wide range of methods , have concluded there is no difference between driving performance of people using hand - held phones and hands - free devices .
For instance , in a 2005 Australian study published in the British Medical Journal , researchers interviewed , during a 27 - month period , 456 hospitalized cellphone users who had each been involved in a crash .
The scientists combed the drivers ’ call records to see how cellphone use affected their driving .
Whether they talked hands - free or with a phone clasped to their ear , the result was the same : During calls , and for 10 minutes after their completion , a driver ’s likelihood of crashing shot up fourfold .
In the lab , multi- tasking drivers fare little better .
A recent study showed powerfully how doing two seemingly simple tasks can overload the brain and cause errors of judgment .
Marcel Just , a neuroscientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , conducted brain imaging of 29 young adults to gauge the cognitive demands of simultaneously driving and listening .
Lying in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine , the subjects steered a simulated car down a winding road .
On a second run , they steered the car while listening to general - knowledge statements and identifying them as true or false .
The study , published in April in the journal Brain Research , found that subjects who were allowed to navigate undisturbed showed robust activity in the brain ’s parietal lobe , a region long associated with spatial sense , distance calculations and judgments that require a person to calculate his whereabouts in a broader physical environment .
When the task of listening to the sentences was added , blood flowed to different parts of the brain generally involved in the processing of language .
As those language areas came alive , activity in the parietal lobe declined by almost 40 % .
While engaged in the listening task , drivers simultaneously listening to sentences veered off the road and onto the shoulder almost 50 % more often than those allowed to focus uniquely on driving .
And all they had to do was steer the car forward : no cars veered into their lane , no children darted into the road , no construction site loomed up unexpectedly .
“ Before we ever ran any of these studies , some thought , ‘ Well , these were two independent tasks , performed by two independent brain areas , ’ ” Just says .
But certain brain regions are very likely critical to both tasks , he adds , and the flow of traffic in the multi- tasking brain appears to have slowed as a result .
“ It can only do so much at a time . ”
Listening is n’t so easy
People mistakenly believe that listening is a light burden and readily adjustable when competing demands crop up , Just says .
But he believes that spoken language is neither simple to process nor easy to tune out .
“ For a driver , it ’s insidious , ” he says .
“ You think driving is kind of effortless , chatting is kind of effortless , so what the heck .
And you can combine them and , mostly , you ’re fine .
But in hard driving , that can be a definite risk . ”
If listening is demanding , talking appears to be even harder , especially when the other person is n’t in the car .
In a study published in June in the journal Experimental Psychology , University of South Carolina psychologist Amit Almor put 47 subjects in a surround - sound console and had them detect visual shapes on a monitor or use a mouse to track a moving target on a screen .
When the subjects listened to prerecorded narratives , their attention to the visual task before them dipped significantly .
But as they then answered questions about what they ’d seen , or even just got ready to speak , their attention to the task on the screen did n’t dip -- it plummeted .
“ It has not anything to do with manipulating the phone or holding it , ” Almor says .
“ It ’s the attentional demands of conversation that matters . ”
Those demands shoot up , he adds , when drivers expect to contribute to conversations .
Some researchers , in fact , fear that the new law may cause more traffic accidents , not fewer , because they envision more distractions for many motorists .
When ring tones chime and drivers scramble to find their newly purchased headsets -- or , alternatively , scan the roadsides for police enforcing the new ban -- their attention , already stretched , will be further taxed .
Strayer suggests , too , that motorists who believe they ’re now safer because they ’re not using a hand - held may now spend more time on the phone in the belief that cellphones ’ safety issues have been addressed .
It ’s clear many drivers agree with Schwarzenegger ’s contention that the roads will be safer .
Denise Spooner of Claremont says that although she has her doubts about other drivers , she ’s pretty sure that hands - free - calling - while - driving has made her a less - hazardous motorist .
A stick - shift owner -- and a longtime user of headsets -- Spooner , a 52 - year - old historian at Cal State Fullerton , says having both hands available for rapid response “ makes the difference . ”
“ What else , ” she asks , “ could it be ? ”

The beguiling combination of kd lang 's androgynous looks and sensuous voice propelled her to fame in the 90s but , asks Emine Saner , does she want her first collection of new songs in eight years to put her back at the top of the charts ?
For a while , in the 90s , it felt as if kd lang was everywhere .
Then she was nowhere .
Today , she 's here , in a hotel room in Cologne , halfway through a European tour of her first album of original songs in eight years .
Gone are the model groupies , celebrity friends and media circus .
She is older , wiser , more settled .
A reincarnation , if you like .
She talks in slow , careful sentences with lots of pauses .
With some people , this can feel awkward , but with lang it feels still , calming .
I 'm not sure if she 's finished a thought , so I wait and watch her instead .
She has filled out , like a middle - aged man with a wife who likes to look after him .
She sits , cross-legged , on the sofa in her hotel room .
Her face is fascinating ; the slant to her eyes hint at a heritage that includes Icelandic and Native American , and when she smiles she looks beautiful .
Her hair , greying now , is in the same style she had when her career started 25 years ago .
" I cut it myself and I only know how to do one thing .
It 's not a fashion statement , it 's just a result of inadequacy , " she says with a laugh .
She is 47 and seems completely at ease with herself .
She talks about getting older - " I love it .
I feel happier and more content with what I have and who I am , and less - what 's the word ?
Covetous .
The older I get , the more I embrace who I am " - and how she can slip through the world almost unnoticed these days .
" My public image is so low - key , but I get to travel the world and still have an audience and it's really amazing , " she says .
" I do n't take that for granted . "
We talk about why so few older women musicians are as revered as their male peers .
" I do n't know , there 's some sort of disregard for women 's perspective after a while .
Music and the business of music is so sexually driven ...
It depends , I guess , on how you were perceived .
When women make their image about youth and sexuality , and not about intellect , that 's kind of a dead - end road .
So I think it 's a combination of self - entrapment and entrapment by society . "
Lang 's longevity was never really in question .
First and always foremost , there was her voice , as pure and wide and open as Canadian skies .
She has also wriggled free of attempts to pigeonhole her and the simple fact of her masculine image seems to automatically afford her more respect .
It would be pointless to bitch about lang losing her looks - as just about every other female musician over 40 has to endure - because she never played that game in the first place .
" I 've always had an interesting relationship with my androgyny , " she says .
" It 's kind of breadfruit - it looks poisonous but it 's really good once you figure out how to get into it .
I think the combination of my voice and my look was pre-ordained . "
It has often been remarked on , this contrast between one of the most sensual rich voices , one that can floor you with emotion , coming from a woman with a practical haircut and a wardrobe of shapeless suits .
Every day , she says , she gets mistaken for a man .
" I like that , " she says .
" I did n't always , it bugged me sometimes , but I like going through the world kind of ambiguous .
I definitely get less harassment , less attention . "
She means sexual harassment , not the attention that comes with being famous , which , as far as I can tell , she does n't get much of any more , to her relief .
" I remember one time I wore a really tight T - shirt that showed cleavage and some guy looked at my boobs and I was like , ' what ?!'
It was , to me , really crazy .
It felt so alien .
Being androgynous changes the sexual playing field too , because a lot of gay guys flirt with me , a lot of straight women flirt with me . "
She pauses .
" Or they have - not any more , nobody flirts with me any more . "
Lang was five when she realised she was gay ( " I remember taking swimming lessons and being completely enamoured with Christy , the swimming instructor " ) , 13 when she came out to herself , 17 when she came out to her mother and 30 when she came out to the world .
It 's easy to forget now what an impact announcing you were gay had back then .
There was some pressure from her record company not to , but looking back , she says , coming out both helped and hindered her .
" I do n't think [ my album ]
Ingenue would have been a hit without me coming out , I would n't have got on the cover of Vanity Fair [ in a barber 's chair being shaved by supermodel Cindy Crawford ] .
But at the same time , I 'm different . "
At the moment , Katy Perry is at the top of the Billboard charts in the US with her song I Kissed a Girl ( the former Christian rock poppet 's previous song Ur So Gay was attacked for being homophobic ) .
Does n't it infuriate her when straight women pretend to be gay for publicity , for titillation ?
" The Britney - Madonna kiss [ at the MTV music awards in 2003 ] annoyed me .
I do n't know much about Katy Perry , but I think there needs to be some inning now and then . "
She laughs .
" Ultimately though , it 's all good to play with sexuality and not be the gayest gay and not be the straightest straight .
Ultimately , we 're all bisexual , honestly I think that 's true .
I think [ the gay community 's ] fears and expectations are the things that get all flustered when someone like Katy Perry has a song . "
Katherine Dawn Lang grew up in Consort , Alberta , a Canadian prairie town , the youngest of four .
Her mother was a teacher and her father ran the local drugstore .
When she was 12 , her father left for another woman and , apart from a chance encounter when she was an adult , lang never saw him again ( he died last year and neither lang , nor her siblings , went to his funeral ) .
She bristles when I mention her father , but she appears to have made peace with him .
After winning a singing competition as a child , lang knew this was where her future lay and all but gave up on school .
She spent the 80s singing country , although by the time lang came out in 1992 ( not only as gay but also as vegetarian , fronting an animal rights campaign ) , the affair with Nashville was over .
She switched to torch songs , moved to LA to be near a married woman she had fallen for and channelled that unrequited love into Ingenue .
There and then , lang exploded .
She describes the height of her fame as " really exciting but it was a fuck - up too .
You can think you have the capacity to deal with it but nothing prepares you for it .
I really thought I did n't care , that I could be famous and not be altered by it - but you are .
You get caught up in it and some of it is real but for the most part , it 's superficial and very fragile or temporary . "
Lang was everywhere and everyone wanted a part of this thrillingly different creature .
What was it like to have Madonna coming on to her ?
" She never came on to me , that was a lot of publicity because we had the same publicist and it helped Madonna and it helped me , " she says .
" I do n't think Madonna ever really liked me , to be honest .
We 're very different people . "
The trappings of fame and success became a diversion .
" I had designers throwing clothes at me and then you realise you have to go to the fashion shows .
Which seems very fun and good , until you realise you 're in this kind of prostitutal exchange ...
I woke up and thought , ' this is ridiculous ' . "
Lang had been touring Ingenue for a long 18 months and was getting tired and disillusioned .
" I was starting to wake up to the ' nothing is free ' perspective , " she says .
" I felt like there were all these expectations on me - from my manager , from the gay community , from myself . "
Her next album , All You Can Eat , was she says , " like the food at a buffet - total carbohydrates and no nutritional value .
It sold , like , 38 copies and it was perfect because it did what I wanted it to do , which was snap me out of it . "
She took herself off , started learning about Buddhism , met her partner , Jamie , a fellow student and settled down in her modest wood cabin in LA with their dogs .
She released Hymns of the 49th Parallel in 2004 , a simple , beautiful album of songs by Canadian songwriters including Joni Mitchell , Neil Young and Leonard Cohen , partly because she did n't know what else to do in response to the path America had taken after 9/11 .
" All the flags and the aggression and the throwing the stones back .
The oppressive environment of fear .
For a long time , I did n't know what to write or I did n't feel I had the capacity to say anything about it . "
Lang allowed herself the time to let her new album , Watershed , develop alongside the changes that were happening in her that came with Buddhism .
Where once her songs of regret and longing might have been tortured and melancholic , they are now pared - down and introspective .
" I think I have a better sense of my weaknesses - being self - important , selfish and having a big ego probably triggers all the other stuff .
I can see myself more clearly . "
Several of the songs are straightforward love songs ( " I have slept there in the snow with others / Yet loved no others before " ) and lang 's intense , youthful infatuation has given way to comfortable contentment .
Is it important for her to be in a relationship ?
" No , but it 's definitely a nice bonus .
Life is so impermanent that it's not about somebody else or things around me , it 's about knowing you are completely alone in this world and being content inside "
· Watershed is out now on Nonesuch records .

Facts from Cohen and others
How long will nuclear energy last ?
Nuclear energy , assuming breeder reactors , will last for several billion years , i.e. as long as the sun is in a state to support life on earth .
Here are the basic facts .
In 1983 , uranium cost $ 40 per pound .
The known uranium reserves at that price would suffice for light water reactors for a few tens of years .
Since then more rich uranium deposits have been discovered including a very big one in Canada .
At $ 40 per pound , uranium contributes about 0.2 cents per kwh to the cost of electricity .
( Electricity retails between 5 cents and 10 cents per kwh in the U.S. )
Breeder reactors use uranium more than 100 times as efficiently as the current light water reactors .
Hence much more expensive uranium can be used .
At $ 1,000 per pound , uranium would contribute only 0.03 cents per kwh , i.e. less than one percent of the cost of electricity .
At that price , the fuel cost would correspond to gasoline priced at half a cent per gallon .
How much uranium is available at $ 1,000 per pound ?
There is plenty in the Conway granites of New England and in shales in Tennessee , but Cohen decided to concentrate on uranium extracted from seawater - presumably in order to keep the calculations simple and certain .
Cohen ( see the references in his article ) considers it certain that uranium can be extracted from seawater at less than $ 1000 per pound and considers $ 200 - 400 per pound the best estimate .
In terms of fuel cost per million BTU , he gives ( uranium at $ 400 per pound 1.1 cents , coal $ 1.25 , OPEC oil $ 5.70 , natural gas $ 3 - 4 . )
How much uranium is there in seawater ?
Seawater contains 3.3x10 ^( - 9 ) ( 3.3 parts per billion ) of uranium , so the 1.4x10 ^18 tonne of seawater contains 4.6x10^9 tonne of uranium .
All the world 's electricity usage , 650GWe could therefore be supplied by the uranium in seawater for 7 million years .
However , rivers bring more uranium into the sea all the time , in fact 3.2x10 ^4 tonne per year .
Cohen calculates that we could take 16,000 tonne per year of uranium from seawater , which would supply 25 times the world 's present electricity usage and twice the world 's present total energy consumption .
He argues that given the geological cycles of erosion , subduction and uplift , the supply would last for 5 billion years with a withdrawal rate of 6,500 tonne per year .
The crust contains 6.5x10 ^13 tonne of uranium .
He comments that lasting 5 billion years , i.e. longer than the sun will support life on earth , should cause uranium to be considered a renewable resource .
Here 's a Japanese site discussing extracting uranium from seawater .
Comments :
Cohen neglects decay of the uranium .
Since uranium has a half - life of 4.46 billion years , about half will have decayed by his postulated 5 billion years .
He did n't mention thorium , also usable in breeders .
There is 4 times as much in the earth 's crust as there is uranium .
There 's less thorium in seawater than there is uranium .
He did mention fusion , but remarks that it has n't been developed yet .
He has certainly provided us plenty of time to develop it .
Cohen 's web site contains links to many of his articles .
He 's a particular expert on radiation hazards .
His 1990 book The Nuclear Energy Option is on the web page .
Its chapter on solar energy is especially interesting in its description of the 1990 hopes for solar energy .
Bernard Cohen is Professor Emeritus of Physics at Pittsburgh University .
He is former president of the Health Physics Society , the main scientific society concerned with radiation safety .
He has written several books on nuclear energy .
Several of Cohen 's papers are reproduced on Russ Paielli 's nuclear page

Europe ’s first high speed train link from Paris to Lyon saw air traffic drop significantly .
This was followed by the same phenomenon more recently in the Paris - London , Paris - Brussels and Paris - Amsterdam combinations .
Madrid - Barcelona high speed trains caused an 18.4 % drop in airline passengers .
When I lived in Japan , Tokyo was linked to Niigata by bullet train and the air route was canceled altogether .
It ’s faster to get on the train and than to going to the outer limits of the city to reach the airport , check - in , fly , check - out , etc .

Train speeds are pushing along faster – 300 kph ( 200 m ph ) about the speed and sometimes better of small commuter airlines .
In any event , can we expect trains to overtake plane routes in more places ?
I do n’t see it happening in the States .
The country is too big .
However , there has been talk of a high speed train route from San Francisco to Los Angeles .
But , those talks always stall because of some special interest group .
In this case , the environmentalists prevent environmentalists from trying to do ‘ good . ’
Then what ?

The healthcare plan is part of an EU " social Europe " package The European Commission has unveiled a healthcare package designed to make it easier for patients to get medical treatment elsewhere in the EU .
Under the proposals , patients would not have to get their doctor 's approval for non-hospital care abroad .
The European Parliament and EU governments must approve the rules for them to take effect .
Patients would be able to claim up to the amount their treatment would have cost in their home country .
The Commission 's draft directive is part of a wider " renewed social agenda " package aimed at clarifying citizens ' rights in line with European Court of Justice rulings .
The package also includes measures to improve access to jobs and fight discrimination and poverty .
HAVE YOUR SAY
As a country we seem incapable of managing the NHS effectively , so why not !!!!
Mark , London
In recent years the court 's judges have ruled that freedom to cross EU borders for the best and quickest treatment is a right for all .
A Commission healthcare spokesman , Nicholas Fahy , said the aim was to clarify patients ' rights to treatment abroad , and the Commission was not introducing new rights .
In a landmark ruling in 2006 , the European Court said the UK's National Health Service should reimburse a woman for a hip replacement operation she had in France .
The woman , Yvonne Watts , won the argument that patients facing " undue delays " in the queue for operations should be entitled to treatment in other EU countries .
She paid £ 3,900 for the operation .
No free ' health tourism '
The Commission says patients are entitled to be reimbursed for treatment that their home health authority would normally provide .
The NHS would not be expected to pay for spa treatments in Germany , for example .
It 's exactly to make the rules clearer after all the court cases that the Commission has been working on new laws
Mark Mardell 's Europe Q&A : EU healthcare proposals A UK Department of Health spokesperson said the Commission 's proposals " will be subject to change during future negotiations " .
" The government is clear that health tourism will not be funded by the NHS , " the spokesperson continued .
" We are also absolutely committed to ensuring that , where UK patients choose to travel abroad for care , the NHS retains the ability to decide what care it will fund .
Equally , anyone from other member states travelling to the UK specifically for healthcare will have to pay the full NHS cost of treatment upfront . "
Currently , only 1 % of healthcare budgets are spent on cross - border healthcare and the number of people seeking treatment abroad is very small , the Commission says .
The new package still allows member states to require that their citizens get prior authorisation for hospital treatment abroad .
But such authorisations would be on a case - by - case basis , and states would have to prove there was a specific problem justifying their limitation of a patient 's right to foreign healthcare .
If the cost of treatment abroad exceeds the cost of similar treatment at home , the patient will have to pay the difference , under the Commission 's scheme .
Detailed negotiations Currently the European Health Insurance Card ( EHIC ) provides emergency care across the EU for patients who fall ill while abroad .
It only applies to those who have health insurance at home .
The new scheme is designed to help in cases where the nearest hospital or specialist clinic is in a neighbouring country , or where a particular treatment can be provided faster or more expertly abroad .
The package is seen as an effort to give patients greater freedom in choosing where they get treatment , and to answer critics who say the EU is too remote from ordinary citizens ' concerns .
Mr Fahy said it could take three years for the draft directive to become law through the EU co-decision process and " there is much discussion yet to be had over the details " .
The British Medical Association said the proposals " must not be allowed to erode the fundamental values of universality , accessibility and equality " in healthcare .
The BMA told BBC News that the proposals failed to address continuity of care and communication problems , and the risk of NHS services being financially destabilised .

What are these ?
PILGRIMS will be handed condoms en route to the papal Mass at Randwick racecourse for World Youth Day as part of a protest against the Pope 's views on homosexuality , contraception and abortion .
NoToPope , a coalition of religious , atheist , gay and lesbian groups will hold a rally in Taylor Square from midday on Saturday , July 19 .
Protest organisers expect between 1000 and 5000 people .
The Mass will be on July 20 , after an overnight vigil .
While the groups want the protest to be peaceful , they say they cannot guarantee there will be no confrontations with police or pilgrims .
" We will say to them , ' take up the campaign within the Catholic Church to promote condoms ' , " said Rachel Evans , from Community Action Against Homophobia .
" We 're not planning to get into any trouble , we do n't want to condemn Catholic youth for being Catholics .
We want to condemn the Pope for being homophobic and ' anti-condom ' .

Phillip Toledano ’s new book Phone Sex ( July 2008 , Twin Palms ) takes us into the boudoirs of nearly 30 phone - sex operators so we see their faces and also hear their stories — each operator gives his or her take on the business .
So much of commerce now is blind : online shopping , tech support in Bangalore .
We hope there is a person at the other end of the transaction , but it could be a machine ; often the machine does n’t seem very well programmed .
The phone - sex industry , though , thrives on being faceless and intensely personal at the same time .
“ To the caller , when I first answer , I am the inanimate Barbie .
They do not know what I look like , who I am or how I feel .
They can only imagine .
It is my job to indulge their fantasies , to convince them that I am not a doll .
I am their dream turned real .
I view every question the caller asks me as a command for me to transform .
If they ask if I am blonde , I become a blonde .
If they ask how wet I am , I tell them that my panties are drenched .
I respond to every sound the caller makes with an affirmation , I encourage them , I breathe life into their fantasy , I carve the doll out of flesh .
I do not view myself as this doll , as the commodity .
I am the manufacturer who creates her from the blueprint that the caller provides me .
When the caller comes , it is positive feedback .
Like an architect patting his contractor on the back . ”
“ I ’m 60 years old , have a B.A. in Cultural Anthropology from Columbia University , and married for 25 years .
I have a son in his last years of college who lives at home .
He ’s a 4.0 with a double major in English Literature and Religion .
Men call me for an infinity of reasons .
Of course , they call to masturbate .
I call it “ Executive Stress Relief . ”
It ’s not sex ; it ’s a cocktail of testosterone , fueled by addiction to pornography , loneliness , and the need to hear a woman ’s voice .
I make twice the money I made in the corporate world .
I work from home , the money transfers into my bank account daily .
I ’m Scheherezade :
If I do n’t tell stories that fascinate the Pasha , he will kill me in the morning . ”
“ One of my most memorable calls was also one of the grossest .
It was a fetish cat .
A scat fetish .
Most times I would aggravate the caller into hanging up by refusing to talk ‘ shit ’ with him , but this night I was feeling frisky .
So I indulged in his request and gave him the shittiest call ever .
I started out by telling him I was a vegan .
After several minutes of conversation he gently asked if I could ‘ go ’ while we were on the phone , and I told him I could .
He wanted to hear it coming out , farts and all .
( So gross . )
Then he wanted to eat it and clean me .
While describing how soft and colorful it was , I told him there was a piece of asparagus that I apparently did not chew too well .
Naturally , I asked him to get it for me .
I cracked him up .
He was laughing so hard , he had to hang up , because he could n’t get back into our fantasy . ”
“ Gary was watching a ‘ World ’s Strongest Women ’ show and saw a woman pick up a motorcycle .
‘ Oh I could do that , ’ I offered .
‘ Could you ? ’ he responded , breathless .
‘ Yes .
How much do you weigh ? ’ ‘ 160 . ’
‘ Oh .
I could bench - press two of you . ’
‘ Oh my god … I ’d like to see you lift up my girlfriend ’s car . ’
‘ What kind of car does she have ? ’
‘ A Mazda Miata . ’
‘ Oh yes , I could pick up a Miata .
In fact , I would love to . ’
‘ Really ?!?!??!
Oh my god !
What if my girlfriend was inside ? ’
‘ I would just pick it up , lift it to my shoulder level , and then hoist it up over my head , with your girlfriend inside .
I ’d slowly turn around in a circle with it held up in the air , with your girlfriend screaming in the front seat . ’ ” A part of me may miss getting paid for this when I move on .
“ I got into phone sex because I thought : ‘ Why not get paid for talking dirty , instead of doing it for free ? ’
It brings up my self - esteem so much , knowing guys are looking at my pics and wanting to talk with me .
Wanting me to take them to a whole other place , filling their fantasies … painting that picture in their mind for them . ”
“ My first night was on a Saturday at midnight .
It was a gentleman who I believe called himself Bob .
He told me about his first experience with a glory hole .
He explained that he had no one he felt comfortable telling this to , and I felt a strange intimacy between us , though it was rooted in a fantasy .
I think it ’s easier to release repressed desires to a non-judgmental , fictional person , because there are no consequences in the outside world . ”
“ I never thought I would work in the phone sex industry .
All those years doing customer service , my customers would comment on my sexy voice .
I thought I was being professional , not sexy .
This work is customer service .
It ’s just your customers leave with more than a smile . ”
So how did the series begin ?
I ’d been thinking about the things in society that are in plain sight , but still remain hidden .
What surprises appeared ?
How many [ of these ] people really loved what they did , and for so many reasons : because they felt they were helping people ; because they had discovered things about themselves , sexually or otherwise ; because it was often a two - way street .
Also , how much imagination you need to be a good operator , and how good you have to be at figuring out what someone wants .
And finally , how it ’s a job that reaches across the entire socio-economic strata .
How did the operators respond to you coming into their workspaces ( which , presumably , are fairly intimate zones ) ?
They were fine with it .
We ’d spent several weeks emailing beforehand , so I was n’t a completely unknown quantity .
Plus , I always mentioned that if they wanted to have someone there , that was completely OK .
Any desire to make portraits of those who call phone - sex lines ?
No , that ’s it for phone sex for me .
What are you working on now ?
Two projects .
One is an installation project that has nothing to do with photography .
It ’s called “ America the Gift Shop ” and the premise is :
If American foreign policy had a gift shop , what would it sell ?
The other is a personal photo project about my father and me .
My mum died a year ago , and he ’s 98 , so I ’m trying to memorize as much as possible .

For this is where we are in the United States , nearing the end of the Year of Our Lord 2007 : the truth is not merely unpleasant , an uninvited guest who makes conversation difficult and awkward .
Truth is the enemy ; truth is to be destroyed .
To attempt to speak the truth on any subject of importance requires a deep reserve of determination , for to speak the truth requires that one first sweep away an infinite number of rationalizations , false alternatives , and numerous other failures of logic and the most rudimentary forms of thought -- as well as the endless lies .
On that single occasion in a thousand or a million when a person overcomes these barriers and speaks the truth , he or she discovers an additional , terrible truth : almost no one wants to hear it .
This is how we live today : lies are the staple of our diet .
Without them , we would die , certainly in psychological terms . --
My essay , " A Nation on the Edge of the Final Descent ( II ) : A Culture of Lies , and A Desperate Need for Action "
Of course , our modern political landscape very rarely rewards context and nuance , brilliant or not , so whether Obama managed to help his campaign today remains to be seen .
It 's depressing , but Michael Crowley 's point in response to the speech is important : " [ It was ] brilliant , beautiful , inspiring — but perhaps not what crass electoral politics demanded of him . "
It feels almost ridiculous to wonder whether a candidate 's speech is too good for modern campaigning and today 's media , but it 's hardly an unreasonable question this afternoon .
Barack Obama 's speech , perhaps one of the most important in modern political history pushed us as a people to move beyond race and gender , beyond Democrat and Republican , beyond politics and into reviving the spirit of the nation itself .
To talk , to talk at home , at work , at the dinner table .
To really finally talk .
What a great day , and where else in the world but in the United States ?
Today I am very proud to be an American .
[ F]inally , the temperature of this speech is one of its messages ; or should I say invitations ?
Obama kept his cool and turned up the heat at the same time .
For those who have not yet voted , and crucially to the superdelegates , he raised the stakes , asking them all : Can you , too , keep your cool and your heat at the same time ?
The Reverend Jeremiah Wright , he said , had spoken in an " incendiary " manner , but Obama offered himself as the man who rises from flames and invites you to rise from your own .
He took a grievous embarrassment and moved his lesson to the plane of prophecy .
Talk about hope ; talk about audacity .
Tears came to my eyes .
I do n't think I 'm especially hard - hearted , but I cannot think of another time when the speech of a presidential candidate watered me up .
It will still be possible to parse his words for insufficiencies of denunciation , but Obama 's gamble was that he could turn Wright 's damnable sins into a pivot for a sermon about how the past can be overcome , about how American it would be to accomplish that hard and necessary objective .
" We bombed Hiroshima , we bombed Nagasaki , and we nuked far more than the thousands in New York and the Pentagon , and we never batted an eye , " Rev. Wright said in a sermon on Sept. 16 , 2001 .
" We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans , and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards .
America 's chickens are coming home to roost , " he told his congregation .
For most white folks , indignation just does n't wear well .
Once affected or conjured up , it reminds one of a pudgy man , wearing a tie that may well have fit him when he was fifty pounds lighter , but which now cuts off somewhere above his navel and makes him look like an idiot .
Indignation does n't work for most whites , because having remained sanguine about , silent during , indeed often supportive of so much injustice over the years in this country -- the theft of native land and genocide of indigenous persons , and the enslavement of Africans being only two of the best examples -- we are just a bit late to get into the game of moral rectitude .
And once we enter it , our efforts at righteousness tend to fail the test of sincerity .
But here we are , in 2008 , fuming at the words of Pastor Jeremiah Wright , of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago -- occasionally Barack Obama 's pastor , and the man whom Obama credits with having brought him to Christianity -- for merely reminding us of those evils about which we have remained so quiet , so dismissive , so unconcerned .
It is not the crime that bothers us , but the remembrance of it , the unwillingness to let it go -- these last words being the first ones uttered by most whites it seems whenever anyone , least of all an " angry black man " like Jeremiah Wright , foists upon us the bill of particulars for several centuries of white supremacy .
But our collective indignation , no matter how loudly we announce it , cannot drown out the truth .
And as much as white America may not be able to hear it ( and as much as politics may require Obama to condemn it ) let us be clear , Jeremiah Wright fundamentally told the truth .
The conclusion to which these truths then attest is simple , both in its basic veracity and its monstrousness : namely , that in those places we committed premeditated and deliberate mass murder , with no justification whatsoever ; and yet for saying that I will receive more hate mail , more hostility , more dismissive and contemptuous responses than will those who suggest that no body count is too high when we 're the ones doing the killing .
What Jeremiah Wright knows , and told his flock -- though make no mistake , they already knew it -- is that 9/11 was neither the first , nor worst act of terrorism on American soil .
The history of this nation for folks of color , was for generations , nothing less than an intergenerational hate crime , one in which 9/11s were woven into the fabric of everyday life : hundreds of thousands of the enslaved who died from the conditions of their bondage ; thousands more who were lynched ( as many as 10,000 in the first few years after the Civil War , according to testimony in the Congressional Record at the time ) ; millions of indigenous persons wiped off the face of the Earth .
No , to some , the horror of 9/11 was not new .
To some it was not on that day that " everything changed . "
To some , everything changed four hundred years ago , when that first ship landed at what would become Jamestown .
To some , everything changed when their ancestors were forced into the hulls of slave ships at Goree Island and brought to a strange land as chattel .
To some , everything changed when they were run out of Northern Mexico , only to watch it become the Southwest United States , thanks to a war of annihilation initiated by the U.S. government [ see this article ] .
To some , being on the receiving end of terrorism has been a way of life .
Until recently it was absolutely normal in fact .
But white folks have a hard time hearing these simple truths .
We find it almost impossible to listen to an alternative version of reality .
Indeed , what seems to bother white people more than anything , whether in the recent episode , or at any other time , is being confronted with the recognition that black people do not , by and large , see the world like we do ; that black people , by and large , do not view America as white people view it .
We are , in fact , shocked that this should be so , having come to believe , apparently , that the falsehoods to which we cling like a kidney patient clings to a dialysis machine , are equally shared by our darker - skinned compatriots .
...
Whites refuse to remember ( or perhaps have never learned ) that which black folks cannot afford to forget .
I 've seen white people stunned to the point of paralysis when they learn the truth about lynchings in this country -- when they discover that such events were not just a couple of good old boys with a truck and a rope hauling some black guy out to the tree , hanging him , and letting him swing there .
They were never told the truth : that lynchings were often community events , advertised in papers as " Negro Barbecues , " involving hundreds or even thousands of whites , who would join in the fun , eat chicken salad and drink sweet tea , all while the black victims of their depravity were being hung , then shot , then burned , and then having their body parts cut off , to be handed out to onlookers .
They are stunned to learn that postcards of the events were traded as souvenirs , and that very few whites , including members of their own families did or said anything to stop it .
...
Most white people desire , or perhaps even require the propagation of lies when it comes to our history .
Surely we prefer the lies to anything resembling , even remotely , the truth .
Our version of history , of our national past , simply cannot allow for the intrusion of fact into a worldview so thoroughly identified with fiction .
But that white version of America is not only extraordinarily incomplete , in that it so favors the white experience to the exclusion of others ; it is more than that ; it is actually a slap in the face to people of color , a re-injury , a reminder that they are essentially irrelevant , their concerns trivial , their lives unworthy of being taken seriously .
On one end of the spectrum , we 've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action ; that it 's based solely on the desire of wide - eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap .
On the other end , we 've heard my former pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright , use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide , but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation ; that rightly offend white and black alike .
I have already condemned , in unequivocal terms , the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy .
For some , nagging questions remain .
Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy ?
Of course .
Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church ?
Yes .
Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views ?
Absolutely – just as I 'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors , priests , or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed .
But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm were n't simply controversial .
They were n't simply a religious leader 's effort to speak out against perceived injustice .
Instead , they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country – a view that sees white racism as endemic , and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America ; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel , instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam .
It pains me tremendously to acknowledge this , but I was somewhat unfair to Andrew Sullivan in this brief post yesterday .
Although I am all too aware that great numbers of people are enthusiastically willing to abandon their analytic faculties altogether when the subject is the divinely sublime Barack Obama , I had thought that Sullivan 's emotional jibberings were something of an outlier .
But as the day wore on , I came across a number of regrettably similar examples of puddles of drool disguised as political commentary .
( I give you fair warning : the next person who says , " I 'm really tough , but Obamato me , man .
I wept .
I mean , like a baby .
No other politician in the history of all the universes has ever , had that effect on me !
He is Teh Awesome !! , " gets drop - kicked into next year . ) I refuse to suffer alone , so here is a brief tour of my discoveries .
Steve Benen
As an American myself , let me state that I deeply loathe this typically American arrogance and condescension .
" Where else in the world ... , " indeed .
I can only imagine how many millions of peoples in countries around the globe might react to such pronouncements of inherent , axiomatic , eternal and unalterable superiority .
In fact , since this perspective has lain at the heart of our foreign policy for more than a hundred years , we do n't have to imagine their reaction , do we ?
I think we have a fairly clear idea as to what it is .
As the saying goes : get aboys .
It appears it will have to be a large one .
Earlier in his ejaculatory piece , Gitlin writes :
At one time , was n't Gitlin considered to be of " the left " ?
It 's hard to keep track of the players these days .
In future , it seems I should proceed on the assumption thatis a viciously primitive , anti-intellectual conservative propagandist , manufactured in the dread Cheney Underground Laboratory , until and unless theyprove otherwise .
That paragraph is simply extraordinary , and it is deeply shocking .
Keep in mind these phrases : " It will still be possible to parse his words ... " and " Wright's ... "
Rush Limbaugh could not express such detestable ideas more forcefully .
Obama 's speech was a response to the controversy surrounding certain of Wright 's statements , so it is necessary to begin with an assessment of what Wright said .
Yesterday , I addressed one of Wright 's most controversial claims -- that the U.S. government " lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color " -- and that post explains why Wright 's statement is not in the least difficult to understand , assuming one knows even a smattering of history ( which obviously is not the case for those who have rushed to condemn it , which is practically everyone ) .
At the center of Wright 's alleged sins are these statements I have written about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in considerable detail .
The truth is much worse than briefly indicated by Pastor Wright : the United States government lied about the reasons for dropping the bombs , it lied about the effects of the bombings , and it has lied comprehensively about every aspect of this criminal episode in our history ever since .
Wright spoke -- but truth is the enemy .
Truth is to be destroyed .
With regard to Wright 's other supposedly reprehensible statements , I turn to Tim Wise .
An unusually perceptive and valuable article by Tim Wise provided the foundation for my article , " Myths of New Orleans : Poor , Bad Blacks -- Who Got What They Deserved . "
A new article by Wise concerning the Obama - Wright controversy is equally perceptive and valuable : " Jeremiah Wright , Barack Obama and the Unacceptability of Truth : Of National Lies and Racial America . "
You should read Wise 's article in its entirety .
Here are some highlights .
Wise begins his article by noting a fact of critical importance .
As is true of every other aspect of this controversy , it is a fact that most white Americans find intolerable : that fact is , very simply , that they haveto be offended by Wright 's comments .
Wise writes :
The resistance of the ruling class and of most Americans to one aspect of the truth about 9/11 remains astonishing , and it demonstrates how puerile our national conversation is .
Of course , the ruling class cannot admit that to state the obvious fact thatisto say that the U.S. " deserved " 9/11 -- for to acknowledge the millions murdered by the U.S. government and our policy of aggressive military intervention across the globe would subject our own actions to the kinds of judgments that only the United States is entitled to make , and only about the actions of The United States is uniquely exempt from the standards we apply to everyone else ; thus runs the catechism at the church of our inherent national superiority .
Wise notes that Wright 's comments about 9/11 would be regarded as unexceptional , if only we were adults -- that 9/11 wasand " that the U.S. has indeed engaged in more than enough violence against innocent people to make it just a tad bit hypocritical for us to then evince shock and outrage about an attack on ourselves , as if the latter were unprecedented . "
Wise offers a shorter version of my discussion of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and then writes :
Our national catechism tells us that America is Good -- and that America 's murders are Good Murders .
You may not say otherwise .
Wise has more about the specifics of Wright 's comments , but the most important part of Wise 's discussion concerns the fundamental difference between the realities of America and American history as experienced by black Americans and white Americans .
It is the difference between the truth and the steady , determined diet of lies manufactured and propagated by the ruling class :
Wise has much more , and you should read it There is a great deal that could be said about Obama 's speech , and there is a great deal that could be said that is true .
None of it bears any resemblance to the kinds of utterances noted at the beginning of this essay .
For my purposes here , I want to focus on this passage :
If you read Wise 's article , and if you consider the numerous facts set forth in many of my own pieces , you will realize that Obama sets forth a series of notable lies here .
Obama speaks of " views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation ; that rightly offend white and black alike . "
This is a lie :
Wright 's views expressof our history , and of our present .
No , it is not all of the truth , but it is an absolutely essential and major part of the truth .
It is the part of the truth that our fictionalized , mythologized history denies , the truth that many Americans will not permit themselves to understand or acknowledge .
You are profoundly wrong if the truth " offends " you .
If you remain determined to cling to the lies that sustain you , you may certainly make that choice .
But that does not make it right , or true .
Obama speaks of " a profoundly distorted view of this country -- a view that sees white racism as endemic ... "
But white racismbeen endemic to America 's history , and its effects are still painfully visible in most aspects of American life today .
Indeed , a good portion of Obama 's speech itself details the effects of that " endemic " white racism .
Wright does not " elevate what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America " -- heof the part of our history drowned by the propaganda that inundates us every day .
For those who remain wedded to the mythologized America , such acknowledgment cannot be tolerated .
Truth must be destroyed .
Obama states : " I have already condemned , in unequivocal terms , the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy . "
What Obama has " condemned , in unequivocal terms " is -- the truth that is forbidden by the fictions that feed the myth of American exceptionalism .
Obama has fully embraced the lies at the heart of mythologized America -- an embrace that is underscored by his inclusion of this phrase : " a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel , instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam . "
In this manner , Obama confirms that he will continue our policy of global interventionism including our endless interventions in the Middle East , which have been unceasing ever since World War I.
Obama embraces all the lies that support that policy , and he will challenge none of them .
( See " Songs of Death " for many more details concerning Obama 's embrace of this murderous policy . )
Almost every politician lies , and most politicians lie repeatedly .
Yet in one sense , Obama 's speech is exceptional , rare and unique -- but not for any of the reasons offered by Obama 's uncritical , mindless adulators .
It is exceptional for this reason : it is rare that a candidate will announce in such stark , comprehensive terms that he will lie about every fact of moment , about every aspect of our history that affects the crises of today and that has led to them , about everything that might challenge the mythological view of America .
But that is what Obama achieved with this speech .
It may be a remarkable achievement -- a remarkable and detestable one , and one that promises endless destruction in the future , both here and abroad .
Is that what many Americans want ?
Tragically , the answer appears to be yes .
Truth must be destroyed , no matter how many lives and how much suffering are required .
Americans will accept anything else -- war , genocide , economic collapse , further terrorist attacks in the U.S. -- but the truth must be denied .
Yet the truth can not be denied forever .
At some point , in some form , truth will make its claims known .
The costs may be far worse than anything we can think of .
And many Americans will still cling to the lies , even as they are buried in the mounting wreckage .
Our national life and our mythological history survive on lies .
Many Americans are incapable of imagining life without the lies .
They had better start imagining it -- before it is too late .

Emma Spaulding Bryant Letters

Emma Bryant 's letters
Each of the following letters has been scanned and transcribed .
By following the dated links below you will be presented with a transcript of the letter from that date as well as links to images of each page of the letter in two magnifications .
About the letters
Emma Spaulding
Bryant wrote these ten letters to her husband , John Emory Bryant , in the summer of 1873 .
They recount Emma 's activities during that summer when she and her daughter , Alice , were visiting relatives in Illinois and Ohio while her husband tended to his political affairs in Georgia .
In particular , the letters describe Emma 's visits to a doctor in Cleveland for " uterine difficulties " that had been ailing her for some time .
Although we do not have her husband 's letters to her from this period , it appears that he accused her of adultery with the doctor and berated her for not being obedient to him .
Many of Emma 's letters from this period have markings in red pencil , presumably made by John to highlight the sections of her letters that he found suspicious .
Emma 's responses to John 's accusations are indignant , and she rebuts each of his points eloquently and emphatically .
Because these letters are unusually frank for this time period , they reveal much about the relationships between husbands and wives in this era , and shed light on medical practices that were often kept private .
About Emma and John Bryant
Emma Spaulding met John Bryant in 1860 in Maine , where she was his pupil in one of the " subscription schools " he taught to earn money for his own education .
John Bryant served in the Union Army during the Civil War , and during a leave of absence from his military duties in 1864 they were married .
After the war John moved to Georgia to join the Freedmen 's Bureau , supporting the cause of freed slaves by setting up schools , providing them with land , and giving legal assistance .
He began a political career in the Republican party there , and edited a series of newspapers that promoted his political causes .
Emma joined him in Georgia in 1866 and aided him in his work , including filling in as editor of his newspapers during his absences .
John travelled often to support his political ambitions , and frequently left Emma to fend for herself with neither money nor companionship in difficult times , including through two pregnancies that ended in miscarriage .
In 1871 , once again with her husband absent , she gave birth to a daughter , Emma Alice Bryant , and herself travelled often to spend time with family and friends in the North to escape from her isolation in Georgia .
John held a number of important posts in the Georgia Republican party and Reconstruction governments there , but was often in conflict with others within his party .
He eventually gave up Georgia politics and moved to New York in the late 1880s , where he established a business selling bonds and mortgages and was active in the national Union League .
Emma and Alice did not move to New York with John but instead went to Tennessee , where Emma took a position teaching mathematics at East Tennessee Wesleyan University in Athens while Alice studied there .
The family was reunited after Alice 's graduation , and they lived together in Mount Vernon , New York , where John and Emma ran a Methodist mission .
John died of cancer in 1900 , and Emma died at Alice 's home the following year .

As if 100 years in Iraq was n’t enough , a top adviser to John McCain claims that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee supports and believes lawful Bush ’s infamous warrantless wiretapping program .
In a letter to the National Review , McCain adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin writes that “ neither the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the A.C.L.U. and trial lawyers , understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
Because everyone knows telecom companies are constitutional experts , not lawyers .
In the once anonymous town of Petersberg , Kentucky , seven miles west of the Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport , and “ within a day ’s drive of almost 2/3 of the U.S. population , ” the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum makes a 27 - million - dollar , 65,000 - square - foot attempt to prove the Bible ’s creation story is “ the true history book of the universe . ”
The facility , “ constructed debt - free , ” opened in May 2007 , attracting 250,000 visitors in its first five months of operation .
National news coverage has been plentiful , and as a Kentuckian who believes evolution is the true history book of the universe , I worry that the Creation Museum is drawing unsavory attention to my home state , fueling stereotypes .
But I also ca n’t wait to visit .
1:1 Arrival
I ’m arriving just after one o’clock on a December Saturday , full of curiosity .
Over the stubbled fields bordering Petersberg , dark smoke plumes from industrial stacks .
I figure those stacks are in Ohio , the border tantalizingly close , as if , for better or worse , the museum were almost built in a state other than Kentucky .
The Creation Museum promotes young - earth creationism , which teaches earth was created by a direct act of God between six and ten thousand years ago , in six 24 - hour days .
Old - earth creationists believe the planet existed much earlier but fell into decay , more or less reconciling earth ’s age with mainstream science , and only later did God reshape the planet in six 24 - hour days .
Day - age creationists think God ’s six days of work did not literally occur in six 24 - hour days , but in much longer days , or with gaps between them .
Evolutionary creationism , taught by most mainline Protestant seminaries , is a theistic hybrid , attributing evolution to an act of God .
At the entrance , two stegosauruses stand sentinel on stone impediments .
I prepare myself for maximum cheesiness , but the Museum itself turns out to be a contemporary wedge of stone and glass : classy , museum - appropriate architecture .
The parking lot is three - quarters full .
Future plans call for 663 additional spaces , along with a gated entrance for emergency and maintenance vehicles .
A hulking police officer , earphone plugged into ear , high - powered firearm holstered at hip , points me down a row of cars .
My vehicle seems to be one of the few lacking a Jesus - fish .
How many Jews have toured the Creation Museum ?
Having spent my entire childhood and much of my adulthood in Kentucky , Jewish population .3 % , I ’m comfortable being the odd Ashkenazi out .
I park next to a minivan with Tennessee plates , a leather - bound bible wedged between windshield and dash .
I cross the lot behind a group of teens , hyperactive after disembarking a church van out of Louisville .
I spot license plates from Ohio , Florida , Indiana , Texas — all over America , basically .
Here are the results of a 2007 Gallup poll on evolution and creationism :
Evolution , that is , the idea that human beings developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , is :
Definitely True Probably True Probably False Definitely False No Opinion Total True Total False 18 35 16 28 3 53 44
Creationism , that is , the idea that God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years , is :
Definitely True Probably True Probably False Definitely False No Opinion Total True Total False 39 27 16 15 3 66 31
1:2 Ticketing
Entering the museum ’s foyer — a vast space with a 40 - foot ceiling and stone walls and a huge broadside that reads “ Prepare to Believe ” — the church kids and I are greeted by employees clad in Creation Museum safari vests .
The museum employs about 160 people , all of whom signed a statement of belief in young - earth creationism and other Answers in Genesis tenets , which include “ Genesis is a simple but factual presentation of actual events and therefore provides a reliable framework for scientific research ” ; “ The Noachian Flood was a significant geological event and much ( but not all ) fossiliferous sediment originated at that time ” ; and “ The only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman . ”
I ’m handed a form attached to a clipboard .
In exchange for my name , mailing address , and email address , I ’m entitled to $ 2 off museum admission ( $ 19.95 ) , and mailings from the Answers in Genesis ministry , based 11 miles away in Hebron , Kentucky .
As I fill out the form , my ears pick up a susurrus of chirping birds , roaring mammals , hissing serpents .
I hand back my real name , fake email .
Proceeding through a series of roped switchbacks to the ticket counter , I lament the waste of paper to my fake mailing address .
There ’s a life - sized cardboard cutout of Answers in Genesis ’s president , founder , and chief pastor , Ken Ham .
He ’s bearded , 56 years old , wearing a Sears - grade button - down and slacks .
Annual passes cost $ 129.95 per family , $ 59.95 per individual .
According to the museum website , over 10,000 people have become members .
A five - year membership costs $ 99 a year and provides “ year - round access to the museum , free planetarium admission , bookstore discounts , super special email offers , and the opportunity to be part of a global , culture - impacting ministry . ”
A lifetime membership may be purchased for $ 1,000 .
1:3 The Main Hall
A museum employee offers to take my picture , which I can pick up on my way out ; I decline , fearing the cost , though the area is certainly photo - worthy : on a rocky embankment , a 40 - foot sauropod cranes its neck amid towering cypress trees draped in moss .
One of the fun things about creationism is that it speaks to the dreams of children and B - grade filmmakers everywhere : humans mingling with dinosaurs .
One sign in the Dinosaur Den reads “ The word dinosaur was n’t invented until 1841 , which explains why dinosaurs are absent in the Bible ’s account of animals on the Ark . ”
And another , more boldly : “ It is possible that dinosaurs could still live in remote parts of the world . ”
Inside and out , the Museum is rife with gorgeously detailed prehistoric beasts , all of them lifelike and many of them life - sized .
The Director of Museum Design is a man named Patrick Marsh ; he designed the “ Jaws ” and “ King Kong ” attractions at Universal Studios in Florida .
He also coordinated the unveiling of the refurbished Statue of Liberty in 1986
In the main hall , visitors snap pictures in front of a 15 - foot statue of the Virgin Mary cradling Jesus .
The few Asian and African - American visitors stand out in the predominantly white crowd .
A family of Mennonites emerges from Noah ’s Café sipping soft drinks .
The general vibe is festive .
Within biting range of the sauropod stand two mannequins , a boy and a girl , clothed in animal hides .
They ’re black - haired with mocha skin , somewhat Semitic in this regard , but their somewhat European features make them appear somewhat European , while their somewhat wide foreheads make them look somewhat Cro-Magnon .
Where to begin ?
The museum ’s K - 9 officer passes in front of me with a German shepherd , gives me a stern look , as if he ’s seen my type before .
Feeling chastised , I merge into a steady stream of visitors entering an aisle of colorful placards .
The first is labeled Human Reason : a timeline charting earth ’s creation according to hard science , which says Earth is 4.6 billion years old .
A second , labeled God ’s Word , dates back 4,350 years and charts the Seven Cs of Christianity : Creation , Corruption , Catastrophe , Confusion , Christ , Cross , and Consummation ( “ One day , at the Consummation , the Creator will remake His creation .
He will cast out death and the disobedient , and dwell eternally with those who trust in Him ” ) .
People glance at the Seven Cs , though few stop to read .
On the museum website , Ken Ham writes , “ When you think about it , everything we teach in Christianity goes back to this timeline ( the Seven Cs ) of history .
And this is the point : we need to show people that the Bible is a history book , and that everything connects to real history . ”
Ken Ham ’s radio show , “ Answers . . . with Ken Ham , ” is broadcast on more than 860 domestic radio stations and 450 outlets worldwide , clocking in at 1.5 hours per show .
He ’s the author and co-author of several books .
In Dragon Hall Bookstore , I ’ll hear him preaching on one of his videos : he has an Australian accent .
Just after the museum opened , he was interviewed on Australian radio :
This idea ( for the museum ) came about from when I was a teacher in public schools in Australia actually , teaching in the science classes and students saying , “ Sir , you ’re a Christian , how can you believe the Bible when we know that ’s not true because of evolution and what ’s in our textbooks ? ”
And then when I took them to museums and saw that they were presented evolution as fact , I thought why ca n’t we have a creation museum ?
And so I had this embryonic idea 25 years ago in Australia .
But of course , Australia ’s not really the place to build such a facility if you ’re going to reach the world .
Really , America is .
1:4 Three Glass Cases
The first contains live finches .
The sign below the case , complete with biological finch diagrams , tells us God created everything 6,000 years ago with the ability to “ multiply on earth . ”
Regarding finches , “ scientists have been puzzled by their vast array of traits . ”
Charles Darwin is n’t mentioned by name .
Finches can interbreed , the sign tells us , and their speciation is so great because “ God loves variety . ”
This variety proves there was n’t enough time in evolutional history - even billions of years - to get such different traits from a common ancestor .
Next , a terrarium houses poison dart frogs , so bright in color , and sitting so still , they look artificial .
Upon closer inspection — perhaps they are fake ?
— I discern tiny palpations .
Kids plant their hands on the glass , adults point at frogs on branches and rocks .
“ Why is creation so deadly ? ” asks the sign below the glass .
The answer : poison dart frogs raised in captivity ( like the ones in this case ) are n’t poisonous .
Poison dart frogs before Adam sinned were not poisonous .
Poison came from animals eating wild plants after Adam sinned .
“ All things were good before Adam sinned . ”
The last case contains a pair of chameleons astonishingly well adapted to hiding before our very eyes .
People who have already discerned the bright green lizards in the bright green foliage point and tell other visitors where to look .
We learn that chameleons can extend their tongues to over 1 ½ times their body length ( ! ) , at an acceleration of up to 50g .
These miraculous tongues could only be designed by God .
A man named Kurt Wise , who owns a Ph.D. in invertebrate paleontology from Harvard , an M.A. in geology from Harvard , and a B.A. in geology from the University of Chicago , is scientific advisor to the museum .
He recently told the New York Times Magazine that he wanted to use the museum to present a “ coherent story line about the earth ’s history .
Even if it ’s wrong , it ’s a starting point .
It ought to fit together not as a set of random processes but something coherent orchestrated by God .
And not just coherent but spine - tingling . ”
Most creationist “ science ” attempts to prove a 1961 model put forth by John Whitcomb , a theologian , and Henry Morris , a hydraulic engineer .
In The Genesis Flood : The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Explanations , Whitcomb and Morris argued that Noah ’s Flood suddenly and catastrophically altered earth ’s geological processes .
Geysers from the skies and from within the earth , the Bible ’s “ floodgates of heaven , ” bludgeoned the oceans , exterminating all sea life and causing water to “ rise over the high mountains . ”
A period of tsunamis , earthquakes , and volcano eruptions gave way to a compressed ice age , causing continents to shift and the water to recede , allowing life to flourish in its present form .
1:5 Interpreting the Facts
A darkened room contains a life - sized , spot - lit model of an archeological dig in a rocky desert .
Two mannequin paleontologists — a white guy with a gray beard and a skinny Asian guy — are excavating a dinosaur skeleton .
Their tools and field notes lay about , and the site is roped off with a sign that reads , “ Thou Shalt Not Touch ! ”
A small crowd has formed at a flat - screen monitor : a video introduces two paleontologists who look like their mannequin counterparts .
As the Asian guy digs in a dried river bed , his face hidden under the brim of his outback hat , the white guy , affecting a professorial tone , tells us he ’s been studying fossils his whole life , and science requires interpretation of facts .
Holding up a dinosaur bone , he waxes poetic on what existed on Earth thousands of years ago .
He tells us that he and his colleague , Kim , agree on many facts regarding fossils , but disagree on a few details regarding how they were formed .
Kim then looks up from his digging and says the dinosaur fossils at this site were formed about a hundred million years ago , because of a local flood .
He resumes digging , without mentioning radiocarbon dating .
The white paleontologist , looking into the camera , smiles and shakes his head .
1:6 Biblical Authority
The next room resembles an alleyway in Jerusalem circa King David .
Pillars and large stone blocks .
There are mannequins : Isaiah cowled in a tallus and holding a large scroll , presumably a torah ; Moses holding the Ten Commandments ; King David holding a harp ;
Paul sitting at a desk , penning an epistle .
A man behind me says , “ Isaiah looks like Bin Laden . ”
He sounds ticked off .
His wife tells him to “ can it . ”
In my opinion , yes , Isaiah ’s dark skin , salt ‘ n ’ pepper beard and narrow face make him resemble Osama Bin Laden , though Bin Laden would n’t be caught dead in a tallus .
The adjoining room contains a mannequin of Martin Luther nailing his 95 Theses to the Castle Church in Wittenberg ; sheepskin pages from a 300 - year - old Torah that was secreted out of Iraq following Saddam ’s order to destroy all Torahs ; and a copy of The Da Vinci Code with a sign that reads , “ Its popularity is only temporary . ”
1:7 Life in the City
I pass through to an urban streetscape with the flicker of poorly functioning street lights , buzzing power lines , the sweep and wail of sirens in the distance , honking cars , jack - hammering workmen , shattering glass , screeching tires .
Airbrushed across the brick wall of a condemned building : “ MODERN WORLD ABANDONS BIBLE . ”
Bits of crumpled trash lay scattered on the cement floor .
The walls are plastered with torn magazine pages whose headlines pertain to Columbine , same - sex marriage , euthanasia ( featuring Terri Schiavo ) , teen pregnancy , drug abuse , abortion , 9/11 , murder , the ACLU ( removing the Ten Commandments ) , suicide , homelessness , pornography , AIDS , and stem cell research ( featuring Christopher Reeve ) .
A radio announcement warns of possible terrorist attacks .
A fake rat crawls along the top of a wall .
I ’m writing in my notebook when a man who has been touring ahead of me — alone , reading most signs — asks if I ’m a journalist .
I nod .
He wants to know what I think so far .
He ’s Caucasian , middle - aged , and he ’s smiling amusedly — amused that the museum is using a city to represent Godlessness , I assume .
“ I think it ’s funny , ” I say .
His eyebrows arch , smile gone .
“ Funny ? ”
My apology : “ I came into this sold on evolution . ”
“ Well , that ’s what you were educated to believe .
Who do you write for ? ”
“ A magazine called n+1 . ”
He glances at my notebook , says nothing .
The last thing I wrote : “ Rat on wall . ”
“ I guess you think creationism should be taught in schools ? ” I venture .
“ Why not ?
Evolution is only a theory . ”
He moves on .
I loiter in the alley , hoping to create some distance between us .
I ’m beginning to feel sorry for the guy : isolated , fanatical , doomed to failure .
Then I remember that Gallup poll — 66 % of Americans think creationism is definitely or probably accurate .
He probably feels sorry for me .
1:8 Culture in Crisis
In the next room , “ Culture in Crisis , ” videos play inside a series of life - sized dormer windows :
Two boys , maybe 13 and 10 , the older sitting at a computer , the younger playing video games .
They ’re discussing school , how lazy they feel , how much trouble they ’ve gotten into , and then the older kid starts to roll a joint .
The next window shows a teenage girl sitting in a chair , talking on the phone about her pregnancy results : she does n’t want to keep it .
The next window shows two women sitting at a table whispering , while in the background a man sits slumped on a couch with a can of beer , watching TV .
It ’s difficult to hear the whispering over the statistics issuing from an overhead speaker : “ Parents spend less than 30 minutes per day with their kids ” ; “ Over one - half of teenage girls engage in premarital sex ” ; “ Average age of internet porn exposure : 11 . ”
I wait with a group of visitors at a roped entrance to the next exhibit , a movie theater with limited seating .
Some people chit - chat , others listen to statistics .
The man who accused me of believing what I learned in school is standing nearby .
Eventually , an employee wearing a headset arrives and unhooks the roped entrance to the Time Tunnel .
We file through a dark tube with myriad points of white light .
The house - lights go down , and we ’re shown the museum ’s “ Dawn of Creation Movie , ” a dramatic reading of Genesis 1 by a man who sounds just like Don LaFontaine , the famous movie - trailer intoner whose nickname is “ The Voice of God . ”
1:9 The Garden
Giant fans blow the foliage of an ultra-verdant pre-Flood forest , while Genesis is read over a cacophony of jungle sounds : I ’ve entered the Garden of Eden , a .k.a. the first of the Seven C’s : Creation .
Amid the bloom and thicket a ten - foot - tall tyrannosaurus rex moves his neck to and fro , making an eerie hissing noise instead of the usual roar .
The vertical slit in his bright green eye expands and contracts , a nictitating membrane descends .
Well - used dinosaur teeth are embedded in gums that glisten with dinosaur saliva .
A little boy next to me warns , “ Do n’t you get smart with me , T - Rex , or I ’ll shoot you ! ”
Along with smaller dinosaurs , a variety of animals — deer , zebra , squirrels , a penguin , rabbits , an antelope — frolic in the woods or drink from a stream with mountains and waterfalls painted in the distance .
A swarthy Adam sits on the ground , sporting the chiseled musculature of five - time world - champion boxer Roy Jones Jr. A sign tells us , “ Before Adam ’s fall , all animals , including dinosaurs , were vegetarians .
No animals would die , so there were no carnivores . ”
Further along , in an arbor of birch trees , Adam and Eve sit holding each other ’s arms .
Eve is dark and beautiful : think movie starlet Penelope Cruz .
Her long raven hair covers her breasts ; she appears to have shaven her underarms .
A sign tell us , “ The creation of Adam and Eve is the foundation of marriage : one man and one woman . ”
Next comes “ Adam and Eve in Waterfall ” : they ’re standing in a pool beneath an actual waterfall , the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil growing nearby .
Eve holds a white blossom while Adam caresses her hair .
A grandmotherly woman at the railing wipes her brow and says , “ Whew . ”
1:10 Corruption Valley
Here Eve tempts
Adam with a palm full of berries — small and red , like holly berries .
I ’d always pictured an apple , but the Bible does not , in fact , specify the forbidden fruit .
Right around the corner : gray cement walls with what appear to be burn marks .
A white door is locked eight times with an assortment of padlocks and deadbolts .
Walking past the door , toward the sound of machine - gun fire , visitors enter a place called “ Corruption Valley . ”
And here we go again : cement walls covered with pictures of starving people , diseased people , drug abusers , the skeleton - riddled killing fields in Cambodia , Arlington Cemetery .
Over the speakers : Hitler propagandizing ?
Yep .
It ’s Hitler .
Projected onto a jagged section of wall : images of Nazi soldiers , more starvation , more disease .
This invocation of Hitler , the most ironic I ’ve encountered in my life , reminds me of something he once said : “ Make the lie big , make it simple , keep saying it , and eventually they will believe it . ”
1:11 The Ark
The Catastrophe section starts with “ Noah ’s Ark Construction Site , ” certainly the coolest exhibit in the museum , the one I ’d want my kid to see , if I had one : a gigantic section of the Ark , reduced to 10 % of its “ actual ” size in order to fit in the room , with mannequin laborers up on wood scaffolding or working in stalls : we hear hammering , sawing , the squeak of pulleys .
Blacksmiths , weavers , and carpenters carry on conversations with Jewish accents straight out of “ Fiddler on the Roof . ”
One guy doubts a flood is really coming , another calls Noah a “ religious fanatic . ”
Inside glass cases are models of the Ark : one shows animals being corralled into the Ark two by two , including dinosaurs .
Four flat - screen monitors linked together present a rumbling , computer - generated recreation of the oncoming Flood , with a real - time clock ticking in one corner ; after the initial surge , including massive geysers ( the floodgates of heaven ) , the Ark is shown tossing and turning in gargantuan waves .
It occurs to me that CGI would enable James Cameron to make an astonishing “ Noah ’s Ark ” movie .
1:12 Modernity Begins
The Rainbow Covenant room tells the story of Noah after the Flood through glorious depictions of the Ark emerging into God ’s green earth , His promise renewed .
The Flood Geology Room features a stunning fossil called “ Last Supper of a Perch . ”
The perch has halfway consumed a herring , which proves animals were instantaneously trapped by the Noachian Flood .
In the first mention of scientific dating method that I ’ve found , a chart shows how an 11 year - old lava dome dates greater than 350,000 years - old by radio - isotope dating .
This is meant to show radioisotope dating is a flawed technique , though this particular example deals with an isolated application with too many undocumented variables to mention .
1:13 Jesus
The final exhibit , a movie called “ The Last Adam , ” covers the Cs of Christ , Cross , and Consummation .
A sign says , “ The first Adam brought death and suffering into the world .
The last Adam ( Jesus ) brought life to those who received His gift of salvation . ”
The waiting room is packed with people sitting on benches as overhead monitors play video of witnessing Christians .
An employee tells me the wait for the movie is currently forty - five minutes .
The poster for “ The Last Adam ” rivals or exceeds a Hollywood poster in production value : Jesus on the Cross with churning flame in the background , movie credits across the bottom .
The teaser : “ It is finished . ”
The movie features realistic sets in biblical times , impressive costumes , pretty decent acting — think made - for - TV .
We ’re seated in comfortable movie chairs , a theater roughly the size of a small - screen Cineplex theatre .
A brawny roman soldier with goatee gives an eyewitness account of Jesus ’ death as if he ’s regaling a bunch of dudes in the free - weights room .
Leaning over his knee , he says things like , “ I ’ve seen lots of people nailed to a cross , and let me tell you , it ai n’t pretty .
But Jesus , he took it without showing any emotion .
It was almost like ( shakes his head ) . . . like he knew what was coming after his death . ”
The movie specifies Jews and Romans as the people who took Jesus to the Cross , making the film slightly less incendiary than Mel Gibson ’s The Passion of the Christ .
People emerge from the theater visibly moved .
One old guy has tears in his eyes .
Visitors can decompress in a room replicating a Nazarene synagogue from the first century — inside , soft music plays , and save for the rack of Christian literature , the place is devoid of religious iconography .
I do sit in there for a while , thinking I ’ll recommend the museum to evolutionists and creationists alike .
It can be a good ride , regardless of your point of view , and good rides are worth taking , no ?
And anyway it ’s a ride we ’re all already on , like it or not .
As the writer and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins says , “ People actually believe that because they read some dopey prophesy in the book of Revelation , the world is going to come to an end some time soon .
People who believe that say , ‘ We do n’t need to bother about conserving forests or anything else because the end of the world is coming anyway . ’
A few decades ago one would simply have laughed at that .
Today you ca n’t laugh .
These people are in power . ”

Three days each week , at the tail end of the morning rush hour , Jonathan Ball drives from Pasadena to his job in Camarillo -- a journey of 57 to 64 miles , depending on his route .
Over the last few months , he has seen his speed often increase and his time on the road lessen , convincing him that traffic may be easing its grip on parts of Southern California .
“ It was one of those days I took the 210 to the 118 , ” Ball said .
“ Instead of taking an hour and 15 minutes to get to work , it took an hour and 10 minutes .
It was only five minutes , but I noticed it because I was n’t even pushing it that day . ”
If there has been anything that remains quintessentially unpredictable over the years in the Southland , it ’s traffic .
One day it ’s good , the following it ’s let ’s - move - to - Portland awful , then it ’s back to tolerable .
But a sampling of residents , traffic reporters and technical data indicates that as gasoline prices have climbed and the economy has faltered , weekday congestion has softened in some areas over the last month .
There are notable decreases in commuting times on some well - traveled freeways .
Other drivers say their commutes are still bad , but that the roads are more lightly traveled at midday and evenings -- the times of day that people make discretionary trips .
The Freeway Performance Measurement System , a computer database overseen by UC Berkeley and Caltrans , provides several examples .
The morning commute from Simi Valley to Los Angeles averaged 61 minutes in April 2007 when gas cost a little more than $ 3 a gallon but fell to 55.1 minutes last month .
Also significant are numbers from the Inland Empire , where the morning drive from Riverside to Ontario fell nearly 13 % -- from 41.5 minutes in April 2007 to 36.2 minutes this April .
Also down in early May was the number of incidents reported to the California Highway Patrol in Los Angeles County -- the belly of the traffic beast .
Accidents and breakdowns are thought to cause about 50 % of all congestion .
In most cases , the difference in commuting times is small and typically ranges from one to five minutes .
But there is evidence of fewer cars on the road .
In Orange County , Caltrans officials said that road sensors had shown a slight drop in the average number of vehicles each day on freeways such as the 91 and 405 and that toll road business was down about 6 % .
The region ’s ubiquitous traffic reporters are noticing a change .
“ Things have definitely become a lot thinner out there , ” said Meghan Reyes , an airborne reporter for KNX - AM 1070 Newsradio , who first noticed a shift in late March .
On Thursday , for example , the usually busy 5 Freeway was moving smoothly through the Newhall Pass , and on the northbound 101 , the afternoon traffic was backed up from the Cahuenga Pass only to Santa Monica Boulevard -- not all the way to downtown , she said .
Caltrans in Los Angeles County could not provide data on Friday because , officials said , their computer had crashed .
Traffic typically eases when a declining economy puts people out of work .
In the Silicon Valley , for example , “ in 2000 , the 680 Freeway was one of the top two or three congested freeways here , ” said Pravin Varaiya , a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley who helps oversee the freeway performance database .
“ When you look at it now , there ’s no congestion .
Something like the dot - com boom and bust were huge . ”
Currently , unemployment rates are at least one percentage point higher across the region than they were a year ago .
The most pronounced increase has been in the Inland Empire , where the unemployment rate in March was 7.1 % compared with 5.2 % a year earlier .
The latest numbers on gas sales , from January , show that consumption was down 4.5 % compared with January 2007 , according to the state Board of Equalization , and has been declining over the last two years .
That could be an indicator that people are driving less or driving more efficient cars , or both .
Meanwhile , ridership on mass transit has continued on an upswing .
Metrolink commuter trains are averaging about 46,000 passengers each weekday , up from 44,000 a year ago .
“ Our riders are n’t the transit - dependent , ” said spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell .
“ They have cars .
Many of them were driving alone on the freeway . ”
The number of people on buses and trains operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has also climbed .
The subway had 144,841 riders each weekday , an increase of about 7,000 from March ’07 .
Not everyone is convinced that traffic patterns have changed .
And there are exceptions .
The data show , for example , that the Santa Monica Freeway has mostly worsened .
Varaiya said that although the numbers indicated there may be a decrease in commute times , a more sophisticated analysis would be needed to tell if traffic was truly trending downward .
Jeff Baugh , an airborne reporter for KFWB - AM ( 980 ) , agreed that traffic has seemed lighter , but he thinks it ’s because spring break for students lasts longer .
Marco Ruano , chief of freeway operations for Caltrans in Los Angeles County , said he did not have enough data to say that traffic had decreased .
He also said that commute times shift as job patterns change and freeway improvements take hold .
He cited an improved 405 - 101 interchange that has helped the 405 , in particular , and also said that increased use of ramp meters had improved speeds on the 210 Freeway .
“ For some folks it might seem like they ’ve noticed on a particular route that the commute is better , but on a systemwide level it ’s not necessarily so , ” Ruano said .
Steve Grothe , a consultant in the liquor industry , said his commute from Rancho Cucamonga to Cerritos remained stuck at 80 minutes each way via the 210 , 57 and 91 freeways , with many trucks on the road .
In Ojai , Al Stroberg said his drive to Westwood , where he works as an orthopedic surgeon , was still running 70 to 75 minutes .
There is one difference :
He used to leave between 5:30 and 5:45 a.m. , but now tries to get on the road by 5:15 to keep the commute from growing longer .
But Roberta Kramer , an attorney from Woodland Hills , said she was seeing fewer people driving , particularly at night .
“ If we go out on a Saturday night , I do n’t see the traffic , ” she said .
“ It does n’t look like L.A . ”
And Chuck Street , a pilot reporter for KTLA - TV Channel 5 and KIIS - FM ( 102.7 ) , said that on Thursday he almost said on the air that traffic seemed lighter -- and even asked his flying partner whether gas prices had hit the magic number .
David Rizzo , a podiatrist who still makes house calls , has written a pair of advice books on escaping the death grip of Southland traffic .
Rizzo ’s diagnosis :
The freeways are flowing again -- on Friday he saw 75 - mph speeds on the 105 .
“ It ’s not like we ’re married to our cars , ” Rizzo said .
“ When the price gets high enough we ’ll change , and it ’s the discretionary stuff that goes first . ”

Feingold : Mukasey trying to ' create election - year security issue '
RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008

This A top Democratic senator is accusing the Attorney General of trying " to create an election - year security issue where there is nt one . "
Congress , and not judges , should decide how to give Guantanamo Bay detainees their day in court , the attorney general said Monday in calling for new laws governing how foreign terror suspects seek their release .
It 's doubtful , however , that Congress will approve the legal measures Attorney General Michael Mukasey wants before the end of the election - season year .
A federal court in Washington is currently working on rules for judicial hearings for about 200 suspected al - Qaida and Taliban foot soldiers who charge they 're being illegally held at the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba .
A Supreme Court ruling last month gave the detainees the right to challenge their capture in U.S. civilian courts .
" With so many cases , there is a serious risk of inconsistent rulings and considerable uncertainty , " Mukasey , himself a former federal judge , told an audience at Washington think - tank , the American Enterprise Institute .
Left to the courts to decide , Mukasey said , many of the cases could wind up in appeals that would further delay the hearings .
" It hardly takes a pessimist to expect that , without guidance from the Congress , different judges on even the same court will disagree , " he said .
Critics immediately called Mukasey 's request an attempt to go around the Supreme Court with legislation that also would face lengthy legal challenges .
The court 's June 12 ruling said Congress ' earlier efforts to intervene in detainee cases were unconstitutional .
" What Mukasey is doing is a shocking attempt to drag us into years of further legal challenges and delays , " said Vincent Warren , executive director for the Center for Constitutional Rights .
The group has helped find lawyers to represent the detainees .
" Congress should be a part of the solution this time by letting the courts do their job , " Warren said .
In a statement sent to RAW STORY , Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) complains that " The Attorney Generals comments today appeared to be an attempt to create an election - year security issue where there is nt one . "
" Our federal courts are capable of handling these cases , and no dangerous detainees held at Guantanamo will be released anytime soon , " Feingold 's statement continued .
" By repeatedly mishandling these cases , the administration has delayed justice from being served .
If congressional action is needed to clean up the mess the administration created at Guantanamo , it should be taken alongside a new administration that doesnt have such contempt for the rule of law . "
Mukasey said Justice Department attorneys are hopeful and available to help Congress craft legislation .
He said lawmakers should feel spurred , and not delayed , by the election year to pass the laws .
Judges have said they want to set rules governing the detainees ' hearings by year 's end .
Among the rules Mukasey is seeking : - Barring federal courts from allowing the detainees to be brought or released into the United States .
He said detainees could participate in the court hearings by video link from Guantanamo if necessary .
" Many of them pose an extraordinary threat to Americans , " he said .
- Protecting counterterror intelligence gathered and used to detain the suspects from being turned over to courts .
- Prohibiting detainees charged with war crimes from challenging their capture until after they stand trial .
Additionally , detainees should not be allowed to appeal their imprisonment under more than one legal standard .
- Assigning one federal court , and one judge , to oversee the detainee release cases to make sure they are heard in a coordinated effort .
- Underscoring that the United States has the authority to detain suspects it has identified as enemy combatants .
" The United States has every right to capture and detain enemy combatants in this conflict , and need not simply release them to return to the battlefield - as indeed some of them have , " Mukasey said .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
The global economy could be under threat if oil prices remain too high for too long , German Economy Minister Michael Glos was quoted on Saturday as saying .
“ An excessively high oil price for too long could throw the whole global economy into turmoil , ” Glos told newspaper Bild am Sonntag , repeating comments he made last weekend to Reuters .
“ This would also have an impact on jobs in Germany , ” he added in comments due to be published in the paper on Sunday .
Oil prices in the United States reached a record of nearly $ 140 per barrel last week , and have stayed high since .
Glos is due to hold talks on energy with Saudi officials during a visit to Jeddah next weekend .
At a meeting in Osaka , Japan , finance ministers from the Group of Eight ( G8 ) nations said on Saturday that soaring commodity prices could hit growth .
But they shrank from offering a plan to calm markets or quell protests over the cost of fuel and food .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said costly oil could extend a U.S. slowdown , the International Monetary Fund talked of prolonged global economic weakness and European Union Economic Commissioner Joaquin Almunia warned of 1970s - style stagflation .
Subsidize This
Arik Hesseldahl in BusinessWeek , “ Why AT&T May Deep - Discount the iPhone ” :
The big thing about the next iPhone was supposed to be high - speed Internet access and tools for business .
Says who ?
I know , everyone with even a single toe dabbled in gadget - blogging is calling the next - gen iPhone the “ 3G iPhone ” , but when has speculation ever accurately predicted next - generation iPods ?
3G networking could well be the least of what ’s cool about next - generation iPhone hardware .
As for tools for business , they ’re coming to all iPhones , not just new ones , when the 2.0 OS ships in a few months .
Instead , it ’s looking like iPhone 2.0 is all about price and that ever - awkward relationship between Apple and AT&T .
So says one report , using one anonymous source , from Scott Moritz , a “ reporter ” with an appalling track record regarding Apple and the iPhone .
The same Scott Moritz who reported in July last year that Apple had cut back its production order on iPhones based on a “ trading note ” from Miller Tabak , a note which , it ends up , did n’t actually exist .
And , as we know now , Apple went on to sell more iPhones than expected in 2007 , not fewer .
So after a year of charting a new wireless business model by selling the vaunted iPhone at premium prices , the nation ’s biggest phone company may resort to the oldest trick in the cellular book : big discounts .
Do you really think anyone at AT&T has seen or knows the details regarding the next - generation iPhone , given that they first laid eyes on the original one just before its debut at Macworld Expo ?
Although it has sent millions of new customers AT&T ’s way , this unique market advantage known as the iPhone will only last so long .
With every passing month , rival device makers are introducing new handhelds that attempt to replicate the wide array of innovations — starting with sheer simplicity — that Apple used to rock the wireless world less than a year ago .
None of these new phones has duplicated Apple ’s formula for success yet , but it may be only a matter of time .
Sounds a lot like what people wrote about the iPod in 2002 : competitors have n’t caught up yet , but surely they will , because , well , just because .
In the same way that surely , eventually , Ford and GM will start making cars as well - engineered and designed as the Germans and Japanese , because , well , because .
Published reports that first appeared on the Web site of Fortune Magazine [ sic ] suggest that AT&T , which has an exclusive five - year deal to sell the iPhone in the U.S. , is prepared to subsidize the device by as much as $ 200 , slicing the purchase price as low as $ 199 for customers who sign a two - year service contract .
No , it was not published reports , plural .
It was one published report , singular .
By Scott Moritz .
All the other reports regarding this purported $ 200 AT&T iPhone subsidy were based on Moritz ’s report for Fortune — no additional sources or original reporting to corroborate this subsidy story .
Such a discount could cause a surge in demand .
I find this theory intriguing , that when prices go down , demand “ could ” go up .
With this sort of deep economic insight , it ’s no wonder people read BusinessWeek .
At last count , Apple had sold some 5.4 million units , the vast majority of them for AT&T ’s network , even with price tags of $ 400 to $ 600 — essentially unheard of in the U.S. cellular market .
Except for the 30 or so different $ 400 - 800 phones at Amazon , this is a very good point .
Yet with rival smartphones like Research In Motion ’s BlackBerry and a new Palm Treo selling for as little at $ 99 at some carriers , competitive pressures are building .
Because there were n’t any $ 100 BlackBerrys or Treo a year ago ?
AT&T brings in about $ 90 a month from each iPhone user , reckons John Hodulik , analyst with UBS Investment Research ( UBS ) .
I wonder if Hodulik is aware that the rate plans are published , and that they make $ 90 per month sound like a very unlikely average ?
“ When Apple cut the price on the iPhone by 33 % earlier this year , it stimulated demand , ” he says .
“ If this new price turns out to be true , it would do it again .
It ’s like déjà vu all over again . ”
Again with this intriguing theory of lower prices creating higher demand .
Perhaps they should give the iPhones away for free — perhaps demand would then go even higher .
The article ends with speculation that the next generation iPhone hardware , if it ’s called something other than just “ iPhone ” , might fall outside the purview of Apple ’s “ iPhone ” exclusivity deal with AT&T .
I.e. that their existing deal might cover only the original iPhone , and that Apple is free to shop the upcoming “ iPhone Pro/ Mini / Nano / Steampunky Olde Timey Handset / Whatever ” to other carriers .
( I was thinking along similar lines two days ago on the Twitter . )
Hesseldahl mentions this in the context of explaining why AT&T might push for this $ 200 subsidy :
There ’s also been speculation , considered unlikely , that AT&T might be floating the idea of an iPhone subsidy to reinforce its marriage with a partner as notoriously slippery and heavy - handed as Apple .
This comes so close to uncovering the obvious and glaring problem with a $ 200 AT&T iPhone subsidy , but , alas , Hesseldahl and his keen economic mind walk right past it .
The problem is this : why would Apple allow AT&T to sell iPhones for half the price of what iPhones cost in Apple ’s own stores ( including this one ) ?
Subsidies only work when they ’re sold in conjunction with two - year contracts .
It ’s possible that Apple could do the same , and sell subsidized AT&T - contract iPhones in Apple Stores , but that would mean abandoning the innovative ( and very appealing , very successful ) model of activating a new iPhone at home , via iTunes , rather than sitting around in a store for 45 minutes making uncomfortable small talk with a salesman while waiting for your credit check and your old phone number to transfer over .
You ’d think this might be worth a mention .

Cecil Rhodes , the businessman - imperialist of Africa , the creator of Rhodesia , suffered no flicker of doubt about who were the masters .
" To be born an Englishman , " he mused , " Is to win first prize in the lottery of life . "
It was n't idle boasting .
In the jingoistic triumphalism of the late 19th century , when waving the Union Jack was a simple pleasure , people sang : " Rule Britannia ! Britannia , rule the waves " without any irony .
It was a statement of fact .
A quarter of mankind lived under the British flag in the largest empire the world had ever known .
And many of those parts that were n't under Britain 's rule - such as the U.S. - had been created by Britain .
British missionaries had opened up the Dark Continent almost unchallenged .

The British Army found it easier to invade troublesome nations - or most of them - than it does nowadays .
Britain was the workshop of the world , dominating science , manufacturing and trade .
To many Victorians , unquestioning of the ideology that underpinned much imperialism , British supremacy was a simple matter of racial supremacy - Europeans , and the English in particular , were fated to be the masters .
The truth is that we are masters of the world no more .
The global power shift from the West to the East is no longer just a matter of debate confined to learned journals and newspaper columns - it is a reality that is beginning to have a huge impact on our daily lives .
What would those Victorian masters of old have made of the fact that Chinese security men were on the streets of London this week , ordering our own police about and fighting running battles with British protesters while bewildered athletes carried the Olympic torch on its relay through the capital ?
It was a brazen display of how confident China has become of its new place in the world , just as the British Government 's failure to take a firm stand on Chinese abuses of human rights shows how craven we have become .
The dire warnings from the International Monetary Fund this week that the West now faces the largest financial shock since the Great Depression , while the Asian economies are still powering ahead , simply underlines our vulnerability in this new world order .
The desperately weakened American dollar appears to be on the verge of losing its global dominance , in the same way as sterling lost it a lifetime ago .
The credit crunch has brought home to all of us in Britain how over - reliant our country has become on financial services .
Meanwhile , the loss of our manufacturing industries to Asia continues unabated .
Last month , an Indian company , Tata , bought up what was once the cream of British manufacturing - Jaguar and Land Rover .
A couple of years ago , Nanjing Automotive , a Chinese company , snapped up MG Rover .
Just as the 19th century was the British century , and the 20th century was the American century , the 21st century is the Asian century .
But the handover of global power from the UK to the U.S. was trivial compared to what is happening now .
The U.S. was Britain 's offspring , based on the same values and the same language .

It , too , was an Anglo - Saxon country , and passing the baton across the Atlantic ensured the continuation of the Anglo - Saxon world order , based on democracy , free trade and a belief in human rights , upheld through international institutions that both powers supported .
But the world order we have grown used to - and comfortable with - over the last century is coming to an end .
Napoleon III compared China to a sleeping giant and warned : " When China awakes , she will shake the world . "
After a long hibernation , China , and her 1.3 billion people - twice the population of the U.S. and EU combined - is awaking almost overnight .
And not just China .
The world 's second most populous country , India , is industrialising at a historically unprecedented pace .
Their economies are growing on a long - term basis about four times the speed of the UK's and that of the United States .
Goldman Sachs , the bank , recently predicted that by 2050 , China and India would have overtaken the U.S. to be the world 's first and second biggest economies .
We have long heard about the benefits this brings , in terms of plentiful cheap goods from toys to TVs , and huge opportunities for Western companies to sell their wares in these booming markets .
But there are also downsides , which are becoming more apparent .
Unskilled workers in the West have become unsettled by the threat to their jobs as production moves East .
The most vulnerable Western workers have found their wages stagnate as they struggle to compete in an increasingly global market place .
And competition for raw materials is pitting East against West .
The economic explosion of China , and to a lesser extent India , has given them an almost overpowering hunger for raw materials with which to build their factories , homes and cars .

There are even reports that manholes in Britain have been disappearing to feed the monstrous appetite for scrap steel in the other side of the world .
China is spending 35 times as much on crude oil as it did eight years ago , and 23 times as much on copper .
As it builds gleaming skyscrapers on its fields , China alone consumes half the world 's cement and a third of its steel .
What is happening is so extraordinary that economists have had to invent a new word for it - this is not an economic cycle , but a supercycle , a shift in the world economy of historic proportions .
When demand increases and supply stands still , prices shoot up .
Iron , wheat and oil are all at record prices , despite slackening demand in the faltering Western economies .
The cost of living in Britain is now rising faster than wages , making the British on average poorer year on year .
Asia 's expansion means that its influence is starting to be felt more directly around the world .
Asian countries are not just buying up foreign raw materials , but as their companies try to become global leaders , they are buying up Western companies .
It is not just Land Rover , Jaguar and MG Rover .
The Malaysian company Proton owns Lotus .
Indian company Tata owns Corus , once British Steel , as well as Tetley Tea .
The hunger for raw materials is also making China lose its shyness and venture out into the world .
Like Germany and Russia , China has traditionally been a land empire , focusing its expansionist energies on countries it had borders with , and it eschewed the world - conquering exploits of Europe 's sea-faring maritime nations .

From the UN to the IMF to the World Bank , the international institutions that attempt to govern the planet were made in the image of the victors of World War II .
Now power is shifting from West to East , the whole liberal democratic world order will face its first serious challenge in decades .
Many fear that things could get ugly .
There is only one thing worse than an unchallenged superpower - it is a superpower with a victim mentality , which feels the world owes it a favour .
And the bitter truth is that , after centuries of humiliation in foreign affairs , there is a nationalist mood in China that the country 's time has come again , that it can again claim its rightful place as the world 's most powerful country .
Its comparative weakness over the last few centuries is , in fact , but a blip in the last 2,000 years , during which China was the world 's most economically and culturally advanced nation .

Many were shocked by their heavy - handed tactics
It is an accident of history that Europeans took advantage of their window of opportunity in the last half of the second millennium to take over the world .
The cause was a combination of factors such as the development of maritime technology in Europe , the competition between European countries that drove them to look outwards and find new ways to increase prosperity , and the fact China remained firmly locked in its agrarian , introspective past .
Now things have changed , and already the shift in the world economy is starting to have dramatic effects on migration patterns .
The emigration of poor people from China and India to the West is slowing down , as their citizens see more hope in their own rapidly advancing nations .
Instead , their expanding middle classes are paying large fees for their children to enjoy a Western university education , before returning home .
There are now 60,000 Chinese students in Britain , more than from any other country .
Westerners have become accustomed to being the only tourists in the world 's tourist hotspots , but the Chinese and Indians want to enjoy the fruits of their labour by expanding their horizons , too .

As the opportunities flow from West to East , so too do the people .

Responding , R K Krishna Kumar , a senior Tata executive , thundered that " Indian companies ... will take their rightful place in the international arena .
" Enterprises and individuals must recognise and adapt to these fundamental economic changes .
We believe that those with a fossilised frame of mind risk being marginalised . "
In a world in which we are no longer masters , it is a warning that we ignore at our peril .
" Can scientists and journalists learn to beat the doubt industry before our most serious problems beat us all ? "
This is the question asked in an interesting piece at a news ?
site I 've never heard of - " Miller - McCune : Turning Research Into Solutions . "
I 'm not sure about the research and solutions thing , but they do have some interesting comments about the " Doubt Industy . "
" Doubt Industry " means organized interests with a strong motivation to get the public to question science : the link between smoking and cancer , the scientific status of evolution , the health hazards of beryllium ( apparently a problem for workers in the atomic industry ) .
Whenever scientific results cause problems for someone , especially someone with a strong financial incentive to not believe the science , the time - tested strategy is to question the certainty of the science .
A well - known internal memo from one cigarette company in the 1960 's famously claimed ( PDF ) : " In thinking over what we might do to improve the case for cigarettes , I have looked at the problem somewhat like the marketing of a new brand ...
Our consumer I have defined as the mass public , [ and ] our product as doubt ... "
That line is the title of a new book by a former Department of Energy Scientist : Doubt is Their Product : How Industry 's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health . "
The Miller - McClune Piece interviews the author and reviews the book .
I have n't read the book and have nothing to say about it , but the strategy of sowing doubt about science raises an interesting issue .
A lot of times scienceuncertain , and we 're are occasionally forced to make policy decisions based on incomplete data .
But in other cases we are not , the science is solid , yet how is the public supposed to know the difference ?
Or let 's make this even more personal : how aresupposed to know the difference between a settled scientific issue and one that is still debated ?
Obviously none of us is an expert in every technical field , and even if we were capable of that , nobody can keep up with all that primary literature .
At some point , you have to take somebody 's word for it .
Personally , I 'd like to listen to somebody who 's likely to be right , whether it fits with my personal ideology or not .
Sometimes the science is relatively simple - like the link between smoking and cancer ; it 's hard to find a stronger link between something and cancer than that , unless it 's exposure to radioactivity .
But usually we 're not so lucky - take climate change , something which is so fiendishly complicated , resting on multiple different types of evidence from different fields , as well as computer models , which can be great , or they can be terrible , but it 's hard to know without immersing yourself in the details .
The issue gets worse when you get cargo - cult science involved : imitators , who try their best to look scientific , using jargon , hosting technical conferences , and basically trying to get the public to get to think that they are doing real science .
What these imitators are missing ( and it 's not always limited to imitators , it happens in real science as well ) is , as Richard Feynman put it : " A specific , extra type of integrity that is not lying , but bending over backwards to show how you are maybe wrong , that you ought to have when acting as a scientist . "
That 's the kind of person you want to trust .
Unfortunately , that kind of attitude does n't help the uncertainty issue .
But there is hope : good scientists who speak to the public should be frank about the shortcomings and possible alternate interpretations of their work , but when they are confident about a result , they should say so forcefully and explain why alternate ideas have failed on the evidence .
What I 'm really saying is that I have no clue how to solve the doubt problem .
I look for scientists who have the self - confidence to recognize a solid result when they see one , but who also bend over backwards to make sure they are not fooling themselves .
In today 's current media climate , that kind of thing is hard to find .
Montreal psychiatrists Joel and Ian Gold are studying the Truman Show Delusion , a mental illness they 've identified where individuals are convinced that they are the stars of imaginary reality TV shows .
By the way some people act on Flickr and YouTube , I 'd say that this disorder , with varying severity , may be more common than we realize .
From Canada.com :
While ( Joel ) Gold says they could have easily called their new disorder the EDtv Delusion or the Matrix Delusion — both films that refer to an unreal existence– three of the five patients he treated at the storied mental health hospital directly likened their plight to The Truman Show , the 1998 film about Truman Burbank , an affable suburbanite who slowly becomes aware that his every movement is broadcast 24/7 to voyeuristic viewers around the world .
The five patients Dr. Gold treated were white men between the ages of 25 and 34 , the majority of whom held university degrees .
" I realized that I was and am the centre , the focus of attention by millions and millions of people , " explained one patient , an army veteran who came from an upper - middle - class upbringing .
" My family and everyone I knew were and are actors in a script , a charade whose entire purpose is to make me the focus of the world 's attention … . "
" The wish for fame is a form of grandiosity , and the fear of threats such as surveillance can bring about paranoia , " said the Montreal - based ( Ian ) Gold , 46 , who specializes in delusion .
" New media is opening up vast social spaces that might be interacting with psychological processes . "

Controversial plans for the first new settlement to be built in the occupied West Bank in almost a decade have been revived by Israel 's defence ministry , despite calls by the international community for a freeze on construction , which is illegal under international law .
A key planning committee at the ministry has approved a plan to build 20 homes in a new settlement in the Jordan valley to be called Maskiot .
The defence minister , Ehud Barak , has not yet given his approval , although Israeli reports yesterday suggested the plan would go ahead soon .
The decision comes in the same week as two high - profile visits to Israel by Gordon Brown and Barack Obama , who both talked about the importance of a two - state solution to end the Middle East conflict .
All settlements in occupied territory are illegal under international law and Palestinian officials were quick to criticise the proposal .
" This is destroying the process of a two - state solution , " said Saeb Erekat , a senior Palestinian negotiator .
" I hope the Americans will make the Israelis revoke the decision .
I think they can make the Israelis do this . "
The US road map , which is the basis of the current peace talks , calls for a freeze on all settlement activity , but Israel has defended its recent decisions to go ahead with construction in East Jerusalem and in West Bank settlements that it believes will become part of Israel in any peace deal .
However the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , has promised not to build new settlements .
Yesterday his spokesman , Mark Regev , said : " Israel will continue to honour our commitments .
There will be no new settlements , there will be no expansion of existing settlements and there will be no expropriation of land for settlement construction . "
He said neither Barak nor Olmert had approved the plan .
During his visit to Israel and the West Bank , Brown said " settlement expansion has made peace harder to achieve " .
It is not the first plan for a Maskiot settlement .
Israel said two years ago that it planned to build Maskiot but the plan was frozen after international disapproval .
Maskiot began as a military position , which is how many settlements started .
Then a religious school was established , and this year several families arrived in mobile homes .
The families were mostly religious Jewish settlers who had been withdrawn from Gaza in 2005 , with more reportedly waiting to join them .
Yariv Oppenheimer , head of the Israeli group Peace Now , said pressure on the government from the settler movement often appeared to outweigh international pressure against expansion .
" I think it is very disappointing , " he said .
" It is paving the way to a one - state solution .
We are afraid eventually that if there will be a peace treaty there will be so many settlements it will not be possible to implement it . "
Settler leaders sounded buoyed by the news .
" This should have been done a long time ago , " Dubi Tal , chairman of the Jordan Valley regional council , told the Ma'ariv newspaper .
" I welcome this decision with much hope and , with God 's help , we will build and bring those expelled from Gush Katif to a safe place . "
Gush Katif refers to the settlers evacuated from Gaza three years ago .
There are more than 400,000 people living in Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank .
A report in Ma'ariv said new figures from the interior ministry showed the West Bank settler population grew by 15,000 last year , a rise of 5.5 % , with the sharpest rise in ultra-Orthodox settlements .
That compares with a 1.8 % rise for the Jewish population in Israel .
Palestinian officials said yesterday that a group of Jewish settlers had attacked a Palestinian village , Burin , near the West Bank city of Nablus , smashing cars and windows and cutting electricity wires .
The attack was filmed by an Israeli group , Rabbis for Human Rights .
The village was close to a settlement where an Israeli was arrested this month for allegedly trying to fire a rocket at the Palestinians .
Hypebot Infiltrates Columbia Records Site With Anti-Label Ad
There are many reasons why corporate and artist sites should not carry advertising .
But the most obvious one is that outside ads change the conversation .
In one of the few places that a marketer can completely control their message ; they ’re sharing the stage with outsiders who have a different agenda .
To prove the point , I placed this ad via Google AdWords in rotation yesterday on the front page of the main Columbia Records web site columbiarecords.com :
Major Labels Are Obsolete
R.I.P. or learn and thrive .
Music .
Tech .
The New Music Business
Hypebot.com
As of this morning for a mere $ 3.37 in click thru fees , 6417 people visiting Columbia Records flagship site were delivered the message that this company is obsolete .
Could that have been worth the share of $ 3.37 that parent Sony BMG will receive ?

War criminal Karadzic arrested :
From The Times :
Lech Mintowt - Czyz
War crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic has been arrested in Serbia after 12 years on the run .
The Bosnian Serb wartime leader , one of the world ’s most wanted men , was taken into custody by the Serbian security services , Serbian President Boris Tadic ’s office said in a statement .
Karadzic is twice indicted for genocide for the 43 - month siege of Sarajevo which claimed 12,000 lives and for orchestrating the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica , the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two .
My dear readers , I have a fetish .
I thoroughly enjoy making you guys and gals look at things that simply make you go " what the f*ck " and make your brain feel like it 's dividing by zero as it tries to process what it just saw .
Tonight , I think I have outdone myself .
I know this is a monster from the Silent Hill series , but I 'm not exactly sure what they 're called .
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I believe this is a Twoback , which are baddies from Silent Hill : Origins .
In any case , this is one of best cosplays I have ever seen .
Sure , it 's extremely creepy , but I absolutely just adore it .
You can tell a lot of hard work went into creating the costume .
Can you just imagine how bad the guy 's back must have felt at the end of the day holding all the weight ?
Very impressive , indeed .

When palaeontologists reported that they had recovered soft tissue from a 65 - million - year - old Tyrannosaurus rex fossil , the excitement was palpable .
Without going all Jurassic Park , the discovery seemed to open the door to studying biomolecules from dinosaurs and other long - extinct creatures .
Now , however , Tom Kaye of the University of Washington says the soft material is more likely to be remnants of biofilms deposited by bacteria .
Kaye set out to find his own dinosaur tissue in bones from rocks like those that had apparently yielded the T. rex tissue .

Dental plaque
“ We cracked open a lot of bones and spent hundreds of hours on an electron microscope examining them , ” said Kaye .
He concluded the soft material was not from dinosaurs , but from bacterial films which grew on cavities inside the bone long after the animal had died .
More familiar biofilms are thin , sticky layers like dental plaque , but Kaye says the biofilms he found produced branching hollow filaments when they coated the inside of blood vessel cavities in the bone .
Mary Schweitzer of North Carolina State University , who made the original soft tissue claim and who also reported evidence for dinosaur collagen , is not convinced .
Schweitzer points to immunological studies that show her T. rex samples were close to chicken collagen , as expected because birds evolved from predatory dinosaurs .
Original protein
Kaye , she says , “ did not offer any explanation for how ‘ biofilm ’ proteins from dinosaur could cluster with chicken , while ‘ biofilm ’ from mammoth and mastodon cluster with elephant . ”
That indicates at least some of the long - dead animals ’ original protein survives .
It is clear that some biomarker molecules can survive for tens or hundreds of millions of years in fossils , says David Martill of the University of Portsmouth , UK .
“ This is why we should not abandon hope of finding fossil biomolecules , ” he says .
But some of the bacterial scum could be mixed in , making the whole fossil a composite , says Dave Unwin of the University of Leicester .
“ That seems a lot more realistic of nature than the clean pictures presented before , ” he told New Scientist .

Games have evolved over their relatively short existance , but as the hardware has been pushed to the limit , it has n’t necessarily driven better games .
Sure , now games have extensive cut scenes and all sorts of wonderous graphics , but I believe what has driven newer and better games have been the controllers .
In this extensive Retro Garden feature I have a look at some of the controllers that have shaped video game history , as well as three that – well – have n’t .
Slight deviation :
In this article I focus on controllers that are used for most games on the system .
Lightguns were battery hungry rubbish that do n’t work , so I have n’t looked at things like that .
So do n’t complain if the NES Laserscope is n’t here .
Because it is n’t .
1. Dials
Early video games were built on large , room filled computers .
As a result , there was few slots to plug things into , and less money available to waste developing controllers .
As such , the early games such as Pong and Computer Space only had two methods of movement , so existing computer technology was used to control computers .
Most computers used dials in some way shape or form , so to begin with , dials were used to begin with .
They had their pros and cons .
They were stupidly accurate – play pong with a joystick and play with a dial and you ’ll know which one is better .
However , they could be overly sensitive .
Also , they did n’t allow much freedom of movement beyond two planes .
2. Digital Joystick – Atari 2600
Probably the architypical joystick of the 8 - bit era .
The Atrai 2600 was one of a number of peripherals available for the system , but this one allowed more than just dial movements and plugged the world into full 2D movement .
Furthermore , it also utilized a standard port which could be plugged into the Commodore 64 , Atari ST , Amiga , Master System and Megadrive ( as well as more ) , and is still recognised today .
It was overly stiff at times , but was the first popular joystick available , and is still remembered fondly today .
So much so that it is featured on keyrings and direct to TV multigames .
A recent magazine article also stated this controller was very popular with women for it ’s , erm , durable nature .
3. Competition Pro Joystick ( 2 Buttons ) – Commodore 64
Sensing a gap in the market , Competition Pro Joystick became the first joystick to take advantage of the fact that the ports all worked the same , with multiple buttons .
Because of this , it sold itself to a number of systems , from the Commodore 64 , Amiga , Atari ST and Master System .
It had two buttons as well , and – whilst probably not the best selling or best joystick out there – it has become one of the most iconic “ third party ” joysticks , used in banners and also a copy of it ’s design was used in Commdore 64 DTV system .
4. Joypads – NES / Master System
Consoles became the next big thing after the triumph of the 8 - bit computer era .
The NES was there first , in 1983 beating the first incarnation of the Master System by a couple of months .
But how would you control these consoles ?
Joysticks had a nasty knack of breaking easy , especially with joystick busters such as Track & Field , or the worse Spy vs Spy 2 .
It ’s no surprise that the only two working Commodore 64 joysticks I own today are have tiny shafts ( do n’t giggle ) , barely big enough to wiggle with 3 fingers ( again , stop the giggling ) .
So the NES did away with the joystick altogether , allowing you to press the digital keypad directly under the joystick with ease .
This made it ideal for the NES and Master System ’s choice of games – platformers .
Joysticks did n’t like it , regularly becoming such and unwieldy .
Mario – with it ’s buttons for jump and fire , leaving up useless , and pressing down ducking , made pixel perfect jumping a breeze , and made a control system for years to come , a control system without joysticks ( try playing Smash Bros Brawl ’s Adventure Mode with a Classic Controller to see what I mean ) .
5. 3 Button Joypads – Megadrive
With all it ’s plaudits , both the Master System and the NES ’s controller suffered a fundemental flaw , you had to have hands with right angles in them .
The Sega Megadrive , with an extra 16 bits , knew that it may have to spend a little bit of time on controller enhancements .
The controller was cool , it was black , it was shaped like the thing Batman throws , and it was so easy to hold for long periods – like a loved one .
Sega knew that erganomically happy gamers lead to we throw money at you gamers .
They also stuck an extra button on it .
This took the developers by surprise as a lot of games did n’t take advantage of it to begin with ( such as Columns / Sonic ) or shoehorned in a rubbish command with it ( Italia 90 ’s “ Pass ” , which is weak , and useless ) .
Still , it paved the way of awesome controllers .
6. Analogue Joysticks – PC/ST / Amiga
Back to those joysticks , and some people think that Analogue Joysticks were invented with the Nintendo 64 , right ?
These people are wrong .
Analogue joysticks have been around for years on the 16 bit computers .
Popular with flight games , driving games , and just any sort of game that requires overly precise movement , analogue joysticks were also built to last , which explained their hefty price tag that only monarchs can afford , rumours that Prince William bought one to train on flying helicopters may be untrue though .
7. 6 Button Joypads – SNES
A quarter of the way through the 16 bit console era came that wonderful wonderful time of beat - em-ups .
Yes , it began with Street Fighter II and is still in drips and drabs today .
Street Fighter pretty much dictated the need of six buttons , and the SNES was first up .
I know the Megadrive had the six on the face buttons , but I preferred the SNES ’ two shoulder buttons .
Helped immensely for fighting games and put to good use for Super Punch Out and Street Racer .
Top work Shigsy !
8. 8 Button Joypads – Sony Playstation
Come the Sony Playstation , and the 32 - 64 bit era of games , more and more buttons were being placed everywhere .
The 64 bit Atari Jaguar saw the most buttons on the controller , but that was in effect useless ( more on that later ) .
Sony gave us a fantastic controller with the PS1 .
Erganomically desigened so it was so easy on the hands , all of the buttons were in the right places , meaning none were redunant .
The controllers made controlling games a breeze , and the triangle , square , X and Circle buttons became so cool it was used in Sony ’s advertising and branding of the machine .
9. Analogue Controllers + Expandable Slots – Nintendo 64
Nintendo’s 64 bit console , the Nintendo 64 , introduced a revolutionary new controlller that allowed for multiple methods of control .
As well as a traditional joypad and six buttons , you also got an analogue stick for precise movement , which worked well for it ’s primary source of games – 3D platformers .
You also got a trigger button on the back ( ideal for games like Goldeneye ) and shoulder buttons .
It did n’t work well for some games ( beat em ups ) , but for many games it worked fantastically .
As well as this you got an expandable slot on each controller for memory packs or rumble packs , and it worked really well .
Nowadays , multple controllers have expandable packs .
10 . Wiimote – Nintendo Wii
Seems to be a theme here , does n’t there ?
Nintendo shocked the world with hit ’s basic design for it ’s controller for the Wii .
It looked like a retarded remote control , with only two buttons , and a pointer .
However , with the advent of Wii Sports , Nintendo showed that there was a lot of power in it .
Instead of simply moving a controller , you could swing , wiggle and make all sorts of movements corresponding to your character on screen .
It ’s not completely revolutionary ( a number of golf games used a similar method with the mouse as what happens on Wii Golf ) , however it has pushed the boundaries of gaming further , as games such as Pro Evolution Soccer for the Wii shows .
Non Starters
Below are three Joypads that , in my opinion , sucked .
1. Joypad +
Telephone Keyboard – Atari Jaguar
In the midst of the “ lets put as many buttons on a joypad as possible ” this took it too far .
The controllers were light and felt like they were thrown together , yet were so awkward .
The controller contained a grand total of 17 buttons and a D - Pad , however most were completely unusable , as they were based on a keypad .
Some games like Doom did use them , but that lead to further problems as you sometimes leant against the buttons unwittingly , which resulted in a switched gun , and untold consequences .
2. Controllers within Controllers – Dreamcast
Do n’t get me wrong , I thought this was a great idea in principle .
Basically , the VMU’s ( the Virtual Memory Units – the Dreamcast version of the Memory Card ) plugged into the controller , but they had a screen .
That screen added extra information to your game , such as stats and stuff .
However , you could also download small games to the VMU , and play them on the move , as the VMU had a controller .
This was an awesome idea in principle , but there was three main faults .
For one , it ate up the battery like nobody ’s business , and if the battery died , that ’s it , you lost your game .
It was easy to replace the battery , but it sucked no end losing your way .
Secondly , no real games used the screen beyond stats and an animation – if somebody had released a texas hold em for the dreamcast , then it could ’ve be used .
Finally , it was rather expensive , around £ 15 more than a standard memory card .
3. Dual Shock – Sony Playstation 2
Oooh controversial !
Yes , I hated the Dual Shock for the PS2 .
So it ’s here personally .
The vibration on it was too strong ( yes , you could turn it off ) , and mine seemed to break rather easily , even though I hardly played on it .
The other thing I hated was the overly analogue buttons .
Basically , like the joypads , the buttons could detect levels of compression , meaning that you could control the accelleration in driving games .
This was fine for driving games , but completely ruined fighting and other types of games .
Furthermore who does n’t floor it on driving games ?
Mine also rattled .
Great system , average at best controller .
What are your thoughts ?
Have I missed off a classic controller ?
Or do you feel that I ’m being unfair .

Virgin Amazon rain forest borders deforested land prepared for the planting of soybeans , in this aerial photo taken over Mato Grosso state in western Brazil in this February 25 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Paulo Whitaker
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - More of the Amazon rain forest should be cut down to make way for farmland to help ease the global food crisis , the governor of a big Brazilian farming state was quoted on Friday as saying .
Blairo Maggi , the governor of Mato Grosso state and Brazil ’s largest soy producer , was quoted in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper as defending deforestation .
“ With the worsening of the global food crisis , the time is coming when it will be inevitable to discuss whether we preserve the environment or produce more food .
There is no way to produce more food without occupying more land and taking down more trees , ” said Maggi , a farming pioneer in the vast western state who is widely known as the “ King of Soy . ”
“ In this moment of crisis , the world needs to understand that the country has space to raise its production . ”
Folha said the areas with the most deforestation , legal and illegal , in the second half of 2007 were in Mato Grosso , a huge agricultural state in western Brazil still half covered by rain forest .
Brazil ’s booming economy , soy farming and cattle ranching have put pressure on land prices and fueled deforestation .
Official figures released in January showed that between August and December of last year , about 2,700 square miles
were chopped down illegally in the Amazon rain forest .
It was the first increase in deforestation after three years of declines and coincided with a rise in global food prices .
There ’s a disturbing trend in this 2008 election .
We are witnessing the manipulation and exploitation of Muslim - Jewish differences by political candidates in pursuit of votes .
As advocates for our respective communities , we believe it ’s in America ’s interest that it stop .
It appears that the political logic of the candidates and their handlers calls for winning Jewish American support at the expense of Muslim American voters .
This takes the shape of aggressive outreach to the Jewish community while Muslims go ignored .
That strategy may be politically expedient , but it is inherently flawed .
Muslims see their exclusion as a betrayal of American values , and many Jews are alarmed by the parallels to their own historical political exclusion .
American Jews are all too familiar with institutionalized bigotry .
In the late 1940s and 1950s , Rep. John Rankin opposed the immigration of Holocaust survivors , and he opposed integration .
In that McCarthyite , anti-Communist era , politicians clamped down against those who they thought threatened the changing fabric of America -- namely , Jews .
Now , Muslims are on the receiving end of similar suspicions , this time in the name of fighting terrorism .
Muslims today are political scapegoats associated with global tragedies including terrorism and war .
Against this dismal backdrop , politicians are apparently deeming Muslim voters political pariahs ; any endorsement from national Muslim groups is tantamount to a kiss of death .
Just one day after Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton dropped out of the Democratic race , Sen. Barack Obama rushed to receive the blessing of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Last week , his campaign volunteers rushed to remove Muslim women wearing head scarves from a Detroit rally .
Though Obama apologized , Muslims felt stung by a candidate supposedly running on a platform of inclusion and change .
But the snubs are n’t limited to Obama .
Sen .
John McCain recently dismissed a Muslim American businessman from an important campaign committee .
In March , McCain visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem but made no similar visit to the adjacent Muslim holy site , the Dome of the Rock .
And although both candidates have made frequent stops at churches and synagogues , neither has made a campaign stop at a mosque .
Put on the spot about turning their backs on Muslim voters , politicians may argue that they can’t afford to lose Jewish support , implying that the Jewish community would oppose any politician who associates with Muslims .
To be sure , the politicians are n’t inventing a division between Muslims and Jews .
We acknowledge the tension between our communities created by the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
And yet it is also clear that Jews and Muslims should be natural allies in countering xenophobia and hysteria .
We both suffer from scapegoating as fear works against common sense in our political culture .
Whether it is anti-Semitism or Islamophobia , we both know the face of bigotry .
The issue of excluding Muslims to get Jewish votes is not about ensuring domestic security , it is about cowardly politics .
It is about playing to fears , not processing facts .
It is about the canard that Muslims and Jews have been fighting since ancient times and nothing will change .
It is about blaming both for America ’s problems .
We Muslims and Jews , along with all people of faith , represent the spirit of God .
There is much that binds us together .
It is in the spirit of this shared history , and our common interests , that we must stand against these divisions being created by the candidates .
Abraham Lincoln argued against the politics of fear , holding out hope for the “ better angels of our nature . ”
Our presidential candidates must display such higher thinking in the coming months .
Likewise , we -- American Jews and Muslims -- must do the same .

( CNN ) -- Italian newspapers , an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on Monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned Roma girls were laid out on the sand .
Photographs of the dead Roma girls on a beach caused outrage in Italy .
Italian news agency ANSA reported that the incident had occurred on Saturday at the beach of Torregaveta , west of Naples , southern Italy , where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other Roma girls .
Reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets .
Local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents .
Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams .
Two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them .
Watch why the photos have generated anger »
The Web site of the Archbishop of Naples said the girls were cousins named Violetta and Cristina , aged 12 and 13 .
Their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police .
Photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls ' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies .
A photographer who took photos at the scene told CNN the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference .
Other photos show police officers lifting the bodies into coffins and carrying them away past bathers reclined on sun loungers .
" While the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand , there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few meters away , " Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported .
Corriere della Sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed .
" Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing .
When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins , the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun . "
The incident also attracted condemnation from the Archbishop of Naples , Cardinal Crecenzio Seppe .
" Indifference is not an emotion for human beings , " Seppe wrote in his parish blog .
" To turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur . "
Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country 's Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi 's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a " Roma emergency " that has seen the 150,000 - strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime .
That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma -- an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination .
Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents .
In a statement published on its Web site , the Italian civil liberties group EveryOne said Saturday 's drowning had occurred in an atmosphere of " racism and horror " and cast doubt on the reported version of events , suggesting that it appeared unusual for the four girls to wade into the sea , apparently casting modesty aside and despite being unable to swim .
" The most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach , " the statement said .
" No one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children 's dead bodies on the beach : they carry on swimming , sunbathing , sipping soft drinks and chatting . "

Meaghan Cooper : The Girl Behind the Mario Lopez and Karina Smirnoff Split
Former bartender , Hooters calendar girl , aspiring rock star and reality television star , , is being blamed for the break up ofand his " Dancing with the Stars " partner
Pictures of Cooper and Lopez partying together surfaced last June and also appeared on Meaghan 's Myspace page , which she says she removed at Mario 's request .
" He said he broke up with her .
If he ’s still seeing her , he said it ’s because he ’s just trying to keep things ‘ cordial ’ between them because of the dancing show .
I would n’t be parading around with him if he was still with Karina . "
" He ’s been friends with Eva for 20 years , and I ’m friends with Tony .
So if he asks me to go to the wedding , I would , " however she insists she does n't think Mario is one to settle down - with her or any other woman , explaining , " I would never get serious with him because he has a history of not being real faithful . "
" After I returned from filming he started acting really weird , " she said .
" Right now we are n't talking , and I wo n't return his calls . "
Cooper says she has been dating Lopez for the past 11 months , and claimed last year in an interview with The Enquirer that he told her his relationship with Smirnoff was over .
Also in the interview , Cooper said she was hoping to attend the wedding of Eva Longoria and Tony Parker with Lopez :
The 22 - year - old native Texan from San Antonio is a contestant on the upcoming ABC reality show " I Survived a Japanese Game Show , " which recently wrapped in Tokyo .
A rep for Smirnoff said that this is obviously a difficult time for her but she is focusing on some very exciting opportunities in her professional life and dealing with the situation as best she can .

There seems to be an interesting attraction between Erlang and Lisp and several times it has been tried to marry them , in different ways .
Bill Clementson wrote about it already in his article Concurrent / Parallel Programming - The Next Generation .
Here is an updated list :
And this list does not even include projects like ( again defunct ? )
Kali Scheme , which are clearly related .
Personally , I think that the reimplementation approach will have a tough stance against integration approaches like Distel .
They lock out either one or the other of the two language eco-systems : libraries , development tools , etc. , and recreating this is a lot of work ( but do n't let that stop you ! )
With Distel , I can choose to program parts of the application in ELisp or Erlang , whatever is a better fit .
Distel implements
Erlang 's on - the - wire protocol , which is nice because there is no need to mess around with a Foreign Function Interface .
Alternatively , one could bind to the Erlang C libraries .
As far as rapid prototyping is concerned , this should be the fastest and most straight - forward approach .
I wonder why everybody is doing it the hard way ( reimplementation ) ?
A helpful reader on reddit rightly pointed out that I forgot to include ETOS , now rectified .
Bill Clementson wrote a nice summary of the Erlang Interoperability options .
Thanks again , Bill !

Ah , the Nazis .
Modern America knows few epithets more vile .
You can insult a man ’s mother , wish rape on him , liken him to the hinder part of the alimentary canal .
But do n’t compare him to Germany ’s totalitarians , even if he works for their contemporary counterparts , unless you want a fight — and a frisk from the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
Darron Derrick was " very late " for his flight out of Tampa International Airport to Detroit .
How late ?
" He checked in 38 minutes before the scheduled departure … "
Back when America was free , passengers who arrived 38 minutes prior to " scheduled departure " were early .
But the TSA ’s warrantless searches impede travel now , and we serfs are expected to revise our schedules accordingly .
Our Rulers " recommend " we waste " at least two hours " in the airport ; it ’s our own fault if we flout their orders and miss our flight .
Ergo , when our 39 - year - old engineer huffed into the airport , he " found a long , snaking line to the security checkpoint … "
So he approached " a line attendant . "
Imagine that as resume fodder : " 2006 — 2008 Line attendant .
Stand around in uniform ; look fat , dumb , and hippy .
Pretend passengers are terrorists .
Scowl and yell in bullying tones while disregarding individuals seeking assistance .
Plan best route for own escape in case real terrorists actually show up some day . "
Anyway , poor Darron asked this cretin " if he could move ahead of others .
She ignored him . "
Of course .
She ’s too busy doing nothing .
Eventually Darron made it to " the X - ray machine , " where " he placed his laptop inside its case on the belt and went through the metal detector .
An officer informed him the computer and case had to go through again separately . "
Those wimpy rays do n’t see through Christmas paper either , prompting the TSA to command , " Travel with unwrapped gifts .
If a wrapped gift sets off an alarm , TSA security officers will need to unwrap the gift to resolve the alarm . "
Lois Lane must have hoped Superman ’s vision was this feeble .
Our hero had endured enough nonsense by now .
He " told the supervisor that screeners were going to make him late for the plane by using u2018 Nazi - style , police - state tactics . ’ "
Darron may not realize it , but he was paraphrasing a Supreme Court justice who knew something about Nazis .
Robert Jackon had represented the United States at the Nuremberg Trials ; four years later , when deciding Brinegar v. United States ( 338 U.S. 160 , 180 [ 1949 ] ) , he extolled the Fourth Amendment : " These rights , I protest , are not mere second - class rights but belong in the catalog of indipensable [ sic ] freedoms .
Among deprivations of rights , none is so effective in cowing a population , crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart .
Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government . "
Or , as Darron succinctly put it , " police state . "
The TSA boasts more Nazi ties .
There ’s its parent bureaucracy , the Department of Homeland Security .
Even neoconservative cheerleader Peggy Noonan tsk - tsked its demonic echoes in an otherwise supportive column for the Wall Street Journal : " The name Homeland Security grates on a lot of people , understandably .
Homeland is n’t really an American word , it ’s not something we used to say or say now .
It has a vaguely Teutonic ring — Ve must help ze Fuehrer protect ze Homeland ! … "
Actually , there ’s nothing vague about " Homeland ’s " Teutonic ring : it clearly and horrifically tolls " Third Reich . "
Wikipedia points out that " homeland is translated as Heimatland , and this was a term used by the Nazis to refer to the German u2018 Fatherland . ’
It was also the name of a strongly pro-Nazi magazine edited by Wilhelm Weiss during the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany . "
I ’ll be the first to agree George Bush makes bubblegum look intelligent ; still , it ’s hard to believe his Administration chose the term unwittingly .
So you might think the TSA would be flattered when alert " customers " like Darron note the connection .
But modern Nazis spurn their progenitor : the TSA " supervisor , a Florida National Guard member and Iraq war vet , blew up .
u2018 I do n’t have to listen to your s — and being called a Nazi , ’ he said , according to a TSA report dated Tuesday .
…
Two officers detailed to watch for suspicious behavior decided Derrick " — and not the goon who " blew up " — " was a u2018 heightened concern individual , ’ said TSA spokesman Christopher White .
They directed him to additional screening , a body pat - down and a scan with a hand - held metal detector " — despite the fact that " Federal law enforcement officials " have long and vehemently " den[ied ] targeting dissidents . "
These liars met their match in Darron .
He " refused to give his telephone number . "
Nor did he " agree to have the pat - down in a private room , noting the case of a woman who died while detained at the Phoenix airport . "
Way to go , Darron !
This guy wins our " Patriotic Passenger Award " : not only did he decline to cooperate with murderers , he called them on their crimes !
His prize ?
" The supervisor had airport police escort Derrick from the terminal . "
Could have been worse : Leviathan often imprisons or kills revolutionaries who tell the truth .
Meanwhile , the TSA lived up to Darron ’s charge .
Its " report concluded that Derrick ’s u2018 frustration made him a victim of himself ’ … "
Ridiculous regulations , supervisors throwing tantrums , and vengeful minions had nothing to do with it .
Chillingly , " officers followed all procedures . "
In other words , the TSA ’s " procedures " call for punishing passengers who refuse to cringe .
Add the First Amendment to the Second and Fourth as ones this unspeakably evil agency has gutted .
But at least America ’s Nazis are fastidious : " the supervisor will receive u2018 corrective action ’ for using profanity , said White . "
You certainly do n’t want a thug shouting vulgarities as he tramples the Constitution .
Darron ’s valor continues : he may be a Ron Paul voter .
Which accords with his all - around good sense : “ I did n’t go in [ the airport ] and yell ‘ terrorist , ’ " he said .
" It ’s the system .
Everyone ’s treated like a criminal .
It ’s dehumanizing . "
Yep , and that would have Adolph applauding .
The TSA has " not become a servant of the masses , but their master . ”

@nutbastard : DD - WRT on the WRT54G is pretty damn cool .
I have n't rebooted my router since the first Friday in February , I could activate an auto - reboot , but I really want to keep an eye on the stability and want to know when / if it freezes up .
For the record , the reason I rebooted was due to a Verizon outage , not a router instability issue .
My favorite feature is being able to assign IP adresses from the routers DHCP , and lock them to that Mac address .
My server is always on 192.168.1.50 , so I can route all of the traffic to that without fear of reassignment , and without dicking around with Static IPs .
Mr Plant said he hoped to carry on working as a chef A former homeless man who now works as a chef at the hostel that took him in has won £ 2.6 m on the lottery .
Herbert Plant , 49 , from Blackpole , Worcester , said he would spend the cash from Saturday 's draw buying a car and paying off his son 's mortgage .
But he said he wanted to continue working at the city 's St Paul 's Hospice , which took him in after he lost his home and job .
The chef said hearing the news of his windfall was " surreal " .
Mr Plant said he called his employers on Monday to tell them about the win ; they greeted the news with disbelief .
' Lucky weekend '
He said he would now be taking " time out " to decide what else to do with his winnings .
However , the Leeds United fan said he would go to Elland Road to see a match and would also pay for a holiday .
" My youngest son Jamie did say he thought it was going to be a lucky weekend , " Mr Plant said .
" I asked him what he meant , but he just could n't describe his feelings , although I 'm very glad they have come true . "
He ran into the house shouting at the top of his voice , ' You 've won , you 've won '
Herbert Plant Mr Plant , who is divorced , said he played the lottery by Lucky Dip , which came up with the winning numbers of 15 , 20 , 22 , 34 , 37 and 39 .
He said he first realised he had won when his other son Richard , 24 , checked his Lotto tickets on Sunday .
Mr Plant said : " It was a normal relaxing Sunday afternoon .
" Richard was running a few errands for me at the local shop and I asked him if he would check my Lotto tickets at the same time .
" He was gone over an hour so I started to worry , but moments later he ran into the house shouting at the top of his voice , ' You 've won , you 've won ' .
" I could n't believe it . "

What are these ?
By Keith Fitz - Gerald
Investment Director
Money Morning / The Money Map Report
We can almost hear that ominous " Jaws " theme music in the background and can see that huge dorsal fin as it slices threateningly through the water – knowing full well that the real terror is hidden beneath the water 's surface .
But this time around , it 's not a " Great White " that 's sparking our fears ; it 's a well - capitalized and broadly based series of secret stock exchanges known as " Dark Pools of Liquidity , " " Dark Liquidity , " or just " Dark Pools . "
Most investors have never even heard the term – and are truly shocked to discover these " off - the - books " trading networks actually exist .
But to Wall Street insiders looking to anonymously move billions of dollars in stocks , bonds , and other investment instruments , dark pools are de rigueur – especially when you 're an institutional trader who does n't want to reveal your intentions or your actions to the " rest " of the market , until after the fact when the orders are " printed . "
And that makes these dark pools of capital highly problematic when it comes transparency :
There is literally none in most pools and only limited visibility in others .
Dark Pools : From Trading Haven to Heavyweight
Dark Pools are electronic " crossing networks " that offer institutional investors many of the same benefits associated with making trades on the stock exchanges ' public limit order books – without tipping their hands to others , meaning publicly quoted prices are n't affected .
This is the capital markets ' version of a godsend – especially for traders who desire to move large blocks of shares without the public investors ever knowing .
Some examples of so - called crossing networks include Liquidnet Inc. , Pipeline , the Posit unit of Investment Technology Group ( ITG ) , or the SIGMA X unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) .
In an era in which " secret " transactions contributed to what 's shaping up to be the largest credit crisis in history , you 'd think that any mechanism that allows insiders to trade in complete secrecy and with total anonymity would be scrutinized more closely than a Roger Clemens vitamin shot .
But that 's not the case with Dark Pools .
As has long been the case , the old boys really do like to operate behind closed doors , on the other side of the " velvet rope " – beyond which the un-anointed daily working stiff may never pass .
And Dark - Pool operators are only getting more private as computerized trading becomes more sophisticated and large - scale - order placement evolves into a science all to itself .
Dark Pool ownership involves almost the entire institutional - trading sector , consisting of independents , broker / dealer - owned pools , consortiums and even – as hard as this is to imagine , given the public 's trust – the stock exchanges themselves ( See accompanying chart ) .
And business is booming .
According to the latest data , nearly 12 % of daily U.S. stock - trading volume is presently conducted via the 40 or so Dark Pools operated by the " usual suspects . "
According to The Wall Street Journal , Credit Suisse Group AG ( ADR : CS ) is assembling a network of 30 Dark Pool partners , while JP Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) is trying to become the Google Inc. ( GOOG ) of the Dark Pool world by aligning itself with Neovest Inc .
Not to be left out , Goldman Sachs recently struck reciprocal deals with rivals UBS AG ( UBS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) to allow previously proprietary trading algorithms to work on each other 's desktop trading systems .
This is something the stock exchanges do n't want to see because it strips them of order execution revenue .
Which is why they 're getting into the game , too .
At the present time , the Nasdaq ( NDAQ ) alone shunts some 18 % of its volume – or roughly 350 million shares a day – through what insiders euphemistically refer to as its " non-displayed platforms , " and also has struck a deal with five unnamed Dark Pool operators that are rumored to route nearly half of the total Dark - Pool volume in the United States today .
NYSE Euronext ( NYX ) plans to connect up to 30 such pools , so do n't think for a New York minute that this is n't a global phenomenon – Dark Pools exist all around the globe .
We 're still in the early days of this movement .
That means there are still lots of things to be worked out from a technical standpoint .
For instance , there 's very little in the way of proprietary software that enables any Dark Pool operators to " talk " with their competition .
But we think that 's going to change in a real hurry in the next few years , when as much as 50 % of all U.S. trading volume will be handled by " Dark Pool Alliances . "
Dark Pool Downers ?
While it's hard to say just how this will affect individual investors like us , my experience as a professional trader suggests that there are a few " realities " we can count upon .
As you might expect , not all of them are good .
Let 's look at the top three :
First , as more volume moves to the so - called Dark Pools , the very notion of what constitutes " public pricing " becomes suspect .
Practically speaking , if we 're seeing only 50 % of the trading volume in a given stock , who 's to say that the pricing we 're seeing is accurate if the other half remains a mystery .
Second , the small - and mid-cap stocks that for so long have been the domain of smaller investors will likely become harder to trade .
The reason : Dark Pools will absorb the liquidity that 's presently out in the open , just as a " black hole " in outer space sucks in all the matter that 's nearby .
The net effect could be that smaller transactions become more inefficient , or that public pricing actually disconnects from private pricing .
Either way , individual investors may not get the best possible prices .
Third , you can bet regulators will get interested if there is even a whiff of impropriety at the expense of smaller investors who perceive ( and rightly so ) that they are being " locked out " of the markets by the big boys yet again .
On the other hand , maybe those regulators do n't care at all .
With the economy going the way it is right now , there 's plenty more to worry about … like making it out of the water and back up onto the beach before the music stops and " you - know - who " grabs you from below … … da - dun…da - dun….da-dun….da- dun .

WSJ : Finance chair 's ties to failed bank could embarrass Obama campaign RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator Barack Obama 's campaign faces a potential controversy over finance chairwoman Penny Pritzker 's past association with Superior Bank , which failed and was seized by regulators in 2001 .
" Billionaire Penny Pritzker helped run Hinsdale , Ill. - based Superior , overseeing her family 's 50 % ownership stake , " John R. Emshwiller writes for The Wall Street Journal .
" She now serves as Barack Obama 's national campaign - finance chairwoman , which means her banking past could prove to be an embarrassment to her -- and perhaps to the campaign . "
Superior Bank was reportedly worth $ 2.3 billion at time of its seizure by the Feds .
Superior was criticized for engaging in predatory lending .
Senator Obama has frequently called for Congressional action against predatory lenders who are at the epicenter of the subprime mortgage crisis .
" In a prepared statement , the Obama campaign noted that Ms. Pritzker was never accused of wrongdoing by regulators in connection with Superior , and that her family agreed to pay $ 460 million to help defray the costs of Superior 's collapse , " notes The Wall Street Journal .
Excerpts from article : #### " Superior was at the forefront of the securitizing of subprime mortgages , " says Timothy Anderson , a retired bank consultant who has studied Superior and other failed thrifts .
Ms. Pritzker said her " main role " as chairman was to help clean up past financial problems .
" I did not set strategy or policies " on lending or securitization , she said .
In 1994 , she moved to the board of Superior 's holding company .
Through the 1990s , Superior reported rising profits and paid $ 200 million in dividends to its owners , according to a 2002 report by the inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
But the profits came through " flawed " accounting and masked operating losses , the FDIC report said .
The dividend payments were made " without regard to the deteriorating financial and operating condition . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Big business is officially going solar .
The Boston Red Sox unveiled 28 solar hot water panels atop Fenway Park in Boston , Massachusetts May 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
This month , several of the world 's biggest technology and manufacturing companies -- including Intel Corp INTC.O and International Business Machines Corp IBM.N -- made major moves into the burgeoning solar power business .
That could be the start of a trend as corporate giants look to capitalize on the growing demand for cleaner energy sources .
“ These announcements are a great indication of where the solar industry is going , ” Rhone Resch , president of industry trade group the Solar Energy Industries Association , said in an interview on the sidelines of the Renewable Energy Finance Forum conference in New York this week .
“ This is the beginning of both high - tech and energy companies getting into solar . ”
Solar power still makes up a tiny fraction of the world ’s energy consumption , but the makers of panels that transform sunlight into electricity are enjoying supercharged growth due to heightened concerns about climate change and rising prices on fossil fuels .
In the last few years alone , solar companies including San Jose , California - based SunPower Corp SPWR.O and Germany 's Q - Cells AG QCEG .DE have grown from small technology - focused start - ups into businesses with multibillion - dollar market capitalizations .
Now , other companies want a piece of that fast - growing market .
A few tech companies , such as chip equipment maker Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O and SunPower stakeholder Cypress Semiconductor Corp CY.N , got into the solar business earlier this decade , recognizing the similarities between their own industries and technology - driven solar power .
With their proven successes , others are following .
“ What the strategic players bring is that ability to bring large - scale manufacturing , ” said Kevin Genieser , who heads Morgan Stanley ’s renewable energy investment banking practice .
“ We ’re expecting to see merger and acquisition activity ramp up in the solar space , ” he said at the conference .
‘ THE REAL DEAL ’
This week , the world 's largest maker of semiconductors , Intel , said it would spin off solar technology it developed into a start - up called SpectraWatt Inc , and IBM said it had joined forces with semiconductor process company Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co Ltd 4186.T ( TOK ) to develop more efficient solar power technologies .
Intel is leading a $ 50 million investment round in SpectraWatt , which will begin shipping its solar cells next year , while IBM and TOK plan to license their copper - indium - gallium - selenide thin film solar technology in the next two to three years .
Those moves came on the heels of Robert Bosch GmbH's ROBG .UL announcement earlier this month that it would buy German solar cell maker Ersol for 1.08 billion euros ( $ 1.67 billion ) .
Privately owned Bosch is the world 's biggest automotive supplier .
Finally , also this month Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N , the world 's biggest computer maker , said it would license its clear transistor technology to Livermore , California - based solar power company Xtreme Energetics .
Many said the interest from corporate stalwarts lends new credibility to solar power , proving that it is far from a fad .
“ Intel , IBM and HP announcements of new solar initiatives ( on the heels of Bosch acquisition of Ersol ) validate solar ’s long - term opportunity , ” Piper Jaffray analyst Jesse Pichel said in a note to clients this week .
Even Tom Werner , chief executive of SunPower , agreed that with Intel and IBM in the business , financiers and others can’t help but see solar as “ the real deal . ”
Werner said IBM and Intel would certainly raise the competitive bar , but he added that SunPower ’s well - established business has a significant advantage .
“ For us , it just makes us sharpen our sword a little bit more , ” Werner said in an interview .
“ The Intel thing , they are breaking ground now .
We ’ve been shipping for several years now , so if we ca n’t stay in front of that , shame on us . ”
Resch and Pichel also said new entrants into the market , however large , were unlikely to hurt established players given that demand for solar panels far outpaces supply .
Still , there are some who say the big companies now coming into the solar fold may just be too late to the party .
“ Today it may be a day late and a dollar short , ” said CRT Capital Group analyst Ashok Kumar .
“ Most of the domestic and overseas players have already built up scale . ”

In purported efforts to help the public " understand the privacy risks of carrying a mobile phone , " the ACLU and the EFF are suing the Justice Dept. for " documents , memos , and guides " about procedures used to track individuals through cell phones .
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are n't looking for money -- except to cover their own costs -- in their most recent lawsuit against the US Department of Justice .
Instead , the two civil liberty advocacy groups want information about whether and how the government might be using the location capabilities in cell phones to find out where people are .
" The overwhelming majority of Americans -- over 200 million people -- carry mobile phones .
This large number is steadily increasing .
The information the ACLU seeks therefore bears on the privacy of a vast segment of the United States population , " according to the complaint , which was submitted this week under the Freedom of Information Act .
Advertisement
" Recent court decisions and media reports reveal that US Attorneys Offices ( USAOs ) are assisting law enforcement officers in obtaining information from mobile carriers that enables officers to track the location of individuals ' mobile phones , " the document says .
" Court decisions indicate that USAOs claim not to need probable cause to obtain real - time tracking information .
News reports further suggest that some field offices are violating a Department of Justice ' internal recomendation ' that ' federal procecutors seek warrants based on probable cause to obtain precise location data in private areas . ' "
Filed in federal court in Washington , D.C. , the lawsuit asks the DOJ to search several specific federal offices within the agency -- including US Attorneys '
Offices in six states and the District of Columbia -- for records related to cell phone tracking .
The types of records sought in the suit pertain to policies , procedures , and practices used for obtaining mobile phone location information ; the DOJ's " internal recommendation " and any violations of that recommendation ; and the number of times the government has applied for a court order , based on less than probable cause , using that court order as authority to obtain mobile phone location information , " and whether such applications were successful . "
In an appendix to the court document , the plaintiffs have attached a news article that mentions a couple of location - based services already offered by mobile providers for tracking people outside the realm of criminal justice .
The two examples include Verizon Wireless ' Chaperone service , aimed at helping parents to track their kids , and Sprint Nextel 's " loopt " service , for " sending an alert when a friend is near . "
It 's important to note , though , that if carriers are enabling cellular tracking -- whether for parents , friends or law enforcement officials -- any location data they 're obtaining really refers to the phone itself , as opposed to the mobile subscriber .
Many cell phone owners do n't carry their phones with them at all times .
People also lose and temporarily misplace their phones , and loan them to family members and even casual acquaintances .
Consequently , a cell phone 's location is n't exactly a solid indicator of the actual current location of the owner of that phone .
So beyond any privacy risks , there could be risks , too , of mistaken identity .

6 Intake Twister & Tornado Fuel Saver
What is it ?
There are countless variations of these devices on the market , but they all come down to hunks of metal with blades that supposedly break up the air and swirl it around on its way into the engine .
According to the ads , they 're a precisely - engineered piece of futuristic alien technology designed to rock your world .
According to Popular Mechanics , they 're " something we could make in about 10 minutes from an old soda can . "

Intake Twister : $ 20 on eBay
Soda can : free in the back alley
You can decide who you would rather believe .
What 's it supposed to do ?
The vanes on this thing whip the air into a little mini-tornado .
This is somehow supposed to mix up the fuel more thoroughly with the air so you get a better burn .
Apparently all the moron car designers at these multi-billion dollar companies were too stupid to figure this out , so these guys had to make this product for all of us to enjoy the power of the tornado !
What will it really do ?
Depending on which one you use , you 'll get either nothing or a 20 percent decrease in your fuel efficiency .
Of course , there is something to the whole swirling air and fuel thing .
That 's why engines are already designed to take advantage of it , and have been for decades .

They went to school for this
The difference is that car manufacturers design their systems with high tech equipment and quality materials -- not some craptastic scrap metal .
When Popular Mechanics did their test on the Intake Twister , they were actually afraid to install this thing for fear that it would perform less like a fuel optimizer and more like deadly shrapnel once it fell apart .
These devices continue to sell and there are always customer reviews saying they saw improvements .
However , controlled tests seem to indicate the small increases they reported were less due to the device and more to people not wanting to admit they got screwed .
When is a gang not a gang ?
When it ’s based in the District .
D.C. officials insist on describing groups of young males as “ crews , ” rather than gangs , even when they are held responsible for violent acts such as the wave of killings in the city last weekend .
But police officials in other cities say the distinction is counterproductive .
“ The very first step in dealing with gangs is denial , ” said Capt .
Charles Bloom of the Philadelphia Police Department .
“ Then you get to the point that you ca n’t deny it any more . ”
D.C. police , lawmakers and community activists say the groups are not gangs because their members are mostly teens who band together for personal protection .
That , they say , distinguished them from conventional gangs , which are created for a criminal enterprise such as drug dealing .
Capt .
Bloom said Philadelphia quit trying to make such distinctions two years ago .
Although they once described such bands as “ loose groups , ” they now use the term “ gang - related ” for any group that engages in criminal violence .
Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier acknowledged this week that crews appear to be connected to some of the 10 homicides in the past two weeks — including four this past weekend .
And they are connected to hundreds of shots fired and a dozen shootings late last year in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in Northwest , officials say .
“ There seem to be several street crews that are feuding , ” said D.C. Council member Phil Mendelson , at - large Democrat , who heads the council ’s public safety committee .
“ On the one hand , that means it ’s not random ; but on the other hand , it ’s an intolerable level of violence . ”
Other large U.S. police departments also say they classify such groups as gangs — not crews — if they are engaged in any type of crime .
“ In our law , we do n’t have crews , ” said Sgt. Wilfred Williams of the San Francisco Police Department .
“ We prosecute gangs , not crews . ”
Chicago recently experienced a similar crime wave , with nine people killed in 36 shootings last weekend .
Police said at least 14 of the shootings were gang - related .
Though much larger than the eight shootings this past weekend in the District , Chicago officials said the shootings involved young males who were 18 to 25 years old .
“ The term ‘ crews ’ has never come up here , ” Officer Marcel Bright of the Chicago Police Department said yesterday .
Spokespersons for Baltimore and Los Angeles police departments made similar statements .
A Los Angeles police sergeant said the department uses the term crew to refer to a small group of gang members who commit a crime but does not use the term to describe independent groups .
Chief Lanier also said yesterday that the 1,200 officers whom she put on patrol — three times the normal number — after the weekend shootings will remain on duty for the rest of the week .
She said that she would not alter her All Hands on Deck initiative during which the entire 4,000 - officer department works patrol shifts of three - day periods .
Police said there have been no arrests in the weekend shootings but identified Melvin R. Seals of the 4600 block of Foote Street Northeast as the victim of a shooting Saturday at Morse Street and Montello Avenue Northeast .
As of yesterday , the District had 50 homicides , just one fewer than at the same time last year , according to numbers from the department .
Seventeen of the killings have been in the Fifth District , which is double the number at this time last year .

The tobacco plant may provide a cheap vaccine factory
The tobacco plant - responsible for millions of cancer cases - may actually offer the means to treat one form of the disease , a study suggests .
US scientists used the plant to " grow " key components of a cancer vaccine .
The National Academy of Sciences study suggests they could be used to tackle a form of lymphoma .
UK specialists said while " potentially exciting " , more research would be needed to test how well the vaccine actually worked .
It 's pretty cool technology - and it's really ironic that you would make a treatment for cancer out of tobacco
Dr Ronald Levy
Stanford University
The ironic new role for tobacco is the work of researchers from Stanford University in California .
They are using the plants as factories for an antibody chemical specific to the cells which cause follicular B - cell lymphoma , a type of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
These antibodies are put into a patient newly - diagnosed with the disease , to " prime " the body 's immune system to attack any cell carrying them .
If successful , this would mean the body would then recognise and destroy the lymphoma cells .
However , every patient 's antibodies are different , and would need to be produced quickly once the diagnosis was made .
The idea is not a new one - attempts have already been made to grow these antibodies inside animal cells , with mixed success .
However , a plant - grown vaccine would be much cheaper and in theory could carry less risk to the patient , as animal cells might hold unknown viruses .
So far , the experimental vaccine has only been tested on a handful of patients to check for any side - effects of using plant - produced antibodies , so its effectiveness at fighting the disease is uncertain .
' Infected ' plants Dr Ronald Levy , who is leading the research , said : " It 's pretty cool technology - and it's really ironic that you would make a treatment for cancer out of tobacco .
That appealed to me . "
The technique is relatively straightforward .
Once a patient 's cancer cells are isolated in the laboratory , the gene responsible for producing the antibody is extracted and added to the " tobacco mosaic virus " .
The plants are then " infected " with the virus , and as it spreads through the cells , the added gene starts the process of producing large quantities of the antibody .
After just a few days a few leaves are taken , ground up , and the antibody extracted from them .
Only a few plants are needed to make enough vaccine for a patient .
Professor Charles Arntzen , from Arizona State University , said that the sheer speed of the production process could convince patients to wait for their own tailored vaccine rather than undergoing other treatment .
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK , said : " While these results could potentially be very exciting , this was a small and early - stage trial and it did not look at whether this vaccination strategy reduced the size of the tumours . "
" This is a good foundation for future work , but a larger study will be needed to test the success of this plant - made antibody in fighting non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . "

" Strong , tough and battle - ready are some of the words often associated with robots , but we wanted to break that stereotype and provide a robot that 's sweet and interactive , " Sega Toys spokeswoman Minako Sakanoue said .
My family is supported by commercial fishing ( dungeness crab and king salmon ) , which is kind of ironic since I am a vegetarian .
For the second time in recent years , there will be no salmon season in California .
Last year ’s season lasted only four days , and the year before that was a complete closure due to the Klamath River .
The collapse of the Klamath salmon population was due to Bush ’s water diversion policies , that were implemented to get a Republican elected in Oregon .
This year ’s Sacramento River collapse is also the result of Bush administration decisions , which were followed up by lies to cover up the true source of the problem .
As has happened repeatedly throughout the Bush administration , scientists have been forced to mislead the public about the true cause of the Sacramento fisheries crisis .
Government scientists claim that low ocean food supply is the cause of the collapse , whereas independent scientists cite water diversion from the delta as the biggest culprit .
Rep. George Miller ( D ) Martinez explained :
They changed the science , the conclusion of the scientists and what we see now is we ’ve closed the entire Pacific fisheries to salmon and the salmon are much more endangered now than they were five , six , seven , 10 years ago .
Although warming may have caused a lack of upwelling in the California current responsible for phytoplankton and zooplankton growth , denying the negative effects of water diversion is irresponsible of the Bush administration .
Politics should not dictate or manipulate scientists .
We deserve to know the truth .
In related news , a recent effort to truck Chinook salmon failed miserably in California .
75,000 of 180,000 young fall - run salmon being hauled in tanker trucks from Coleman National Fish Hatchery in Anderson to San Pablo Bay died on Monday .
The trucked smolts were part of an experiment to see how trucking might boost salmon stocks in the ocean in response to the salmon crisis .
Last year only 22,000 salmon returned to the Coleman hatchery , compared to the record number of 450,000 in 2002 .
I am tired of the Bush administration manipulating environmental scientists for political gain , whether it is about climate change or fisheries .
Massive fish population collapses should not be covered up , and harebrained trucking experiments will not restore our rivers .
We need honesty in the face of environmental crisis .

New poll has Obama , McCain nearly tied
A new poll showing Sens. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) essentially tied in the race for the White House has prompted one pundit to ask if Obama has " peaked too soon . "
Rasmussen Reports released their latest survey today with Obama at 44 % of the vote , while McCain was at 42 % , a statistical tie .
The senators had been actually tied at 43 % for the past two days of Rasmussen 's daily tracking poll .
Obama 's lead in the Rasmussen poll , conducted via telephone surveys , has faltered in recent weeks .
Additionally , Obama's " unfavorable " reviews are higher than McCain's , 43 % to 41 % .
Rasmussen suggests that McCain 's improved poll ratings may be due in part to more Americans believing " it is possible for the U.S. to win the war in Iraq . "
Political analyst Bonnie Erbe , writing at U.S. News & World Report , says of Obama that " if upcoming polls find his lead to have evaporated long term and this weekend 's findings turn out to have been more than just ' statistical noise , ' " then the Illinois Democrat has likely peaked .
" If so , " Erbe continues , " it might just be a bit of poetic justice .
A little less than a year ago , Sen. Hillary Clinton was the media - anointed front - runner for the Democratic nomination .
Then last winter , she was deemed to have peaked too soon . "
Yet recent polls from other sources show Obama maintaining a decent lead over McCain .
Pew , for example , released a report last week showing Obama up by eight points over the Arizona Republican .

During an interview with reporters today Barack Obama was asked about Republican claims that he is too naïve on foreign policy .
“ I think it ’s my impression that John McCain has adopted not only George Bush ’s policies but George Bush ’s playbook .
This is what was done in 2000 ; this is what was done in 2004 , ” Obama
said .
“ But we are now in 2008 and there will be a different outcome because I think the American people recognize that after years in Iraq , thousands of deaths , hundreds of billions , soon to be trillions of dollars that we ’ve spent in Iraq , three , four , five , military tours of duty for our military and their families .
I think the American people are recognizing that this was not a good approach .
Now they ’re not interesting in reiterating what happened in the past , ” he continued .
He also talked about putting more resources into Afghanistan , “ They want to look forward and the plans that I ’ve presented in terms of dealing with Iraq , having a responsible paced withdrawal , going in to Afghanistan and putting more resources behind that effort so that we can finally win against Al Qaeda , taking seriously the need to forge alliances , attacking Al Qaeda wherever it appears , restoring a sense of rule of law in ways that are consonant with what the Supreme Court talked about . ”

Obama is correct in pointing out that McCain ’s tactics are straight out of the George W. Bush playbook , but I would also add that there have been other times in modern political history where the election came down to the experience argument .
In 1992 , George H.W. made the experience argument against Bill Clinton and lost .
In 1976 , Republicans said that Jimmy Carter was too inexperienced , and they lost , and in 1960 the knock on John F. Kennedy was that he was too inexperienced to be president , yet he went on to defeat then Vice President Nixon .
The experience argument only works when it is made by a popular incumbent candidate .
Neither Bush nor Ford was popular at the time of their elections .
When things are going poorly , especially economically , voters tend to turn to change candidates .
For these reasons , it is extremely unlikely that the inexperience argument will persuade enough voters away from Obama to allow McCain to win .
Because most voters are smart enough to understand that good judgment is a more important quality for a president to possess than experience .

Electronic Arts CEO , John Riccitiello , has stated that his investors really do n't care about quality when it comes to software , explaining that higher review scores do n't translate into stock sales .
" I do n't think the investors give a sh*t about our quality .
They care about our earnings per share .
They wait for it to happen .
We had three years where we did n't make our expectations .
If I were an investor , I would wait and see .
That 's fine with me , " Riccitiello explained when broaching the subject of EA 's stock failing to shift despite the rise in review scores .
Electronic Arts ' outspoken CEO also touched upon the ongoing battle for Take - Two .
" I do n't care if people write about Take - Two .
It does n't matter to me .
What matters to me is that ... we 're making progress toward that goal , " claimed Riccitiello .
" Having clever verbal sword play about Take - Two does n't really matter .
I 'm not really playing for a headline in the New York Times . "
More than 400 foreign children , many suspected of being trafficked into the sex or drug trade in Britain , have gone missing from local authority care .
Children from Africa , Asia and eastern Europe have disappeared from safe houses and foster homes around the country 's biggest ports and airports , figures released to the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed .
The missing children include at least 87 Chinese who disappeared from care around Heathrow and Gatwick and 68 from countries including Afghanistan , Albania and India who went missing from the care of Kent county council , which is responsible for protecting children trafficked through Dover and Folkestone .
Anti-trafficking campaigners believe the missing children are often taken from care by their trafficker and then exploited for prostitution , domestic servitude and other illegal activities .
Other children escape out of fear of being found by the trafficker and without money or identity papers fall prey to further abuse and exploitation .
According to records from 16 local authorities around England 's ports and airports , an estimated 408 children disappeared between July 2004 and July 2007 .
They are known by officialdom as unaccompanied asylum seekers and child protection campaigners believe most have been trafficked .
It is thought that many escape only for traffickers to send them on for exploitation in other parts of the world , particularly Italy and Spain .
Only 12 children have been traced and returned to care .
" We are shocked that the numbers keep rising , " said Christine Beddoe , the chief executive of ECPAT UK which campaigns for greater protection for trafficked children .
" These figures come in spite of the government 's action plan on trafficking and show the need for an urgent inquiry into separated children who go missing .
These vulnerable children need to be given independent guardians as soon as possible to ensure they are protected from traffickers who we know target them even while they are in care . "
Today local authorities on the front line of the illegal trade in children will tell ministers they need at least another £ 30 m to continue offering the basic protections for unaccompanied asylum seekers under 18 .
ECPAT UK also wants the government to appoint an independent " rapporteur " who can work out the true extent of the problem .
The last government estimate put the number of missing trafficked children at 183 , which now seems low .
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said : " We are concerned about the number of children who go missing from local authority care each year who appear to have been trafficked .
That is why we intend to identify a group of " specialist " local authorities which have effective procedures to keep children safe and to identify and provide proper services for the victims of trafficking .
We intend to channel all cases to these authorities from around the country . "
According to the figures obtained by the Guardian , Newcastle city council reported 12 Somali children missing and said 13 of the 17 Chinese children it has taken into care have disappeared .
Officials at Suffolk county council said they find unaccompanied children arriving in shipping containers and in the backs of lorries travelling through Felixstowe .
They admitted losing track of 16 children since March 2005 , including six Afghans .
The worst record was at the London Borough of Hillingdon which estimates it is dealing with 1,000 unaccompanied minors a year , coming mostly through Heathrow airport .
The council said 74 went missing between 2006 and 2007 and it does not know how many it lost in the previous years .
Despite a system of safe houses for the 145 children who came into the care of West Sussex , which includes Gatwick airport , 42 went missing , largely Chinese and Nigerians .
" As soon as they can they will contact their trafficker , " said Kirsty Hanna , manager of the Gatwick children 's team .
" It could be they have memorised the trafficker 's mobile number , or the trafficker may have followed them to the safe house .
There have been times when they have jumped out of the window .
They are under a lot of pressure , often to pay back their passage .
Their families back home could be threatened with torture or murder .
We are constantly trying to disrupt the traffickers , but it has to be a losing battle if we can't stop the problems abroad that causes the trafficking . "

At the beginning , there was Croslite .
The stuff came out of a factory in Colorado , and was like a miracle : soft , antibacterial , and breathable .
But nobody could decide what to do with it , until one day somebody came up with the idea to make a pair of sailing shoes out of it for his buddy ’s trip .
The buddy ended up loving it , and Crocs , the runaway six - ounce shoe success , was born .
The shoes caught on like wildfire .
All of a sudden , molded Croslite with a heel strap and big , breathable holes became a fashion statement .
The world had n’t seen footwear this bizarre , or this popular , since the Jellies sensation in the 1980s .
Jellies did n’t last forever ; they were a trend .
So are Crocs .
The people behind the shoe know that full well , so they ’ve engineering a massive expansion campaign , putting their Croslite into everything from stilettos to toilet seats .
So far , the Crocs product has essentially sold itself , and expansion has seemed inevitable for Croslite .
Last year ’s revenues were in excess of $ 800 million .
This year , they ’ve stated 10 % - 15 % growth .
Not bad for an ugly shoe .
What ’s their secret ?
They nailed down their supply chain .
Crocs purchased the supplier of the resin for the shoes and the factories that make Crocs .
They also signed contracts with key retailers .
Instead of focusing on fashion , they focused on their core strength : Croslite .
Waterproof and lightweight , Croslite also boasts antimicrobial properties .
The founders saw that the material , not the funny - looking shoe , would be sustainable in the marketplace .
They thought huge .
After the runaway success of their funny looking shoes , Crocs executives took the local company multinational .
They purchased more manufacturing plants in Canada and Mexico , as well as signing on contract manufacturers in Italy , Romania , and China .
Scale allowed them to set up just - in - time manufacturing in response to demand .
For example , if a gold shoe model is hot one month , the company makes more in a matter of weeks .
Their huge manufacturing base allows them to produce a diversified product line .
They now make kneepads for gardeners , rain boots , dress shoes , protective padding for hockey players , and specialty shoes for medical patients .
They intend to expand into toilet seats and the building industry .
In the case of Crocs , it ’s not about a trend .
It ’s about a highly effective , versatile product that can be stretched , twisted , and remade into hundreds other products .
They ’re a prime example of a company with a strong core competency ( their material ) leading to innumerable opportunities .
What ’s your core competency ?
How can it be stretched and reshaped into other forms ?
How many other ways can you think of to use your core competency ?
If Crocs is a good example to follow , knowing the answers will give you a light , springy , antimicrobial , and ever - growing bottom line …
JERUSALEM , June 6 ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites looks " unavoidable " given the apparent failure of sanctions to deny Tehran technology with bomb - making potential , one of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's deputies said on Friday .
" If Iran continues with its programme for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The sanctions are ineffective , " Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz told the mass - circulation Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper .
" Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable , " said the former army chief who has also been defence minister .
It was the most explicit threat yet against Iran from a member of Olmert 's government , which , like the Bush administration , has preferred to hint at force as a last resort should U.N. Security Council sanctions be deemed a dead end .
Iran , which denies seeking nuclear weapons , has defied Western pressure to abandon its uranium enrichment projects .
The leadership in Tehran has also threatened to retaliate against Israel -- believed to have the Middle East 's only atomic arsenal -- and U.S. targets in the Gulf for any attack on Iranian turf .
Mofaz also said in the interview that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map , " would disappear before Israel does . "
Mofaz 's remarks came as he and several other senior members of Olmert 's Kadima Party prepare for a possible run for top office should a corruption scandal force the Israeli prime minister to step down .
Iranian - born Mofaz has been a main party rival of the Israeli prime minister , particularly following the 2006 elections when Olmert was forced to hand the defence portfolio to Labour , his main coalition partner , at Mofaz 's expense .
Mofaz , who is also designated as a deputy prime minister , has remained privy to Israel 's defence planning .
He is a member of Olmert 's security cabinet and leads regular strategic coordination talks with the U.S. State Department .
Israel sent warplanes to destroy Iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981 .
A similar Israeli sortie over Syria last September razed what the U.S. administration said was a nascent nuclear reactor built with North Korean help .
Syria denied having any such facility .
Independent analysts have questioned , however , whether Israel 's armed forces can take on Iran alone , as its nuclear sites are numerous , distant and well - fortified .

ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkey ’s military said on Sunday its fighter jets hit 12 Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq ’s Qandil region in an operation that started at midnight .
The army general staff said in a statement on its website that all the planes had returned safely to their bases and that it was working to confirm “ terrorist casualties . ”
The Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) uses north Iraq as a base from which to make attacks on Turkish territory .
Turkey blames the PKK , which is fighting for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey , for the deaths of 40,000 people in the past 25 years .
“ The operations carried out as part of the anti-terror fight will continue with determination both at home and abroad in accordance with military necessities , ” the army statement said .
The PKK is regarded as a terrorist organization by Turkey , the European Union and the United States .
A Kurdish Peshmerga source , declining to be named , and Azad Wassu , local mayor of Jarawa town , confirmed a Turkish airstrike early on Sunday .
It lasted for an hour - and - half , targeting several sites in Qandil mountains , they said , adding that no civilian casualties were suffered during the operation as the civilians had left the area .
There were no reports of hospitals receiving any casualties and no information on PKK casualties , they said .
Turkish aircraft also attacked Kurdish separatist targets in Iraq on Wednesday , striking 13 PKK targets .
Iraqi officials said the air raid lasted 45 minutes but caused no casualties .
Three people traveling in a truck were killed in a mine blast on Sunday in Hakkari province on Iraqi border , the state Anatolian news agency said .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Barack Obama met in Kabul , Afghanistan , Sunday .

Barack Obama ’s long - awaited and much - hyped trip overseas , in large part intended to overcome a perception that he ’s not up to the job of commander - in - chief , seems to have come at the perfect time as recent events in Afghanistan , Iraq and Iran have played into his message .
Afghanistan , which Obama has long said should be the central front in the battle against Islamic extremism , returned to the front pages last week when militants breached a compound and killed nine U.S. soldiers , adding heft to reports over the last several months that the Taliban is resurgent there .

Burns , the third - ranking official in the State Department , to Switzerland this weekend for a formal meeting with Iranian officials and representatives from other countries about Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions .
The meeting was , the New York Times noted , “ the highest - level session between the countries during the Bush administration . ”
After being attacked for months by Republicans for his willingness to meet unconditionally with Iran , the State Department ’s negotiations amounted to political cover for Obama .
“ I welcome news that the Bush administration has shifted course and will send an envoy for direct talks , ” Obama crowed Wednesday .
But it ’s Iraq where Obama got perhaps his most significant bon voyage gift .
First , the White House and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki jointly announced Friday that they were in support of a “ general time horizon ” for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq , marking a break from the Bush administration ’s previous refusal to discuss a timeline .
Saturday , the German magazine der Spiegel published an interview with Maliki in which he was asked to predict when U.S. troops may leave Iraq .
He replied , “ As soon as possible , as far as we 're concerned . ”
“ U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months , ” Maliki said .
“ That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . ”
Ali al - Dabbagh , a spokesman for Maliki , later backpedaled , saying that any withdrawal would be done in concert with the U.S. government and in accordance with improved conditions on the ground .
Dabbagh also said the published comments had been " misunderstood and mistranslated ” but did n’t specifically point to any discrepancy .
Der Spiegel subsequently noted that the partial retraction came via the press desk of the U.S. forces in Iraq .
A Bush official said the administration did n’t think Maliki intended his comment to be interpreted the way it was and acknowledged that they helped prompt the clarification .
“ [ U.S. officials ] let the Iraqis know that it was being picked up widely , Iraqis issued a statement to make Maliki ’s position clear , ” said the official .
Maliki , though , had already made his position clear .
In a detailed Associated Press report that moved Sunday , Maliki is reported to have used the looming presidential election to put pressure on the Bush administration to reach a deal on withdrawal , telling his advisers , “ Let ’s squeeze them . ”
He ’s also put the squeeze on McCain , whose support for an open - ended U.S. troop presence in the country now seems to defy the wishes of the Iraqi government .
Democrats quickly jumped on the matter , reminding reporters that in 2004 the Arizona senator had said he’d be in favor of withdrawing troops were Iraqi leaders to ask them to leave .
“ Timing is not as important as whether we leave with victory and honor , which is of no apparent concern to Barack Obama , ” said foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann in a statement issued on Saturday night in response to Maliki ’s comments .
“ The fundamental truth remains that Senator McCain was right about the surge and Senator Obama was wrong .
We would not be in the position to discuss a responsible withdrawal today if Senator Obama ’s views had prevailed . "
But the Washington - Baghdad move to a “ general time horizon ” and Maliki ’s comments have plainly focused the Iraq debate on terms preferred by Obama , just as he is poised to touch down on Iraqi soil .
In an interview , Scheunemann dismissed the idea that events abroad had shifted the debate in ways that favor Obama .
He also said McCain stood be his 2004 remarks , and that “ if the sovereign Iraqi government wants our troops out , our troops will leave .
They have not said that . ”
Maliki ’s comments to der Spiegel were only “ inartful , ” Scheunemann said .
“ If they ’re going to go after inartful statements , we can have that debate , ” he quipped , noting Obama ’s past equivocations on such issues as the Washington , D.C. , gun ban and status of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel .
The Iron Plate in
the Great Pyramid

In 1837 , Colonel Howard Vyse , with the assistance of two civil engineers ( John Perring and James Mash ) , investigated the air shafts in the King 's Chamber of the Great Pyramid described by George Sandys more than 200 years earlier .
A man in Vyse 's team , J.R. Hill , was put in charge of clearing the mouth of the southern shaft .
Vyse 's methods were not subtle , and the use of explosives was employed resulting in the vertical gash that can still be seen on the south side of the pyramid .
On Friday , 26 May 1837 , after a few days of blasting and clearing , Hill discovered a flat iron plate about 26 cm ( 10.2 " ) long , 8.6 cm ( 3.4 " ) wide , with a thickness ranging from .4 cm ( .2 " ) to nearly zero .
The plate weighs about 750g .
Vyse proclaimed it to be " the oldest piece of wrought iron known . "
Hill affirmed that his find was legitimate :
This is to certify , that the piece of iron found by me near the mouth of the air - passage , in the southern side of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh , on Friday , May 26th , was taken out by me from an inner joint , after having removed by blasting the two outer tiers of the stones of the present surface of the Pyramid ; and that no joint or opening of any sort was connected with the above - mentioned joint , by which the iron could have been placed in it after the original building of the Pyramid .
I also shewed the exact point to Mr. Perring , on Saturday , June 24th .
( Vyse , Pyramids of Gizeh , I , p. 276 )
Perring , along with James Mash , were both " of the opinion that the iron must have been left in the joint during the building of the Pyramid , and that it could not have been inserted afterward . "
Vyse sent the artifact , along with the certifications of Hill , Perring , and Mash , to the British Museum .
What is one to make of the story ?
Hill was the only witness to the discovery of the plate ( on 26 May ) and the second " witness " appeared nearly a month later ( on 24 June ) .
Perring was actually not a witness at all , but had only the word of Hill about the details of the find .
Thus , despite the " certifications " of the others , Hill is the sole witness .
Most modern authorities believe that Hill either falsified his testimony , or , more likely , a bit of modern iron somehow made its way into the rubble , convincing Hill that it had been there all along .
Flinders Petrie wrote of the plate in The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh ( 1883 ) :
That sheet iron was employed , we know , from the fragment found by Howard Vyse in the masonry of the south air channel , and though some doubt has been thrown on the piece , merely from its rarity , yet the vouchers for it are very precise , and it has a cast of a nummulite on the rust of it , proving it to have been buried for ages beside a block of nummulitic limestone , and therefore to be certainly ancient .
No reasonable doubt can therefore exist about its being really a genuine piece used by the pyramid masons , and probably such pieces were required to prevent crowbars biting into the stones , and to ease the actions of the rollers .
( p. 212-13 )
( A nummulite is a large coin - shaped fossil foraminifer widely distributed in limestone formations . )
Petrie later recanted the view that the iron was contemporary with the pyramid ( Six Temples at Thebes , 1896 , p. 19 ) .
H.R.
Hall wrote of the plate in " Note on the Early Use of Iron in Egypt " ( Man 3 , 1903 ) :
Now that Professor Petrie has discovered iron in deposits of VIth Dynasty date at Abydos , the contentions of those Egyptologists who have always maintained that iron was known to the Egyptians from the earliest times must be acknowledged to be correct .
The fact that iron was known to , and used by , the Egyptians over 2,000 years before it came into use in Europe is very remarkable , and it is hard to square with current theories , but it is a fact .
Professor Petrie 's find is a lump of worked (? ) iron , perhaps a wedge , which is rusted on to a bent piece of copper ...
This is the third find of iron which can be attributed to the Old Kingdom .
In 1837 a fragment of wrought - iron was discovered in an inner joint of the stone blocks in one of the air - passages which pass upwards from the interior of the Great Pyramid to the outer air [ Vyse , Pyramids of Gizeh , I. , 276 ; Beck , Geschichte des Eisens , I. , 85 ] .
This is now in the British Museum , Egyptian Department , No. 2433 ( 3rd Egyptian Room , Case K , 29 ) .
In 1882 Professor Maspero found iron in the pyramid of a Vth Dynasty king at Abûsîr .
Professor Petrie has now found iron in a VIth Dynasty deposit at Abydos ...
The presumption now is that the iron fragments from Abûsîr and from the Great Pyramid are of a Vth and IVth Dynasty date respectively .
The Gîza fragment will be about 150 years older than the piece from Abydos . ( pp. 147-49 )
In a later article , " The Early Occurrence of Iron in Egypt " ( Man 5 , 1905 ) , Hall wrote :
Here are the facts .
We find in Egypt a piece of worked iron , to which a date of about 3500 B.C. is assigned on good primâ facie grounds , but because iron did not come into general use in Egypt till about 1300 B.C. , and in southern Europe till about 1100 B.C. , and because we do not possess another piece of iron of the same date , we admit that this early date must be regarded as still sub judice .
We need corroboration .
We afterwards find in Egypt a piece of iron , worked or unworked does not matter in the argument , which is assigned on incontestable grounds to a date of about 3200 B.C.
Does not the second find corroborate the first , and are we not justified in assuming that we have erred from excess of caution in denying that iron was not only known to , but occasionally worked by , the Egyptians in the fourth millenium B.C. ?
And as a matter of fact , as I have said , the probabilities are that the VI Dynasty fragment was originally worked , and not a mere meaningless lump .
Why should a mere lump be buried with tools ?
( p. 71 )
In his article " Iron in Egypt " ( JEA 18 , 1932 , pp. 3 - 15 ) G. A. Wainwright asserted that iron found in Egypt dating to before the New Kingdom was certain to have been of meteoric origin .
In " The Coming of Iron " ( Antiquity 10 , 1936 ) , the same author addressed the iron plate specifically :
In Egypt iron objects are extremely rare until the New Kingdom , and by no means common even then ...
The serious pieces are those of the Great Pyramid c. 2900 B.C. , the Abydos lump c. 2500 B.C. and the Nubian spearhead c. 1800 B.C.
Full analyses have not yet been made of the Pyramid and Abydos pieces , but those which have been showed ' traces ' of nickel [ Rickard in Man , 1927 , no. 56 ] .
This looks as if they were meteoric iron .
But if the ' traces ' should prove to be only a fraction of 1 per cent , as it sounds , the iron might have perhaps been smelted from ore [ Though very rare such are known to exist though not near Egypt .
Rickard , Man and Metals , II , 846 ] .
If so , this would have proved a difficulty hitherto , but such would now be disposed by he finding in Mesopotamia of the unquestionable piece of smelted iron of approximately the same date .
Unless we can know definitely that the Pyramid piece is of meteoric origin , and therefore not modern , the probability of Rickard 's suggestion is too attractive .
He thinks that it may have been a piece of the tool of one of Vyse 's own workmen engaged in the excavation [ Man and Metals , II , 833 , 834 ] , and one knows only too well how such things may slip down , get jammed , etc .
The antiquity of Petrie 's lump from Abydos has never been in doubt , but it is urgent that its origin also should be decided .
( pp. 8 , 9 )
The presence of nickel is one of the characteristics of meteoric iron .
The content of nickel can vary from 5 % to 26 % , though usually it is 7 - 8 % .
Nickel is rare in terrestrial iron ore , and even then it is found only in very minute traces .
In his article " Early Iron in Egypt " ( Antiquity 10 , 1936 ) , Christopher Hawkes offered a summary of the tests performed on the pyramid and Abydos pieces :
In his article on ' The Coming of Iron ' in Antiquity for March 1936 ( X , 5 - 24 ) , Mr G.A. Wainwright draws attention to the pieces of iron from the Great Pyramid ( IVth Dynasty ) and Abydos ( VIth Dynasty ) .
These should date respectively from c.2900 and c.2500 B.C. ( pp. 8 - 9 ) , and form the two major items in the serious evidence for the use of iron in Egypt before the New Kingdom .
His question is whether they are of terrestrial or meteoric origin , with the rider that if proved by analysis to be terrestrial their claim to be ancient ought to be most critically regarded .
Meteoric origin ( p. 7 ) will be proved by the presence of nickel , probably from 5 to 10 per cent . , for this is absent from iron smelted from terrestrial ore .
Both these pieces are in the British Museum .
Mr. Wainwright states ( p. 9 ) that ' full analyses have not yet been made ' of them , ' but those which have showed " traces " of nickel ; ' the authority he quotes being a letter written in 1927 to the Editor of Man by Dr. T.A. Rickard .
This letter ( Man , 1927 , 56 ) stresses the unlikelihood of any but a meteoric origin for early pieces of iron , and urges examination for nickel to prove this : it states that in fact both these pieces ' were tested recently , at my suggestion , for nickel , and traces of nickel were found , ' but expresses dissatisfaction with the experiment .
The tests were actually made in the British Museum Laboratory , and since it seems desirable that the matter should be cleared up , Dr. J.H. Plenderleith , who did the work , has kindly allowed me to see his notes and copies of his reports .
The Pyramid piece was found to consist ' of a thin film of metallic iron with a more or less thick coating of its oxides . '
Samples were examined and ' no nickel could be detected . '
This was in November 1926 ; in April 1932 it was examined again , and the results ' completely bear out the findings of the previous analytical report as regards to the absence of nickel ; ' separate tests were applied to the exterior scale and to the surface of the metallic iron itself , and nowhere could nickel be detected .
As Dr. Plenderleith was advised that ' all known meteoric iron contains some nickel , about 4 - 30 per cent , ' he considered it ' unnecessary to go any further in the matter of chemical investigation . '
The account of the result quoted from Man ( cf. also Dr. Rickard 's Man and Metals 1932 , II , 834 ) seems therefore to have mislead Mr Wainwright .
The pyramid piece contains no detectable ' traces ' of nickel . ( pp. 355-57 )
Likewise , no nickel was found in the core of the Abydos piece , " and it is only present in minute traces in the outer rust , among various other impurities , whose presence is evidently due to the porous nature of the material . "
Hawkes submitted copies of Plenderleith 's notes and reports to Cecil H. Desch of the National Physical Laboratory ( Desch had some years earlier written a report on the iron plate in Reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , 1928 ) .
He [ Desch ] has expressed his opinion , in a letter communicated to the writer , that the position is 'very clear , and it does not seem necessary to make further analyses ...
I have now obtained further specimens of early iron , which is certainly not meteoric , from sites in Mesopotamia and Syria , and it will be very interesting if it should prove that equally early specimens occur in Egypt .
As regards to the Pyramid specimen , the statement that it consists of only a thin film of iron with a layer of oxide outside seems to rule out the possibility of its being a modern tool which had fallen into a cavity , and it is very desirable that your note should be published . '
It seems , then , that these pieces may reasonably be taken as evidence for the occasional smelting of terrestrial iron -ores in the Near East as early as the third millennium B.C. ( p. 357 )
Once the fact had been established that the iron plate was made of wrought terrestrial iron rather than iron of meteoric origin , it was denied to be of an ancient age based solely on its composition .
Lucas and Harris , in their landmark reference Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries ( 1962 ) , expressed such an opinion :
Those who believe that iron tools must have been employed for early Egyptian work in hard stone attach considerable importance to a piece of iron found at the Great Pyramid of Giza , and see this as proof that iron tools were used in its construction , in support of which the reference in Herodotus to iron tools in connexion to the pyramid is quoted [ History II : 125 ] .
By far the greater part of the stone of the pyramid , however , is not hard and there would be no great difficulty in working it without iron tools , and the specimen of iron found is not a tool and does not appear to be part of a tool of any sort , and it is significant that the earliest iron objects are chiefly weapons and amulets and not tools .
( p. 236 )
The earliest iron objects known in Egypt , write Lucas and Harris , are nine predynastic tubular beads found by Wainwright at Gerzeh .
When found , they were completely oxidized .
Analysis showed that the metal was 7.5 % nickel and thus of meteoric origin .
The authors continue :
The next specimen in date order is that already referred to from the pyramid of Giza which was found in the stonework on the outside .
Although the statements of the finder ( Mr. J.R. Hill ) and others , who examined the spot at the time , are very definite and precise and not lightly to be disregarded , it seems more probable , since the iron has been proved not to be meteoric , that it is of recent date and that it had been lost down a crack in the stone facing of the pyramid when this was being removed for use as building material in modern times , long before Vyse 's work .
( p. 237 )
In 1989 , an analysis of the iron plate was made by El Sayed El Gayar and M.P. Jones , published in their article " Metallurgical investigation of an iron plate found in 1837 in the Great Pyramid at Gizeh , Egypt " ( Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society , Vol. 23 No. 2 , 1989 , pp. 75-83 ) .
El Gayar and Jones , using a hacksaw , carefully cut off a small corner of the plate for analysis .
This fragment was triangular in shape with an area of 1 cm and a weight of 1.7g .
After again determining that the iron contained " only a trace of nickel , " confirming a terrestrial origin ( p. 81 ) , the authors found that
the plate consists of numerous laminates of wrought iron and that these laminates have been inexpertly welded together by hammering .
The various layers differ from each other in their grain sizes , carbon contents , the nature of their non-metallic inclusions , and in their thicknesses ...
None of the iron layers contains siliceous , slaggy inclusions .
Furthermore , none of the other phases within the iron laminates shows any metallic copper globules , nor do they show more than small traces of the element copper .
These features suggest that the Gizeh iron plate had not been produced as a by - product of copper smelting operations .
The outer layers of the iron have been badly corroded and now exist as complex banded iron oxides .
Small , but significant , proportions of gold were found in one of the oxidised layers and it is thought possible that the plate may , originally , have been goldplated . [ p. 75 ]
It is interesting to note that the gold would have been of small value in comparison to that of the iron .
Numerous non-siliceous inclusions were found in the iron laminates , rich in sodium and potassium : probably ash formed by burning charcoal during smelting .
The authors continue ,
Furthermore , the presence of abundant inclusions of un-reduced ( or incompletely reduced ) fragments of iron oxides in the metal laminations shows that the " smelting " operations had been inexpertly carried out at low temperatures ( probably between 1000 º and 1100ºC and that the iron had been produced by the " direct reduction " method - in which no molten iron is normally produced ...
The quality of the forging operations used to weld the iron fragments together is often exceedingly poor and it is possible that the plate was produced by a very primitive and , in consequence , a very inefficient or inexperienced , ironsmith ...
It is concluded , on the basis of the present investigation , that the iron plate is very ancient .
Furthermore , the metallurgical evidence supports the archaeological evidence which suggests that the plate was incorporated within the Pyramid at the time that structure was being built . [ p. 82 ]

While the iron plate 's physical properties apparently argue in favor of its authenticity , its provenance argues against .
A more recent date is attractive mainly because the antiquity of the artifact would be out of place in the known metallurgical progress of ancient Egyptian technology .
Certain " fringe " authors make much of this opportunity , claiming the anachronism proves alien or Atlantean intervention in Egyptian industry , or , at the very least , that Egyptologists have underestimated exactly how advanced Egypt 's ancient civilization had become .
If the iron is of recent vintage ( see below ) , the point is moot .
But if it is as old as the Great Pyramid , what are the implications ?
Precisely where and when the smelting of iron originated is uncertain .
Making useful implements from iron ore is a fairly complicated procedure , requiring specialized fuel to maintain high temperatures , aided by a steady and controlled system of forced air ( such as produced by bellows ) , and heavy tools are necessary for working the red - hot metal .
Evidence of iron production dating to 2800 BC has been found in Mesopotamia ( Wainwright , " The Coming of Iron , " Antiquity 10 , 1936 , p. 7 ) .
Though iron manufacture may have spread from western Asia south through Africa , iron working in sub-Saharan Africa may have developed independently .
It would be likely that , if the iron plate is indeed proved to be ancient , it represents a trade good from the north , or possibly from the south .
The unlikelihood of Egyptian manufacture is supported by both its uniqueness and the absence of archaeological evidence for iron - making technology .
What function might the iron plate have served in association with the Great Pyramid ?
It is doubtful that might have been a part of a tool , nor is it similar to any known type of ceremonial implement .
Various authors have offered an explanation that makes some degree of sense .
The royal funerary Pyramid Text §907 reads :
The doors of bA - kA [ an unknown region of the sky ] which is in the firmament are opened for me , the doors of iron which are in the starry sky are thrown open for me , and I go through them ...
This , taken with the idea that the so - called " air passages " found in the pyramid are in fact meant to serve as egress for the king 's soul , might suggest that the iron plate served as a door of sorts at the terminal end of the shaft .
The plate was , after all , reported to have been found near the outer opening of the King 's Chamber southern " air passage . "
The discrepancy between the size of the plate ( 30.5 x 10 cm ) and the size of the opening of the shaft ( 30.5 x 23.3 cm ) may be explained by the plate 's obvious fragmentary nature .
The plate in its original form could easily have been a good fit .
A more recent analysis of the plate , however , has cast doubt on the findings and conclusions of the study by El Gayar and Jones .
In their article " Gizeh Iron Revisited " ( Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society , Vol. 27 No. 2 , 1993 , pp. 57-59 ) , Paul Craddock and Janet Lang of the British Museum reported that they were at first unable to obtain the section cut by El Gayar and Jones , consequently the initial study was confined to the larger portion of the plate .
A new section was cut adjacent to the original section , and it was examined under a scanning electron microscope both at the British Museum and independently at the Ancient Monuments Laboratory , English Heritage ( the work was carried out there by Dr. G. McDonnell ) .
It was also analyzed by x-ray fluorescence .
Surprisingly , no gold was detected in the metal or in the corrosion .
Craddock and Lang further wrote :
Since the last report the original section has been returned to the Museum and we have been able to carry out a thorough investigation .
Once again we must report that despite extensive searches no trace of gold could be detected , and it is our firm opinion that the original report of gold is incorrect . [ p. 57 ]
The authors agreed with El Gayar and Jones regarding the structure of the iron plate , but they did not agree on the interpretation .
The unusual features are the absence of slag stringers and the very large number of other inclusions .
These are unusual in that they contain large quantities of calcium ( up to 60 % ) , phosphorus ( up to 15 % ) , and some sodium , silicon and potassium .
A number of chlorine - rich areas were also found .
However , we do not agree with the view of El Gayar and Jones , that these inclusions indicate ancient primitive manufacture -- careless maybe , but not primitive . [ p. 57 -58 ]
They believe that the structure is unfamiliar because the iron plate is representative of the largely unstudied period of iron manufacture that falls between " traditional " solid state bloomery iron and " modern " iron and steel of the late 19th century .
The structure of the plate is consistent with iron - making in the post - medieval Islamic era .
Craddock and Lang conclude :
Gold was neither observed nor detected anywhere on the plate .
The composition and structure of the iron rules out any form of natural iron .
Similarly iron smelted in the solid state is precluded as some form of molten slag would be essential , which could only be eradicated by melting the iron .
A more mundane but tenable explanation of the observed features is that the iron ore was smelted to cast iron in a blast furnace , using charcoal as the fuel , resulting in a chemically much purer iron than smelted with coal or coke .
This iron was then decarburized by the finery process to form solid wrought iron .
The inclusions are likely to have originated either as deliberate additions during the fining , as specified in some European accounts , or inadvertently during the subsequent forging .
The blast furnace process does not seem to have reached the Middle East until the post - medieval period , and this strongly suggests that the plate of iron from the Great Pyramid is of no great antiquity .
[ p .
58 ]
It would seem , then , that the iron plate found by J.R.
Hill in 1837 is not contemporary with the construction of the pyramid , but rather dates to the post - medieval ( Islamic ) period sometime between the 16th and 18th centuries .
It would be a matter for speculation just how such a plate might have found its way down a joint between the pyramid stones , but after the Arab conquest there was much activity at the Giza pyramids .
Hill 's report that the iron " was taken out by me from an inner joint , after having removed by blasting the two outer tiers of the stones " and " that no joint or opening of any sort was connected with the above - mentioned joint " was made ex post facto , and one may well wonder how closely he examined the joints before blasting considering he had no idea that he might find something there .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether agency attorneys improperly deported Canadian Maher Arar to his native Syria , where he says he was tortured after he was detained at a U.S. airport due to his erroneous placement on a terrorist watch list .
Maher Arar listens to a question during a news conference in Ottawa January 26 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Chris Wattie
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said on Friday the investigation by its Office of Professional Responsibility began last year , following a report by the Department of Homeland Security ’s inspector general into the matter .
Arar ’s case has become a sore spot in U.S. - Canada relations .
Declassified portions of the report were not released until this week .
It found that U.S. authorities ignored Arar ’s fears of torture if he were sent to Syria .
It said immigration and Justice Department officials disregarded normal procedure , which would have been to send Arar back to Canada or to Switzerland , where his flight originated .
In addition , it found , the Immigration and Naturalization Service had concluded that Arar was entitled to protection from torture under international law and that “ returning him to Syria would more likely than not result in torture . ”
Yet it received only ambiguous assurances that he would be protected , and deported him anyway , the report said .
Homeland Security Inspector General Richard Skinner told Congress on Thursday that he was reopening his investigation into the incident and that Justice Department officials and attorneys may have acted illegally .
He said he could not rule out that the United States sent Arar to Syria because it wanted him interrogated under conditions that would violate U.S. law .
Arar was seized in late September 2002 by immigration officials at New York ’s Kennedy Airport while en route to Canada from a family visit to Tunisia .
He was sent to Jordan the next month , was taken into custody by Syrian officials , and released a year later saying he had been tortured .
The Canadian government has cleared Arar of any links to terrorist groups and apologized and paid him millions of dollars in compensation .
It said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had wrongly told U.S. border agents that Arar was suspected of being an extremist .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice last year acknowledged the United States had mishandled the case , but she stopped short of an apology .
“ We do absolutely not wish to transfer anyone to any place in which they might be tortured , ” Rice said at the time .
Google for Jakob Nielsen and you 'll often find him described as a " web design guru " .
He 's also the man that some web designers love to hate .
In particular , they love to heap abuse on his website - UseIt.com .
It 's a decade - old design and it would n't take much effort to make it look nicer , would it ?
More importantly , surely he ought to be following all his own guidelines on usability .
Nielsen is not a graphic designer , and he reckons that smartening it up would put him in the middle range of site designs : " I 'd be just one out of 10 m .
Redesigning it would take away the real value , which is that it stands out .
But I 'm probably the only one who could get away with it .
I would n't recommend it to somebody starting out now ! "
Although Use
It annoys the people who think web design is graphic design , Nielsen does n't mind .
" There is something good about upsetting people , because it 's making an impact , " he says .
But , he adds : " It 's not good if you only annoy people , " and you have to offer something of value .
' My site stands out '
Nielsen evaluates sites using principles described by Don Norman , his partner in the Nielsen Norman Group , in his book , Emotional Design ( see arts.theguardian.com ) .
The idea is that all designs work in three main ways : visceral , behavioural and reflective .
Use
It might upset people at the visceral level - if they immediately dislike the look of it - but Nielsen reckons it works well on the behavioural and reflective levels .
" On the behavioural level - in actual use - it scores pretty well , " Nielsen says .
It 's fast , has readable text , is fairly easy to use , and so on .
" On the reflective level - what does it say about you - my site stands out like a protest against the overly glamorous , flashy sites .
So it scores really high . "
Nielsen is careful to point out that he 's not making recommendations for all websites .
There 's no reason why people can't go mad on their MySpace pages , or create sites that are complex and challenging for , say , geeks or gamers .
But his main focus is on sites where people go to get something done , such as look up a timetable , buy a car or take out a loan .
He 's also very closely involved with intranets - in - house webs where companies provide things for staff , from news to forms for claiming expenses .
In these cases , even quite small usability improvements can bring enormous financial benefits , justifying high fees .
" Who are the users and what are they trying to do ? " Nielsen says .
" So what is a good interface for computer engineers is not a good interface for the average person .
A lot of computer guys do n't recognise that , and it creates problems . "
Nielsen 's approach is to test usability using one or preferably more real users .
Unlike the site 's designers and other company employees , real users do n't know what they 're supposed to do , and often wo n't take the time to find out .
" One of the main reasons companies need systematic usability studies is to make explicit the fact that outside customers do n't find your design as important as you do , " he writes in his latest column on Use it .
According to Nielsen Norman research , " users visiting a new site spend an average of 30 seconds on the homepage and less than two minutes on the entire site before deciding to abandon it .
They spend a bit more time if they decide to stay on a site , but still only four minutes on average . "
If they have to spend 15 of their 30 seconds figuring out which link to click on your home page , you 've probably lost them .
He says : " Thus , websites should have almost no features : focus on the words . "
Plenty of people make a living adding features with Adobe 's Flash and Sun 's Java , so you can add a few more to Nielsen 's piles of potential haters .
He added a few more recently by posting an article that upset some bloggers , including ex-Microsoft geek Robert Scoble .
In Write Articles , Not Blog Postings , Nielsen wrote : " To demonstrate world - class expertise , avoid quickly written , shallow postings .
Instead , invest your time in thorough , value - added content that attracts paying customers . " .
That 's the aim on Use It , where casual visitors can be converted into buying reports or attending conferences , and so on .
User loyalty
But Nielsen 's point is that short and generally superficial blog posts are a commodity , and it 's difficult to make yours any better than thousands of others .
It 's hard to build up any user loyalty that way .
" One longer post beats many small pieces given superficial treatment , which will essentially be free , so maybe you can get people to pay for it - maybe not in money , but in a registration , or whatever . "
He makes a similar point about short videos .
People can get an audience on YouTube , but by building up their own sites and " a loyal viewer base , they could actually make money out of T - shirts and DVDs and so on " he says .
" In the long run , how you get value from being online is that users become regulars .
If compiling other people 's work is how you get value , like YouTube does , that is n't good news . "
What worries him is search engine domination : Google " takes a big percentage of the money , " he says .
" The web is a web , and that is good , but companies invest a lot of money in creating content , and the money goes to Google for indexing it . "
Google drives lots of traffic to a great many sites , but it 's delivering " no-value users .
So they look at one article , but they never go there again , " Nielsen says .
But what could you do , boycott it ?
" That would only work if everybody did it .
You would have to get all of them to agree , and that 's essentially impossible .
So we have to do something else , and it has to be something that encourages user buy - in and creates loyalty . "
Looking forward five years or more , Nielsen thinks sites should try to get themselves in users ' " need to know " category rather than " nice to know " .
It 's a fair bet that , in another decade , Use It will still be in the " need to know " category , at least for web designers who are interested in usability .
Whether it will look nice is another matter .
I would n't bet on it .

McCain does n't rule out preemptive war Reuters
Published : Thursday April 10 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Republican U.S. presidential candidate John McCain said on Wednesday he would not rule out launching preemptive wars against future enemies .
President George W. Bush , in launching his 2003 invasion of Iraq , said it was necessary to forestall possible future attacks from a country that was developing weapons of mass destruction .
None of the weapons he alleged were in Iraq were subsequently found .
McCain , who has wrapped up his party 's nomination to run for the White House in the November election , has maintained support for Iraq war and has said frequently that he would rather lose an election than a war .
When asked at a town hall meeting about the Bush policy on preemption , McCain said : " I do n't think you can make a blanket statement about preemptive war because obviously it depends on the threat that the United States of America faces . "
After the Sept. 11 attacks Bush approved a new national security strategy in 2002 that allowed the United States to strike first against U.S. enemies believed to be about to use weapons of mass destruction against America .
The doctrine triggered a wide debate and criticism from the administration 's critics at the time .
In an October 2002 speech , Bush made the case for invading Iraq , saying : " Facing clear evidence of peril , we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud . "
McCain said the U.S. president should consult more closely with members of Congress so that the branches of government could act together if a threat were imminent .
" In normal times as you see a looming threat ... I think you need to consult more closely and more carefully not with every member of Congress but certainly the leaders of Congress . "
You may find that you have been spending too much in the supermarket .
It will be a good idea if you can save money while shopping in the supermarket .
In fact , there are ways to help you to avoid spending too much .
The followings are some tips for you .
Try your best to avoid impulse buying .
This is usually the main reason for spending too much in the supermarket .
You should only purchase what you really need .
And never buy something if you do not need it .
You have to try to make a list of items before you go shopping .
Pre -plan shopping can actually help you a lot in terms of saving money .
You should only buy what you have planned to buy .
This is the way to avoid impulse buying since you will only buy the thing you really need .
You have to keep reminding yourself that you should only purchase according to the list .
No matter how attractive an item is , you should never buy it if it is not on the list .
You need to train yourself to follow this rule .
You should also try to eat before you shop .
Experience shows that if you have a full meal before you shop .
You will not be tempted to buy the snacks .
On the contrary , if you feel empty when you are shopping , you will be very inclined to put some cookies , chocolates or even ice - cream in the basket .

Sometimes you can get a better price if you purchase in bulk .
For example , you may get a discount if you buy 30 cans of coke at a time .
If you really need coke from time to time , you should buy it in bulk .
You will be surprised by the amount you can save each month if you can have the habit to buy in bulk .
On the other hand , you should never buy in bulk if you only need an item once only .
You are wasting your money if you buy more than you need .
You should also buy the items when they are on sale .
There can be a huge discount when the items are on sale .
Remember , a can of soft - drink will still be the same can even if you buy it with a discount .
Of course you should pay extra attention to the expiry date when you purchase these items .

New York ’s Jada Yuan was at the James Beard Awards last night to check in with Bobby Flay , Drew Nieporent , Danny Meyer , David Chang , and the other gastro - luminaries who came to Lincoln Center , and she put together a culinary - world Party Lines slideshow that has a little something for everyone .
But her interview with Tom Colicchio was so good that we thought it worthy of printing in its entirety .
After - party plans ?
I ’m going home .
No , I ’m going to Gramercy Tavern to congratulate the team there , and then I ’m going home .
What happened to the Chang mobile ?
You know , David asked me to go on the Chang mobile and it was too much for me .
What happens on the Chang bus ?
I have no idea , and even if I did , I would be sworn to secrecy .
Journalists are just not invited to the Chang mobile .
Is the Chang mobile a one - time thing , or does David always have a party bus ?
I think it ’s this one night only .
David does not have a permanent party bus as far as I know .
But I go home when I ’m done cooking .
I ’m not young like those guys .
I ca n’t do what they do anymore .
I work , I go home .
Does a faux - hawk make you a better chef ?
I do n’t think it ’s like a Samson thing , where your faux - hawk gives you strength .
In fact , I do n’t think anyone who ’s had a faux - hawk has won .
What about Hung ?
I would not classify that as a faux - hawk .
So do shaved heads make you a better chef ?
That ’s just great .
Men with shaved heads are always better .
Just ask my wife .
[ To wife Lori Silverbush ]
Are n’t shaved heads great ?
Silverbush : Much easier on the thighs .
Colicchio : [ blushing and laughing hysterically ]
That was off the record !

Alaskan state officials have recently announced their intentions to begin funding the exploration and surveying of Alaska ’s largest volcanoes in hopes of utilizing these as a source of geothermal energy which they say could provide enough energy to power thousands of households .
According to some estimates these volcanoes and hot springs could supply up to 25 % of the state ’s energy needs .
Could this be the beginning of an alternative energy revolution ?
Mount Spurr , Alaska
( Credit : United States Geological Survey )
Officials are already set to begin auctioning off exploration rights – the first volcano to be tapped for geothermal power is Mount Spurr , a 3.4 - km tall snowcapped stratovolcano in the Aleutian Volcanic Arc of Alaska .
Another volcano considered for exploration is the Augustine stratovolcano , which resides near Anchorage and reaches 1.3 km in height .
One of two vents of Mount Spurr , called Crater Peak , has erupted twice in the past century , the latest eruption occurring as recently as 1992 and leading to falls of volcanic ash stretching as far as the Municipality of Anchorage , 130 km to the east .
In 2004 the Alaska Volcano Observatory ( AVO ) issued an eruption warning concerning Mt. Spurr due to an increased number of earthquakes detected beneath its surface which could indicate activity preceding an eruption .
Currently AVO rates Mt. Spurr as Level of Concern Code Green , which indicates that the volcano is in its normal , non-eruptive state .
However , many experts have expressed safety concerns in regards to working with such a volatile geothermal source , however great the potential gain may be .
As the power companies prepare to turn the immense heat that simmers beneath the volcanoes ’ surfaces and hot springs in Alaska into electric power , about a dozen other states with highly potential geothermal lands are looking into possible utilization of these resources on their own territory .
Experts state that if fully exploited nationwide , geothermal resources could supply about a quarter of the entire US population power needs .
“ High prices and climate change are definitely creating a renaissance in geothermal interest , particularly on a state and local level ” – says Karl Gawell , executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association , adding that the projects currently underway are merely the “ tip of the iceberg . ”
“ If we really want to go all out for it , we could easily achieve a substantial amount ; 20 , 25 per cent of US energy needs within a few decades .
We ’re limited more by public policy than the resource – the resource is enormous . ”
According to recent findings , there are about 200 million acres of land in the US with geothermal potential but Gawell says he believes 80 percent of such land is yet “ unsuspected ” , since it does n’t bear the typical features scientists look for when exploring an area for geothermal activity .

When it comes to harnessing geothermal energy , scientists face a number of considerable challenges .
One geologic drawback is the fact that the heat sources in the mentioned Alaskan volcanoes lie deep inside thick layers of earth , which makes them especially difficult to tap .
Novel designs are necessary for such missions in order to even get the exploratory system started on a grand scale .
With all the difficulties geothermal energy generation entails , there is a bright star on the horizon – a unique resort at Chena Hot Springs in Alaska which is entirely powered by hot springs .
TFOT has previously published an extensive overview of a unique open - source engineering project which aims to create a new power plant design that will use a combination of solar and geothermal energy for use in more distant locations without polluting the environment .
We have also covered a number of innovative alternative energy solutions , among them the recently unveiled highly bendable “ dye - sensitized ” solar cells , which were developed at the A*STAR Institute of Microelectronics in Singapore .
As well covered is a novel technology developed by MIT scientists , who have succeeded in improving the power output of a certain type of fuel cell by more than 50 percent .

I think it ’s very important for the consumer .
I just want to make sure that accurate information is passed on .

The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday a first draft of a rule that will govern the geologic sequestration of heat - trapping carbon dioxide from power plants .
Geologic sequestration of global warming gases , also known as “ carbon capture and sequestration ” ( CCS ) , is viewed by some as a critical component of a climate change policy portfolio .
According to the EPA , the annual cost associated with the implementation of the rule are estimated to be around $ 15 million .
“ Today ’s proposal paves the way for technologies that would protect public health and help reduce the effects of climate change , ” said EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson .
“ With proper site selection and management , geologic sequestration could play a major role in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . ”
EPA ’s proposed regulation creates a national framework for the injection of carbon dioxide underground and protection of underground drinking water resources .
The agency acted under the Clean Water Act because injecting carbon dioxide could push pollutants into underground drinking water supplies , according to Benjamin H. Grumbles , assistant EPA administrator for water .
The rule would create a new class of injection wells under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act ’s Underground Injection Control ( UIC ) program .
According to an EPA Factsheet ( EPA 816 - F - 08-031 ) , the new monitoring rule is needed because :
“ The relative buoyancy of CO2 , its corrosivity in the presence of water , the potential presence of impurities in captured CO2 , its mobility within subsurface formations , and large injection volumes anticipated at full scale deployment warrant specific requirements tailored to this new practice . ”
The rule , which would apply to well owners and operators , would require monitoring to trace the chemical , squeezed down into liquid form .
“ A cornerstone of this rule is that the carbon dioxide stays where it is put , and not leak or be released to the surface , ” Mr. Grumbles said .
EPA is requesting public comments on the proposed rule for 120 days .

Oil at $ 150 ?
Very likely and could be soon .
How about $ 170 , or even $ 200 ?
That is possible before the end of this year .
There are those who see the price of a barrel of oil hitting $ 300 and even $ 500 in the next few years .
Impossible you say , well just remember that last year a barrel of crude was selling at $ 70 and even then the markets were complaining that it was already too high .
The oil conundrum is playing havoc with local , regional and international markets .
The producers say it ’s not their fault and consumers blame speculators and a battered dollar .
Others point to the current crisis between the West and Iran , which in recent days moved from rhetorical ranting to sabre - rattling .
There is confusion , fear , mistrust and greed in the oil business today , but what else is new ?
Oil has been a central pillar of international politics and trade for decades , and the West has traditionally played dirty games when it came to preserving the life - line of its economy and civilization .
Cheap oil enabled Western societies to flourish and expand , the United States being the most notorious example .
Wars were waged , coups staged and regimes toppled in order to maintain control of production , exploration rights , distribution and price .
It is unlikely that the rules of the game have changed in recent years , but it is now a fact that the new economies of China , India , Russia and others are competing ever more with the West for a bigger share of available oil .
Economic displacement is a matter of time , with studies predicting that China will unseat the US as the biggest world economy in 30 to 40 years if not before .
Read
This is probably why China is now eyeing Africa as the next source of new oil finds and is investing tens of millions of dollars in Sudan Chad , Nigeria , Angola , Algeria , Gabon , and Equatorial Guinea .
According to US energy sources the Chinese now account for more than 40 per cent of total growth in global demand for oil and have replaced Japan as the world ’s second largest oil importer , after the United States .
It is not all speculation that is driving energy prices to new territories , although President George W. Bush and a number of prominent experts would disagree .
Try conspiracy and behind - the - scenes power struggle between the United States and China .
The US economy is officially in recession and is unlikely to recover for years .
Meanwhile , China , along with India and other emerging economies , are trying to prevent their markets from overheating .
But investments are still pouring in and the shift will continue to move from the north to the south .
But expensive oil is hurting the US economy as much as emerging ones .
That is true , but with trillions of dollars – generated over the years by trade surplus – in the coffers of China , Russia and India , these countries may have a better chance at weathering the current storm .
The question then is who is twisting the other ’s arm ?
In this game of finger biting China and others may be the ones who will be left standing by the end of the day .
According to Charles Biderman in a recently published article in Forbes , what is happening now could spell a financial disaster for the US .
He writes that at present levels the US consumes 21 million barrels of oil per day .
“ At $ 135 per barrel , the US spends $ 1 trillion per year on oil , which is equal to 15 per cent of the $ 6.8 trillion in take - home pay of everyone who pays taxes .
If oil prices rose to $ 200 per barrel , the US would spend $ 1.5 trillion per year on oil , which would be equal to 22 per cent of take - home pay .
In other words , the US will be broke long before oil prices hit $ 200 per barrel , and the rest of the world would be sure to follow . ”
But if this is the case then why ca n’t governments work together to chase away speculators who are driving energy prices through the roof ?
There are few indicators that consumers and producers are doing just that .
The US insists that the crisis will go away if senior Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) members , such as Saudi Arabia , increase production .
In fact the Saudis did just that recently , but prices continued to soar .
There are other reasons behind the unchecked rise of oil prices besides speculation .
One is the weak dollar and another is the ailing state of the US economy where investors have given up on stock markets and embraced commodity futures .
It is a strange situation that we find ourselves in today ; ample supplies of oil , slow growth at global levels and yet soaring energy prices .
Opec has rebuffed calls to increase production citing mismanaged US economy as one cause for current speculative run .
But with the recent tension in the Gulf over a possible Israeli strike against Iran , speculators have another good reason to push prices north .
In all it seems that bad US policies have contributed to the dire state that the world finds itself in today .
If the US wanted to derail the Chinese economy by “ allowing ” prices to rise to these dangerous levels , they have failed to achieve their goals .
If they thought that applying pressure on producers would force them to increase production , they have failed to do that as well .
Meanwhile , the US economy is hurting and whether the Americans know who is behind the crisis or not , they certainly have done all the wrong steps to contain it .
Police say UFO was just the Moon
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Police called out to a 999 call about an unexplained object in the night sky solved the mystery straight away for their operator - " it 's the Moon , over . "
But the emergency call meant the officers were sent out to a house in the valleys area of south Wales .
They were told a " bright stationary object " was spotted above the unnamed caller 's home .
A recording of the call has been released as part of a police campaign asking people to use 999 appropriately .
The Control Room conversation , which took place in May , was recorded - and below is a transcript : Control Room : " South Wales Police , what 's your emergency ? "
Caller : " It 's not really .
I just need to inform you that across the mountain there 's a bright stationary object . "
Control room : " Right . "
Caller : " If you 've got a couple of minutes perhaps you could find out what it is ?
It 's been there at least half an hour and it 's still there . "
Control : " It 's been there for half an hour .
Right .
Is it actually on the mountain or in the sky ? "
Caller : " It 's in the air . "
Control : " I will send someone up there now to check it out . "
Caller : " OK . "
The mystery was soon solved , as the exchange between control and an officer at the scene , makes clear .
Control : " Alpha Zulu 20 , this object in the sky , did anyone have a look at it ? "
Officer : " Yes , it 's the moon .
Over . "
Control room staff also dealt with a stream of unsuitable calls on the 999 number during an " extremely busy period " , said a spokesman .
Another caller rang asking for help when they wanted to vote for Rhydian on the TV programme X - Factor .
' Real emergencies '
Another wanted a pound for their supermarket trolley .
Following the calls , South Wales Police has changed the way it answers the phone .
Instead of saying " South Wales Police , how can I help ? " , control room staff now say " South Wales Police what is your emergency ? "
Since the change , they have reported a 10 % drop in 999 calls .
Superintendent Kevin O'Neill said : " There is no doubt in my mind that the public have taken on board the message we sent about making inappropriate 999 calls and thought twice about dialling the number in a non-emergency situation for which we are extremely grateful .
" Thanks to the public we have been able to answer calls , concerning real emergencies , quicker , " said Supt O'Neill .
Between January and June 2008 , the force answered 86.4 % of calls within 10 seconds compared to 76.2 % in the same period last year - an improvement of just over 10 % .
The change in the greeting is being monitored by Cardiff University researchers Professor Martin Innes of the Universities Police Science Institute and Dr Frances Rock of the Centre for Language and Communication .

What are these ?
C'est une décision qui pourrait faire jurisprudence et redonner le sourire à des centaines de milliers de conducteurs verbalisés pour s'être affranchis du paiement de leur stationnement .
Le 30 mai dernier , un juge de Versailles a relaxé une automobiliste contrevenante poursuivie pour le non-paiement d'une trentaine de PV de stationnement à Montigny - le - Bretonneux , dans les Yvelines , révèle vendredi .
Motif de la relaxe : en assurant la défense d'une de leur adhérente , l'association 40 millions d'automobilistes a démontré que les poursuites pour non-affichage du ticket d'horodateur étaient illégales .
L'association a donc trouvé la faille juridique .
" Dans un État de droit , seul un texte fonde les poursuites et détermine les peines , explique Rémy Josseaume , président de la commission juridique de 40 millions d'automobilistes , .
En l'espèce aucun texte du Code de la route , aucun article du code pénal et aucun arrêté municipal en France n'impose à un automobiliste d'afficher son ticket d'horodateur " .
Et d'enfoncer le clou en ajoutant :
" On doit régler le stationnement là où il est payant , mais le fait de ne pas afficher son ticket n'est pas une preuve du non-paiement (...)
Il y a de multiples raisons pour lesquelles le ticket peut ne pas être visible .
Il peut être tombé , l'automobiliste peut l'avoir oublié dans sa poche , la contractuelle peut ne pas le voir alors qu'il y est " Avec ce jugement , les contrevenants verbalisés sur le motif du non-affichage du ticket d'horodateur ( sept millions de contraventions sont dressées chaque année ) vont pouvoir échapper à leur amende .
Il leur suffira , " assisté ou non d'un avocat lors de l'audience , de demander au juge de constater l'absence de texte leur imposant l'obligation pour laquelle ils sont poursuivis .
La décision du juge ne pourra ê tre que la relaxe . "
Face à ce vide juridique , l'administration n'aura pas d'autre choix que de modifier les modes de poursuite et les textes .

VIRGINIA SHERWOOD / NBC NEWSWIRE VIA AP IMAGES Ad Policy
In a year bursting with memorable moments in televised political punditry , the first may have come on January 8 , when MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow explained one of the quick - spreading theories behind Hillary Clinton ’s victory in New Hampshire , a surprise win that had knocked many of Maddow ’s on - air colleagues on their asses .
“ You want to know who they ’re blaming for women voters breaking for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama ? ” a delighted Maddow asked co-panelist Pat Buchanan and host Chris Matthews , her eyes flashing .
“ They ’re blaming Chris Matthews !
People are citing specifically Chris … not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton . ”
Matthews sputtered dismissively , but Maddow was n’t done yet .
“ People feel the media is piling on Hillary Clinton , ” she said , “ and they ’re coming to her defense with their votes . ”
For Matthews , who ’d been enjoying near rapturous pleasure over the presumptive early - season thumping of his personal hobgoblin , there could not have been worse news than that his own commentary might have paved the way for Clinton ’s triumph .
Yet here was just this headline , delivered by Maddow , looking like Sylvester the Cat , practically licking yellow feathers from the corners of her mouth .
“ I did n’t mean it in a mean way at all , ” says Maddow over breakfast on a summer day many months and many MSNBC promotions away from that indelible January night .
“ But I knew that it was just going to blow his mind . ”
Matthews is far from the first talking head to get this treatment .
Long before this primary season , clips of Maddow , an Air America host often invited on cable news shows as a ballsy gremlin of the left , zipped around the Internet .
Her specialty was making Tucker Carlson ’s head explode , or getting under Buchanan ’s skin until all he could do was gibber at her about socialism .
But presidential election cycles provide the hot klieg lights under which character actors mature into media leading ladies , and at 35 , with fewer than five years of national broadcast experience under her belt , Rachel Maddow is the explosive star of the season .
She ’s gone from being a popular guest analyst on MSNBC to an exclusive commentator to a regular guest host for the network ’s prize pig , Countdown With Keith Olbermann .
Now there is increasing clang and clamor over the possibility that she will get her own show on MSNBC .
What ’s remarkable about Maddow ’s ascension is not its velocity –Hurricane Katrina made Anderson Cooper in less than a week–but the shifts in media it may demarcate .
Maddow is one of the few left - liberal women to bust open the world of TV punditry , which has made icons of right - wing commentators like Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin .
Unlike her beautiful , bilious conservative female counterparts or the cocksure boys - on - the - bus analysts , however , Maddow did n’t get here by bluster and bravado but with a combination of crisp thinking and galumphing good cheer .
Remarkably , this season ’s discovery is n’t a glossy matinee idol or a smooth - talking partisan hack but a PhD Rhodes scholar lesbian policy wonk who started as a prison AIDS activist .
All of which raises a crucial question : does Maddow ’s unlikely success , reliant on her ability to defy cliché and categorization at every turn , signal a move in punditry away from the thuggish and the angry and toward the lucid and sophisticated ?
Or has her powerful charisma and canny career management allowed her to break the rules –without actually breaking a mold ?
When we meet , Maddow is halfway through an eight - night stand filling in for a vacationing Olbermann on Countdown , and she is vibrating with energy from the previous evening .
She believes she has three distinct responsibilities when subbing : not messing anything up for the show ’s permanent stewards , keeping Olbermann ’s ratings high and just being Rachel Maddow .
“ Trying to do it as if I ’m Keith is n’t the best way to go , ” she explains .
Maddow fulfilled all three responsibilities in her July stint , showcasing her obvious facility with the medium while putting her own stamp on the program .
Nonetheless , she still dwells on her anxieties about the mechanics of hosting –when to look at the camera , when to turn to the script–which she says Olbermann has tutored her on .
“ It ’s like rocket science , honestly , ” she says .
“ And I feel like I ’ve got a learning curve that ’s like the Matterhorn !
Holy mackerel ! ”
Of course , Olbermann recently told the Kansas City Star that his protégée mastered the technical stuff in about ten minutes , and that on the first night she stepped in for him , she did n’t make a single teleprompter mistake , while he averages four or five a night .
But Maddow ’s signature mixture of self - deprecation and gusto , her holy mackerel - ness , is as good a place as any to start thinking about her singular success .
Everything about her radiates competence and a deft , bright careerism .
She wants to succeed , makes no bones about campaigning for her own television show and yet evinces a regular - person charm and self - doubt that ensures you ’ll never mistake her ambition for bloodthirst or bullying .
Unlike her Air America founding classmates Janeane Garofalo and Al Franken , Maddow is not a professional comedian .
Still , it ’s clear that she finds many of the characters lumbering across the tableau of American politics a total hoot .
She finds her own story pretty hilarious , too .
Asked if her television career is the culmination of a plotted path , Maddow laughs .
“ You mean when I started working on AIDS in prisons , was this where I thought it would end up ?
Yeah .
This is pretty much it .
Phase forty - seven of my master plan . ”
Maddow grew up in the Bay Area ; she came out just before college in 1990 and became an AIDS activist at the epicenter of the epidemic .
She earned a degree in public policy from Stanford before beginning work with ACT UP and the AIDS Legal Referral Panel .
But Maddow had trouble breaking into treatment activism , which was then the rock - star world of AIDS policy .
“ It was boys ’ land , ” she says .
“ I knew like two women total who were doing treatment activism .
And I did n’t totally get it .
I ’m not like Barbie– ‘ Math is hard !’– but it was a techie world , and I did n’t feel like I could be all that helpful . ”
What she discovered instead was the nexus of the radical prison reform movement of the ’70s and modern AIDS activism .
It was an area where Maddow felt progress–like allowing secure hospices to take dying prisoners –was possible .
“ Dying behind bars ? ” she says fourteen years later .
“ Wicked expensive .
And wicked stupid .
And also mean .
So let ’s make the hospices get what they want and also do the right thing ! ”
In 1995 Maddow traveled as a Rhodes scholar to Oxford , where she began a doctorate in political science , focusing on the intersection of the AIDS and prison movements .
She moved back to the United States to finish her dissertation , crashing with friends in Western Massachusetts .
“ I wanted to live somewhere where I ’d be unhappy , ” she explains .
“ And I have no interest in New England , hate winter , do n’t like the country , not fond of animals . ”
More than a decade later , Maddow still divides her time between her home in Northampton , Massachusetts , and an apartment in Greenwich Village , both of which she shares with her girlfriend , artist Susan Mikula .
The couple have been together for almost ten years , and Maddow calls their relationship “ my proudest accomplishment . ”
After defending her dissertation , Maddow picked up work on AIDS in prison again , as well as a series of odd jobs , from cleaning buckets at a coffee bean factory to being a handyman who did n’t know how to fix anything .
As part of her patchwork career , she attended an open audition to replace the “ news girl ” at the local radio station .
She got the job and took a shine to the airwaves .
When Air America launched in 2004 , Maddow lobbied the network to bring her aboard .
It did , hiring her to co-host Unfiltered with Chuck D and Lizz Winstead .
When the show was canceled a year later , Maddow got her own two - hour weekday slot .
“ They had no business hiring me , ” Maddow says of the flier Air America took on her .
“ As it turned out , it worked out for them .
I mean , I hope it did .
I hope they ’re happy ! ”
Maddow is one of the only original Air Americans to be left standing after the company ’s rocky four - and - a - half - year history , and her mainstream success is an unqualified victory for the network .
If she got plucked away by grabby television hands , it would be a tough loss .
“ We view her as a homegrown talent , ” says Air America chairman Charles Kireker , who has run the network since February .
“ We hope and expect to have her continue hosting a radio show on Air America for a long time . ”
In an e-mail , Maddow confirms her desire to host both a TV and a radio program : “ If O’Reilly , Hannity and Beck can do that , so can I . ” Still , Kireker has reason to be nervous .
Calling from the Netroots convention in Austin , he ’d just come from a panel during which mention of a still - imaginary Maddow TV show prompted an eruption of applause .
“ We ’ve seen the potential for greatness in Rachel for years , ” says Kireker .
“ What ’s so remarkable is that now it ’s coming so quickly .
This election cycle has propelled it forward in a meteoric fashion . ”
No kidding .
Love is too weak a word to describe how some people feel about Rachel Maddow .
They lurve her , loave her , luff her .
New York magazine ’s online Intelligencer column recently ran an item headlined Why We ’re Gay for Rachel Maddow , and the blogosphere is dotted with posts like “ I ’m totally gay for Rachel Maddow . ”
The “ gay for Rachel ” meme appears to transcend gender and sexuality .
Women , men , straight and not straight : they ’re all gay for her .
In a year in which we have decided to become postracial and postgender , Maddow may embody a media in which adoring fandom is postgay .
That ’s appropriate , since part of the hypnotic hold Maddow has on her audience is that while she is one of the first fully forged stars of the “ liberal media , ” her commentary is , in a funny way , also postpartisan .
During an incendiary primary season , Maddow maintained an almost maddening equilibrium , expressing dismay and appreciation for just about every candidate .
She was very hard on Clinton ; her face still hardens when she talks about the 3 am red phone ad , which she calls “ an abomination , ” and Clinton ’s war vote , which she says is “ unforgivable . ”
But Maddow also finds herself “ frequently underwhelmed ” by Obama .
“ He got it right in opposing the war , ” she says , “ but his war policy stuff now is bullshit .
It ’s total bullshit , and I ’ve never been impressed by it .
One or two brigades a month ?
You want your son to be in the last brigade ? ”
Contrary to widely held opinion , Maddow did not endorse a candidate in the primary .
“ I have never and still do n’t think of myself as an Obama supporter , either professionally or actually , ” says Maddow , adding that she feels “ liberated by having a professional role in which it ’s probably better for me not to take sides . ”
“ She is a civics geek , ” says Vanessa Silverton - Peel , executive producer of The Rachel Maddow Show .
“ She wants to talk about AIDS in prison and the Constitution and the war in Iraq .
Policy is her main focus .
Not winning elections . ”
On radio , Maddow starts every day with war news .
She focuses hard on policy and on the politics of the absurd .
“ I ’m fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run Poland , ” she says , as well as inflation in Zimbabwe ( “ How many bails of hundred - dollar bills does it take to buy bread today in Zimbabwe ? ” ) .
She ’s obsessed with the Iraqi national soccer team , librarians and cocktail mixology ; she once said that she ’d like to “ professionally bully people about what they drink . ”
Then there are her specialties : foreign policy , the GI Bill , veterans groups .
“ That ’s the most satisfying thing about being able to do my own story selection , ” she says .
“ You get to pick that stuff .
And whoever is President or in control in Congress is not going to affect that . ”
It ’s ironic that Maddow , perhaps Air America ’s most successful product , has traveled through the looking glass of partisan journalism and come out the other side an electoral agnostic , a liberal in the purest , almost mineral sense of the word .
She loves the country , loves the Constitution and loves what is moving about politics .
A worldview shaped by these concerns , one that maintains a well - manicured distance from electoral Sturm und Drang , could be a powerful asset for Maddow and the rest of the left - leaning media , an inoculation against future tune - out should they get their wish–an Obama administration that could rob them of their fury - fueled audiences .
Maddow , who has not owned a TV since 1990 , tries to limit her exposure to online and print criticism of herself .
If and when she lands her own berth , and with it a nightly viewership unused to seeing a brainy lesbian with rock - solid expertise on military policy or the IAVA , that will become more difficult .
She already bristles slightly when talking about how she gets all the girl questions .
“ I love the idea that I am the voice of woman , ” she says , gesturing at her T - shirt , baggy jeans and Red Sox cap .
“ Look at me .
It ’s like : really ?
The one woman in the room is really mannish . ”
In real life , as advertised on her website , Maddow dresses “ like a first - grader ” and hypothesizes that her mild androgyny might have greased her infiltration of boyworld punditry .
“ I look like a dude , ” she says .
Of course , for her television gigs , Maddow gets coiffed and painted and dressed up in what she calls “ lady clothes ” to fit a more traditional bill , a process she says she used to “ resist and get angsty about , ” but to which she has now surrendered .
When I ask whether some of her signature habits –the fascination with the evil twin Polish dictators , the obsession with the nuts and bolts of foreign policy –will go the way of her chunky glasses and naked lips , she balks .
“ The only reason I get these opportunities is because of my sensibility , ” she says .
“ I ’m not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language .
What they ’re after is the thing you ’re saying I have to trade off . ”
She continues , “ My instinct sometimes is to trade it off .
Like , ‘ Oh , I ’m in the big leagues now so I better dial it back .
But they do n’t want it dialed back .
They are booking me or asking me to host because they like what they see . ”
Our civilization is fast approaching a tipping point .
Humans will need to make the transition from nonrenewable fossil fuels as the primary source of our energy to renewable energy sources that will allow us to flourish into the future .
Failure to make that transformation will doom us to the endless political machinations and economic conflicts that have plagued civilization for the last half - millennium .
We need new technologies to be sure , but without evolved political and economic systems , we can not become what we must .
And what is that ?
A Type 1 civilization .
Let me explain .
In a 1964 article on searching for extraterrestrial civilizations , the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev suggested using radio telescopes to detect energy signals from other solar systems in which there might be civilizations of three levels of advancement :
Type 1 can harness all of the energy of its home planet ;
Type 2 can harvest all of the power of its sun ; and Type 3 can master the energy from its entire galaxy .
Based on our energy efficiency at the time , in 1973 the astronomer Carl Sagan estimated that Earth represented a Type 0.7 civilization on a Type 0 to Type 1 scale .
( More current assessments put us at 0.72 . )
As the Kardashevian scale is logarithmic -- where any increase in power consumption requires a huge leap in power production -- we have a ways before 1.0 .

Fossil fuels wo n’t get us there .
Renewable sources such as solar , wind and geothermal are a good start , and coupled to nuclear power could eventually get us to Type 1 .
Yet the hurdles are not solely -- or even primarily -- technological ones .
We have a proven track record of achieving remarkable scientific solutions to survival problems -- as long as there is the political will and economic opportunities that allow the solutions to flourish .
In other words , we need a Type 1 polity and economy , along with the technology , in order to become a Type 1 civilization .
We are close .
If we use the Kardashevian scale to plot humankind ’s progress , it shows how far we ’ve come in the long history of our species from Type 0 , and it leads us to see what a Type 1 civilization might be like :
Type 0.1 : Fluid groups of hominids living in Africa .
Technology consists of primitive stone tools .
Intra -group conflicts are resolved through dominance hierarchy , and between - group violence is common .
Advertisement
Type 0.2 : Bands of roaming hunter - gatherers that form kinship groups , with a mostly horizontal political system and egalitarian economy .
Type 0.3 : Tribes of individuals linked through kinship but with a more settled and agrarian lifestyle .
The beginnings of a political hierarchy and a primitive economic division of labor .
Type 0.4 : Chiefdoms consisting of a coalition of tribes into a single hierarchical political unit with a dominant leader at the top , and with the beginnings of significant economic inequalities and a division of labor in which lower - class members produce food and other products consumed by non-producing upper - class members .
Type 0.5 : The state as a political coalition with jurisdiction over a well - defined geographical territory and its corresponding inhabitants , with a mercantile economy that seeks a favorable balance of trade in a win- lose game against other states .
Advertisement
Type 0.6 : Empires extend their control over peoples who are not culturally , ethnically or geographically within their normal jurisdiction , with a goal of economic dominance over rival empires .
Type 0.7 : Democracies that divide power over several institutions , which are run by elected officials voted for by some citizens .
The beginnings of a market economy .
Type 0.8 : Liberal democracies that give the vote to all citizens .
Markets that begin to embrace a nonzero , win - win economic game through free trade with other states .
Type 0.9 : Democratic capitalism , the blending of liberal democracy and free markets , now spreading across the globe through democratic movements in developing nations and broad trading blocs such as the European Union .
Advertisement
Type 1.0 : Globalism that includes worldwide wireless Internet access , with all knowledge digitized and available to everyone .
A completely global economy with free markets in which anyone can trade with anyone else without interference from states or governments .
A planet where all states are democracies in which everyone has the franchise .
The forces at work that could prevent us from making the great leap forward to a Type 1 civilization are primarily political and economic .
The resistance by nondemocratic states to turning power over to the people is considerable , especially in theocracies whose leaders would prefer we all revert to Type 0.4 chiefdoms .
The opposition toward a global economy is substantial , even in the industrialized West , where economic tribalism still dominates the thinking of most politicians , intellectuals and citizens .
For thousands of years , we have existed in a zero - sum tribal world in which a gain for one tribe , state or nation meant a loss for another tribe , state or nation -- and our political and economic systems have been designed for use in that win-lose world .
But we have the opportunity to live in a win-win world and become a Type 1 civilization by spreading liberal democracy and free trade , in which the scientific and technological benefits will flourish .
I am optimistic because in the evolutionist ’s deep time and the historian ’s long view , the trend lines toward achieving Type 1 status tick inexorably upward .
That is change we can believe in .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's bombshell plan to slash the pay of state workers and lay off thousands of other employees to ease a looming cash shortage brought on by the state 's budget impasse faces the same obstacle that arose five years ago during a state fiscal crisis : a state controller unwilling to cooperate .
While the governor is poised to order the cuts on Monday , state Controller John Chiang , who is responsible for disbursing state workers ' paychecks , said Thursday that he will refuse to go along with the governor , setting up a political standoff and a possible legal fight .
" The authority to issue people 's paychecks is mine .
I have both constitutional and statutory authority , " said Chiang , a Democrat .
" Frankly , ( the governor ) is just trying to make me do something that 's improper and illegal . "
But the Republican administration maintained that Schwarzenegger has the legal right to invoke such a controversial plan , under which the pay of about 200,000 state workers would be reduced to the federal minimum wage of $ 6.55 an hour .
Once a new budget is passed , the workers ' pay would be restored along with back wages .
" We are on firm legal standing , " said Aaron McLear , a spokesman for the governor .
" But if ( the controller ) wants to challenge the state Constitution and a state Supreme Court decision , he has the right to do that . "
The dispute over state employee wages is a replay of 2003 , when the state Supreme Court issued a precedent - setting ruling during a budget impasse on the watch of Gov. Gray Davis that left some questions unanswered .
In a unanimous decision stemming from a 1998 lawsuit by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association , the court said state workers who are paid by the hour and do n't work overtime in a particular pay period are legally entitled only to the federal minimum wage if the state enters a new fiscal year without a budget .
But the 2003 court decision did n't resolve the argument raised by the state controller at the time , Steve Westly - reiterated Thursday by Chiang - that the controller 's office has the authority to continue paying all state employees in full even without a budget because of a series of obstacles to temporarily reducing their wages .
Westly continued paying the employees in full until Davis signed the new budget on Aug. 2 of that year .
Besides cutting workers ' pay , Schwarzenegger 's proposal would lay off nearly 22,000 temporary , seasonal and student workers .
He also wants to stop all overtime pay and impose a hiring freeze .
Lisa Paige , a spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger , said agency secretaries are reviewing how their workers would be affected , adding that the governor 's plan wo n't jeopardize critical areas of state government .
At the heart of the governor 's proposal is the ongoing budget impasse , which has resulted in California beginning a new fiscal year on July 1 without a spending plan in place .
Schwarzenegger and lawmakers in the Democratic - controlled Legislature have not agreed on how to close a $ 17.2 billion budget gap , which would include $ 2 billion in cash reserves .
To make matters worse , the state may face a cash shortage by September if a budget is not in place , which is one of the reasons Schwarzenegger wants to push legislative leaders into quickly finding a budget compromise .
But the governor 's order also underscores his desire to push the Legislature to approve his budget reform ideas - and his plan to borrow against future lottery revenue to help solve California 's budget woes - for the November ballot .
In a letter to Schwarzenegger on Wednesday , Secretary of State Debra Bowen said the deadline for new measures to be placed on the supplemental ballot for the November general election is Aug. 16 .
Schwarzenegger 's budget proposal includes borrowing against future state lottery sales and reforms such as a large rainy - day fund , a spending cap based on previous decades ' revenues and automatic mid-year spending cuts that the governor could invoke by declaring a fiscal crisis .
All four plans would require voter approval .
Republicans have demanded budget reforms of their own that include a rainy - day fund and limits on spending .
Democrats , meanwhile , have been less enthused about such ideas and have proposed a nearly $ 10 billion tax package to help solve the budget deficit .
" I understand what the governor wants and why he wants it in terms of the rainy - day fund , and I 'm not opposed to that , " said state Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D - Oakland , who has scheduled a Senate floor session on Tuesday to vote on the budget .
" But we 're not going to give away the responsibilities of the Legislature to make appropriations . "
While there is no deal in sight , Perata said Thursday that the budget he will put up for a vote will include a rainy - day fund , taxes and cuts in spending .
But Perata also criticized the governor for his plans for state worker pay cuts and layoffs , adding that such proposals do n't help during tough budget negotiations .
" I find it perplexing .
It 's gratuitous , " he said .
" If you 're trying to bring people together , this is not the way to do it . "
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) , called Schwarzenegger 's plans draconian and vowed to work with Chiang in his decision not to reduce state workers ' pay .
But Republicans argued that the governor 's proposals are unfortunate realities for a state whose spending has been out of control .
" The state is running out of money .
That is no bluff .
That is mathematical fact , " said state Sen .
Tom McClintock , R - Thousand Oaks ( Ventura County ) .
" I wish ( the governor ) sounded this alarm a year or two years ago .
If we had addressed this earlier , we would n't be in this mess . "
Assemblyman Chuck DeVore , R - Irvine , agreed .
" We 've run out of options .
This is clearly inevitable .
It 's the unfortunate consequence of all these years of overspending and the system is finally grinding to a halt because it 's unsustainable . "
Somewhere in Cheshire is a seriously melancholy thief .
The gravestone of Ian Curtis has been stolen from the Macclesfield cemetery where the former Joy Division singer is buried .
The not - quite - graverobber made off with the memorial some time between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning .
Police are appealing for anyone with information on its whereabouts to come forward .
Curtis committed suicide in May 1980 , hanging himself in his kitchen just before Joy Division were due to tour the United States .
He was 23 .
His gravestone is inscribed " Ian Curtis , 18 - 5 - 80 " , with the words " Love Will Tear Us Apart " .
" There is no CCTV in the area and there are no apparent leads as to who is responsible for the theft , " a police spokesman said .
" This is a very unusual theft and I am confident that someone locally will have knowledge about who is responsible or where the memorial stone is at present . "
There has been a resurgence of interest in the late singer after last year 's Curtis biopic , Control , and a new Joy Division documentary that was released this spring .
It remains to be seen whether the gravestone thief sought a movie memento , a poor - taste Cheshire souvenir or just a morbid piece of living - room furniture .
Hopefully , he 's sitting in his flat somewhere , staring at the engraved stone , feeling an abject gloom over what he 's done .

Lately , I ’ve been working on my Christmas shopping list , trying to get ( way ) ahead of the curve .
I have a lot of great ideas in mind for the people around me , but I know that unless I ’m diligent , the gifts will either wind up being too expensive or will simply slip through my fingers .
Add to that the fact that there ’s usually an item or two that I ’m looking for on heavy discount , and it ’s unsurprising that I often spend my time eyeing flyers and other places for huge markdowns on specific items .
Until recently , I ’ve been doing the drudgework of visiting Amazon on a daily basis to check for some of these items .
But , after doing a bit of careful thinking and some clever hacking , I ’ve found an easy way to get Amazon to automatically report those deals to me .
Here ’s the trick in its step - by - step glory .
Step 1 : Get the Feed !
Amazon has a feature called Gold Box , where they collect a bunch of hugely discounted items from across their site each day .
The deals are a mixed bag of stuff – one might be a software sale , another might be a watch , another one might be glass tumblers , and so on .
The point of the page is to attract people who are “ bargain ” hunters – the people who will buy anything provided it has a pretty good discount .
It also entices people who are actual bargain hunters in the hopes that once they have an item or two in their cart , they ’ll add a few more items .
Plus , there ’s the “ temptation ” folks – the people who randomly find the page and buy something they really do n’t need .
Add it all together and you get a lot of additional sales ( and happy customers ) for Amazon .
The only problem is that if you ’re living cheap , this is just a giant temptation to spend money you should n’t .
If only there were a way to filter all these deals just for the relevant ones …
There is .
Amazon makes the vast majority of these deals available via their Gold Box RSS feed .
It ’s basically a single page view of most of the available Gold Box deals , all on one page :
http://rssfeeds.s3.amazonaws.com/goldbox
This makes it convenient to stop at one page for a giant list .
Or if you have a feed reader , you can subscribe to that feed to get the deals .
But that ’s just the start of it .
Step 2 : Filter the Feed !
Now , head over to FeedSifter.com , a brilliant little tool if I ’ve ever seen one .
It lets you put in a RSS feed URL ( like the one above ) , then filter it for any list of terms you put in , then gives you an output feed that contains only the items that match the terms you listed .
Let ’s see this in play .
Let ’s say I ’m trying to find a couple of older games for my Wii on a huge discount , plus I ’m looking for a cheap Nintendo DS or Playstation Portable for Christmas gifts for my nieces and nephews .
While I ’m at it , I ’m also interested in any bargain cookbooks they might put up , plus any grocery deals or deals related to my Mac computer .
I ’d fill out Feed Sifter like this :
A quick note : search terms fewer than three characters match everything , so use ones longer than that .
The actual list I ’m using is much longer than this one – I ’d share it with you , but I ’m worried I ’d reveal a good chunk of the Christmas gifts I ’m looking for .
Anyway , when you click on the “ Filter my Feed ” button , you ’ll get an option to subscribe to that new feed .
Click on that and you ’ll find that the Amazon feed is now filtered for those search terms .
For my list , I found that it had only left one item – and I actually went ahead and purchased that single item , as a Christmas gift !
Hooray – one down , a big bundle to go !
Step 3 : Remember the Filtered Feed !
Obviously , with most of these sales having an extremely limited time frame , you ’ll need to check it regularly .
Since many people have Google as their home page , it ’s very easy to integrate this filtered Amazon sales search right into the home page on their browser .
Just pop over to http://www.google.com/ig and click on the “ Add stuff ” link over on the right hand side of the page …
… then click on the “ Add feed or gadget ” link on the right .
Then , paste in the URL of the feed you created in step two .
Wham !
Your filtered feed is now on your Google homepage .
Whenever you fire up your browser and visit Google , you ’ll see a list of the sales over at Amazon that match the terms you put in .
Click on the link to an interesting one , and you ’ll go right over to Amazon .
Whenever you want to create a new search , just follow all these steps again – easy as pie .
Bonus tip :
If you ’ve found your item and are ready to check out , but have found yourself a few dollars short of getting free Super Saver Shipping ( Wait !
Add $ 4.32 to your order to qualify for FREE Super Saver Shipping ) , use FillerItem.com to find a cheap item to just barely push you over the top .
I used to regularly get a pack of AA batteries here , but since moving to rechargeables , I often usually get a “ stocking stuffer ” type item and hold onto it for later .
This technique has saved me quite a bit of money on gifts I intended to purchase anyway with almost no effort after the initial setup .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury moved to freeze assets on Thursday of four Algerians it said were leaders of an al Qaeda - affiliated group responsible for deadly bombings in Algeria last month .
The Treasury said in a statement that the men -- Salah Gasmi , Yahia Djouadi , Ahmed Deghdegh , and Abid Hammadou -- are leaders of al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb , which has claimed responsibility for attacks in Algeria .
Two bombs exploded at a railway station east of Algiers on June 8 , killing 12 people including a French national and eight Algerian soldiers .
The Treasury said the attack was among three bombings carried out by the group in early June .
“ The four terrorists we have targeted today are among the most culpable for this violence as leaders of al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb , ” said Adam Szubin , head of the Treasury ’s sanctions arm , the Office of Foreign Assets Control .
“ We are proud to support the efforts of Algeria and the world community to combat this deadly threat and we will continue to do so , ” Szubin said .
The men blacklisted by the Treasury were put on a U.N. list of individuals associated with Osama bin Laden and the Taliban on July 3 .
The Treasury ’s move bans Americans from doing business with them and seeks to freeze any assets they might have under U.S. jurisdiction .
The news came as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki visited the UAE The United Arab Emirates has cancelled the entire debt owed to it by Iraq - a sum of almost $ 7bn ( £ 3.5 bn ) including interest and arrears .
The Gulf state also appointed a new ambassador to Iraq , in a move which eases Baghdad 's diplomatic isolation .
The news was announced during a visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
Correspondents say Iraq 's Sunni Arab neighbours have been wary of fostering ties with Iraq 's mainly Shia government because of its links with Iran .
Last month , the UAE 's foreign minister became the highest - ranking official from an Arab nation to visit Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The US has been pushing its Arab allies to send ambassadors to Iraq to bolster Mr Maliki 's government .
Soon after Mr Maliki arrived on his two - day visit , the UAE named its former envoy to India , Abdullah al - Shehi , as its new ambassador to Baghdad .
Better relations
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says the debt cancellation is a welcome move for Iraq .
Like other Sunni Arab states , the UAE had downgraded its representation in Baghdad , in part because of the security situation - a number of Arab diplomats had been kidnapped or killed .
That downgrading also reflected unease that the Iraqi government seemed to be dominated by Shiites and Kurds , who are minorities in the wider Arab world , our correspondent says .
But the recent Iraqi government crack - down on Shia militias , especially the Mehdi Army of Moqtada Sadr , has impressed Iraqi Sunnis , and their sympathisers beyond the borders , he says .
This means the Baghdad government believes it is a good moment to push for better relations with the Arab states , our correspondent adds .
Royal visit Mr Maliki used a UN forum on Iraq , held in May , to call for debt cancellation , mainly from Arab nations .
Iraq 's debt has been reduced by about $ 66.5 bn over the past three years , not taking into account Sunday 's announcement by the UAE , according to the US state department .
Of that , the Paris Club of 19 developed countries cancelled some $ 43.2 bn .
Iraq 's foreign debts currently total up to $ 80bn , Reuters news agency says , with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait among the biggest creditors .
In another sign that its diplomatic isolation may be easing , the Iraqi government has said it expects a visit soon from Jordan 's King Abdullah .
He would be the first Arab head of state to visit Iraq since the 2003 invasion .

Pfc. Joe Dwyer carried a young Iraqi boy who was injured during a heavy battle between the U.S. Army ’s 7th Cavalry Regiment and Iraqi forces near the village of Al Faysaliyah , Iraq , on March 25 , 2003 .
Dwyer died of an apparent overdose at his home in North Carolina on June 29 , 2008 .
The March 2003 image became one of the most iconic of the U.S. invasion of Iraq : that of a bespectacled American soldier carrying an Iraqi child to safety .
The photograph of Army Pfc. Joseph Dwyer , who was raised in Mount Sinai , was used by news outlets around the world .
After being lionized by many as the human face of the U.S. effort to rebuild a troubled Iraq , Dwyer brought the battlefield home with him , often grappling violently with delusions that he was being hunted by Iraqi killers .
His internal terror got so bad that , in 2005 , he shot up his El Paso , Texas , apartment and held police at bay for three hours with a 9 - mm handgun , believing Iraqis were trying to get in .
Last month , on June 28 , police in Pinehurst , N.C. , who responded to Dwyer ’s home , said the 31 - year - old collapsed and died after abusing a computer cleaner aerosol .
Dwyer had moved to North Carolina after living in Texas .
Dwyer , who joined the Army two days after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and who was assigned to a unit of the 3rd Infantry Division that one officer called “ the tip of the tip of the spear ” in the first days of the U.S. invasion , had since then battled depression , sleeplessness and other anxieties that military doctors eventually attributed to post - traumatic stress disorder .
The war that made him a hero at 26 haunted him to the last moments of his life .

BAGHDAD , April 3 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. ambassador to Baghdad said on Thursday he was caught off guard when a big battle broke out between Iraqi forces and militias in Basra last week , saying U.S. troops were only able to give support after fighting began .
Ryan Crocker , just days away from delivering key testimony to the U.S. Congress on Iraq , sought to paint a positive picture of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's crackdown on Shi'ite militias that many analysts say highlighted the weakness of Iraq 's army .
Iraq 's defence minister has said his forces were not ready for such fierce resistance from the Mehdi Army militia of populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr in the southern city .
The Interior Ministry has said 210 people were killed in Basra during a week of fighting .
The operation sparked clashes in other towns across southern Iraq and in Baghdad .
At a briefing with foreign journalists before leaving for Washington on Friday , Crocker was asked about how much he knew of the operation in advance .
" I had the understanding this was going to be an effort to kind of get down , show they were serious with additional forces , put the squeeze on , develop a full picture of conditions and then act accordingly , " Crocker said .
" I was not expecting frankly a major battle from day one .
But then again it 's not clear to me that they 'd decided that 's what they were going to do .
The enemy has a vote in combat . "
The scale of the fighting -- U.S. and British forces had to launch air and artillery strikes to support Iraqi troops -- comes at an awkward time for Crocker and U.S. commander General David Petraeus who will also testify to Congress on April 8 - 9 .
Both men are likely to face questions from opposition Democrats about the ability of Iraq 's forces to function with less U.S. military support as American troop levels decline .
Petraeus is expected to recommend a pause in withdrawals when an initial 20,000 troops depart Iraq by July .
That will leave around U.S. 140,000 soldiers in the country .
Asked at a separate news conference about the apparent lack of notice given to the Americans , Maliki said : " We told them frankly these are purely Iraqi operations and this is the way that other operations will be in the future . "
" BOATLOAD OF PROBLEMS "
Crocker avoided being drawn on how last week 's fighting might affect his testimony next week .
He rejected suggestions Maliki went into Basra hastily , saying he was impressed the prime minister acted " decisively " .
" Were there a lot of problems ?
There were a boatload of problems and there is still a long way to go , " Crocker said when asked about the capability of Iraq 's security forces in light of the operation .
" It 's true that as far as support we were able to give , we kind of had to put that together after the battle was joined . "
But Crocker said Iraq 's forces were able to plan and execute the operation and make adjustments when they ran into trouble .
Sadr on Sunday pulled back from all - out confrontation , ordering his militia to stop fighting but to ignore Maliki 's order to surrender heavy weapons .
A fragile calm has since held .
The young cleric backed Maliki 's rise to power in 2006 but split with the prime minister a year ago , partly over Maliki 's refusal to set a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces .
Crocker said the Basra violence did not " erase the significant progress " in security over recent months , but added : " Gains are fragile .
This episode demonstrates it . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Jalapeno peppers are a new focus of the investigation into the salmonella outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in at least 40 states , according to media reports .
Government health investigators had initially focused on some types of fresh tomatoes , which have been removed from menus across the country , but are turning toward jalapenos as sicknesses continue .
Salsa ingredients cilantro and Serrano peppers are also under scrutiny , according to reports .
" Recently , many clusters of illnesses have been identified in Texas and other states among persons who ate at restaurants , " according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statement .
" These clusters have led us to broaden the investigation to be sure that it encompasses food items that are commonly consumed with tomatoes . "
As of Friday evening , 943 persons infected with salmonella Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint have been identified in 40 states , the District of Columbia , and Canada , according to CDC .
Illnesses are believed to have begun in early April .
CNN reported that the U.S. investigation is focusing on imports from Mexico , and that starting Monday inspectors will stop shipments of produce for common Mexican cuisine ingredients .
So far Texas is by far the leader in reported illnesses , with 356 reports of ill people as of late Friday .
New Mexico has 98 reported illnesses , while Illinois has 93 .
Government investigators have been looking for the source of the salmonella outbreak for weeks -- a frustrating experience that highlights the need for more resources dedicated to improved food - safety science .
Last month , the FDA 's food - safety plan came under intense criticism from the Government Accountability Office , which voiced concerns about its direction and resources .
The FDA , which is responsible for overseeing about 80 % of the food supply , recently issued an update on a food - protection plan , and said it is working to identify best practices for traceability , and will hire at least another 130 employees to conduct food field exams , inspections and sample collections .

We loveand .
The wonderfully talented character actors are best remembered for Rhea 's feisty portrayal of waitress Carla on Cheers and DeVito 's brilliant performances as Louie De Palma in Taxi .
Both received multiple Emmy's for their roles in the hugely popular television sitcoms .
The couple live in Beverly Hills and have three adult children .
They are active in the Democratic Party and DeVito co-owns a restaurant DeVito South Beach in Miami .
The successful pair are known for their business savvy and have remained viable in the Hollywood community long after their big hit roles have ended .
Surrounded by glitz , they feel no compulsion to jump on that glam bandwagon .
DeVito made news in November 2006 when he appeared on ABC morning talk show The View in what appeared to be a very inebriated condition .
He blamed it on actor George Clooney and the shots of Limoncello that they drank the night before his television appearance .
Shortly thereafter , the enterprising DeVito marketed his own brand of the liqueur .

CQ ’s Presidential Support studies try to determine how often a legislator votes in line with the President ’s position :
CQ tries to determine what the president personally , as distinct from other administration officials , does and does not want in the way of legislative action .
This is done by analyzing his messages to Congress , news conference remarks and other public statements and documents .
So , these studies only track votes when the President has an explicit , stated opinion on a bill .
According to CQ , Senator John McCain has voted with President Bush 100 % of the time in 2008 and 95 % of the time in 2007 : Read on ...
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged Congress Tuesday to approve the Bush administration 's plan to back up mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Speaking in New York the day before the House is expected to take up the proposal , Paulson said it 's crucial that the companies have access to the capital they need to maintain their operations and regain the public 's confidence .
" Their continued activity is central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction and remove the underlying uncertainty in our financial markets and financial institutions , " Paulson said .
" Now , more than ever , we need Fannie and Freddie out there , financing mortgages , " he added .
" That means we must , in the short term , take steps to boost confidence in the [ companies ] , while also taking steps to address the potential systemic risk they pose . "
The recovery , however , will take time , Paulson said .
" We have been experiencing more bumps recently , and until the housing market stabilizes further we should expect some continued stresses in our financial markets , " he said .
" Working through the current turmoil will take additional time , as markets and financial institutions continue to reassess risk and reprice securities across a number of asset classes and sectors . "
The administration on July 13 unveiled a plan to inject untold billions of dollars into Fannie and Freddie by temporarily increasing their line of credit with Treasury and allowing Paulson 's agency to buy stock in the mortgage giants .
The secretary has stressed that the two may never need to draw upon the funds , but that the proposal should calm the roiling markets by making it clear the government stands behind the companies .
The plan could cost the federal government $ 25 billion over fiscal years 2009 and 2010 , according to a report released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office .
It noted the cost could vary widely depending on the extent of the bailout , if any is needed at all .
Paulson also wants Congress to endorse the creation of a new regulator for Fannie and Freddie , which would keep a closer eye on the companies ' operations .
The Federal Reserve should have a consulting role in setting capital requirements and other standards , he said .
Fannie and Freddie investors had mixed reactions to the speech and CBO report .
Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) closed down about 5 % and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) finished up 11 % .
Central players in mortgage market
Freddie and Fannie are critical to the revival of the United States housing market .
The two provide much - needed funding for banks and lenders , who can no longer turn to investors to buy pools of mortgage loans .
Freddie has already indicated it might have to reduce its purchases of home loans , which would make it even more difficult and expensive for Americans to obtain mortgages .
Set up by Congress to encourage homeownership but spun off as private companies owned by shareholders , Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion in home loans .
This is about half the mortgages in the United States .
Responding to a question about how the taxpayer would be protected if the government has to bail out the companies , Paulson said Congress should not put restrictions on Treasury 's rescue plan because greater flexibility engenders greater support in the capital markets .
" It minimizes the likelihood they 'll be used , " he said , referring to the bailout measures .
Paulson 's speech comes as Congress is poised to vote on the housing rescue plan .
The House is expected to take up the proposal on Wednesday .
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , and others have said they are concerned about giving the Treasury department a blank check to bail out Fannie and Freddie .
Tuesday 's speech comes a day after Paulson spent time with Wall Street chief executives discussing the current economic situation .
He also took a weekend tour of the talk show circuit , appearing on CNN and CBS on Sunday to drum up support for the plan .
Looking beyond the current turmoil , Paulson said Wall Street needs to consider a more significant overhaul of the financial market operations and the regulation of the industry .
That way , problems at one institution - be it a mortgage finance company , a hedge fund or a brokerage firm such as Bear Stearns - does n't threaten to upend the entire sector .
" Looking beyond today 's market challenges , we need to get to a point where large , complex financial institutions are not perceived to be too big or too interconnected to fail , " he said .
Last week ’s JK Rowling / Warner Brothers versus RDR Books trial made me very uncomfortable .
On one hand , I completely support an author ’s right to protect copyright .
It ’s time this nation ( world , really ) learned serious lessons about copyright — what it is , how it ’s applied , fair use ( yes , kids , fair use is part of copyright ) .
But there ’s something , well , chilling about how this case has played out .
And , as a fan , I ’m particularly bothered by this case because , well , there has to be a better way to deal with your readers than suing them .
Especially after you ’ve blessed the website and admittedly used it as a resource .
It ’s really absurd to belittle the efforts of said fan while tacitly admitting that you — the author — do n’t have the same level of information readily available .
At the heart of the suit are issues related to fair use , derivative works , and copyright infringement .
Rowling , over the course of eight books , created a complex world filled with new concepts , new language , detailed history , and a host of characters .
A website , reportedly endorsed by Rowling , created a sort of lexicon of the Potter world .
The creators of the lexicon then decided to release the work in print format .
Rowling was n’t at all happy .
Rowling is famously protective of her copyright , to the point that her zealousness has backfired .
As Kirk Biglione noted in his “ Tools of Change ” presentation ( download PDF ) , Rowling ’s refusal to release an ebook version of the “ Harry Potter ” series due to fear of piracy ( among other reasons ) lead to , you guessed it ! , increased piracy without a single legal alternative for consumers .
Demand existed for the ebook — small demand , sure , but demand — yet only the pirates met it .
Rowling says this suit is n’t about money , but it is .
I do not believe it stems from greed on her part , but the heart and soul is about who profits from the Potter world ( and it ’s clear that the parties with the most financial interest are the author and Warner Brothers — not , you ’ll note , either Bloomsbury or Scholastic ) .
Once it was perceived that there might be money made of this derivative work , then the worries began .
JK Rowling , for all her innovative thinking , has an issue with the Internet , that much is clear .
She might use it , but she does n’t get it .
eBooks are one issue , but it ’s clear to me that she considered the lexicon created by Steven Vander Ark to be just fine as long as it remained online .
Once he ported it to ( printed ) book format , things got sticky .
Was it the idea that books are sold in stores and make money ?
Would she have been as litigious if he ’d made a bundle via Google AdSense on his website ( did he sell ads , one too lazy to check wonders ) .
So it ’s okay for Rowling to benefit from the obsessive of a fan , but not okay for the fan to benefit as well ?
It ’s a bit selfish , is n’t it , to support the efforts of your fans while they funnel money to you but to disregard their time and energy when it seems they might earn a little back ?
Over and over and over again , I see the publishing industry asking readers to give without , well , giving back in return .
I digress .
Rowling has stated that , at some point in time , she plans to write her own encyclopedia / lexicon .
You know , a little something to tie the whole thing together .
The when and if of this project are unscheduled , but you can bet your sweet bippie that Rowling ’s book will skyrocket up the charts .
Not only will she be able to bring intimate depth to the entire Potter oeuvre , but she ’ll also present the material in her own voice .
There is no way that the RDR Books lexicon will cannibalize Rowling ’s sales ( if there are indeed any sales by Rowling as those sales are dependent on the creation of a book that is still in the “ thinking about ” phase ) .
To suggest this might be the case is no less than a classic red herring .
Readers are hungry for more Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling .
The brilliant Jeff Gomez draws a similar conclusion :
True , itâ€™s a different story when someone is using your exact words , repackaging them for their own profit .
But if whatâ€™s being written about is instead your world , then thatâ€™s not only fair game ( and fair use ) , but itâ€™s good thing and not a bad thing .
In Rowlingâ€™s case , her books are going to sell no matter what .
But if sheâ€™s allowed to succeed in stopping RDR , think about all of the books about books ( not to mention books about movies and plays and music ) that wonâ€™t get written as a result .
Bands could protest books being written about their songs , and directors could claim infringement when books about their movies appear .
Part of the pleasure , and indeed the understanding , of art comes from putting it into context and perspective â€ ” not to mention just plain celebrating it â€ ” but if Rowling has her way nothing would exist but the works themselves .
Gomez hits the point square on : if derivative works are subject to approval of copyright owners , that leads to a chilling effect on criticism .
The RDR lexicon provides a perspective on Rowling ’s books that , while she might disagree , reflects particular reading and understanding of the text .
And , I believe , given the cultural impact of this series , it ’s not unreasonable to anticipate other analysis , cataloguing , discussion — that ’s what great books do .
They inspire readers to build upon and explore the literary landscape .
Rowling should be flattered and honored that her work created the kind of passion that went into this project .
If this were truly about copyright infringement , I ’d feel sympathetic to Rowling ’s cause ( the weird thing being that so little of the coverage indicates the level of actual copyright theft happening here ) .
But she ’s made it clear that this is n’t just about copyright — it ’s about control .
Rowling wants to control the conversation about her work .
She lost that right a long time ago .
There ’s a point where she has to come to terms with the fact that it ’s time to let go .
Jeff Gomez compares this to sending your children out into the grown - up world .
You hope they fare well , hope you did a good job , wonder about who they will influence .
Rowling can continue to offer her wisdom and insight .
Do I think this could have been handled better ?
Absolutely .
Suing your fans is rarely a good public relations move .
With the U.S. Supreme Court peering over its shoulder and Congress turning up the political heat , the Bush administration is moving toward some sort of action on the climate - changing greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
But what administration officials see as responsible deliberation – seeking public comment later this spring before acting under the federal Clean Air Act – critics charge is foot - dragging .
Rep. Ed Markey ( D ) of Massachusetts , chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , calls it " running out the clock " before the next president takes over in 10 months .
Not so , says Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Ste­phen Johnson .
Mr. Johnson 's reason for going more slowly is that dealing with CO2 needs to be seen in a broader context : not just motor vehicles ( which account for about 30 percent of the US total ) , but also such stationary sources as power plants , oil refineries , and cement and other manufacturers .
In a letter to lawmakers quoted by the Associated Press he wrote :
" Rather than rushing to judgment on a single issue this approach allows us to examine all the potential effects of a decision with the benefit of the public 's insight . "
Johnson has supporters among industry groups and conservative analysts .
The Edison Electric Institute , which represents big utilities , said it 's glad the EPA realizes the broad potential of carbon regulation .
Reuters reported :
" ' It 's appropriate that the EPA fully understands the consequences of using the Clean Air Act tool to address greenhouse gases , ' said John Kinsman , the group 's senior director for the environment .
US utilities generally favor a legislative fix to carbon dioxide emissions rather than a regulatory one , which could be challenged and delayed by lawsuits . "
Heritage Foundation energy and environment policy analyst Ben Lieberman warns that any short - term effort to substantially curtail CO2 emissions " would have extremely costly and disruptive impacts on the economy and on living standards . "
He continues :
" The kind of industrial - strength EPA red tape that routinely imposes hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars in compliance costs in a process that can drag on for a year or more could now be imposed for the first time on many commercial buildings , farms , and all but the smallest of businesses . "
Since it first moved into the White House seven years ago , the Bush administration has resisted efforts to treat CO2 as a pollutant that is largely responsible for global climate change .
But the Supreme Court ruled a year ago that carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is subject to the Clean Air Act .
If such emissions are a danger to public health and welfare , the court said , the EPA must regulate them – in particular , emissions from motor vehicles .
EPA staffers came to that conclusion , according to the Los Angeles Times .
" EPA staffers told the Times they had concluded that such greenhouse gases were a major threat to water supplies , crops , wildlife , and other aspects of public welfare , and their finding was forwarded to the White House for review in December .
In addition , under orders from Johnson , the staff last fall completed a draft regulation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles . "
Still , Johnson chose to move slowly .
Critics say it was in response to industry pressure .
The New York Times editorialized :
" … the administration – despite all the blather about Mr. Bush 's newfound awareness of the dangers of climate change – has again refused to do anything about the problem , wasting another year in a struggle in which time is no one 's friend . "
Congressional Quarterly reported that Representative Markey wants to subpoena the EPA for its failure to turn over documents related to global warming , including the EPA 's draft proposal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
The political sniping between Congress and the White House over greenhouse gases and global warming comes the same week that former vice president Al Gore launched a three - year , $ 300 - million campaign to mobilize Americans to push for big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , a move The Washington Post calls " one of the most ambitious and costly public advocacy campaigns in US history . "

Harrison Ford 's sidekick in the film is Shia LaBeouf
New Indiana Jones movie
The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May , one of its stars John Hurt has said .
But the actor , who plays Abner Ravenwood in the picture , told BBC One 's Jonathan Ross show he was sworn to secrecy about the film 's details .
There has been speculation the film will debut at the French event days before a worldwide release on 22 May .
The Cannes programme is not officially released until later this month .
' Brilliant '
A spokesman for the festival was not immediately available for comment .
Hurt told the chat show host that Harrison Ford , who is returning to play the titular hero at the age of 65 , is " brilliant " .
" I have nothing but good things to say about him .
He understands that whole franchise .
He is that franchise , " said the British star .
John Hurt heaped praise on Harrison Ford
The new film will also star Australian Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf .
It took almost 18 years before Harrison , director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas returned with a fourth instalment in the popular film series .
A trailer to the new movie was released in February , and received a largely positive response .
Criticisms that Ford might have grown too old for the role have been largely dismissed by fans .
Hurt , meanwhile , said he was in talks to reprise his role as Quentin Crisp in a film about the later stages of his life in New York .
The actor won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant , a 1975 television play about the flamboyant gay man 's struggle to be accepted in Britain during the 1930s and 40s .
The US economy is poised on the edge of a recession , despite strong intervention by the US central bank and Treasury .
ECONOMIC GROWTH
In the past few years the US economy has been growing strongly .
But recent troubles in the housing and credit markets have hit it hard , with growth slowing sharply at the end of 2007 .
Economic forecasts suggest that the US growth in 2008 could be negative , with a mild recession in the first half of the year , and only very slow growth in 2009 .
INFLATION
The US economy is also facing significant inflationary pressures because of record oil prices which have pushed up the price of petrol and heating oil .
While the US central bank , the Fed does not have an explicit inflation target , inflation above 2 % is normally enough to set off the danger signals .
UNEMPLOYMENT
The economic slowdown has led to gradual rise in unemployment rate , and the economy has been losing jobs in the last few months .
Unemployment was already higher than it was at the end of the last boom in the l990s .
BUDGET DEFICIT
The US Treasury has begun paying out over $ 100bn in tax rebates to help boost economic growth .
But the package will double the size of the US deficit , which will also be hit by the economic downturn .
In the longer term , costs will rise as more people claim social security and Medicare payments as the Baby Boomer generation reaches retirement .
COLLAPSING HOUSE PRICES
At the root of the problems in the US economy is the collapse of the housing market as foreclosed properties and unsold new build homes flood the market .
Nationwide , US house prices are dropping for the first time since the Great Depression , and the rate of contraction is still accelerating .
And with people unable to borrow more against the value of their homes , it also has an impact on the real economy .

When Disney announced it was casting its first black princess for its latest animation film , the African - American heroine was hailed as a positive role model for little girls and an ambitious marketing ploy , not to mention an attempt to ward off the allegations of racism that have lurked since the heyday of Walt Disney Productions in the 1940s and 1950s .
But now the film studio finds itself fending off a chorus of accusations of racial stereotyping in its forthcoming big - budget cartoon , The Princess and The Frog : An American Fairy Tale , which marks a return to hand - drawn animation .
A musical set in 1920s New Orleans , the film was supposed to feature Maddy , a black chambermaid working for a spoilt , white Southern debutante .
Maddy was to be helped by a voodoo priestess fairy godmother to win the heart of a white prince , after he rescued her from the clutches of a voodoo magician .

Disney 's original storyboard is believed to have been torn up after criticism that the lead character was a clichéd subservient role with echoes of slavery , and whose name sounded too much like " Mammy " – a unwelcome reminder of America 's Deep South before the civil rights movement swept away segregation .
The heroine has been recast as Tiana , a 19 - year - old in a country that has never had a monarchy .
She is now slated to live " happily ever after " with a handsome fellow who is not black – with leaks suggesting that he will be of Middle Eastern heritage and called Naveen .
The race of the villain in the cartoon is reported to have also been revised .
The film studio began making changes a year ago , first to its title , The Frog Princess , which some had interpreted as a slur .
Amendments to the plot followed .
Rodney Hinds , features editor of The Voice newspaper , said : " We are talking about a big company who has had to go back to the drawing board .
It 's disappointing ...
Some of the stereotyping of people from our community is still rigid in people 's minds .
We have our own dreams and stories like everyone else , and we want them to be portrayed positively .
This is about how people are perceived and a princess is normally a positive character who most people aspire to . "
Disney commented : " The story takes place in the charming elegance and grandeur of New Orleans ' fabled French Quarter during the Jazz Age ...
Princess Tiana will be a heroine in the great tradition of Disney 's rich animated fairy tale legacy , and all other characters and aspects of the story will be treated with the greatest respect and sensitivity . "
Disney 's efforts to be multicultural have not always gone according to plan .
In 1993 , there were protests from Muslims who said the animated film Aladdin depicted the Middle East as barbaric .
One lyric included with the line : " I come from a land , from a faraway place , where the caravan camels roam , where they cut off your ear if they do n't like your face ; it 's barbaric , but hey , it 's home . "
The Waldpolenz Solar Park is built on a surface area equivalent to 200 soccer fields , the solar park will be capable of feeding 40 megawatts into the power grid when fully operational in 2009 .
In the start - up phase , the 130 - million - euro ( $ 201 million ) plant it will have a capacity of 24 megawatts , according to the Juwi group , which operates the installation .
The facility , located east of Leipzig , uses state - of - the - art , thin - film technology .
Some 550,000 thin - film modules will be used , of which 350,000 have already been installed .
The direct current produced in the photovoltaic solar modules will be converted into alternating current and fed completely into the power grid .
After just a year the solar power station will have produced the energy needed to build it , according to the Juwi group .
The eastern part of Germany is one of the forerunners of solar energy in the country .
Three of the world 's 50 biggest solar parks are located near Leipzig .
A solar plant due to be completed in California by 2011 will have a capacity of 80 megawatts - double that of Waldpolenz .
I put this pattern together in 1999 - 2000 mainly using patterns that I created in the 1980's .
The basic design has a Universal Turing Machine in mind so design expands easily to 16 states and 8 symbols .
I have a design for a Universal Turing Machine which fits in that size .
This is the first fully working Turing machine so I made it small , just 3 states and 3 symbols .
It takes 11040 generations for one cycle .
I have put an extra FANOUT in the addressing of the finite state machine to give a trace of the operation .
It is a very simple Turing Machine as it is limited to 3 states and 3 symbols .
It is shown in this picture starting with a 2 1's on the tape to the right .
It will stop with twice this number on the right .
The Tape is implemented as 2 stacks and the machine has been provided with 6 stack cells .
This can be expanded as required for the calculation .
The Finite State machine part is an array of memory cells address by State ( Row ) and Symbol ( Column ) .
Each memory cell cycle round in 240 generations with a space for a glider every 30 generations .
These 8 positions are decoded as DVVVSSSS with the D for direction ( 1 = Right ) first , VVV is the symbol to write on the tape and SSSS is the next state .
The design for this Turing Machine is extendible by expanding the size of the Finite State Machine part and storing different numbers in the memory cells .
The maximum size is 16 states and 8 symbols .
This is sufficient for a Universal Turing Machine .
This has now been down see here .
UKIAH , Calif . 
There is probably no marijuana - friendlier place in the country than here in Mendocino County , where plants can grow more than 15 feet high , medical marijuana clubs adopt stretches of highway , and the sticky , sweet aroma of cannabis fills this city ’s streets during the autumn harvest .
Lately , however , residents of Mendocino County , like those in other parts of California , are wondering if the state ’s embrace of marijuana for medicinal purposes has gone too far .
Medical marijuana was legalized under state law by California voters in 1996 , and since then 11 other states have followed , even though federal law still bans the sale of any marijuana .
But some frustrated residents and law enforcement officials say the California law has increasingly and unintentionally provided legal cover for large - scale marijuana growers  and the problems such big - money operations can attract .
“ It ’s a clear shield for commercial operations , ” said Mike Sweeney , 60 , a supporter of both medical marijuana and a local ballot measure on June 3 that called for new limits on the drug in Mendocino .
“ And we do n’t want those here . ”
Nicotine can give the brain a boost Nicotine - based drugs may help delay the moment a person with dementia has to enter a care home , say researchers .
Nicotine has toxic effects , and carries a strong risk of addiction , but scientists have shown it can also boost learning , memory and attention .
The effect is small , but it may help give dementia patients up to six extra months of independent living .
A team at King 's College London have demonstrated the positive effects of nicotine in experiments on rats .
It may be possible for medicinal chemists to devise compounds that provide some of the beneficial effects of nicotine while cutting out the toxic effects
Professor Ian Stolerman
Institute of Psychiatry
They showed that nicotine boosted the animals ' ability to carry out a task accurately - particularly when they were also distracted .
When able to give full concentration , the animals responded correctly to stimuli about 80 % of the time .
Nicotine boosted the accuracy rate by about 5 % .
However , when distracted , the animals ' success rate fell to about 55 % .
In this case nicotine brought it back up to around the 85 % level .
Biochemical mechanisms
The King 's team , based at the Institute of Psychiatry , studied the mechanisms which underpin the effects produced by nicotine .
They showed how proteins on the surface of cells respond to the compound , and pinned down the role of several key chemicals in the brain , including dopamine and noradrenaline .
It transpired that there are only subtle biochemical differences in the way nicotine stimulates the brain , and triggers addiction .
Several nicotinic drugs are already in development , but the King 's team hopes its work will speed up the discovery of agents which give the brain a bigger boost than nicotine , with longer lasting effects .
Lead researcher Professor Ian Stolerman said : " Nicotine , like many other drugs , has multiple effects , some of which are harmful , whereas others may be beneficial .
" It may be possible for medicinal chemists to devise compounds that provide some of the beneficial effects of nicotine while cutting out the toxic effects . "
Professor Stolerman stressed that the positive effects produced by nicotine were small , and would be of no benefit to most people .
However , he said they could potentially make a difference to dementia patients .
He added that the " cognitive boost " that many smokers experience from nicotine may contribute to the pleasure they get from their habit .
' Do n't smoke ' Professor Clive Ballard , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " Although nicotine has therapeutic qualities , when it is absorbed through smoking the health risks outweigh the benefits .
" Smoking increases risk of vascular dementia , the second most common form of dementia and is associated with a number of other health risks .
" More research is now needed to find a safe and effective treatment for dementia , with the potential benefits of nicotine , but without the health risks . "
Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , agreed that people should not be tempted to smoke to try to ward off dementia .
She said the best way to minimise risk was to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly .
Professor Stolerman said there was no reason to believe that nicotine or smoking reduced the risk of getting dementia - it only helps to reverse symptoms .
It is estimated that 700,000 people in the UK live with dementia .
The research will be presented to a Federation of European Neuroscience Societies conference in Geneva .

What are these ?
Maybe this is Newsweek merely coming back to the pack , but after showing a 15 - point lead for Obama last month , the latest Newsweek poll shows a tight race : 44 - 41 .
This is hard to believe , but Obama has dropped 14 points among independents since the last poll .
The story is this kid from Germany had leukimia and knew he was going to die .
So he started to live his last days to their fullest by hitching himself to the back of Germany 's fastest Highspeed train ICE with a top speed of over 330 km/hr , and he brought along a camera and captured some Amazing Footage , he died a year later .
He was actually pretty well known and made headlines .

The comments to this entry are closed .
Many people go to psychics for a handful of typical reasons .
They want to know if they will get their dream job soon , or make a big move , or end up with the hunky new guy who seems shy but might just be The One .
Most of the subjects are personal , minor , and relatively inconsequential .
If the information seems valid , then the client is happy .
If none of it comes true , then the subject just chalks it up to a bad reading and only loses a few bucks .
No real harm done .
But what happens when the psychic lies to the client ( or is wrong ) , telling her information that is not true about something with real - world consequences ?
Consider the case of Colleen Leduc , a single mother of an autistic eleven - year - old girl in Barrie , Ontario .
On May 30 , she left her daughter Victoria at her elementary school .
Leduc was soon called back to the school urgently , and confronted by the principal , Victoria 's teacher , and a teacher 's aide ( educational assistant , or EA ) .
Puzzled and alarmed , Leduc asked what was going on .
The group told her that they believed that Victoria was being sexually abused .
They had contacted the Children 's Aid Society , a case file had been opened , and her daughter might be taken from her " for her own safety . "
Leduc was shocked by the explanation : " The teacher looked at me and said : ' We have to tell you that Victoria 's EA went to see a psychic and the psychic asked her if she works with a little girl with the initial V .
When the EA said yes , the psychic said , ' Well , you need to know that this girl is being sexually abused by a man between the ages of 23 and 26 . ' "
The EA reported it to the teacher , who then went to the principal , and so on .
Because Victoria is autistic , the child could n't speak for herself about the alleged abuse .
Leduc did n't believe the psychic 's allegations , and said they could not be true since her daughter did not even come in contact with any men of those ages .
Furthermore , Leduc could prove it : Because of Victoria 's disability , Leduc had equipped her daughter with a GPS tracking system and a continuous audio recorder .
A review of the audio proved that at no point was Victoria sexually abused in any way by anyone .
The case was eventually closed , but Leduc was stunned that it had gotten as far as it did based on such dubious evidence .
The psychic has not been identified nor arrested for providing false report of a crime .
( For more on this , see www.WhatsTheHarm.net, a web site the tracks the damage done by psychics . )
If you believe that psychic information should be taken seriously , consider that at any time , you could suddenly be accused of anything from murder to rape to child molestation on nothing more than the word of someone who claims to get messages from supernatural sources .
Psychic powers have never been proven to exist , much less provide reliable , valid information .
Some psychics are careful to claim that their readings are " for entertainment purposes only , " tacitly admitting that their information should not be taken seriously .
Most , however , are happy to do their work for paying clients and accept no responsibility for the truth of their information .
If you consult psychics , the next time you meet with one , ask him or her to promise in writing that what they are telling you is true and accurate .
I predict you wo n't get any takers .
Ask yourself why they will take your money but not promise to give you the truth .
Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the Skeptical Inquirer science magazine , and he has investigated psychics and psychic powers for over a decade .
His books can be found on his website .
Is some deafness avoidable ?
Hearing loss is usually accepted as an unavoidable side effect of ageing , but new research suggests that lifestyle has a greater influence than previously thought .
According to the largest study on age - related hearing impairment done so far , the recipe for keen ears well into the senior years may be simple : stop smoking , stay slim , and have an alcoholic drink at least once a week .
“ Our take - home message is that hearing loss up to a certain degree is preventable .
Environmental factors are responsible for about 50 % [ of age - related deafness ] and we now know which ones to avoid , ” says Erik Fransen at the University of Antwerp in Belgium .
Fransen and collaborators in nine European countries analysed lifestyle questionnaires and hearing tests from 4000 people aged 53 to 67 .
Advertisement
Dose - dependent link
Perhaps unsurprisingly , noise exposure , known to destroy the sound - transducing hair cells in the inner ear , was the biggest risk .
More surprising is the apparent effect of smoking and overeating .
These factors have been suspected as potential causes of deafness , but it has been hard to separate them from the effects of cardiovascular diseases that are also frequently suffered by people who smoke and overeat .
This study has been able to do just that .
“ Since the current study is so large , we found enough otherwise healthy smokers to show a direct and dose - dependent link between smoking and bad hearing , ” says Fransen .
“ For example , a 60 - year - old man who has smoked a pack a day for at least 10 years loses about five decibels on top of the 25 dB loss experienced by a third of the people his age . ”
Smoking and excess weight both decrease blood circulation , a cause of cardiovascular disease .
But the inner ear itself is very sensitive to circulation problems , explains Fransen : “ Hair cells die when they do not get enough oxygen and when toxic free radicals do not get transported away fast enough .
Smoking also directly increases radical production , making matters worse . ”
Incentive to quit
In contrast , the questionnaires suggested that moderate alcohol intake may protect hearing – at least one drink a week .
This may occur through improved blood circulation , suggests Fransen .
Karen Cruickshanks at the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Wisconsin in Madison , US , says the study is exciting .
“ For some people , finding out about the added risk of hearing loss might provide them with that extra incentive to quit smoking , ” she says .

The USA and the EU planning to escalate confrontation with Iran .
A military blockade discussed .
In the conflict over Iran ’s civilian nuclear program , the United States and Europe are intensifying confrontation .
At the top of the measures that are now being discussed is an international naval blockade by a “ coalition of the willing . ”
As in the Adriatic blockade against Yugoslavia in the first half of the 1990s , the coasts of Iran can be sealed off by a collective action by the NATO warships .
This would involve the “ not - so - willing ” such as Germany early in a joint military operation against Iran , unlike in the Iraq War .
A later exit from the military escalation would hardly be possible .
Such a blockade has been favored by the Israeli government and the neo-conservative US media like the Wall Street Journal .
Also under discussion is an agreement to no longer supply the Iranian oil and gas industry with necessary technology and spare parts .
The aim is to cause serious bottlenecks in production .
In principle , the US and the EU agreed to enforce their own coercive measures beyond the UN Security Council sanctions during President George W. Bush ’s visit to Europe .
A declaration adopted last Tuesday says : “ We are ready to supplement those ( U.N. Security Council ) sanctions with additional measures .
We will continue to work together . . . to take steps to ensure Iranian banks cannot abuse the international banking system to support proliferation and terrorism . ”
The term “ terrorism ” refers to Hamas , Hezbollah , and all Iraqi organizations and movements that do not conform to Washington .
In agreeing to this declaration , the EU states for the first time accepted the US government ’s foreign policy which had long been linking Tehran ’s nuclear program and its foreign policy .
It is now also official that what is at stake is not just the nuclear program , but the total subjection of Iran to a US - EU diktat .
Against this background , the artificially magnified importance of Javier Solana ’s weekend visit to Iran was only a propaganda stunt .
The EU ’s foreign policy officer presented Tehran with an “ incentive package ” to which the “ Iran Six ” — China , Germany , France , Britain , Russia , and the US — had agreed in mid-May .
It demands that Iran stop all work on uranium enrichment .
It offers nothing in return — except the supposed readiness to continue to discuss some issues .
The Iranian government spokesman Gholam - Hossein Elham made a statement : “ If the package includes suspension it is not debatable at all .
Iran ’s position is clear : any precondition is unacceptable . ”
The original article in German appeared in junge Welt on 16 June 2008 , under the title “ Solanas » Anreizpaket « für Teheran ” [ Solana ’s “ Incentive Package ” for Tehran ] .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City will spend $ 2.3 billion to cut greenhouse gas emissions from municipal buildings and operations by 30 percent in 30 years , Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday .
A couple sit below the Brooklyn Bridge in New York May 21 , 2008 .

The city aims to cut 1.68 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents a year from 2006 levels by 2017 , with measures ranging from improved heating and cooling systems to fixing methane leaks at water treatment plants and using that gas to run electric generation equipment .
“ The city is doing its part , I hope the private sector follows our example and finds conservation savings of their own , ” Bloomberg said in a statement .
The city ’s government consumes about 6.5 percent of the city ’s total energy use , and 10 percent of its peak electricity demand .
“ It ’s a cost that , as we know , is likely to grow as energy prices never seem to stop climbing , ” Bloomberg said at a news conference , saying he believes the city can achieve the results with existing technology .
Bloomberg said the city should break even on its investments , on an annual cash flow basis , by 2013 .
“ By 2015 , we project we will have saved more on our energy bills than we will have spent on all our planned investments to that point , ” Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler said .
The program will partly be funded with 10 percent of the city ’s energy budget -- about $ 100 million in the current fiscal year .
Improved heating , cooling and ventilation systems in city buildings will be used to accomplish 57 percent of the total reductions , Bloomberg said in a statement .
Emissions at firehouses , police precincts , offices , court houses and sanitation garages will also be reduced via repairs , ranging from leaky pipes and broken windows to inefficient pumps , along with correcting wasteful systems .
Another 17 percent of the reductions will come at water plants that treat sewage and storm water runoff , by fixing methane leaks and using that gas to run electric generation equipment .
Other steps include buying more vehicles that get better gas mileage .
And Bloomberg , who jests with reporters about replacing the light bulbs at his Upper East Side townhouse with more efficient ones , plans to do the same with street lights .
Asked how much he could accomplish before his second and last four - year term ends , Bloomberg noted he only had 542 days left to serve .
“ You ’ll be living here , you ’ll be breathing the air , and it ’ll be your children who will suffer .
If you believe this is the right way to go , you ’ll have to pressure whoever so they continue on . ”
New York City has already committed $ 900 million for the program and it spent $ 80 million in its previous budget .
The mayor also hopes to tap federal and state dollars , private foundations and so - called energy performance contracts .
The program puts in place one of the independent mayor ’s so - called PlaNYC initiatives , a series of green proposals to manage the city ’s expected growth in the next few decades .
His best - known proposal , a program to fight gridlock by imposing fees on drivers during peak hours in parts of Manhattan , was killed by the state legislature .
Noting the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , the state agency that runs the subways , buses and commuter trains , faces shortfalls in its capital and operating budgets , Bloomberg said he was still optimistic the state will enact “ an economic disincentive ” for drivers that will pay for mass transit .
Report Shows Lawmakers Heavily Invested in War A new report out reveals that top legislators have millions of their own dollars invested in the military - industrial complex .
By Pat Shannan
A new study by a nonpartisan research group shows that lawmakers ’ stock holdings in various companies doing business with the Defense Department totals more than $ 196 million , earning the congress critters millions in profits individually since the start of the war in Iraq .
The Washington - based Center for Responsive Politics says that 2006 financial disclosure statements suggest that members ’ holdings could pose a conflict of interest as they decide the fate of Iraq war spending .
Several members who earned the most from defense contractors have plum committee or leadership assignments , including Democratic Sen.
John Kerry , independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman and House Republican Whip Roy Blunt .
The study found that more Republicans than Democrats hold stock in defense companies , but that the Democrats who are invested had significantly more money at stake .
In 2006 , for example , Democrats held at least $ 3.7 million in military - related investments , compared to Republican investments of $ 577,500 .
Overall , 151 members hold investments worth $ 78.7 million to $ 195.5 million in companies that receive defense contracts that are worth at least $ 5 million .
These investments earned them anywhere between $ 15.8 million and $ 62 million between 2004 and 2006 , the center concluded .
It is unclear how many members still hold these investments and exactly how much money has been made .
Disclosure reports for 2007 are still being vetted .
Also , members are required to report only a general range of their holdings .
According to the report , presidential hopefuls Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain did not report any defense - related holdings on their filing .
Not all the companies invested in by lawmakers are typical defense contractors .
Corporations such as PepsiCo , IBM , Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson have at one point received defense - related contracts , the report notes .
“ So common are these companies , both as personal investments and as defense contractors , it would appear difficult to build a diverse blue - chip stock Still , earning dividends from companies tied to the military “ could be problematic ” for members that oversee defense policy and budgeting , Mayer adds .
Democrat Kerry , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , is identified as earning the most — at least $ 2.6 million between 2004 and 2006 from investments worth up to $ 38.2 million .
Spokesman David Wade said Kerry , who opposes the war in Iraq , is one of many beneficiaries of family trusts which he does n’t control .
Wade also noted that Kerry does not sit on the Appropriations Committee , which has direct control of the defense budget .
“ He has a 24 - year Senate record of working and voting in the best interests of our men and women in the military , not of any defense contractors , ” Wade said .
Lieberman , an independent and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee , held a considerably smaller share at $ 51,000 .
A spokesman for Blunt , a senior member of House Republican leadership who held at least $ 15,000 in Lockheed Martin stock in 2006 , said the insinuation that lawmakers ’ votes might be affected by their portfolios is “ offensive . ”
“ I do n’t pretend to speak for other offices , but I am fairly certain that no member would consider their personal finances when voting on issues as important as sending our men and women in uniform into harm ’s way , ” said Blunt spokesman Nick Simpson .
Reporters were expecting then to hear an offer of ocean front property for sale in Missouri , but none was forthcoming from Simpson at this time .
Both Lieberman and Blunt support continued operations in Iraq .

It appears that John McCain ’s “ maverick ” energy policy is nothing more than , not drilling in ANWR , keeping 90 % of George W. Bush ’s ideas , and comparing Obama to Jimmy Carter , which unless you are over 50 years old , might not be seen as a bad thing .
Here is what McCain had to say about Obama ’s energy plan while speaking in Houston , TX late today , “ He wants a windfall profits tax on oil , to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas .
If the plan sounds familiar , it ’s because that was President Jimmy Carter ’s big idea too – and a lot of good it did us .
Now as then , all a windfall profits tax will accomplish is to increase our dependence on foreign oil , and hinder exactly the kind of domestic exploration and production we need .
I ’m all for recycling – but it ’s better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970’s . ”
Most of Obama ’s supporters , either were n’t born , or were small children during the Carter administration .
I was nine when Carter left office .
Younger people know Jimmy Carter for his diplomatic efforts to promote peace , and Habitat for Humanity .
Someone needs to remind McCain that the year is 2008 , not 1988 .
Every time he makes this comparison , he is showing his age , and the fact is that Carter has rehabilitated his image since leaving office .
Many Americans view him more favorably than they did 28 years ago .

McCain ’s energy plan is the typical corporate valentine .
Like George W. Bush , McCain wants to increase nuclear energy production , because the nuclear industry is a large donor to the GOP .
He does n’t want a windfall profit tax on the oil companies .
He does n’t propose spending any more money on the development of alternative energy , but wants to spend more money on coal and natural gas .
If McCain wants to compare someone ’s presidency to Carter ’s it should be the man whose policies he supports , George W. Bush .
He can use all the musty old comparisons that he wants , but it is John McCain who is running to continue the failed policies of a presidential flop , not Barack Obama .
McCain quote
ARCHAEOLOGISTS have uncovered the secret of a mysterious earth monument which has puzzled people for centuries .
The barely - visible bump on a Lancashire hill is the site of a lost castle .
The discovery has been hailed as one of the most important architectural finds in England for years .
Experts at Manchester University were stunned to discover the remains of a large 900 - year - old castle , just a few miles north of Stalybridge .
The team had been commissioned to survey the entire borough of Tameside for historical artefacts .
Although several ancient documents refer to a `castle ' on windswept Buckton Moor few believed that such a structure existed .
Archaeologists had visited the moor on three previous occasions but those digs had yielded nothing .
Although some raised earth mounds were visible , historians guessed they were the remains of a lowly earthwork fort , made by digging a ditch and building a simple wooden tower .
It was not until earlier this year that they found the foundations of a 9ft deep wall and a huge gate tower , revealing that a football - pitched size castle capable of garrisoning up to 30 soldiers would have occupied the site .
Mike Nevell , director of the university 's field archaeology centre , said : " The discovery of a high ranking castle in England is a tremendously rare event - and was definitely not what we were expecting .
" It 's been an object of curiosity for a very long time - perhaps going all the way back to a reference in a 1359 survey carried out by Edward , the Black Prince , who had just acquired the lands .
Then it was described as a ruined castle .
" Much of the stonework has been stolen and it's walls are overgrown with heather and peat which explains why it has been mistaken for an earthwork all this time . "
Now historians are trying to discover who built and lived in the structure .
Their best guess is that it was built by Earl of Chester , Ranulf the Second .
Controlling most of the counties in the north of England , the French - born aristocrat was one of the country 's most powerful landlords .
Although he helped King Stephen conquer the warring Scots , the earl lived in a state of near constant conflict with the king and rival aristocrats , during a turbulent civil war .
He went on to survive a poisoning attempt by his arch - enemy William Peveril the Younger , which killed three of his men .
He died at the age of 54 , although the circumstances of his death are shrouded in mystery .
The university team , made up of professional archaeologists and local volunteers , will return for further excavations next year in an attempt to discover more about the castle .
In particular , they want to find out why it faced north rather than south where Chester 's sworn enemy Peveril lived .
( CNN ) --
The titanic struggle for the Democratic candidacy neared its end Tuesday with final voting expected to push Hillary Clinton aside and usher in Barack Obama as the first ever black U.S. presidential nomination for a major political party .
After months of primaries and caucuses , the Democratic party still does not have a nominee .
Clinton 's campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe told CNN Clinton will not concede at a New York rally being held after voting closes Tuesday night in the last two primary states .
That was a reaction to an Associated Press story quoting two senior Clinton campaign officials as saying she will concede Tuesday night or early Wednesday that Obama has done enough to secure the Democratic nomination , while stopping short of formally suspending or ending her race .
But Clinton told New York lawmakers she is willing to be the vice presidential nominee on Obama 's presidential ticket , those lawmakers told CNN .
CNN first reported Monday that Clinton was signalling the Obama campaign of her interest .
CNN confirmed that another big name Democrat , former President Jimmy Carter will endorse Obama .
Democrats in South Dakota and Montana cast the final votes Tuesday in a long and bitter campaign that has cost the candidates dearly in dollars and left the party struggling to unite to challenge Republican John McCain and succeed George W. Bush at the White House .
Obama needs the support of about 40 more Democratic delegates to make the 2,118 needed to capture the nomination at the party 's August convention but he is likely to depend on superdelegates -- party officials free to back any candidate -- to tip the balance .
The Illinois senator , who has sought to dispel fears of inexperience by campaigning on a message of change , has emerged as favorite in recent weeks despite a dogged campaign by Clinton who as former first lady claims to have more political experience .
Although campaigns for both parties said there had been no formal discussion , sources close to Clinton said she was poised to acknowledge her inevitable defeat by Tuesday signaling her willingness to accept an offer of becoming Obama 's running mate if asked .
" In her speech tomorrow night she will convey the message that first and foremost she is committed to Democrats winning in November and will do whatever she 's asked to do , " a close friend of the New York senator said .
Her husband , former U.S. President Bill Clinton , also told voters in South Dakota on Monday that " this may be the last day I 'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind . "
Watch how the race could end »
Obama insiders are said to be split over whether a joint ticket with Clinton will be a good idea , with some doubting she can deliver , despite claims the pairing would help " ram down the animosity " between supporters of the two that many fear could cost the Democrats the election .
Democratic Party insiders are also discussing how to patch up Clinton 's relationship with the black community and how to bring African American Clinton supporters into the Obama fold , several top Clinton supporters said .
Feuding between the two camps reached fever pitch at the height of the campaign , after Clinton and Obama saw off main rival John Edwards then traded blows on sideline issues including Obama 's links to a controversial preacher and Clinton 's claims to have dodged bullets in Bosnia .
At least one superdelegate -- the highest - ranking African American in Congress Jim Clyburn -- announced his endorsement Obama on Tuesday , saying Obama had " energized " constituents .
But despite forecasts of defeat , Clinton -- dubbed the " comeback kid " for earlier popularity resurgences -- campaigned into the night on Monday , clinging to the outside prospect of an upset in the final two U.S. states to make their selections in the six month primary voting season .
Clinton told voters in South Dakota Monday : " We 're going to make our case to all the delegates as to who would be the best president , number one -- because that 's the most important question -- and number two , who would be the stronger candidate against John McCain ; and I believe on both of those questions I am the person who should get the support to get the nomination for our party . "
CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley reported that " only a handful of people at the inner core of the Clinton campaign knows what she 's thinking about doing when Tuesday 's dust settles . "
" Those who have been with her since nearly the beginning are saying she will not push this into the convention .
" As one close Clinton supporter put it , she 's acutely aware of her place in the party .
She will not ruin the party . "

Red Rover , Red Rover , Send Karl Rove Over
July 12 , 2008 by squishmael
by squishmael
This kind of thing is what makes my stomach turn .
Karl
Rove has thumbed his nose at the law of the land and what is worse is that I do n’t doubt that he ’ll get away with it somehow .
I have no long - winded rant ready to unleash on anyone who might happen to stumble upon this post , but , the whole idea that the Bush administration can even entertain the prospect of getting away with this is , to say the least , disturbing .
If executive privilege can be flaunted and abused like this , then I think that it is only fair that some liberties should be taken in terms of creative criminal punishment , should the unlikely scenario that a whiff of common sense justice enter the nostrils of Washington and Rove ( and the Bush administration ) is held accountable .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Senator , what do you see as the gravest long - term threat to the U.S. economy ? "
That was the first question we put to John McCain when he sat down for an interview with Fortune on a sunny afternoon in June .
The moment felt charged .
Hillary Clinton had finally conceded to Barack Obama , and now the contest for the highest office in the land was down to two sparkling finalists - " the most impressive choice America has had for a very long time , " The Economist observed from overseas .
Both were long shots when all this began .
Each prevailed despite deep differences with key blocs in their party bases .
Both promised change .
Already they were going at each other hard , mostly over the economy , and there was no shortage of bad news to fight about : turmoil in the markets , oil pushing toward $ 140 a barrel , gas at more than $ 4 a gallon , GM shutting down truck plants all over North America , unemployment arching higher than expected .
All that was context for the question we posed .
But we were asking McCain to rise above the news and look ahead to the day seven months from now when , he hopes , he 'll be sitting in the Oval Office .
We wanted to know what single economic threat he perceives above all others .
McCain at first says nothing .
He sits in the corner of a sofa , one black , tasseled loafer propped against a coffee table .
We 're in the presidential suite on the 41st floor of the New York Hilton .
McCain has come here - between a major speech on the economy in Washington , D.C. , this morning and a fundraiser tonight at the 21 Club - to talk to us and to let us take his picture .
He is wearing a dark suit , as he almost always does , with a blue shirt and a wine - colored tie .
He 's looking not at us but into the void .
His eyes are narrowed .
Nine seconds of silence , ten seconds , 11 .
Finally he says , " Well , I would think that the absolute gravest threat is the struggle that we 're in against radical Islamic extremism , which can affect , if they prevail , our very existence .
Another successful attack on the United States of America could have devastating consequences . "
Not America 's dependence on foreign oil ?
Not climate change ?
Not the crushing cost of health care ?
Eventually McCain gets around to mentioning all three of those .
But he starts by deftly turning the economy into a national security issue - and why not ?
On national security McCain wins .
We saw how that might play out early in the campaign , when one good scare , one timely reminder of the chaos lurking in the world , probably saved McCain in New Hampshire , a state he had to win to save his candidacy - this according to McCain 's chief strategist , Charlie Black .
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December was an " unfortunate event , " says Black .
" But his knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy who 's ready to be Commander - in - Chief .
And it helped us . "
As would , Black concedes with startling candor after we raise the issue , another terrorist attack on U.S. soil .
" Certainly it would be a big advantage to him , " says Black .
Absent that horror , however , the 2008 election will probably be a referendum on two issues that , according to every poll we 've seen , trump national security in the minds of voters right now .
Both are problematic for McCain : the war in Iraq , now viewed as not worth fighting by two - thirds of Americans ( according to a recent ABC News / Washington Post poll ) but which McCain unbendingly supports ; and the economy - especially the economy .
" During bad economic times , history tells you people do blame it on the party in power in the White House , " says Black , a longtime Washington lobbyist who has worked in every Republican presidential campaign since 1972 .
So far , Black adds , voters seem willing to give McCain a pass , or at least a partial one .
He polls much better when the choice is McCain vs. Obama than when it's a generic choice of Republicans vs. Democrats .
The GOP can only hope the distinction holds .
In any case , McCain 's task is clear :
He has to convince us , first , that he's not George Bush and therefore not the one responsible for the economic mess we 're in , and second , that he knows how to clean it up , even if he did admit early in the campaign , " The issue of economics is not something I 've understood as well as I should . "
We did n't have to spend a lot of time with McCain on the campaign trail to discover what really gets his mojo working .
Let 's just say it 's not his plan to reform the unemployment - insurance system .
There he was at an airport rally in Stockton , Calif. , shouting out to his loyal pals in the Rolling Thunder veterans group who had parked their Harleys behind the stage : " Go ahead and start your engines for a second !
Go right ahead ! "
And earlier that week in Chicago , addressing the other NRA - the National Restaurant Association - departing from his prepared remarks to accuse Obama of making light of the threat posed by Iran 's leadership .
" They are the chief sponsors of Shiah extremists in Iraq , " he decried , his voice rising , " and their President has called Israel " - and here he paused for one beat - " a stinking corpse ! "
On such occasions McCain conveys passion , commitment to a cause , a sure sense of who he is and why he 's running for President , and above all a strong connection to his audience .
When the topic is economics , the same fire is n't there - at least not yet .
When he took part in an economic roundtable in Union City , Calif. , with celebrity supporters John Chambers of Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , Meg Whitman , former chief of eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , and a panel of entrepreneurs , McCain took the opportunity to tick off some of the highlights in his stump speech : his insistence that " the foundation of our economy is incredibly strong " ; his belief that when it comes to government , " the lesser the better , " and to taxes , " the lower the better " ; and above all , his commitment to free trade .
" Erecting trade barriers , " he said in his introductory remarks , " would be the most harmful thing we could do to America 's economic future . "
Some of that went over pretty well with the Silicon Valley techies in the crowd .
But the economic landscape is nothing if not fractured .
Tax cuts , investment credits , stimulus packages , trade deals , help with the mortgage , government contracts - everybody 's looking for whatever it is they 're looking for , and if they do n't get it they 're not happy .
Michelle Moskowitz , who lobbies for the University of California at Berkeley , came to Union City hoping McCain would commit to more funding for basic research ; she left disappointed .
The overall tepid response McCain received from the people we spoke to afterward seemed to point up the peculiar challenge he faces when laying out his economic plan .
How does a tough , uncompromising former prisoner of war - a self - described maverick who built his political reputation on straight talk - handle competing demands for limited resources during hard times , meanwhile keeping the ideologues in his own party at bay ?
Not always gracefully , it turns out .
****
For the lowdown on McCain 's economic plan , we turn to Doug Holtz - Eakin , the bearded , balding former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , now McCain 's chief economic advisor .
We meet at campaign headquarters in Arlington , Va. , in a conference room on the M floor - M for McCain .
( M is one above 12 .
The whole floor was renamed and relabeled by the campaign , right down to the buttons on the elevators .
McCain is superstitious , his spokeswoman explained ; it 's a fighter - pilot thing .
But is n't M the 13th letter in the ... ?
Never mind . )
Holtz - Eakin is relating an anecdote from McCain 's first presidential campaign in 2000 .
The Senator was visiting a shuttered mill in South Carolina , talking to a worker who had lost his job .
" And the guy said to him , ' I worked in this mill for 30 years .
What is my son going to do ? '
And McCain looked at him and he gave the economist 's best answer .
He said , ' You know , I would have hoped that we both had higher aspirations for your son . ' "
That 's classic McCain straight talk , a pure dose of it .
Truthful , direct , maybe a tad harsh in that sometimes starchy Republican spirit of self - reliance , but with definite undercurrents of compassion and respect .
I will not dissemble , is what he 's saying between the lines , because I believe you can handle the truth .
How many of us ever hear stuff like that from our friends , much less from a politician who wants our vote ?
No wonder so many reporters fell in love with him , and not just because he was famously accessible to them .
" But he had nerve , " Michael Lewis wrote about McCain in the New York Times in 1999 , under the headline I LIKED A POL .
" And his nerve was far more interesting than bravery in combat .
It was the nerve of a man engaged in an experiment of behaving like a human being when everyone around him was playing this strange , artificial game . "
At times McCain still shows flashes of his old uncompromising self .
All last winter he campaigned in Iowa against ethanol subsidies , claiming they " distort " the market .
He was right about that .
In January he told autoworkers in Michigan : " Some of the jobs that have left the state of Michigan are not coming back .
They are not .
And I am sorry to tell you that . "
He was right about that too , although saying so may well have cost him the Michigan primary .
Last month in Stockton , days after he not only voted against the $ 307 billion farm bill ( Obama was for it ) but also vowed to veto any similar " pork - barrel - laden bill " that might cross his desk when he 's President , we heard a local reporter ask him , " How is that going to help you in the Central Valley ? "
It will not , obviously , which is n't trivial .
McCain 's staff thinks he might actually have a shot this year at winning California , something no Republican presidential candidate since George H. W. Bush in 1988 has been able to do .
But McCain has been battling earmarks and pork - barrel politics his whole legislative career .
He stood his ground .
" There may be some people who do n't agree with my position , " he replied , " but I think you 'll agree that I 'm doing what I think is best for this country . "
Hard not to respect that .
But back to Holtz - Eakin 's story about the displaced mill worker in South Carolina .
Turns out there 's a coda , and it tells us something about how McCain is approaching the 2008 campaign differently than he did in 2000 .
" This time , " Holtz - Eakin says , " when this campaign started , he looked at me and he said , ' I know that you guys all thought that was a great answer .
I 'm happy to do the straight talk , but I need something more .
These guys have gone to work '- he 's thinking about the autoworkers - ' they 've paid their taxes , they 've sent their kids to school .
Now what are they going to do ? ' "
To begin , they 'll still have to find another job - McCain has n't softened his position on that .
He has shown zero interest in propping up dying industries , even if to do so would alleviate economic suffering in the short term .
And we know that unlike Obama , who has wavered , McCain is dead set against protectionist trade policies .
( " I stand for free trade , " he said at a Boston press conference , " and with all the difficulties and economic troubles we 're in today , there 's a real bright spot , and that 's our exports .
Protectionism does not work and it will not work , and I look forward to that debate between myself and Senator Obama . " )
But in his new more sensitive mode , at least he 's talking about a plan to ease the transition .
He says he wants to give workers more control over how they choose to spend their benefit money , plus added incentives to get the training they need to land a better job , preferably in an industry that has a future .
And he 's offering " special , targeted assistance " to workers over 55 .
Will that appeal to disaffected Clinton supporters ?
Conceivably .
So might the populist themes we heard him sound repeatedly on the campaign trail .
McCain wants greater " transparency and accountability " in government and markets .
Moreover , he does not dispute that " the gap between executives and the workers has grown , " and he states flatly , " That trend should not continue . "
One could argue that raising taxes on the wealthy would slow that trend ; McCain is definitely not willing to go there .
However , he does support so - called say - for - pay legislation , meaning he would give shareholders " advisory , " if not binding , input on CEO pay .
" I think what the corporate world has got to understand is there 's anger out there with the American people , " he told Fortune .
" And [ corporations ] have to act to restore their reputation , just as we in public office have to act to restore ours .
Our approval ratings are basically at the same incredibly low level . "
The point where the line between populism and pandering begins to blur is McCain 's proposal for a summer gas - tax holiday .
Eight years ago McCain would have ridiculed the idea and earned straight - talk points for doing so .
Now Obama gets to be that guy , and he 's got lots of company .
" Absolutely stupid , " says Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute , a pro-free - market think tank .
" Embarrassingly so . "
Even FedEx ( FDX , Fortune 500 ) CEO Fred Smith , a prominent member of McCain 's kitchen cabinet of economic advisors - and someone who , in his words , burns " hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel per year " - is skeptical .
" Well , " Smith says , " I 'm an ardent supporter of Senator McCain , but I do n't agree with him on everything ....
Will it have any major effect on the energy crisis ?
The answer to that is no . "
McCain 's advisors insist that 's not the intent : " It 's a summer thing , " says Holtz - Eakin .
" It 's an effort to help some people when they 're really getting hammered .
And there are n't a lot of levers to stop the short - term duress . "
( Long term , McCain has said he would lift the quarter - century ban on offshore drilling in hopes of increasing domestic reserves . )
But economists say the gas - tax holiday creates exactly the wrong incentive at a time when growing demand is driving fuel prices ever upward .
Not that it matters what anyone thinks .
The gas - tax holiday never stood a chance of being introduced in Congress , much less becoming law .
So why even bring it up ?
Former Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) CEO Carly Fiorina , another McCain advisor , offers this frank explanation : " In the last three months the price of a gallon of gas has risen to the top of the American citizen 's agenda as the No. 1 issue , according to polling data .
That 's the justification .
It matters to people . "
Perhaps no issue has tested McCain over the years more than taxes .
Four years ago , before he launched his second campaign for President , McCain was the keynote Republican speaker at a bipartisan conference on the budget titled " Restoring Fiscal Sanity - While We Still Can . "
The event was sponsored by a half - dozen think tanks representing all points on the political spectrum .
" I'm a proud Republican , " McCain said then , by way of introduction .
" I 'm a Barry Goldwater Republican .
I revere Ronald Reagan and his party of limited government .
Sadly , that party is no longer . "
He went on to sharply criticize colleagues on both sides of the aisle for runaway " pork - barrel spending " and " expanding entitlements , " but he did n't quit there .
He also talked about taxes .
" And why do we have to have tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans when the gap between the wealthiest Americans and the poorest Americans is growing ? " he wondered .
Later he added , " We 're at war .
Tell me one time in the history of this country when this nation was at war when we 've enacted tax cuts , especially for the wealthiest . "
McCain tried valiantly to hold the line .
Twice he voted against Bush 's tax cuts , in 2001 and 2003 , angering many in his own party .
But that was then .
Now , first step , McCain wants to make the Bush tax cuts permanent ; then he wants to keep going .
He would repeal the alternative minimum tax , slash the corporate tax , increase the tax exemption for children , and , at least temporarily , allow businesses to write off the full cost of capital investments in one year .
It 'll be expensive - the independent Tax Policy Center estimates , optimistically , that McCain 's plan would add $ 4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next ten years , compared with $ 3.3 trillion for Obama 's plan - but McCain insists that he can balance the budget in four years with promised savings from running a tighter ship and increased tax revenues as the economy expands .
Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , who has sharply criticized McCain in the past , says now , " I 'm happy . "
Norquist still can't get McCain to sign ATR 's no - new - taxes pledge , but he has the next best thing : video of the candidate promising as much on national television , three times .
" With the campaign 's approval , " says Norquist , " we took those three YouTube videos and sent them to everybody and their brother on the planet . "
Now when Norquist convenes his weekly Wednesday strategy meeting at ATR headquarters in Washington , there 's always a McCain campaign representative at the table .
Apparently all is forgiven .
" He was just voting against Bush in general " is how Norquist explains McCain 's reversal .
" I think it was pique . "
McCain would never admit to that , of course .
If he 's in favor of tax cuts now , the explanation goes , that 's because he 'll insist on linking them to spending cuts , which President Bush was never willing to do .
And besides , allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire in 2010 would be tantamount to a tax increase .
" Why hammer the economy at a time when it 's weak ? " says Holtz - Eakin .
Fair enough , although clearly it remains a sensitive issue for McCain , as does the question of how much his larger views have shifted and why , as he takes his last shot at winning the presidency .
" My principles and my practice and my voting record are very clear , " McCain told Fortune near the end of our interview , and as he said so , he sat forward in his seat and looked us in the eye .
" Not only from 2000 but 1998 and 1992 and 1986 .
And you know , it 's kind of a favorite tactical ploy now that opponents use , of saying the person has changed .
Look , none of my principles or values have changed .
Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances ?
I would hope so !
I would hope so ! "
That sound like straight talk to you ?
He sure hopes so .
Editor 's note :
This article has been corrected .
The original stated that McCain planned to double the child - care tax credit .
In fact he intends to expand the tax exemption for kids .
Fortune regrets the error .

1. Water pollution
According to the Worldwatch Institute , the water is not safe to drink in many areas of China .
Industrialization has polluted many lakes and streams , resulting in chemical pollution and increased algae blooms .
Algae blooms also contribute to fish die off by chocking off the oxygen supply that aquatic life needs to survive .
2. Exacerbated dust storms
China is experiencing an increase in dust storms .
Dust storms can spread as far as North America from China and these storms can become deadly when they pick up airborne toxins from factories .
Lester R. Brown of the Earth Policy Institute cites over - plowing and overgrazing as contributing causes of the desertification process .
3. Coastline swamped by red tides
Untreated sewage is being dumped into surrounding estuaries , creating a surplus of red phytoplankton .
Red tides are becoming a common ocurrence in China , killing off marine life and adversely affecting the surrounding coastal communities .
Toxins from this algal growth make seafood unsafe to eat .
4. Thermal insulation rare in Chinese buildings
Because of poor ( or no ) usage of insulation , Chinese buildings require twice as much energy to heat or cool as those in similar climates in the US or Europe .
The World Bank states that 95 % of these buildings do not meet meet China ’s own codes for energy efficiency .
According to Wang Tiehong , chief engineer of The Ministry of Construction , 30 % of China ’s total energy consumption is used for building infrastructure , such as new residential or shopping areas .

5 . All new buildings require China to build new power plants .
Chinese infrastructure is increasing at an astronomical rate of growth .
China added 66 gigawatts of electricity to its power grid in 2005 , according to the The New York Times .
That ’s about as much power as Great Britain generates in an entire year .
6 . Heavy industry plants do not operate efficiently or control pollution as adequately as factories in other parts of the world .
On average Chinese steelmakers use one - fifth more energy per ton than the estimated international average .
The World Bank says that cement manufacturers need 45 % more power and ethylene producers need 70 % more power than producers elsewhere .
Another study done by the World Bank in conjunction with the State Environmental Policy Act , or SEPA , the national environmental Agency , concluded that 350,000 to 400,000 premature deaths are a direct result of outdoor air pollution .
7. Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is triggering landslides .
With the degradation of the Yangtze River , entire ecosystems may are altered or destroyed .
The Times Online reports that geologists have found banks are weakening as a result of water seeping out of the reservoir and the huge pressure changes that occurs during drawdowns of the dam .
A Chinese official noted that the reservoir shore had collapsed in 91 places , affecting a total area of 22 miles .
Algal blooms are accumulating downstream from the Yangtze .

8. China ’s emissions growth is 2 - 4 times greater than expected
The International Energy Agency predicted that China ’s carbon emissions would not reach those of the United States until 2020 .
The agency now states that China overtook the US in emissions growth in 2007 .
China is the world ’s second - largest consumer of oil after the US , and uses more coal than the US , the European Union , and Japan combined .
9. Extinction of Yangtze river dolphin is confirmed .
After an extensive six week survey of the mammal ’s habitat , scientists now believe that the 20 million year old Yangtze river dolphin is now extinct .
The BBC News stated that the team of scientists thinks that unregulated fishing was the main reason for its extinction .
10 . US firms are driving pollution in China .
According to Jane Spencer of the Wall Street Journal , US firms are helping to drive the current environmental degradation in China .
By demanding lower prices on products , manufacturers are forced to reduce environmental safeguards in order to compete internationally .
As an example , she states that prices on fabrics and clothing imported from China to the US have fallen 25 % since 1995 .

LONGYEARBYEN , Norway ( CNN ) --
A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday .
Dubbed the " Doomsday Vault , " the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management .
Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters ( 427 feet ) inside a frozen mountain .
Wangari Maathai , a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries .
The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred - plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world .
In all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes .
The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds .
Watch as " Doomsday " seed vault opens »
Eventually the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the Global Crop Diversity Trust said .
Do n't Miss Web site : Svalbard Global Seed Vault
The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen , in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole .
Building began last year .
The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long - term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding .
" The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , " said Cary Fowler , executive director of the trust .
" At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . "
The vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside .
" We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well - preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , " said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten , project manager for the Norwegian government .
The vault sits at the end of a 120 - meter ( 131 - yard ) tunnel blasted inside the mountain .
Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to - 18 degrees Celsius ( just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least - 4 C ( 25 F ) .
The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex , England , about an hour outside London .
The British vault , called the Millennium Seed Bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops .
Paul Smith , the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops .
" We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us , " Smith told CNN .
The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004 , the Norwegian government said .
The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity .
Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world .
The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner ( $ 9.4 million ) to build the seed vault .

Even though both Michigan and Florida screwed themselves , they are both appealing to the DNC Rules Committee to get their full delegations seated .
There are three different questions being decided at today ’s meeting . 1 ) .
Should the delegates be seated ?
2 ) . How should the delegates be awarded to the candidates ?
3 ) . Will the popular vote count ?
Florida seems like the easier of the two states to resolve .
Florida ’s argument is that the moving up of the primary date was done by the Republicans who control the state government who attached an amendment to an election reform bill that moved the state ’s primary up ahead of the party specified date of February 5 .
Except for the Clinton speakers at the meeting who called for all of the delegates to be seated , most seem open to seating all of Florida ’s delegation but giving them a half vote .
“ We recognize , in fact , that Florida has violated that timing rule , ” said Florida Democratic National Committee member Jon Ausman .
He also said that some kind of punishment is “ appropriate . ”
Florida will probably take their 50 % sanction , but the question of the popular vote may not be decided by this committee .
The popular vote is critical for Clinton who needs to be leading in some category to make the argument to the superdelegates that she should be the nominee .
The Obama campaign is willing to go along with a plan that would allow Clinton to gain a net 16 delegates in Florida .

The more difficult dilemma is what to do with Michigan , where many of the candidates , including Barack Obama , took their names off the ballot .
Michigan is proposing a 69 - 59 delegate split for Clinton .
They calculated this number based on the results of their primary , the number of Democrats who voted uncommitted , and exit polls .
The Rules Committee is skeptical about this recommendation to say the least .
Sen .
Carl Levin is speaking now , and he is calling for the state ’s entire delegation to be seating with full voting rights .
Michigan has a Democratic governor , who signed off moving their primary up , so unlike Florida , they really have no excuse .
I think that the committee will end up resolving this with a slight advantage for Clinton .
Michigan and Florida screwed themselves by gambling that Hillary Clinton would have the nomination wrapped up by Super Tuesday .
It is ironic that if they just would have stuck with the original schedule , both states would have played critical roles in the primary , and had the eyes of the nation on them .
It was simple ego on the part of each state ’s politicians , and those egos should be punished .

A STUDY in a journal , the Lancet Oncology , compares cancer survival rates across five continents for the first time .
After adjusting country data , from the 1990s , for differences in both age and death rates in the general population , Americans were found to have the best chance of survival for two of the five cancers that the reasearchers considered : breast cancer in women and prostate cancer .
( Cuba had impressive survival rates , but these were probably over - estimated , say researchers ) .
Europe lags behind America , with wide differences in survival rates , ranging from 10 % for breast cancer to 34 % for prostate cancer .
Money appears to be an important factor : America spends a greater proportion of national income on health than the other countries .

How To Survive Animal Attacks
Page 1 of 2
From 1991 to 2001 , an average of 177 fatalities occurred per year in the U.S. from venomous and non-venomous animals .
Although some of these tragedies were unavoidable , many of them could have been prevented had the victims known how to protect themselves in the wild .
Get a leg up on crusty old Mother Nature by learning how to survive animal attacks with the simple tips below .
When you ’ve mastered these , please visit our articles on how to defend yourself against a dog and how to fight a bear .

Cougar attack
Wild dog attack
If lions are the king of the jungle , then sharks are surely the sultans of the sea .
These bloodthirsty underwater predators are equipped with razor - sharp teeth , remarkably powerful tails and an unquenchable appetite for flesh .
Luckily , it ’s easy to hear these freaky fish approaching , since they ’re one of the few animals that have their very own theme song .
Should you encounter a shark while swimming or scuba diving , get into a defensive position by backing yourself up against a reef , rock or any solid obstruction that will reduce the animal ’s angles of attack .
If you are with a partner , go back to back to provide yourselves with 360 degrees of protection .
Should the shark attack , your best line of defense is to claw at the animal ’s gills and eyes .
Delivering a quick succession of sharp strikes will confuse the shark , making it believe there are multiple attackers .
Once the shark has swum away you ’ll be free to return to shore where you can sell your story to the highest bidder .
One of the most unpredictable animals in the wild ( and in many yuppie bars ) , cougars are sleek , muscular killing machines capable of running at speeds of 35 miles per hour and jumping as high as 18 feet from a sitting position .
Should you see a cougar in the wild , try to stay perfectly still since even the most minute of movements may cause these powerful predators to attack .
If a cougar does indeed pounce upon you , your best — and perhaps only — hope is to fight back .
Many outdoorsmen have managed to fend off cougars by retaliating with rocks , sticks , fishing poles , and even their bare fists .
Another method , albeit a far more dangerous one , is to try to control the animal by placing your hand behind its lower canine teeth on the lower half of its jaw .
Simply pull down as hard as you can and try to choke the animal until help arrives .
If you exert enough force it ’s possible the cougar will retreat back into the wild to lick its wounds .
Years of watching Disney films and Saturday morning cartoons may have convinced you that your typical wild dog is an amiable , wise - cracking animal .
Sadly , this common misconception could n’t be further from the truth .
Wild mutts , such as wolves , coyotes and foxes , are dangerous and sometimes even rabid animals that do n’t take lightly to humans encroaching on their territory .
Should you stumble upon a wild dog , maintain eye contact with the animal while backing away slowly .
Remain upright , and make yourself appear bigger and more imposing by picking up sticks or branches and waving them about .
If a wild dog lunges at you , remain standing while kicking the animal repeatedly in the face around the eyes and snout .
If you have a stick , deliver full , powerful blows to the animal ’s face and ribs until it finally relents .
It may be a dog - eat - dog world , but there ’s no need for you to become puppy chow if you ’re willing to put up a fight

If you are glued to the evening news or the radio , you might believe that the whole nation is waiting in suspense to see how our leaders are going to deal with the economic challenges of our day : recession , inflation , unemployment , bank runs , etc .
There are proposed laws , bills flying everywhere , candidates promising this and that , press conferences , debates , op - eds , talking heads , regulations , investigations , proposals , and policies .
Then there is the real world .
The real world is the market economy .
It is making a trillion decisions every hour .
The decisions are dramatic , decisive , and life changing .
They deal with real stuff , not vapid promises .
We see this in a crisis more than ever : the takeovers , production shifts , whole industries rising and falling , patterns of imports and exports reversing themselves , jobs changing , with tens of billions of dollars changing hands minute by minute .
Here is the pith of life .
The rest of what people think matters is just white noise .
An interesting case is how production in some sectors is increasing in the midst of an economic slowdown .
Cars , computers , and steel — important aspects of industrial production — actually experienced a marginal boost in June .
Why might this be ?
The declining value of the dollar on international exchange has made imports more expensive , and made domestic production more appealing .
This complex activity — a signal of bad economic times but a praiseworthy response to massive shifts in the investment environment — is driven by nothing less than loss avoidance strategies by entrepreneurs .
No one needed to issue a command to make sure this happened .
There were no debates or polls .
No regulator had to issue a press release .
It happens because considerations of profit and loss provide the right signals to entrepreneurs .
The entrepreneurs saw the new conditions and acted on them .
And why ?
To do what they always do : try to stay out of loss - imposing lines of production and find profitable ones .
Another dimension of this is the industrial takeover .
In Bev SA of Belgium has taken over Anheuser - Busch in the hope that it can make the company profitable .
This is partly a response to the falling dollar but also a handoff to a management team that might do a better job at doing what the company is supposed to be doing .
Concerning the nativists who say that only Americans should own beer companies in America , consider that the foreigners are doing us a favor : taking over one line of production to free up domestic resources to help dig out of recession .
Oh — and beer from Belgium is far superior to any Bud .
Earlier this year , the Royal Bank of Canada , from its US headquarters in North Carolina , swept in and took over First American Bank and nine other banks in Alabama , Florida , and Georgia .
In bank after bank , they close on Friday and reopen on Monday with a completely new name and face .
Nothing in politics happens this fast .
It is all to the good for everyone , since it puts the banks on a more profitable path .
Historically , by the way , Canadian banks are far more prudent than their US competition , so as a customer , I can only say : Hooray !
Again , the motivation is the same : loss avoidance and profit seeking , which is just another way of saying that these are efforts to make sure that society ’s resources are used in the most efficient ( least wasteful ) way .
A recession makes this approach all the more critical .
But what is really impressive is the way in which markets respond to dramatic change .
Resources move and shift in a manner that makes economizing part of the very structure of life itself .
Another example is oil .
The prices at the pump reflect not only existing supply and demand conditions but also the best possible guesses about future conditions , discounted to the present .
The prices reflect what producers believe to be profitable and they also serve to bring about the best possible conditions for economizing .
Should prices go up or go down ?
We are fortunate that this does n’t have to be decided by a government committee .
It is a matter worked out by billions of real trades around the world within the global market framework .
The response time to new information is mind - boggling .
Prices soar for months and then suddenly plummet based on changing conditions .
Everything is constantly in flux , with present prices representing the best possible guess concerning the least wasteful use of resources .
Every business in America right now is in the position of having to assess how it does business , what it pays its workers , how much to invest for the future , whether to cut back on some lines of production now , how and whether to advertise , when and how to raise prices in response to increased costs of doing business .
Again , no one waits for an order from Washington .
The orders are issued by balance sheets at the end of the day .
A company must stay in the black or else shut its doors .
Consumers too participate in these large movements of resources .
We see prices going up in all goods and services , but some more than others .
We shift to substitutes , we consider more carefully what we buy , we think hard about alternative ways of stretching the value of declining dollars .
In this way , we reward producers who best adapt to the changing environment , and best serve our needs .
Finally , consider the fate of mortgage lenders and homeowners .
The markets became wise to the fact that loose credit led to a fantastic bubble and that trillions in traded mortgages might not be serviceable in an environment of downward price pressure .
Companies that once were seen as valuable and liquid are suddenly seen as unstable and wasteful .
Their stocks are shorted by sellers .
Their price crashes .
Reality is revealed .
This is not an attack .
It is not a result of malign “ rumor mongering . ”
It is not even regrettable from an economic point of view .
Truth is a precondition for economic recovery .
Bad investments need to be avoided .
Good ones need to replace them .
That is the very core of what all this economic activity is about .
If the informed guesses of traders turn out to be wrong , there is a profitable opportunity for other traders to guess more accurately .
To dampen this spirit is to do nothing but prop up illusions and perpetuate error .
What can the State contribute to this cause ?
It can get out of the way .
It is not necessary to somehow demonstrate the superiority of markets over state planning .
This is demonstrated every single second of every day .
The politicians blather while the markets act with confidence and wisdom to achieve real results .
The only positive contribution that politicians can make is to make the market a freer environment for resources to travel to their most profitable production lines .
People say that markets are not democratic .
In fact , what we have here is the ultimate economic democracy , one in which all of us as individuals vote in the use of our time and resources , as William H. Peterson argues .
We determine , through our buying and selling decisions , which lines of production succeed and which ones fail .
But if the critics mean that markets are not politically democratic , they are precisely right , and it is a good thing too .
The price system is a system of action , not words .
It is decisive and takes responsibility .
Where political democracy ignores those without power , market democracy collects and uses all available information for the benefit of everyone .
Markets are beautiful in good times , but especially impressive in bad .
There is no better occasion than a crisis of this size and scale to marvel at how the institutions of private enterprise can cope better than any political leader , or all of them put together .

Iran has regularly executed people convicted of homosexual acts A gay Iranian teenager who said he could be executed if he was sent home has been given asylum in Britain .
Mehdi Kazemi , 19 , came to London to study English in 2005 , but later discovered his boyfriend had been charged with sodomy in Iran and hanged .
A 38 - year - old Iranian soldier who deserted rather than lay anti-personnel landmines also won the right to stay .
The soldier , identified only as BE , fled to Britain after refusing to plant mines in roads .
In March 2001 the home secretary refused the man 's claim for asylum , saying he had not only undertaken military service but had signed up as a regular soldier " without any apparent qualms " .
' Individual merits '
The conclusion drawn was that civilian deaths were an unfortunate consequence of war which did not justify desertion .
But this was overturned by judges who ruled the soldier was entitled to succeed in his claim for international protection .
Where Mr Kazemi's case is concerned , in March the home secretary agreed to reconsider his situation after his first asylum bid failed .
The UK Border Agency now says it will allow him asylum after reviewing his case .
A spokesman said : " The UK Border Agency considers each case on its individual merits and will continue to provide refuge for those asylum seekers with a genuine need for protection .
" We keep cases under review where circumstances have changed and it has been decided that Mr Kazemi should be granted leave to remain in the UK based on the particular facts of this case . "
The Home Office should not send gay and lesbian people back to countries where they will be at risk of persecution , torture or death
Simon Hughes MP Liberal Democrat MP
Simon Hughes , who led the campaign to get Mr Kazemi granted asylum , said : " Like Mehdi and his family in Britain , I am delighted to hear of the Home Office decision to let him stay in this country .
This is great news for a very decent man .
" As I have argued over the last 18 months , the Home Office should not send gay and lesbian people back to countries where they will be at risk of persecution , torture or death . "
Iranian human rights campaigners believe more than 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since 1979 .
Mr Kazemi fled to the Netherlands after the Home Office rejected his case late last year , but a Dutch court ruled he could not claim asylum in the Netherlands .
Jacqui Smith said his case would be reviewed after he was sent back to the UK .

WHEN Spike Gjerde started to build a new restaurant in an old mill in Baltimore , he did not want a slick menu with crisp , perfect letters .
“ We ’re all totally about salvage and reuse , ” he said .
The menu had to reflect the restaurant ’s goal : presenting local ingredients in a rough - hewn complex that once cast the 36 - inch - wide columns that support the dome of the United States Capitol .
So he turned to Mary Mashburn , a designer with an office filled with old type just a few blocks away .
Ms. Mashburn set the restaurant ’s name , Woodberry Kitchen , with scratched and nicked wooden type from her collection of antique block types and then printed a copy on her old letterpress .
She then scanned the result into her computer , where she tweaked a few letters and adjusted some spacing .
A new version of an old font was born .
“ The fact that the letters were distressed , it was real , ” Mr. Gjerde said .
Before the personal computer , most people were oblivious to fonts .
Some may have recognized Courier and Elite on the I.B.M. Selectric typewriter ball .
Then word processing programs offered a hundred or more fonts , from Arial to Wingdings .
More were offered in software packages and on the Internet .
Now , many people can recognize fonts by name .
Indeed , a documentary about typography and one of the most familiar typefaces , “ Helvetica , ” played to sellout crowds at film festivals .
People like Mr. Gjerde are realizing that the thousands of fonts available on the Internet are not enough anymore .
They can build custom fonts in which the letters are not perfect duplicates of one another .
They can mix in other fonts and produce something that is uniquely suited for the job .

The issue is highly controversial in a mainly Muslim country
The protestors fear such a move would usher in a stricter form of Islam in Turkey , which is a secular state .
Turkey 's parliament is expected to approve a constitutional amendment to ease the ban next week .
The ban on the headscarf in higher education was imposed in the 1980s , and has been enforced for the past decade .
A huge crowd gathered at the mausoleum of Ataturk - the man who founded Turkey as a modern , secular republic .
Fearing the gains of his revolution are in danger , the protestors came waving Ataturk 's image on banners and carrying the national flag .
Political symbol
The government - which is led by devout Muslims - is pushing a reform that would allow women to wear the religious headscarf to university .
The scarf has been banned outright in private and state universities for almost two decades .
The government argues the ban deprives thousands of women of a higher education .
But Turkey 's powerful , secular establishment sees the headscarf as a symbol of political Islam - a threat to their secular way of life , and to the political system here .
Those opposed to the reform include the military , Turkey 's judges and university rectors .
They fear it is just the first step to allowing religious symbols into all aspects of public life .
The constitutional amendment is likely to be passed by parliament , where the government has the support of the main nationalist party .
But such is the controversy that the changes are almost certain to be contested in the constitutional court .

When John Dean , author and former White House Counsel to President Richard Nixon , appeared Wednesday on Rob Kall 's radio show ( mp3 ) , he seemed willing to go further in his condemnations of current government than he has when appearing on Olberman or any of the mainstream shows on which he is a regular guest .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
In fact , Rob 's very first question about Dean 's take on Congress immunizing telecoms with the passage of FISA amendments drew a refreshingly , honestly coarse answer from Dean , who bluntly said , " Well , it looks like we have a bunch of wusses up there on Capitol Hill , not much interested in civil liberties and very interested in C.Y.A . "
Dean contends that the immunity given to telecoms by the bill is " merely civil immunity " which does not immunize anyone from criminal prosecution , including telecoms .
But he says , " Whether a Democratic administration would have the guts to ever prosecute anybody for any of this is another story . "
Mr. Dean said he also questions whether Congress ' immunization of telecoms for past crimes is even Constitutionally permissable .
He says , " It 's possible that a court could rule that Congress does n't have the power , in the middle of a case that 's being litigated to take away jurisdiction from the federal courts . "
Which makes a lot of sense .
I can envision a judge having some objection to Congress changing the rules in the middle of the game and telling him that the judicial branch has no say in a case that he is currently hearing .
That just might piss a federal judge plum off .
When Rob Kall asked about Dean 's thoughts on law professor Johnathan Turley 's statement on Olberman that President Bush has committed felonies 30 times by reauthorizing the illegal surveillance programs , Dean said he had n't heard of Turley 's remarks , but he made it very clear where he stands on Turley 's judgement compared to George W. Bush's :
" If he says that Bush has violated the law 30 times , I 'd put my money on Turley . "
Rob then asked a question that I had suggested for Mr. Dean :
What about the illegal wiretapping that occured before 9/11 ?
Dean said he did n't know whether there was evidence of that .
" Who knows if we 'll ever know what they were doing ? "
Dean asked rhetorically .
But there is evidence .
And lots of it .
Since the spineless Congress has decided to betray everything that was ever held sacred to American justice by waving its hand and making the felonies of criminal telecoms after 9/11 disappear , we now have to concentrate on what everyone already knows but has n't talked much about .
A January 2006 article on Truthout , Bush Authorized Domestic Spying Before 9/11 , states :
The National Security Agency advised President Bush in early 2001 that it had been eavesdropping on Americans during the course of its work monitoring suspected terrorists and foreigners believed to have ties to terrorist groups , according to a declassified document .
The NSA 's vast data - mining activities began shortly after Bush was sworn in as president and the document contradicts his assertion that the 9/11 attacks prompted him to take the unprecedented step of signing a secret executive order authorizing the NSA to monitor a select number of American citizens thought to have ties to terrorist groups .
The document says that in its 2001 report entitled " Transition 2001 , " the NSA said , " " Make no mistake , NSA can and will perform its missions consistent with the Fourth Amendment and all applicable laws . "
Then adds that " senior leadership must understand that the NSA 's mission will demand a ' powerful , permanent presence ' on global telecommunications networks that host both ' protected ' communications of Americans and the communications of adversaries the agency wants to target . "

Petrol station bosses were accused of profiteering yesterday after it was revealed that a garage was charging up to £ 2 a litre at the pumps .
The astonishing price - which equates to £ 9 a gallon - came on the fourth and final day of a strike by Shell tanker drivers .
The AA said that the walkout , which could begin again on Friday , had caused widespread shortages and long queues at petrol stations .
Profits of doom :
The Foxhayes garage near Exeter which was selling petrol and diesel at £ 1.99 a litre
Its president , Edmund King , added : ' If drivers can find fuel at the pumps they are paying a fortune . '
The biggest recorded mark - up was at the BWOC Foxhayes Garage at Exwick , near Exeter in Devon , which was charging drivers £ 1.99 a litre - 81 p more than the average price across the country .
The garage 's manager , Ron James , denied profiteering and insisted he was hiking the price to help preserve supplies .
Garage manager Ron James denies profiteering , insisting he hiked the price of petrol to help preserve supplies
He said : ' I am trying to stop people panic - buying .
' People have been buying hundreds of pounds worth of fuel instead of the usual £ 5 or £ 6 .
' It slowed down after I put the price up and the result is I 've still got fuel left .
' It 's been chaos and it 's still chaos .
I 've never seen anything like it in 30 years of petrol retailing .'
He added : ' We 're not being mean .
I would say I 'm a very nice person .
The price will go back to normal as soon as we get a delivery . '
But one disgruntled driver said : ' It 's just greedy profiteering .
It 's outrageously high - it 's atrocious .
It 's clearly an attempt to take advantage of the fuel shortage . '
One Shell garage in Manchester was charging 129.9 p a litre for petrol - more than 10 p higher than the average UK price .
It pushed its price up by 14p over the weekend and was yesterday no longer showing the price on its forecourt digital display .
A spokesman for Shell said the garage was ' dealer - owned ' and therefore the prices were set locally .
But motorcyclist Neil Owens , 32 , from Gorton in South Manchester , said : ' I think that the cost of petrol is a rip - off . '
Similar prices were reported in garages in Yorkshire and some remote areas of Scotland .
In its survey of pumps across the country , Petrolprices.com said the average had hit a new record of 118 p per litre .
Diesel was at 131.3 p - fractionally under the £ 6 a gallon mark .
A Shell garage near Cambridge was forced to shut because it ran out of fuel
Average pump prices have jumped nearly 1.5 p a litre since the Government issued its ' Do n't Panic ' warning last Tuesday .
Yesterday was a ' Black Monday ' for motorists as crude oil soared to $ 139.89 a barrel - 40 per cent higher than this time last year .
The surge in prices came despite weekend promises from Saudi Arabia that it would boost output by 200,000 barrels a day next month .
The Government said that 616 garages - seven per cent of the UK total - had yesterday run out of petrol or diesel .
Shell added that nearly half of the garages it owns had dried up .
The drivers ' strike over pay was due to end at 6 am today but could begin again on Friday if a settlement is not reached .
The tanker companies said the union had rejected their offer of a two - stage 13 per cent pay rise , which would take average earnings to around £ 41,500 by the end of the year .
However , sources said both sides were ' hopeful ' of a resolution when talks begin again today .
Bernie Holloway , a director at haulage company Hoyer UK , said he was glad that the two sides were talking again .
He added : ' I do n't think we should kid ourselves .
There 's a lot of work to be done , but we 're hopeful and I 'm sure that Unite and ourselves will be giving everything that we can to try and get this issue resolved . '
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said the continued talks were ' an encouraging step forward ' .
He added : ' We hope it is possible for the two sides to reach an agreement so as to avoid any repetition of this weekend 's disruption . '
Picketing continued yesterday at up to 14 refineries and depots .
Workers from rival firms yesterday joined the walkout in support of Shell colleagues at the Grangemouth oil refinery - which meant even less petrol reached forecourts .
About 60 tanker drivers from companies including BP and Conoco joined their colleagues in taking industrial action .
Strikers manning the picket line at the Shell refinery in Jarrow , Newcastle upon Tyne , said that they were told not to give interviews in case any ' inflammatory remarks ' jeopardised the negotiations .
In France , it 's Le Crawl ...
Truckers blocked roads across France yesterday in their latest protest against high fuel costs .
The nationwide day of action was announced by the country 's main haulage associations .
It included roadblocks and ' snail ' operations by slow - moving trucks to disrupt traffic .
' It 's not about punishing transport users , it 's about sending a warning to the government , ' said Philippe Fournier of Unostra , an association that represents small haulage firms .
' It has to accept its responsibilities . '
Coming a day before union action against plans to reform working hours and pension laws , the fuel protests added to a climate of discontent in France .
In Paris , traffic was disturbed by private ambulance operators protesting in front of the health ministry .
Outside the capital , convoys of trucks crawling along the highways held up traffic near cities ranging from Calais to Marseille .
' We do n't want to go under , we want to remain competitive compared with our European competition , ' Pierre Sibut of the FNTR union said .
' We 're asking the government to put shortterm measures in place to help us get through the next six months . '
Earlier this month the union said that bankruptcies among transport operators had risen 25 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2007 , with 500 firms going out of business .
The government has proposed several potential relief measures , including a possible reduction in fuel tax .

WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit today to force the Department of Defense to release all records relating to deaths , suicide attempts and homicide attempts at the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay since 2002 .
The ACLU 's lawsuit follows a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for those documents , including records relating to four specific detainee deaths that the government categorized as suicides .
To date , the Defense Department has failed to comply with the ACLU 's FOIA request .
" Over six years into Guantánamo 's existence , there have been dozens of suicide attempts and four apparent suicides and yet the Bush administration refuses to come clean about what happened , when , and most importantly , why , " said Hina Shamsi , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
" The secrecy surrounding deaths at Guantánamo hides the dire consequences of indefinite detention from the American public .
The prison camp is a blight on America 's conscience and the public needs to know the truth about what is going on there . "
According to news reports , hunger strikes and suicide attempts at Guantánamo began soon after the facility opened in 2002 .
In 2006 , after three prisoners apparently killed themselves by hanging , government officials claimed their deaths were a " PR move . "
The government refused to release suicide notes , the existence of which was widely reported .
Last year , another detainee reportedly committed suicide and a fifth prisoner died of what the government labeled " natural causes . "
Overall , the Defense Department has reported that five detainees have died since 2002 and 41 have attempted suicide between 2002 and 2006 .
However , these figures most likely underestimate the actual number of attempted suicides at Guantánamo during this period .
Although the Defense Department has acknowledged opening investigations into each of the four reported suicides , it has released no records relating to any of them or to the dozens of suicide attempts it admits have occurred .
" The U.S. government is unreasonably withholding critical information about deaths at Guantánamo , " said Jamil Dakwar , Director of the ACLU Human Rights Program .
" The public is entitled to accurate information about detention policies and accountability at Guantánamo and the Pentagon has no basis to shield these records . "
Since the U.S. government first transferred detainees to Guantánamo in January 2002 , the offshore detention facility has damaged America 's reputation around the world .
At the heart of the controversy surrounding Guantánamo are Bush administration policies that violate core constitutional principles of due process and justice : indefinite detention , lack of independent judicial review , and widespread abuse .
Attorneys in this case are Shamsi , Jameel Jaffer and Nasrina Bargzie of the ACLU National Security Project , Jennifer Turner of the ACLU Human Rights Program , Arthur B. Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area , and Deena Hurwitz of the University of Virginia School of Law's International Human Rights Law Clinic and Human Rights Program .
More details about the ACLU 's FOIA request can be found in today 's legal complaint : www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/34913lgl20080417.html
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to a previous ACLU Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
The ACLU has been posting these documents online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
In addition , many of the FOIA documents are also located and summarized in a recently published book by Jaffer and Amrit Singh , Administration of Torture .

Oil is running out .
Our yearly usage of oil , coal , and natural gas are the products of around 1 million years ' worth of organic matter converting sunlight to chemical energy , and unfortunately for us , much of our way of life depends upon the plentiful supply of petrochemicals .
A Silicon Valley startup called LS9 might be holding a solution to this problem in the form of some cleverly genetically - engineered bacteria that are able to convert fatty acids into hydrocarbons that are drop - in replacements for carbon - based fuels such as gasoline and diesel .
No one can deny the massive impact that fossil fuels have had on human development over the past two centuries .
As a fuel they have very high energy density at relatively low weight , making cars convenient and airplanes possible .
As feedstocks for industrial chemical production , they make possible just about everything I can see on my desk , from the desk itself , to the pens and picture frame , all the way to the computer , LCD , and other peripherals .
However , that utility and ubiquity comes at a cost .
Our carbon dioxide emissions are driving climate change , along with other forms of pollution , and the concentration of oil deposits in politically charged regions represents a geopolitical challenge that has much potential for instability and resource - driven conflict .
Biofuels are being viewed as a potential short - to - medium - term replacement , whereby instead of letting planet Earth do the hard work of converting plant material to oil over geologic timeframes , we humans do it instead .
Corn - based ethanol and soy - based diesel represent the lowest - hanging fruits of the biofuel movement , with simple conversion processes , and a host of externalities that make them unsuitable for long - term use .
Getting little critters to do the work for us
It does n't take a genius to think that a better solution would be to engineer organisms that can do the job for us , using biowaste or weeds rather than food , and that 's exactly what LS9 have been working on .
Details of the technology they have been using are scarce , as they 're a commercial entity and not a publicly - funded academic lab , but they appear to have engineered both yeast and E. coli bacteria to make use of " previously undiscovered metabolic pathways " to convert sugars into hydrocarbon products than can be put straight into your gas tank , or sent off to a refinery for processing .
LS9 claims that this process is nearly carbon neutral , and is about 65 percent less energy intensive than ethanol fermentation .
The bit about the previously unknown metabolic pathway is intriguing ; as far as I can make it out it involves modifying fatty acids inside the cells into simpler hydrocarbons which are then excreted , but since it 's a trade secret , we do n't really know much more .
LS9 is attempting to scale up its technology into something that could work industrially ; currently the largest reactor they have is 1,000 liters , which is impressive for a lab , but not really comparable to the millions of barrels of oil used each day in the US alone !
LS9 are n't the only company working on second - and third - generation biofuels ; earlier this year I reported on the Corvette Racing team and their use of cellulosic bioethanol from KL Process Design Group , who brought the first commercial cellulosic ethanol plant on stream recently .
As promising as all these biofuel systems are , looking further ahead , there are bound to be better solutions .
Using intensively - farmed crops as a starting point is less than ideal .
Although it 's not quite true that the production of corn for ethanol is responsible for the large increase in food prices and subsequent food riots across the world — petroleum products are involved at every stage of food production , including pesticides , fertilizers , transportation of those to farms , transportation of the crops once harvested and so on — they are often less than carbon neutral , and land given over to biofuel production is land that is n't being used for food production .
Even second - and third - generation fuels that use organic waste as a base for fuel production require processing and transport , and are n't always fantastically efficient .
On the other hand , bioengineered algae , plants , or bacteria that could use a modified photosynthetic pathway to convert sunlight into fuel , whether it be hydrocarbon - based or even hydrogen , could provide truly effective replacements for our fossil fuel needs .
Needless to say , smart people are working on making those a reality , but as with so much in life , it takes a lot of time .
Whoever gets it right is going to make a lot money .
Sir Ian is supporting openly gay US Bishop Gene Robinson
Archbishop 's position ' untenable '
Lord of the Rings star Sir Ian McKellen says he has received death threats in the past because of his sexuality .
Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show , the actor , who came out in 1988 , said the number of threats had " declined considerably " in recent years .
" I think I 've become rather boring to the public at large on this particular issue , " he said .
Sir Ian is supporting gay US bishop Gene Robinson , who has been excluded from an Anglican Church convention .
The American preacher has not been invited to the Lambeth Conference , held every 10 years , but has said he will be in Canterbury , where it is taking place , at the same time .
Sir Ian told the BBC that , like Bishop Robinson , he had received death threats - and argued that Britain was still intolerant of homosexuality .
" There are deaths in public places on the grounds that the victim is gay , " he said .
" There is violence of language which can be related to violence in action . "
On Sunday Bishop Robinson will attend the screening of a film about how the Bible can be used to combat homophobia , and will hold a question and answer session with Sir Ian .
The Lambeth Conference begins on Wednesday .

Atheism is a philosophical rather theological position wherein a person is completely against the belief of Theism i.e. the existence of God .
Whereas agnostic is a doubt .
It is a doubt on the existence as well as non-existence of GOD or any divine object .
In one word the theory of Agnostic Atheism states that whatever the situation is either the existence of God is in question or even if there is any deity it is either unknowable for human or is scientifically unproven .
Something about the Agnostic Atheist
For an Agnostic atheist the topic of God is not of much concern yet more than what we can define as apathy .
Primarily because it is an apatheist ’s belief that talking about or related to deity is futile but not of a person who stands on the ground of agnostic atheism .
What makes the logic complete is simply the concern that anything which we claim should be substantial enough to be proved by science .
There must be logic as well as a good explanation behind it .
The Mid Wall
Agnostic atheism is also considered as the mid wall between theist and atheist .
It is a state where neither we nor science can say Yes or No to any question related to a deity or divinity .
At this point what matters is the reality .
Agnosticism takes the matter of deity to the further level of science and intellect , where a person needs to be in his or her right state of mind and should respond to this matter with radical explanations .
An atheist will always say that he believes that there is no god , where an agnostic atheist will say that he is not sure whether there is any trail of the existence of god .
Why Agnosticism with Atheism
Now you may ask “ why agnostic atheism is not concerned about the existence of god , when atheism is joined with agnosticism ? ”
The answer to this question is something that we all must have learned in our school days and that is adjective pull to the noun .
In this case it is an atheism which is agnostic in nature .
We could say that reasoning and science developed this philosophical state wherein the atheist starts discarding the topic related to god and divinity .
This is the main difference between the two terms and when they both are together they create a new state which is agnostic atheism .
This definition and its use have nothing do to with any religion as it is purely a psychological and philosophical state of mind .
Phoenix ’s first dig in the Martian soil .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona
The Phoenix lander used its robotic arm scoop to dig up soil on Mars surface for the first time during its activities during its seventh day on the Red Planet .
The image above shows the hole dug by Phoenix , and below is a picture of the scoop itself , with the Martian soil inside .
The plan was to do a test dig and then dump the soil .
If that works correctly , then Phoenix will dig another scoop and bring it to the TEGA device on board the lander , the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer , a “ furnace ” and mass spectrometer instrument that scientists will use to analyze Martian ice and soil samples .
During its previous day ’s activities on Sol 6 , Phoenix reached out and touched Mars with its robotic arm scoop to make an impression on the Martian surface .
And please , no conspiracy theories here , but the impression looks like a footprint , and the Phoenix scientists have dubbed the mark “ Yeti . ”
Touching the surface was a preliminary test for the robotic arm and scoop , to make sure everything was working correctly before making the first scoop .
However , the TEGA device has experienced an intermittent short circuit , and the TEGA scientists are developing a procedure to work around the problem .
But Phoenix can still deliver the soil sample to TEGA , and the sample can be held there until the device is working .

Fifteen people have escaped unharmed in the US state of Indiana after a sky - diving plane lost power 7,000 ft ( 2,100 m ) from the ground .
The pilot told the 14 skydivers to jump to safety , then crash - landed the plane and crawled out of the wreckage .
The malfunction caused oil to spray on the windscreen , limiting the pilot 's visibility , and he lost manual control .
The plane found the runway but overshot ending up in a cornfield , turning over as its propellers hit the ground .
The parachutists , who all landed without incident , were able to watch the plane 's descent , near the town of Greensburg .
It 's a loss , but 15 people walked away because everybody performed professionally

SkyDive Greensburg
Bob Dougherty , who owns the company SkyDive Greensburg , said the plane was climbing when the engine cut out .
The pilot levelled off the plane at 5,000 ft so that the jumpers could evacuate the plane .
With thick smoke and oil from the engine affecting his field of vision , the pilot tried to steer the plane back .
" He just ran out of runway , but he was able to put the plane in a place where nobody would get hurt , " Mr Dougherty told the Greensburg Daily News newspaper .
" It 's a loss , but 15 people walked away because everybody performed professionally , " he said .

Amazon Links :
I 'm often asked by people who are new to classical music for a list of CDs or key symphonies that I think are the best choices to start off a new classical music collection .
What are ideal symphonies or works that can help you get started getting to know classical music ?
Today I 'm going to attempt to answer this question , and I 'll provide you with a brief list of works that can form the foundation of a great collection of important classical music .
Keep in mind that whenever one reviews any type of list like this , invariably one can complain that a given work was left off the list ( " where 's Chopin ? or Mahler ? " ) , or even that some work was leftthe list ( " ugh , Beethoven 's 5th again ? " ) .
This list is in no way meant to be exhaustive .
It is merely a starting point for the novice listener .
If you purchase recordings of these works and listen to each and every one of them , you 'll have a great head start on your journey towards getting to know classical music as a genre .
Where applicable , I 've included links to other posts on -- if you 'd like to read more about that particular work , follow the link to do so .
In addition , I 've included links to Amazon at the bottom of this post where you can buy high - quality recordings of these works . *
Let 's begin : These two symphonies are widely thought to be Mozart 's very best .
And you can usually find them both on the same CD .
A close second choice in my view : Symphonies 38 and 39 .
The Brandenburg Concertos are unparalleled works of the Baroque era .
And the Violin Concerto in A minor is stately , somber and stunningly beautiful .
There is no such thing as a bad Beethoven symphony - - each one is a masterpiece .
However , for some reason , the odd - numbered symphonies tend to resonate more with beginners .
Listen to this work intently , all the way though , and tell me it does n't bring you to tears .
Although he was long afraid of the responsibility of composing a symphony ( in part because of Beethoven 's long shadow ) , these two symphonies contain a beauty and a depth of feeling that will stand up against any other composer in history .
Choose any of the twelve symphonies ( #93 to # 104 ) that Haydn wrote between the years 1791 - 1795 , during which he made two extended visits to London .
They are widely seen as his greatest works , written during a particularly fruitful period of his life -- both economically and creatively .
There you have it -- go on out and get started building your classical music collection !
Again , let me reiterate that this list is in no way exhaustive .
It 's merely a solid starting point for you to begin your journey through this amazing and multifaceted genre of music .
I expect to return to this theme and I 'll bring you more suggested " listening lists " in the future .
Finally , let me close this post with a few words of encouragement .
You do n't need a great ear , a great musical memory , or any sort of highbrow taste in music to appreciate each and every one of these classics ( although I would suggest not bothering to read any of the CD liner notes if you can help it ) .
Remember , these symphonic works were the popular music of their era , and the Beethovens , Mozarts and Haydns were the proverbial rock stars of their time .
Their music is extremely accessible to everyone .
Go for it !
As Firefox 3 approaches its grand debut this next Tuesday , for Mozilla developers it means the end of a development cycle and the start of another .
Firefox 3.next is the tentative name for the next relatively minor update to the Firefox 3 branch , which is most likely to become Firefox 3.1 .
A very early draft of planned features reveals that as expected , this release will be mainly about landing stuff that did n’t make it on time for the Firefox 3 , along with the usual performance , stability and security bug fixes .
Visual tab switching and tab searching / filtering were both tried for Firefox 3 , abandoned for other more critical features , and are being considered for 3.1 .
Ctrl + Tab , a extension developed by Dao Gottwald implements both of them displaying a thumbnail of the opened tabs when pressing Ctrl +
Tab to switch tabs .
It also modifies the List all tabs tab bar button to show tabs thumbnails you can search .
Ctrl +Tab , compatible with Firefox 3 , is available at Mozilla Add- ons if you want to try these features .
Places would also receive several improvements like integrating the downloads history in the Library as it was planned for Firefox 3 , so you could define smart folders of downloaded files .
Regarding smart folders , the interface for advanced queries ( like multiple criteria ) that was available in the first betas and pulled back for performance concerns , would also come back .
Options for bulk tagging bookmarks and tag autocomplete are also being considered .
Add these to previously announced support for < video > tag , cross site Ajax requests , more power for the location bar , and some recently added support for CSS 3 selectors ( which will improve Firefox score inthe Acid3 test ) , and we can already foresee an interesting update .
Following the tradition of using places as Firefox code names , Firefox 3.1 has been named Shiretoko after the Japanese national park .
Features in Firefox 3.1 should take about six weeks to implement with the rest of the time ( the rest of the year ) dedicated to polishing and testing .
A first alpha is already targeted for mid July , just a month after Firefox 3 .
Users are welcomed to join the discussion .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a car - buying transaction , even the nicest , most honest car salesman has interests that are very different from yours .
He 's paid to sell you what his dealership has at as large a profit as possible .
The better he does that , the more he , and the dealereship , make .
You , on the other hand , want the best car you can get at the best price you can get .
Welcome to capitalism .
At some point , you have to negotiate those conflicting interests .
As in all negotiations , there are certain things you definitely should n't let slip .
Working with Phil Reed , consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com , we boiled down the six things you least want to say when you 're shopping for a car .
1 . I love , love , love this car
Even if a car has your heartstrings in a white - knuckled stranglehold , never let on .
Stay calm and pretend you 're looking over a microwave oven .
By admitting that you 're smitten , you 've given a salesman - and the sales manager and everyone else in the process - the combination to your personal safe .
The salesman will , of course , sympathize and want to help you out .
But he 'll tell you the sales manager , you see , well ...
That 's a really hot car and we had someone in here just the other day and ...
He just wo n't take less than ...
They know you 're not about to walk away .
Bottom line : Cars you 're not in love with are usually a lot cheaper .
2 . I need to get a car by tomorrow
If there 's anything worse than being in love , it 's being in desperate need .
Letting on that you need a set of wheels immediately is , basically , telling the salesman " I wo n't be thinking too much about any of this . "
He knows you wo n't be looking too closely at the particulars of the deal and you are n't likely to drive across town to try to get a better price .
It also means you 're more likely to accept whatever he shows you from the dealership 's inventory even if it does n't exactly suit you .
In other words , you may be presenting yourself as an opportunity to unload a bit of slow - moving inventory .
Even if you really do need a car quickly , act like you have a month to decide .
But you would consider buying today if you found a car that really pleases you at a price you like .
3 . I need a monthly payment of ...
It 's understandable that many car shoppers are " payment shoppers . "
Most of us have no idea how much car we can afford except by looking at how much it would cost us each month .
But saying " I want a payment of less than $ 350 a month " is like going into a box store and asking for a two - inch box .
You 'll notice that some dimensions are missing .
You could end up with a box that 's 12 feet long .
Almost any given monthly payment is possible provided the loan is long enough and the downpayment is big enough .
Over the course of , say , seven years , $ 350 a month can add up to a lot more than $ 350 a month for three or four years .
To understand how much car you can really afford , you need more than a monthly payment figure .
Know what monthly payment you want , for how long and how much you want to pay up front .
You also need a fairly good idea of what your trade - in is worth .
To keep it really simple , just figure out what price you can afford for the car - based on your monthly budget and trade - in value - and negotiate that one big number .
Talk about downpayment and monthly payment and negotiate the value of your trade - in after that .
4 . My trade - in 's outside
A salesperson will usually want to know , early on , if you have a vehicle to trade in .
If you tell him that you do and that it 's parked , conveniently , right outside , he 'll ask you for the keys .
That way the used car manager can assess its value while you 're negotiating .
It 'll save time .
Well , he has a point there .
But consider the downsides .
You 've just handed the salesperson your car keys and he 's given them off to someone else .
Guess what 's going to happen if you reach an impasse in the negotiations and decide it 's time to leave .
You 'll have to ask for you car keys back .
And , odds are good , they will have been misplaced .
You 'll be negotiating a while longer .
5 . I do n't know anything about leasing
Even if you 're never going to lease a car , you need to know about leasing , if only to know exactly why you 're never going to lease a car .
That 's because there 's a good chance someone will try to sell you on the idea .
And they might be right .
It could be a good choice for you .
But it probably is n't .
First of all , leasing makes sense only for people who know - really know - they will not be keeping a car for more than a few years .
Beyond that , you need to understand the terminology and costs of leasing beyond the monthly payments , the number salesperson will focus on .
You need to know how many miles are included in the lease and if there 's additional money you need to pay up front or at the close of the lease .
6 . My credit 's a little spotty
Many people underestimate their own credit rating - and they 're the people who are big moneymakers for car dealers .
Part of the interest you pay is shared with the dealership , so they might be pleased to confirm your belief that you do n't qualify for a low interest rate .
To make sure you 're getting the best financing deal , secure your own financing before you start shopping .
Having another loan in place - one you can use if you do n't like what the dealership is offering - gives you negotiating power .
It also lets you know exactly what you qualify for .
In most cases , a dealership 's finance office - working with a manufacturer - affiliated auto financing company - should be able to get you a more - than - competitive rate .
SANTA MARIA DI LEUCA , Italy ( Reuters ) - The Catholic Church has a vital role to play in shaping social policies but does not seek to usurp secular authorities , Pope Benedict said on Saturday .

In a homily to pilgrims in southern Italy , the Pope said the Church ’s role in politics -- where it often speaks out against abortion , gay marriage and embryo research -- was not intended to take the place of western secular ways of government .
“ The Christian community cannot and does not want ever to substitute the legitimate and right competencies of institutions , ” the Pope told pilgrims at the start of a two - day visit to one of Italy ’s most economically depressed areas .
He spoke at an open - air mass on a cliff 100 meters ( 330 feet ) above the Mediterranean Sea at one of the southernmost points of the Italian mainland .
A day after strolling through the Vatican Gardens with U.S. President George W. Bush , with whom he sees eye - to - eye on many moral issues , the Pope said the Church had the role of “ supporting ( governments ) in their work and always proposes cooperating with them for the good of all ” .
The Church often comes under fire from left - wing politicians in Italy , Spain and some other predominantly Catholic countries who accuse it of interfering in domestic affairs .
After the April election of a new conservative government , former foreign minister Massimo D’Alema warned the Church against succumbing to “ the demoniacal temptation of seeking power ” by forging a pact with new prime minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Benedict , wearing gold and cream vestments as he celebrated the mass , said the Church ’s role in influencing policy - making was especially important in societies where individualism , rather than the common good , is championed .
“ Good wins out , ” he said in his homily .
“ And , if at times it can seem to be defeated by bullying and cunning , in reality it continues to operate in silence and discretion , bearing fruit in the long term , ” he told the crowd of some 5,000 people who packed a small square .
Berlusconi himself has said his government is in favor of the Church .
“ The activity of the government can only please the Pope and his Church , ” he said earlier this month .
But Berlusconi ’s policies have not always coincided with the Vatican ’s views .
The Church has expressed concerns about a current government crackdown on immigration and Benedict ’s predecessor John Paul II was against the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , which was supported by Berlusconi .
Among the local dignitaries to welcome the Pope to the seaside town of Santa Maria di Leuca was Nichi Vendola , an openly gay communist who is governor of Puglia , the “ heel ” of Italy .
The eternal verity ensuing that ideal choice sculpted in love
The exploit of discovering the ideal gift time and again is a herculean task .
Since this quest culminates in me unwinding in the interiors of the recipient ’s brain – a view facilitated through their eyes .
A perfect gift kindles a radiant smile , but preceding this smile was a moment of absolute chaos .
Because unearthing that flawless gift is Sisyphean , as the notion of perfect is fluid .
With your sweetheart - the definition of perfect - could be Netflix and a luxurious homemade dinner date , while for your sassy friend it might be a collection of bold metallic lipstick .
But brighten up because the silver lining is right here – the ultimate guide to discovering the quintessential gift for everyone .
A chronicle defining the giftee
Jot down all the characters that define the recipient .
Make this list extensive and hit the note with the cool stuff .
Ultimately , the spotlight will be on you for being that personal and thoughtful giver .
Is your friend a diehard Game of Thrones maniac , gift a GOT inspired T - shirt where Daenerys or Jon Snow divulging “ I love you ” .
Your friend would fall head over heels with the gift .
Etching the memories
You could recreate their childhood memories or memories imprinted in their hearts .
It could be as simple as a photo frame immortalizing an exceptional juncture in their life .
Or allow them to revel in a reminiscence by a large canvas painting of their favourite childhood cartoon Tom and Jerry .
Carve a customized package
Why are gift baskets admired ?
This affair is glamorous and classy with a collection of themed gifts in a tenacious grip .
The ideal gift for a Harry Potter admirer would be an assortment right from customized Nimbus , the blueprint of Hogwarts to personalized Hogwarts letters engraved with Gryffindor , Slytherin , Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw , and the popular Snape quote ‘ Always ’ engraved on a wooden poster .
Instead of pursuing a single gift , surprise your recipient with many .
Transform the event into an escapade
Get innovative with the unwrapping !
Do n’t make it effortless for them , instead captivate them with an adventurous voyage .
Hide the gift and send them on a treasure hunt .
Let them sweat it out , but unwrapping once the hunt culminates would be an indelible one .
Let your voice resonate
Make it personal in an outlandish way – personalize it the giver ’s way .
Let each glance at the gift speak volumes about you and the bond you cherish .
If you had planned on tour with your lover or your friend , but they could n’t make it outdoors .
But you recorded the whole trip , like how you both had initially planned - venturing into those moments for you both .
That would be a perfect gift !
Be the harbinger of a social cause
Unearth their zeal and contribute to what their heart aches for .
Is your giftee a lover of animals ?
Go ahead and provide for shelter homes .
Is he a philanthropist ?
Donate generously to orphanages , broken families , famished children , advocate for women ’s rights , and what not .
Bestow to an indelible cause .
Trust me , they would on top of the world , because they are proud to have you in their life !

You can learn a lot from a rat — especially if the subject is medical cannabis .
According to a just - published study from the University of Milan — you did n’t actually think medicinal marijuana research took place in this country , did you ? — the administration of whole - plant cannabis extracts provides superior pain relief compared to the administration of the plant ’s isolated components ( such as THC ) in an animal model of neuropathic pain .
" [ T ] he use of a standardized extract of Cannabis sativa … evoked a total relief of thermal hyperalgesia , in an experimental model of neuropathic pain , … ameliorating the effect of single cannabinoids , " investigators reported .
" Collectively , these findings strongly support the idea that the combination of cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid compounds , as present in [ plant - derived ] extracts , provide significant [ therapeutic ] advantages … compared with pure cannabinoids alone . "
Ironically , US lawmakers and bureaucrats have long argued just the opposite — maintaining that the therapeutic use of the plant should remain illegal , but that its " active ingredients … could be isolated and developed into a variety of pharmaceuticals , such as Marinol . "
So if rats can deduce that whole cannabis works better as a medicine than a single synthesized molecule , what ’s stopping our politicians from reaching this same conclusion ?
The Best of Paul Armentano
BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s longest - held Lebanese prisoner , reviled by Israelis as a man with blood on his hands , will get a hero ’s welcome when he returns home on Wednesday .
Samir Qantar , who as a teenager in 1979 took part in a guerrilla raid in Israel in which two children died , is part of a prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hezbollah .
Israel is to free five Lebanese guerrillas in return for two of its soldiers captured by the Lebanese Shi’ite group in 2006 , whom Israeli Prime Minister has said are probably dead .
“ After 30 years of waiting -- I was only a year and a few months old ( when he was captured ) , I never knew him except through pictures and letters .
The moment I meet him will be exceptional , ” Qantar ’s brother , Bassam , told Reuters .
“ It ’s a moment I ’ve always dreamed of and that stayed in my imagination , ” he said , adding that fireworks , gatherings and billboards had been prepared to mark his brother ’s return .
Qantar , one of seven brothers and sisters , was 17 when Israeli police arrested him .
He was one of four Palestinian Liberation Front guerrillas who burst into a flat in Israel ’s northern city of Nahariyah and killed a policeman and another man and his four - year - old daughter .
The man ’s wife hid in a wardrobe with another daughter but accidentally smothered her while trying to stop her crying .
An Israeli court sentenced Qantar to 542 years in jail .
In the Druze village of Abey , Qantar ’s hometown , his family has hung a big portrait of him , along with a poem in his praise .
Hezbollah , which is backed by Syria and Iran , captured the two Israeli soldiers -- Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev -- in a July 2006 raid which triggered a 34 - day war in Lebanon .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at first ruled out talks on their return , but later accepted Hezbollah ’s demand for third - party negotiations via a U.N. - appointed German mediator .
BITTER PILL
Although he is Druze , not Shi’ite , Hezbollah made Qantar ’s freedom its central demand , partly because an earlier prisoner swap arranged with Israel in 2004 failed to secure his release .
Many say it was Israel ’s refusal to release him then that prompted Hezbollah ’s decision to capture more soldiers , sparking the 2006 war that killed 1,200 people in Lebanon , mostly civilians , and 159 Israelis , mostly soldiers .
Qantar ’s inclusion in the deal was a bitter pill for many Israelis loath to free prisoners with “ blood on their hands ” .
But Smadar Haran , whose family was killed by Qantar , did not oppose the deal .
She said in a letter to the cabinet that he was “ never my private prisoner ” and she had “ no monopoly over pain , suffering or justice ” -- a reference to the families of Regev , Goldwasser and missing Israeli aviator Ron Arad .
Clemency for Qantar , whom Israel had described as the last “ bargaining chip ” for word on Arad ’s fate , could also be seen as an admission that the airman ’s trail has gone cold .
Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim , who , along with two other ministers , voted against the agreement , said : “ This is not a good deal .
It is not balanced .
It releases a living terrorist and others in return for soldiers who are dead . ”
“ Qantar was a despised terrorist , but was also not important , ” Boim added .
“ But in 2004 , we ran up his stock by tying him to information on Ron Arad .
We turned this nobody into a symbol . ”
Abstract
Character animation in video games — whether manually key - framed or motion captured — has traditionally relied on codifying skeletons early in a game 's development , and creating animations rigidly tied to these fixed skeleton morphologies .
This paper introduces a novel system for animating characters whose morphologies are unknown at the time the animation is created .
Our authoring tool allows animators to describe motion using familiar posing and key - framing methods .
The system records the data in a morphology - independent form , preserving both the animation 's structural relationships and its stylistic information .
At runtime , the generalized data are applied to specific characters to yield pose goals that are supplied to a robust and efficient inverse kinematics solver .
This system allows us to animate characters with highly varying skeleton morphologies that did not exist when the animation was authored , and , indeed , may be radically different than anything the original animator envisioned .
Materials
This is the final submitted draft of our paper on the Spore procedural animation system .
It 's a pretty long paper , barely squeezing into 11 pages , and it still leaves out tons of details , but hopefully it gives a reasonable overview of both the authoring system , using our custom OpenGL animation tool Spasm , and runtime playback system .

Frequently Asked Questions
Why are there no frequently asked questions ?
Because I have n't even hit submit on this page yet .
But , if you 're reading this , that means I finally did , and you should ask some .
As you may have heard , this summer ’s most anticipated film - The Dark Knight - broods into theatres next week .
Additionally , the caped crusader will be swinging into your console this fall with LEGO Batman .
With that much attention given to the playboy magnate / crimefighter this year alone , we recognize there ’s a whole lot of Batman love being spread about .
To quench your thirst for the masked vigilante , we ’re bringing you a look back at every Bat game ever made .
Batman - 1986
Ocean Software - Amstrad CPC , ZX Spectrum , MSX
Before our hero fought crime in glorious Technicolor , he sported green and black visuals in this monochrome - ian adventure .
Apparently , boy wonder Robin has been kidnapped and the slightly chubby Batman needs to fight through over 150 isometric rooms to locate him .
Based off the comic license and campy TV show .
Batman : The Caped Crusader - 1988
Ocean Software - ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64
Data East - Commodore Amiga
Split in two parts - one for each villain , Penguin and Joker - our hero battles his way through an arcade - style beat - em - up .
Not only does Batman appear just as he did in the comics ( in color , no less ) , but every time he walked into a new doorway , the screen overlaid the previous like a comic book panel .
Batman : The Movie - 1989
Ocean Software - ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 , Amstrad CPC , Commodore Amiga , Atari ST , IBM PC
Sunsoft - NES , Genesis
The first film was essentially a licensing whore - hence the reason why Batman was on every system under the sun .
Loosely based on the first film , the computer versions varied in that Batman was able to use a grappling hook to scale levels and partake in Batmobile driving sections .
The NES version enabled you to fight through five sidescrolling levels as a smaller Batman , donning a suit composed of two shades of purple .
Interestingly , you fought mutants and robots as well as thugs .
The Genesis version was just like the NES version , only with added Batmobile and Batwing sections .
Fun fact : after you pummel the Joker into submission in the NES version , Bats literally chucks him off the cathedral rooftop in the game ’s closing cutscene .
That ’s… a bit out of character .
The Revenge of Shinobi - 1989
Sega - Genesis
Shinobi ?
Really ?
Yes - in early versions of this ninja thriller , you fought a likeness of Spider - Man , who upon defeat would turn into a purplish / demon- looking Batman .
Equipped with actual bats and pure evil , you had to defeat him to clear the sixth mission .
In later versions , Batman was replaced with an actual demon bat .
Spider - Man was still kept because Sega held the license to produce Spidey games .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite daily headlines bemoaning record gas prices , the United States is actually one of the cheaper places to fill up in the world .
Out of 155 countries surveyed , U.S. gas prices were the 45th cheapest , according to a recent study from AIRINC , a research firm that tracks cost of living data .
The difference is staggering .
As of late March , U.S. gas prices averaged $ 3.45 a gallon .
That compares to over $ 8 a gallon across much of Europe .
The United States has always fought to keep gas prices low , and the current debate among presidential candidates on how to keep them that way has been fierce .
But those cheap gas prices - which Americans have gotten used to - mean they feel price spikes like the ones we 're experiencing now more acutely than citizens from other nations which have had historically more expensive fuel .
Cheap gas prices have also lulled Americans into a cycle of buying bigger cars and bigger houses further away from their work - leaving them more exposed to rising prices , some experts say .
Price comparisons are not all created equal .
Comparing gas prices across nations is always difficult .
For starters , the AIRINC numbers do n't take into account different salaries in different countries , or the different exchange rates .
The dollar has lost considerable ground to the euro recently .
Because oil is priced in dollars , rising oil prices are n't as hard on people paying with currencies which are stronger than the dollar , as they can essentially buy more oil with their money as the dollar falls in value .
And then there 's the varying distances people drive , the public transportation options available , and the different services people get in exchange for high gas prices .
For example , Europe 's stronger social safety net , including cheaper health care and higher education , is paid for partly through gas taxes .
Gas price :
It 's all about government policy .
Gasoline costs roughly the same to make no matter where in the world it 's produced , according to John Felmy , chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute .
The difference in retail costs , he said , is that some governments subsidize gas while others tax it heavily .
In many oil producing nations gas is absurdly cheap .
In Venezuela it 's 12 cents a gallon .
In Saudi Arabia it 's 45 .
The governments there forego the money from selling that oil on the open market - instead using the money to make their people happy and encourage their nations ' development .
Subsidies , many analysts say , are encouraging rampant demand in these countries , pushing up the price of oil worldwide .
In the United States , the federal tax on gas is about 18 cents a gallon , pretty low by international standards .
But those relatively low gas taxes make it hard now for Americans to deal with gas prices that have risen from around $ 1 to over $ 3 a gallon in the last seven years .
" Everybody pays more , but the U.S. pays more in relative terms , " said Lee Schipper , a visiting scholar at the University of California Berkeley 's Transportation Center .
If you 're a European and you 're already paying $ 4 in taxes , said Schipper , then an extra $ 2 a gallon does n't seem like it 's as big of a change as Americans are facing .
Revenues from Europe 's high gas taxes are used to fund a variety of things .
One thing they have built is better public transportation , said Peter Tertzakian , chief energy economist at ARC Financial , a Calgary - based private equity firm .
They gave people an alternative to driving , something we do n't have in North America , " said Tertzakian .
Low fuel taxes and prices sprung out of a national love for mobility going back generations , said Robert Lang , director of the urban planning think tank Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech .
In fact , the United States could not have had the western expansion it did without the cheap mobility railroads and horse carriages afforded long before it became an auto - obsessed culture , said Lang .
" You could n't have Manifest Destiny unless you could move , " he said .
The automobile , and its promise of personal mobility , only deepened the nation 's love affair with travel .
" Nobody sang ' She 'll have fun fun fun until her daddy takes the tokens away , ' " said Lang .
' It 's totally romanticized . "
Gas consumption Europe vs. U.S.
There is some evidence Europe 's high gas taxes have capped its oil consumption .
Oil use in the United Kingdom has basically stayed flat from 1980 to now , while in France it 's dropped 17 % , according to figures from the Energy Information Administration .
In the United States , meanwhile , oil use is up 21 % over the same period , although the country has added more people and seen its economy grow slightly faster .
Americans have taken advantage of cheap gas prices to do other things - like buy bigger cars and bigger houses further away from city centers , said Schipper .
On a per capita basis , Americans use three times more oil than Europeans , he said .
That means Americans are more exposed to rising gas prices than their counterparts across the Atlantic .
" Five - thousand square feet in the suburbs , that 's much rarer in Europe , " said Schipper , referring to big homes .
" We dug our hole . "
-- Correction : Due to data errors , previous versions of the charts in this story were incorrect .
The charts have been updated .
And a previous version of this story said Americans pay more for gas in absolute terms , when it should have said relative terms .
Ms. Ryan and Ms. Markova have found what they call three zones of existence : comfort , stretch and stress .
Comfort is the realm of existing habit .
Stress occurs when a challenge is so far beyond current experience as to be overwhelming .
It ’s that stretch zone in the middle  activities that feel a bit awkward and unfamiliar  where true change occurs .
“ Getting into the stretch zone is good for you , ” Ms. Ryan says in “ This Year I Will ... . ” “ It helps keep your brain healthy .
It turns out that unless we continue to learn new things , which challenges our brains to create new pathways , they literally begin to atrophy , which may result in dementia , Alzheimer ’s and other brain diseases .
Continuously stretching ourselves will even help us lose weight , according to one study .
Researchers who asked folks to do something different every day  listen to a new radio station , for instance  found that they lost and kept off weight .
No one is sure why , but scientists speculate that getting out of routines makes us more aware in general . ”
She recommends practicing a Japanese technique called kaizen , which calls for tiny , continuous improvements .
“ Whenever we initiate change , even a positive one , we activate fear in our emotional brain , ” Ms. Ryan notes in her book .
“ If the fear is big enough , the fight - or - flight response will go off and we ’ll run from what we ’re trying to do .
The small steps in kaizen do n’t set off fight or flight , but rather keep us in the thinking brain , where we have access to our creativity and playfulness . ”
Simultaneously , take a look at how colleagues approach challenges , Ms. Markova suggests .
We tend to believe that those who think the way we do are smarter than those who do n’t .
That can be fatal in business , particularly for executives who surround themselves with like - thinkers .
If seniority and promotion are based on similarity to those at the top , chances are strong that the company lacks intellectual diversity .
“ Try lacing your hands together , ” Ms. Markova says .
“ You habitually do it one way .
Now try doing it with the other thumb on top .
Feels awkward , does n’t it ?
That ’s the valuable moment we call confusion , when we fuse the old with the new . ”
AFTER the churn of confusion , she says , the brain begins organizing the new input , ultimately creating new synaptic connections if the process is repeated enough .
[ ChipD ] successfully installed two NAND flash chips into his Wii .
He can keep the stock firmware on one and then flip a switch if he wants to boot using the other chip with a modified firmware .
This hack is fairly straight forward .
All it took was someone with steady hands to try it out .
The new NAND chip is identical to the original and was salvaged from a flash drive .
The chips were soldered as a stack except for the chip enable pin .
The chip enable from each chip is attached to a small switch to toggle between which is active .
You could use a TSOP socket to swap the different chips , but it would n’t fit inside the Wii case .
This little switch could be hidden easily next to the GameCube ports .
Here 's a fun question to consider : Could you maintain a friendship with a Christian who thought you would end up in hell ?
I realize that you are an atheist and that you do n't believe in hell .
Maybe that makes it easier for you to set aside the beliefs of someone who did .
Still , I am curious about whether you think you'd be able to stay friends with someone who not only believed in hell but also thought you were heading there .
I am not sure whether I 'd be able to maintain such a friendship , although I 'd probably give it a try .
Even if the Christian did not talk about it often , I would know that they believed I deserved to be tortured forever .
I think that would be a problem , and I 'm not sure I could get past it .
Hell is one part of Christian doctrine that few Christians like to discuss .
I can't say I blame them .
Reconciling a loving god with everlasting torture can't be easy .
Why would anybody worship the monster who created hell ?
Those who describe themselves as liberal or progressive Christians often seem to ignore hell as much as they can , leaving it to the fundamentalists to celebrate .
I suspect some Christians reject this part of their doctrine altogether .
Good for them !
It is certainly a start .
Given what hell is supposed to be , I think I would have trouble maintaining a relationship with someone who was convinced I was going there .
A big part of that is that if they believed I was going there , they 'd probably have to believe that I deserved to go there .
I 'd have a difficult time trusting them or imagining that they would have any interest whatsoever in my well - being .
How could they not treat me differently if they thought this was my fate ?
I imagine I 'd also have some difficulty wanting to be friends with the sort of person capable of believing in hell .
Does that seem harsh ?
How many friends do you have who think you should be severely punished for not believing what they believe .
Probably not many , right ?
Now go several degrees beyond that to imagine that the punishment is as severe as possible and that it is endless .
I guess I 'm not sure why I 'd want to be friends with someone who thought so little of me that they'd be okay with the idea that I deserved eternal torture .
The fact that I do not believe in heaven , hell , gods , souls , spirits , and the like would make little difference here .
It will still matter that they believed this and that they believed I deserved to be there .
Frankly , I 'd be baffled as to why such a Christian would want to be friends with someone bound for hell .
Do they think I 'm just here to test their faith or something ?
Regardless , I think I 'd have little desire to maintain a relationship with such a Christian .

The Tumbler is the most badass Batmobile ever ( it 's a freakin ' tank ) , but what if it was a Transformer ?

Opec believes oil prices could go as high as $ 170 a barrel this year
The price of oil has continued to climb with US light , sweet crude reaching a record closing price and London Brent rising above $ 146 a barrel .
Oil prices have risen significantly since the US government announced on Wednesday that its crude stockpiles had fallen by more than expected last week .
Brent peaked at $ 146.69 before falling back $ 146.08 , while US crude added $ 1.72 to $ 145.29 , having hit $ 145.85 .
Motoring organisation the AA called the rate of increases " eye watering " .
Absorbing prices A barrel of Brent crude has risen by almost $ 4 since the beginning of the week .
The AA estimates that a $ 2 - a - barrel rise in crude oil means an extra penny on fuel prices at the pump .
This takes a number of weeks to feed through to the fuel stations .
" The market can absorb a little bit of the increase on the forecourt , but nothing like this , " the AA 's Paul Watters told the BBC .
Currently , unleaded petrol is 118.95 pence per litre on average and diesel 132.20 p , according to Experian .
An AA survey in April showed that almost two thirds of motorists were either doing fewer trips by car or cutting back on other spending as a result of higher fuel prices .
" This is only going to happen more .
This is very very bad news for the economy , " Mr Watters added .
Fuel prices
Oil prices are expected to rise even further .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , speaking ahead of next week 's G8 meeting of leading industrialised nations , predicted that prices would climb to $ 150 a barrel .
" Unfortunately , rising oil prices create problems for the world 's economy , " he said .
Companies across the world have been suffering under the strain .
Air New Zealand has become the latest airline to say it cannot continue to absorb the rising cost of jet fuel , which is now more than $ 170 a barrel .
The carrier announced on Thursday that domestic fares would rise by 3 % and international fares by 5 % .
That followed a profit warning from Hong - Kong based airline Cathay Pacific on Wednesday .
Supply concerns
Some observers have blamed speculators for pushing oil prices higher .
However , Prime Minister Gordon Brown , speaking to a committee of MPs , said he thought an imbalance in supply and demand was the primary reason for the spike in prices .
" You ca n't put down to speculation the whole of the problem we are dealing with at the moment , " Mr Brown said .
The president of oil group Opec has blamed the weakening of the dollar , which makes oil a more attractive investment .
There had been fears that a rise in eurozone interest rates - which went from 4 % to 4.25 % on Thursday - would weaken the dollar further and could cause oil prices to rise more as investors turned to commodities rather than the US currency .
But European Central Bank bosses held back from signalling further rate hikes , limiting the damage to the dollar .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices closed at the lowest level in nearly three months on Tuesday , after a selloff was sparked by comments from OPEC 's president and sustained by ongoing worries about a slowdown in demand .
Light , sweet crude for September delivery slid $ 2.54 to end the day at $ 122.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , after having fallen as low as $ 120.42 earlier in the day .
Tuesday 's price represents crude 's lowest level since May 6 , when prices settled at $ 121.84 a barrel .
The drop began after Chakib Khelil , president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , told reporters in Jakarta , Indonesia , that the oil markets were being supplied with plenty of oil to meet demand , and that prices were being inflated by geopolitical tensions .
" Comments out of somebody like this definitely carry a lot of weight , especially with the market so nervous , " said Neal Dingmann , senior energy analyst at Dahmlan Rose & Co .
The threat of a conflict between the West and Iran has raised major concerns about supply from the Middle East .
However , there has been little saber rattling from either side since they met to discuss the oil producer 's nuclear program over a week ago .
Khelil expressed little concern about supply disruption , saying " I think there is a good supply , there is a balance in the market , " according to reports .
But he also did n't see a decline in demand - and that view appeared to run counter to the prevailing market sentiment .
" There 's a sense that supplies are not as tight , [ but ] you can't run away from the fact that demand is getting crushed , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago .
One side effect of the decline was a surge in the dollar , which hit a one - month high versus the euro on Tuesday .
Oil has been used as a hedge against the dollar in its recent decline .
" If the dollar continues to strengthen and the political situation [ with Iran ] improves , then the long - term prices will be about $ 78 [ a barrel ] , " said Khelil , who is also Algeria 's oil minister .
He spoke to reporters while visiting Indonesia 's energy minister .
Price drop : Crude prices have fallen by double digits over the past two weeks as oil investors worried that high prices for fuel made from crude oil have seriously damaged demand .
Average prices for regular gasoline in the U.S. , the world 's largest oil consumer , fell for the 12th straight day Tuesday , but remained near $ 4 a gallon - more than 36 % higher than they were a year ago .
Oil has fallen 15 % from its trading peak of $ 147.27 set July 11 , though prices remained nearly 65 % higher than they were 12 months ago .
" The market is more focused on the fundamental economics aspects than the geopolitical aspects , " said Tom Orr , head of research at Weeden & Co .
Nigeria : Worries about a demand slide also overshadowed disruption in demand from Nigeria , Africa 's largest oil producer .
Prices spiked in early trading after reports revealed that militants in Nigeria had damaged two oil pipelines operated by Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS.A ) , but then retreated .
Rebel attacks on Nigeria 's oil infrastructure have been a constant concern for oil investors , and a factor that some analysts believe is already included in the market price .
Speculation ? :
Oil investors , who have been blamed for pushing oil to record levels , have caught on to the trend of declining demand , according to one trader .
" Basically , as they [ speculators ] were the villains of pushing the market to extreme levels very fast ... they 're now doing the opposite , " said James Cordier , founder of OptionSellers.com in Tampa , Fla. , who referred to himself as a speculator .
In a report released Monday , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that , last week , more investment funds held " short " positions - betting that prices will continue to fall - than those that bet " long " - that prices will keep climbing .
It was the first time that short positions have outweighed long positions since the start of 2007 , when oil prices began climbing , according to Nauman Barakat , energy trader at Macquarie Futures USA , in a research note .
Warhammer Online has been on the horizon for quite a while , churning excitement in both veteran MMO players and gaming press with its promises of grand battles and addicting gameplay .
TGR had the pleasure of spending a mere thirty minutes with a running build of the game , and along with a friendly guide , learned about Warhammer Online ’s most exciting features : public questing and realm vs. realm battles .
Mark Davis from EA Mythic started us off with an introduction to a new MMO feature called " public quests . "
These quests , like those you are already accustomed to , give players a number of objectives to complete , but allow any player willing to take part to join in , even while the quest is already in progress .
Once a quest ’s stages are complete , players are rated by their contributions ; higher ratings offer better chances for loot and more influence , which offers players character progression outside the standard race to the end game .
In all , more than 300 of these public quests will be scattered throughout the game ’s many zones , each with stages offering different types of objectives .
In the public quest we played through , our fellow Greenskins took offense to a local village refusing to aid us in the war , so our quest required us to slaughter the villagers , burn each building to the ground , and then defeat their hero .
The most impressive feature shown to us was " realm vs. realm , " or RvR , combat , a large - scale battle that unfolds through the actions of its players .
Nearly everything your character does in a zone feeds into the zone - wide struggle between your race ’s enemies , including player vs. player combat , capturing battlefield objectives , and even gathering influence through public quests .
Once a side conquers a zone , more zones open up for battle , allowing players to march closer to the enemy capital .
The war itself is persistent , giving players incentive to return and do their part , but once an army captures an enemy capital , the war will pause to give the victors the opportunity to sack the city , gather loot , and even capture the enemy king ( Davis mentioned that they are the toughest encounters in the game ) .
Beyond being the ultimate prize for your enemies , capital cities are a powerful resource .
As the war rages , cities become more prosperous and offer better loot and tougher dungeons for its denizens , and when captured , those resources fall into the hands of the occupying players .
Characters are given three major ways to progress through the game .
The most basic is leveling your character , with an initial level cap of 40 .
Players can also improve renown by playing the the RvR game ; this gives players additional abilities , tactics , and items to use .
Guilds can also progress , using what EA Mythic calls the Living Guild system , offering players within them group rewards like a battle standard that buffs nearby players .
Warhammer Online is even taking some cues from Lord of the Rings Online through the Tome of Knowledge .
Collected in the tome is your quest log , as well as an extensive listing of your character ’s in - game achievements ; your character will earn experience points and titles by fulfilling certain challenges ( like defeating 50 goblins ) .
Many of the challenges are not quite heroic and can be earned by sending private messages to other players or clicking on your character ( " Ow ! My eye ! " is the name of that one ) .
What most impressed us about the game was the scale involved ; we can chat you guys up all night about the game ’s lengthy feature list , but seeing them all in action and working together to drive RvR combat is something that is hard to describe .
Players of all kinds will find a niche in Warhammer Online , no matter their skill or devotion to the game , that will be useful in the big picture .
Giving everyone a chance is something that many modern MMOs fail to do , and EA Mythic has taken that challenge in stride .

Many people own a widescreen monitor .
This is mainly because most laptops are widescreen and more laptops than normal PC 's are sold .
Another thing that people love these days is working with dual screens ( two or more screens ) .
I 'm working dual too : 15,4 " on my laptop , together with a 21 " widescreen .
It really improves my workflow as a programmer / designer .
One of the problems with these wide screen resolutions , is that many backgrounds ( wallpapers ) will not fit since most of them are made for a normal screen .
This is the reason I collected 33 of the most breathtaking dual - and widescreen wallpapers .

WASHINGTON , July 21 , 2008  --
More than 100 members of Congress wrote President Bush today , urging him to " halt all action " on a proposal they argue would change the definition of abortion , and drastically limit women 's access to birth control .
The Department of Health and Human Services draft proposal , which began circulating around Capitol Hill last week , would require hospitals receiving federal funds to certify that , in their hiring , they do not discriminate against people who refuse to provide forms of contraception , such as birth control pills , due to personal religious beliefs .
The proposal immediately incited an uproar among Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , and Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash . , who have also written to Bush .
Now , 104 members of the House of Representatives have sent the president a protest letter of their own .
" The draft regulation could have a disastrous effect upon access to safe and effective birth control for millions of women across the country , " the protest letter warns .
" The regulation 's definitions are so broad as to go far beyond abortion politics and threaten virtually any law or policy designed to protect women 's access to safe and effective birth control .
The department does this primarily by defining ' abortion ' in a way that could sweep in many common forms of birth control , " the lawmakers write in the letter .
" It would allow any provider , who wants to deny a woman emergency contraception or even birth control pills , to claim protection based on a personal belief that such pills fit the regulatory definition . "
Current federal law prohibits health care providers and organizations from discriminating against people who wo n't provide abortions or birth control .
The Bush administration 's new draft proposal would require these agencies to certify in writing their compliance with the law before getting funding from HHS .
The department issued a statement last week saying the draft proposal was simply an attempt to enforce anti-discrimination laws .
" Over the past three decades , Congress has passed several anti-discrimination laws to protect institutional and individual health care providers participating in federal programs .
HHS has an obligation to enforce these laws , and is exploring a number of options , " HHS said in the statement .
However , congressional critics , expressing their " profound disagreement , " wrote today that the draft proposal would go far beyond just enforcing these laws .
" The federal statutes at issue here were , in general , designed to shield different types of health care providers who did not wish to provide abortions .
The draft regulation being circulated at HHS would go much further , " the House lawmakers ' letter said .
" By distorting the scope of the laws , it would gut state and local protections of women 's right to safe and effective birth control .
This is not a technical clarification regarding abortion services .
This is a radical reversal of decades of public health work to provide contraception and family planning services that have enjoyed wide bipartisan support . "
The White House has only said that it does not comment on " possible proposed rules , " but Democrats are not hesitating to comment .
" The more I learn about these rules by the Bush administration , the more appalled I am , and the more determined I am to stop them , " Clinton said Friday at a New York City press conference .
" This is a gratuitous , unnecessary insult to the women of the United States of America .
These rules pose a dire threat to women's health , to health care providers , and to uninsured and low - income Americans seeking care .
It is a disgrace , but unfortunately , it is not a surprise . "
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also issued a statement last week protesting the draft proposal .
" The majority of Americans oppose this out - of - touch position that redefines contraception as abortion and represents a sustained pattern of the Bush administration to reject medical and sound science in favor of a misguided ideology that has no place in our government , " Pelosi said .
Obama 's vice presidential search team has floated the name of a former member of President Bush 's first - term cabinet , Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman , as Obama 's running mate .
Obama veep team floats GOP name
Barack Obama 's vice presidential search team has floated the name of a member of President Bush 's first - term Cabinet , Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman , as Obama 's running mate .
The search committee , now led by Caroline Kennedy and Eric Holder , raised Veneman 's name — among others — in discussions with members of Congress , said two Democrats familiar with the conversations .

The mention of Veneman 's name surprised Democratic lawmakers .
The low - profile Republican was close to food and agriculture industries but clashed with farm - state Democrats and environmentalists during her tenure , which lasted from 2001 to 2004 .
But Veneman , 59 , has a biography that could be suited to Obama 's unifying message .
A Republican raised on a California peach farm , she rose to become the nation ’s first female agriculture secretary .
In 2002 she was diagnosed with breast cancer , which was treated successfully .
Today she serves as executive director of the United Nations children 's agency UNICEF .
The selection of a Republican could bolster Obama 's unifying message , a Capitol Hill Democrat familiar with the discussion said .
" You select a strong independent woman who appeals to Republicans and independents , and so that 's hard to beat , " the Hill source said , explaining the logic of the possible choice .
" Choosing someone like [ Veneman ] does n't hurt you with the Democrats .
It just does n't hurt you .
But it helps you with Independents and Republicans . "
Veneman's is one of about a dozen names suggested by vetters in a round of meetings with members of the House and Senate within the last few weeks .
Veneman 's name , unlike the others , has not been previously reported .
Choosing Veneman would be a way to " show that he can get things done without all the partisanship , " said the Democrat familiar with the discussions .
" Her appeal would be nonideological .
It would be , ' I 'm just here to get the work done . '
She 's not a hot - button conservative . "
Other Republicans mentioned as potential Obama running mates include Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel , who accompanied him to Iraq , and retired Marine Gen. James Jones .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton declined to comment on any aspect of the vice presidential selection process .
UNICEF spokeswoman Kate Donovan declined to comment on the news that Veneman 's name had been mentioned as a prospective running mate to Obama .
She said Veneman is traveling in Africa and could not be reached .
Though Veneman 's biography and Republican affiliation make her a plausible , if surprising , candidate to be Obama 's running mate , the mention of her name was met with incredulity on Capitol Hill .
" Are you serious ? " one lawmaker asked vetters when Veneman 's name came up , a second source familiar with the conversations said .
The surprise stems from the fact that , while Veneman was seen as an experienced leader for her department , she often clashed with Democrats on a central battle front of the Bush years : regulation .
Veneman was criticized by some Democrats and environmentalists , and praised by agriculture and food interests , for lightly regulating the industries and for encouraging trade and biotechnology during her tenure .
When she resigned , the American Meat Institute praised her " vision and commitment . "
She also clashed with Democrats — including then - Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle , who is now an Obama confidant — over subsidies for small farmers , which they sought to expand .
In the best - known incident of her tenure , she led the administration 's response to cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis , known as mad cow disease .
The epidemic was contained , but the relatively light U.S. testing regime has led to continuing barriers for American beef exports .
At UNICEF , Veneman has traveled widely , focusing on extending children 's health services in the developing world .
Check the tires on your car .
How do they look ?
Plenty of tread , no bald spots , no wear and tear ?
If that ’s the case , you ’ve probably got a great set of tires with years of life left on them , right ?
Well , maybe not .
Those tires could actually be ready to break apart at any moment .
I do n’t like buying new tires .
Right now , I ’m shopping around for a good deal because the quote I got from my local tire store was close to $ 800 .
But I ’m wary of " deals " on tires because they actually have a use - by date .
Most people do n’t know that .
It ’s not advertised and there 's no law protecting us ( more on that later ) .
And worse still , the consequences of driving on old tires can be deadly .
This is not just about getting the best tires for your money …it ’s about getting SAFE tires .
In Europe and Asia , tire manufacturers inform customers about the dangers of old tires , and the very real dangers of driving on ‘ new ’ tires that are actually six years old , or even older .
But here in Uncle Sam , we ’re being kept in the dark .
And that ’s hardly surprising , because tires are a billion dollar business , and no company wants to destroy tires and see profits literally go up in smoke .
They look new .
They smell new .
They are new , right ?
Well , no .
The rubber in the tires dries out over time .
This can lead to cracking , greater stress on the tire ’s infrastructure and “ catastrophic failure . ”
When that happens , the tire can literally fall apart on you while you ’re driving .
The tread comes away from the tire quickly and violently .
As you can imagine , this can be disastrous ; even deadly .
So far , more than 100 deaths have been attributed to old tires , and there is currently a lawsuit against Bridgestone / Firestone for selling old tires as new .
It ’s alleged that these tires were responsible for a crash which left one man dead and a family without a father .
And yet despite all of this evidence , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) has refused to impose a six - year shelf life on tires .
All they have issued is a warning .
Why ?
We could speculate , but money talks , and how many tire companies are ready to junk thousands of tires every month that could easily be sold as new ?
A hidden camera report by ABC ’s 20/20 , aired on May 9th , show revealed some shocking facts about so called ‘ new tires ’ currently on sale .
Some tires were up to 12 years old , and were on sale at Sears , a reputable store .
It makes you wander what stores without the big name and reputation will carry .
You can watch the complete section below , this is 10 minutes of your time very well spent .
So , what can you do ?
First , check your tires .
Whether you ’re shopping for new tires , riding on new tires , or have tires that are several years old , check the actual age of your tires asap .
Knowing where to look and how to translate the code is simple enough , but it does vary depending on the age of your tires .
The highlighted section below is the complete information I got from TireRack , the place where I buy my tires and a store that is very forthcoming about both tire age and longevity :
When it comes to determining the age of a tire , it is easy to identify when a tire was manufactured by reading its Tire Identification Number ( often referred to as the tire ’s serial number ) .
Unlike vehicle identification numbers ( VINs ) and the serial numbers used on many other consumer goods ( which identify one specific item ) , Tire Identification Numbers are really batch codes that identify the week and year the tire was produced .
The U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) requires that Tire Identification Numbers be a combination of the letters DOT , followed by ten , eleven or twelve letters and / or numbers that identify the manufacturing location , tire size and manufacturer 's code , along with the week and year the tire was manufactured .
Tires Manufactured Since 2000
Since 2000 , the week and year the tire was produced has been provided by the last four digits of the Tire Identification Number with the 2 digits being used to identify the week immediately preceding the 2 digits used to identify the year .
Example of a tire manufactured since 2000 with the current Tire Identification Number format :
While the entire Tire Identification Number is required to be branded onto one sidewall of every tire , current regulations also require that DOT and the first digits of the Tire Identification Number must also be branded onto the opposite sidewall .
Therefore , it is possible to see a Tire Identification Number that appears incomplete and requires looking at the tire ’s other sidewall to find the entire Tire Identification Number :
The use of a partial Tire Identification Number on the one sidewall ( shown above ) reduces the risk of injury to the mold technician that would have to install the weekly date code on the top sidewall portion of a hot tire mold .
Tires Manufactured Before 2000
The Tire Identification Number for tires produced prior to 2000 was based on the assumption that tires would not be in service for ten years .
While they were required to provided the same information as today ’s tires , the week and year the tire was produced was contained in the last three digits .
The 2 digits used to identify the week a tire was manufactured immediately preceded a single digit used to identify the year .
Rxample of a tire manufactured before 2000 with the earlier Tire Identification Number format :
While the previous Tire Identification Number format identified that a tire was built in the 8th year of a decade , there was no universal identifier that confirmed which decade ( tires produced in the 1990s may have a small triangle following the Tire Identification Number to identify the decade ) .
And finally , hold on to your sales receipt .
Most tire manufacturer 's warranties cover their tires for four years from the date of purchase or five years from the week the tires were manufactured .
So if you purchase new tires that were manufactured exactly two years ago they will be covered for a total of six years ( four years from the date of purchase ) as long as you have your receipt .
If you lose your receipt , your tires ' warranty coverage will end five years from the week the tire was produced ( resulting in the tire manufacturer 's warranty coverage ending only three years from the date of purchase in this example ) .
For more information , you can also go to ABC here .
So , you have old tires .
What next ?
If you ’re the OCD frugal shopper I am , you ’ll have kept all of your receipts from the past few years for your major purchases ( and I consider tires to be one of these ) .
Most of us hang on to these receipts because tires come with a warranty , anywhere from 20 k to 65 k miles .
Contact the store , garage or website that sold you the tires and explain the situation .
If your current tires have had plenty of use , you may still be entitled to at least a discount on a replacement set of tires .
If you ’re a good haggler , you may get a new set free of charge .
And if you have just bought your tires , you should absolutely demand a replacement set that were manufactured recently .
I ’ll be examining my new tires closely when the arrive from TireRack .
I like a deal , but not at the expense of my safety .
If the tires are older than 6 years ( and I ’m hoping they ’re much newer than that ) I ’ll demand free replacements .
You should too .
Old tires being sold as new are not just an oversight .
They ’re a deadly deception .
Drive safe folks .
UPDATE : My tires arrived today from TireRack , they shipped in just two days and each tire was manufactured within the last 5 months .
I can heartily recommend TireRack not just as a way to save money on brand - name tires , but as a reliable source of brand new tires .
They 'll be getting my business again .

The RIAA has dropped its federal lawsuit against MediaServices , LLC , the parent company of AllOfMP3.com .
In a court filing last week , the recording industry dismissed the case without prejudice ( meaning that it can be filed again ) but provided no information on why it was abandoning the effort now .
But in comments to Ars Technica today , an RIAA spokesman indicated that the group had won , that MediaServices was out of business , and that MP3 sparks was badly crippled .
The lawsuit
AllOfMP3 was sued last year in a New York court as the RIAA claimed that the Russian business " amounts to nothing more than a massive infringement of Plaintiffs ' exclusive rights under the Copyright Act and New York law . "
The complaint also noted that " not surprisingly , that business model has proven to be a roaring success . "
No more music
AllOfMP3 has long contended that it pays royalties to Russian music licensing society ROMS and that no US artist or record label has ever approached the society about collecting the money .
RIAA companies are reticent to do this because it would look like they were legitimizing the activities of ROMS and AllOfMP3 .
AllOfMP3 has also argued that , although international music labels may not like it , Russian law permits compulsory licensing of musical works ; that is , the copyright holder must be paid , but it cannot stop an agency like ROMS from licensing its works .
The decision to pull the plug on the case now was largely a function of the court 's briefing schedule , the RIAA tells Ars .
Over the course of the litigation , it came out that MediaServices had liquidated itself and no longer exists as a legal entity , rendering the suit rather pointless .
While some blogosphere coverage has lampooned the RIAA for dropping the case and declaring victory even as the AllOfMP3 site simply shifted domains to MP3 sparks.com , the RIAA tells us that the newer site has " been on our radar screen " for some time .
What good is a site if you can't pay ?
But the RIAA is n't particularly worried about either MP3 sparks or even AllOfMP3 , whose owners have been promising a return since last year .
That 's because AllOfMP3 had most of its credit card access cut off last year under pressure from IFPI , the worldwide music trade group based in London .
The RIAA tells
Ars that the credit card cutoff has actually been extended to MP3 sparks as well , making it extremely difficult for non-Russian users to buy from the site .
( To see just how difficult , take a look at the complicated solutions to the problem discussed on various forums . )
Last year , a former MediaServices exec named Denis Kvasov was charged with copyright infringement in Russia but emerged with a " not guilty " verdict in August ( one that was later upheld by an appeals court ) .
As we noted at the time , though , Kvasov had stepped down from the company in 2005 before a 2006 copyright law update in Russia gave copyright holders a " making available " right , and his prosecution was based on the older law .
Kvasov 's acquittal does not imply anything about AllofMP3's or MP3 sparks ' legal status since 2006 .
The RIAA points out to us that a new case is currently underway against the next MediaServices boss after Kvasov , one that is based on the updated laws .
In addition , a law that went into effect on January 1 , 2008 , clarified more issues surrounding Russia 's disputed collecting societies ( such as ROMS ) that are not recognized by the rest of the world .
The new law " eliminates any question " of legality , says the RIAA , and we should see soon enough if their confidence is borne out by the Russian legal system .
Whatever one thinks of music industry tactics , it 's hard to argue that music is doing nothing but playing Whac - A - Mole with Russian music sites ; it has , in fact , had real successes .
The US music lobby has managed to make this a trade issue that threatened Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organization .
It has managed to change Russian laws .
It has managed to get credit card access to the big sites cut off , and it is continuing to push for prosecutions inside Russia .
That 's not a bad track record , and it shows just how much firepower the big content owners can bring to bear whenever they identify a central point of control .
( When they have to go after decentralized P2P file - swappers , though , the results have been far less impressive , both from a practical and public relations standpoint . )
On its blog , AllOfMP3 yesterday said that it " welcomes the decision of record labels to voluntarily dismiss their $ 1.65 trillion lawsuit against the site , " but until AllofMP3 is back online and taking credit cards , it 's hard to see how this could be much of a victory for the site .
We do n’t hear a great deal about education in the presidential campaign .
It ’s much too serious a topic to compete with such fun stuff as Hillary tossing back a shot of whiskey , or Barack rolling a gutter ball .
The nation ’s future may depend on how well we educate the current and future generations , but ( like the renovation of the nation ’s infrastructure , or a serious search for better sources of energy ) that can wait .
At the moment , no one seems to have the will to engage any of the most serious challenges facing the U.S .
An American kid drops out of high school every 26 seconds .
That ’s more than a million every year , a sign of big trouble for these largely clueless youngsters in an era in which a college education is crucial to maintaining a middle - class quality of life  and for the country as a whole in a world that is becoming more hotly competitive every day .
Ignorance in the United States is not just bliss , it ’s widespread .
A recent survey of teenagers by the education advocacy group Common Core found that a quarter could not identify Adolf Hitler , a third did not know that the Bill of Rights guaranteed freedom of speech and religion , and fewer than half knew that the Civil War took place between 1850 and 1900 .

THE remains of a woman have been found sitting in front of her TV - 42 years after she was reported missing .
Hedviga Golik , who was born in 1924 , had apparently made herself a cup of tea before sitting in her favourite armchair in front of her black and white television .
Croatian police said she was last seen by neighbours in 1966 , when she would have been 42 years old .
Her neighbours thought she had moved out of her flat in the capital , Zagreb .
But she was found by police and bailiffs who had broken in to help the authorities establish who owned the flat .
A police spokesman said : " So far , we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in .
" When officers went there , they said it was like stepping into a place frozen in time .
" The cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades .
Nothing had been disturbed for decades , even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there . "
Neighbours were shocked by the discovery .
Jadranka Markic was nine when Hedviga " vanished " .
She said : " I still remember her .
She was a quiet woman who kept herself to herself but was polite .
We all thought that she had just moved out and gone to live with relatives . "
On top of fuel - related price rises , the phasing - out of free drinks , and tough security measures , more misery is about to be heaped on America 's air passengers : a major airline is cancelling its in - flight film service .
US Airways will stop showing films on all domestic flights this autumn , since the need to save money has become a more pressing concern than making sure customers are entertained .
Rising aviation - fuel costs are eating into profit margins and , by removing video systems that weigh more than 500 lb ( 227kg ) each , US Airways hopes to save $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) each year .
The move will also save the company from having to pay many millions to film studios to secure broadcasting rights .

If other airlines follow suit , it will spell trouble for Hollywood 's already cash - strapped producers .
So - called " non-theatrical " distribution contributes an estimated $ 25 m - a - year to each major studio , with film and television sales to airlines accounting for roughly 80 per cent of that total .
Since studios are already counting the cost of the recent 100 - day writers strike , together with an ongoing pay dispute with actors that has the industry in a state of " virtual strike , " the news comes at a bad time .
Most are trying to put a brave face on things , in public at least .
" I do n't expect the national airlines will follow suit , " Julian Levin , Fox 's executive in charge of non-theatrical sales , told the Hollywood Reporter .
" I think they will continue to offer entertainment to their passengers , even in the extremely difficult environment of rising fuel costs . "
Another executive told the newspaper : " This is probably not an industry trend , as US Airways is in the most trouble right now . "
The wider troubles facing the air industry are still likely to hurt Hollywood because of big cuts to the total number of daily flights .
Deals between studios and airlines vary but fewer flights generally means lower revenue for film - makers .
The Regevs wanted privacy .
But that did n’t stop dozens of friends , neighbors and schoolchildren from lighting candles outside their home in a quiet suburb of Haifa .
Or TV crews from filming the vigil .
Or viewers all over Israel from watching it live .
Eldad Regev and fellow soldier Ehud Goldwasser were national figures .
And they were finally coming home .
Israeli leaders had held out little hope that the two army reservists , whose capture set off a full - scale war with Lebanon ’s Hezbollah guerrillas two summers ago , were still alive .
But hope was all the two families could cling to , and for a few hours Wednesday morning people across the country were drawn into the suspense .
When threatened from outside , Israeli Jews relate to one another like members of an extended family .
The anguish felt by the Goldwassers and Regevs has been widely shared in a country where most young people serve in the military .
Their private campaign became a national crusade .

That solidarity helps explain how the two families managed to press reluctant Israeli leaders into trading a notorious killer and four other jailed Lebanese militants for their sons in a U.N. - mediated deal with Hezbollah .
And it explains the grief that washed over the country just before 10 a.m. as TV broadcasts showed Hezbollah militants deliver two black coffins to the Lebanese side of a coastal border gate .
Only then were the soldiers ’ deaths confirmed .
“ In Israel , the nation is in tears , ” President Shimon Peres said .
“ Today , all of us are the Goldwasser and Regev families . ”

Through television Israelis have come to know Shlomo and Mickey Goldwasser , whose son was 30 when he and Regev were captured on July 12 , 2006 .
Karnit Goldwasser , who had married the reservist 10 months earlier , has become a celebrity for her globe - trotting campaign on his behalf .
Portraits of the two men , with the slogan “ Bring our sons home , ” were ubiquitous in Israel -- Goldwasser , the professional photographer in civilian life , and Regev , whose acceptance to law school came a few days after his capture at age 26 .
That intimacy gave their families little room for private grief over their deaths .
Facing a crowd of reporters in his hometown of Nahariya , Shlomo Goldwasser said the image of the coffins hit him like “ a punch in the gut . ”
Regev ’s aunt Hannah screamed , “ Eldad !
Eldad !
What have they done to you ? ” and collapsed outside the family ’s home after watching the same televised scene .

“ It was horrible to see , ” Zvi Regev , the soldier ’s father , said later .
“ I asked them to turn off the TV . ”
David Druckman , the rabbi in the Regevs ’ town , criticized the swap as an invitation to more elaborate operations to seize Israeli soldiers .
“ This is a black day , ” he said .
But surveys show a majority of Israelis supported the deal because it upheld an unwritten pact between the country ’s leaders and the public : Israelis send their sons and daughters to mandatory military service , ready to go to war ; leaders do everything possible to bring them home , dead or alive , from battle .
“ This closes a circle for me , ” said Ira Ben - Giat , whose son died on the 32nd day of the 34 - day war against Hezbollah , a conflict Israel pursued in part to retrieve the two captured soldiers .
“ I was waiting for a justification to have sacrificed my son , waiting for these two boys to return home .
Today gives me this reason , and a reason to send my other two children to the army . ”

Though that kind of motivation is a source of strength for Israel , it means the country pays dearly for each captured soldier .
Israel faces another such test as it negotiates with Hamas for the Palestinian militant group ’s release of Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier who was captured in June 2006 and is reportedly alive in the Gaza Strip .
Ismail Haniyeh , the Hamas leader who runs Gaza , warned Wednesday that Israel , which is balking at the group ’s demand that it free thousands of Palestinian prisoners , will have to “ pay the price ” for Shalit ’s return .
But first the Goldwassers and Regevs have unfinished business with Hezbollah .
They want Israel to extract a report from the militant group explaining when and how their sons died .
They were believed to have been seriously wounded when captured ; Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has said they were taken alive .
Nasrallah shed no light on that question in a speech hailing the prisoners ’ return to Lebanon .
He said a key to the success of the swap was “ the failure of the enemy ’s security and secret services to learn the fate ” of the soldiers until the very last minute .

NEW YORK , July 10 ( UPI ) -- Ruth Greenglass , who helped send her sister - in - law Ethel Rosenberg to the electric chair in the '50s Rosenberg atomic bomb spy case , has died at the age of 84 .
Greenglass , whose damning testimony was later called into question , died April 7 in New York where she had lived under an assumed name for more than four decades , the New York Times reported .

Her death was disclosed in court papers June 23 , the day the federal government agreed to release secret grand jury testimony , 57 years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage .
David Greenglass , Ethel Rosenberg 's brother , had been recruited by Rosenberg to get information on the atomic bomb at the Manhattan Project where Greenglass worked .
Rosenberg eventually confessed to espionage but the case against his wife remained flimsy until David and Ruth Greenglass linked her to the spying activities by testifying she had typed the secret information notes supplied by her brother .
The Rosenbergs were executed on June 19 , 1953 .
Much later , Greenglass admitted in the book " The Brother : The Untold Story of the Rosenberg Case , " that he had lied on the stand , that his wife probably had done the typing .
WHEN the NBC News host Tim Russert died on June 13 , NBC tried to hold back the news from going public for more than an hour to notify his family vacationing in Italy and presumably to prepare for what became six hours of coverage on its cable news outlet , MSNBC .
And King Canute , ancient legend has it , tried to hold back the tide .
Mr. Russert collapsed from a heart attack in NBC ’s Washington newsroom around 1:40 p.m. ; he was treated there and then taken to a hospital , arriving at 2:23 and being pronounced dead shortly thereafter , according to press accounts .
The network , in the voice of its respected former anchor , Tom Brokaw , announced the news at 3:39 .
Long before Mr. Russert ’s death was reported on air , however , it was flashing across the Internet via the text - messaging service Twitter and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia .
Television networks have a tradition of allowing a network suffering a death to make the announcement first .
Other news outlets , including The New York Times and The New York Post , were about five minutes earlier in reporting Mr. Russert ’s death for their Web sites .

One million deaths is a statistic . "

What do monkeys have to do with war , oppression , crime , racism and even e-mail spam ?
You 'll see that all of the random ass - headed cruelty of the world will suddenly make perfect sense once we go Inside the Monkeysphere .
Not so easy now , is it ?
So how many monkeys would you have to own before you could n't remember their names ?
At what point , in your mind , do your beloved pets become just a faceless sea of monkey ?
Even though each one is every bit the monkey Slappy was , there 's a certain point where you will no longer really care if one of them dies .
Now , imagine you get four more monkeys .
We 'll call them Tito , Bubbles , Marcel and ShitTosser .
Imagine personalities for each of them now .
Maybe one is aggressive , one is affectionate , one is quiet , the other just throws shit all the time .
But they 're all your personal monkey friends .
Imagine you have Slappy as a pet .
Imagine a personality for him .
Maybe you and he have little pirate monkey adventures and maybe even join up to fight crime .
Think how sad you'd be if Slappy died .

That brain , of course , was human .
Probably from a homeless man they snatched off the streets .
Most monkeys operate in troupes of 50 or so .
But somebody slipped them a slightly larger brain and they estimated the ideal group or society for this particular animal was about 150 .
They cut up so many monkey brains , in fact , that they found they could actually take a brain they had never seen before and from it they could accurately predict what size tribes that species of creature formed .
You see , monkey experts performed a monkey study a while back , and discovered that the size of the monkey 's monkey brain determined the size of the monkey groups the monkeys formed .
The bigger the brain , the bigger the little societies they built .

People toss half - full bottles of drain cleaner right into the barrel , without a second thought of what would happen if the trash man got it splattered into his eyes .
Why ?
Because the trash guy exists outside the Monkeysphere .
That this was such an unusual thing to do illustrates my monkey point .
None of us spend much time worrying about the garbage man 's welfare even though he performs a crucial role in not forcing us to live in a cave carved from a mountain of our own filth .
We do n't usually consider his safety or comfort at all and if we do , it 's not in the same way we would worry over our best friend or wife or girlfriend or even our dog .
Famous news talking guy Tim Russert tells a charming story about his father , in his book Big Russ and Me ( the title referring to his on - and - off romance with actor Russell Crowe ) .
Russert 's dad used to take half an hour to carefully box up any broken glass before taking it to the trash .
Why ?
Because " The trash guy might cut his hands . "
It goes much , much deeper than that .
Let 's try an example .

" There 's that word again ... "
The Monkeysphere is the group of people who each of us , using our monkeyish brains , are able to conceptualize as people .
If the monkey scientists are monkey right , it 's physically impossible for this to be a number much larger than 150 .
Most of us do not have room in our Monkeysphere for our friendly neighborhood sanitation worker .
So , we do n't think of him as a person .
We think of him as The Thing That Makes The Trash Go Away .
And even if you happen to know and like your particular garbage man , at one point or another we all have limits to our sphere of monkey concern .
It 's the way our brains are built .
We each have a certain circle of people who we think of as people , usually our own friends and family and neighbors , and then maybe some classmates or coworkers or church or suicide cult .
Those who exist outside that core group of a few dozen people are not people to us .
They 're sort of one - dimensional bit characters .
Remember the first time , as a kid , you met one of your school teachers outside the classroom ?
Maybe you saw old Miss Puckerson at Taco Bell eating refried beans through a straw , or saw your principal walking out of a dildo shop .
Do you remember that surreal feeling you had when you saw these people actually had lives outside the classroom ?
I mean , they 're not people .
They 're teachers .
" So ?
What difference does all this make ? "
Oh , not much .
It 's just the one single reason society does n't work .
It 's like this : which would upset you more , your best friend dying , or a dozen kids across town getting killed because their bus collided with a truck hauling killer bees ?
Which would hit you harder , your Mom dying , or seeing on the news that 15,000 people died in an earthquake in Iran ?
They 're all humans and they are all equally dead .
But the closer to our Monkeysphere they are , the more it means to us .
Just as your death wo n't mean anything to the Chinese or , for that matter , hardly anyone else more than 100 feet or so from where you 're sitting right now .

" Why should I feel bad for them ?
I do n't even know those people ! "
Exactly .
This is so ingrained that to even suggest you should feel their deaths as deeply as that of your best friend sounds a little ridiculous .
We are hard - wired to have a drastic double standard for the people inside our Monkeysphere versus the 99.999 % of the world 's population who are on the outside .
Think about this the next time you get really pissed off in traffic , when you start throwing finger gestures and wedging your head out of the window to scream , " LEARN TO FUCKING DRIVE , FUCKER !! "
Try to imagine acting like that in a smaller group .
Like if you 're standing in an elevator with two friends and a coworker , and the friend goes to hit a button and accidentally punches the wrong one .
Would you lean over , your mouth two inches from her ear , and scream " LEARN TO OPERATE THE FUCKING ELEVATOR BUTTONS , SHITCAMEL !! "
They 'd think you 'd gone insane .
We all go a little insane , though , when we get in a group larger than the Monkeysphere .
That 's why you get that weird feeling of anonymous invincibility when you 're sitting in a large crowd , screaming curses at a football player you 'd never dare say to his face .
Related :
" Well , I 'm nice to strangers .
Have you considered that maybe you 're just an asshole ? "
Sure , you probably do n't go out of your way to be mean to strangers .
You do n't go out of your way to be mean to stray dogs , either .
The problem is that eventually , the needs of you or those within your Monkeysphere will require screwing someone outside it ( even if that need is just venting some tension and anger via exaggerated insults ) .
This is why most of us would n't dream of stealing money from the pocket of the old lady next door , but do n't mind stealing cable , adding a shady exemption on our tax return , or quietly celebrating when they forget to charge us for something at the restaurant .
You may have a list of rationalizations long enough to circle the Earth , but the truth is that in our monkey brains the old woman next door is a human being while the cable company is a big , cold , faceless machine .
That the company is , in reality , nothing but a group of people every bit as human as the old lady , or that some kind old ladies actually work there and would lose their jobs if enough cable were stolen , rarely occurs to us .
That 's one of the ingenious things about the big - time religions , by the way .
The old religious writers knew it was easier to put the screws to a stranger , so they taught us to get a personal idea of a God in our heads who says , " No matter who you hurt , you 're really hurting me .
Also , I can crush you like a grape . "
You must admit that if they were n't writing words inspired by the Almighty , they at least understood the Monkeysphere .
It 's everywhere .
Once you grasp the concept , you can see examples all around you .
You 'll walk the streets in a daze , like Roddy Piper after putting on his X - ray sunglasses in They Live .
But wait , because this gets much bigger and much , much stranger ...

" So you 're going to tell us that this Monkeysphere thing runs the whole world ?
Also ,
They Live sucked . "
Go flip on the radio .
Listen to the conservative talk about " The Government " as if it were some huge , lurking dragon ready to eat you and your paycheck whole .
Never mind that the government is made up of people and that all of that money they take goes into the pockets of human beings .
Talk radio's Rush Limbaugh is known to tip 50 % at restaurants , but flies into a broadcast tirade if even half that dollar amount is deducted from his paycheck by " The Government . "
That 's despite the fact that the money helps that very same single mom he had no problem tipping in her capacity as a waitress .
Now click over to a liberal show now , listen to them describe " Multinational Corporations " in the same diabolical terms , an evil black force that belches smoke and poisons water and enslaves humanity .
Is n't it strange how , say , a lone man who carves and sells children 's toys in his basement is a sweetheart who just loves bringing joy at Christmas , but a big - time toy corporation ( which brings toys to millions of kids at Christmas ) is an inhuman soul - grinding greed machine ?
Strangely enough , if the kindly lone toy making guy made enough toys and hired enough people and expanded to enough shops , we 'd eventually stop seeing it as a toy - making shop and start seeing it as the fiery Orc factories of Mordor .
And if you 've just thought , " Well , those talk show hosts are just a bunch of egomaniacal blowhards anyway , " you 've just done it again , turned real humans into two - word cartoon characters .
It 's no surprise , you do it with pretty much all six billion human beings outside the Monkeysphere .

" So I 'm supposed to suddenly start worrying about six billion strangers ?
That 's not even possible ! "
That 's right , it is n't possible .
That 's the point .
What is hard to understand is that it's also impossible for them to care about you .
That 's why they do n't mind stealing your stereo or vandalizing your house or cutting your wages or raising your taxes or bombing your office building or choking your computer with spam advertising diet and penis drugs they know do n't work .
You 're outside their Monkeysphere .
In their mind , you 're just a vague shape with a pocket full of money for the taking .
Think of Osama Bin Laden .
Did you just picture a camouflaged man hiding in a cave , drawing up suicide missions ?
Or are you thinking of a man who gets hungry and has a favorite food and who had a childhood crush on a girl and who has athlete 's foot and chronic headaches and wakes up in the morning with a boner and loves volleyball ?
Something in you , just now , probably was offended by that .
You think there 's an effort to build sympathy for the murderous fuck .
Is n't it strange how simply knowing random human facts about him immediately tugs at your sympathy strings ?
He comes closer to your Monkeysphere , he takes on dimension .
Now , the cold truth is this Bin Laden is just as desperately in need of a bullet to the skull as the raving four - color caricature on some redneck 's T - shirt .
The key to understanding people like him , though , is realizing that we are the caricature on his T - shirt .

" So you 're using monkeys to claim that we 're all a bunch of Osama Bin Ladens ? "
Sort of .
Listen to any 16 year - old kid with his first job , going on and on about how the boss is screwing him and the government is screwing him even more ( " What 's FICA ?!?! " he screams as he looks at his first paycheck ) .
Then watch that same kid at work , as he drops a hamburger patty on the floor , picks it up , and slaps in on a bun and serves it to a customer .
In that one dropped burger he has everything he needs to understand those black - hearted politicians and corporate bosses .
They see him in the exact same way he sees the customers lined up at the burger counter .
Which is , just barely .
In both cases , for the guy making the burger and the guy running Exxon , getting through the workweek and collecting the paycheck are all that matters .
No thought is given to the real human unhappiness being spread by doing it shittily ( ever gotten so sick from food poisoning you thought your stomach lining was going to fly out of your mouth ? )
That many customers or employees just can't fit inside the Monkeysphere .
The kid will protest that he should n't have to care for the customers for minimum wage , but the truth is if a man does n't feel sympathy for his fellow man at $ 6.00 an hour , he wo n't feel anything more at $ 600,000 a year .
Or , to look at it the other way , if we 're allowed to be indifferent and even resentful to the masses for $ 6.00 an hour , just think of how angry the some Pakistani man is allowed to be when he 's making the equivalent of six dollars a week .

" You 've used the word ' monkey ' more than 50 times , but the same principle hardly applies .
Humans have been to the moon .
Let 's see the monkeys do that . "
It does n't matter .
It 's just an issue of degree .
There 's a reason why legendary monkeytician Charles Darwin and his assistant , Jeje ( pronounced " heyhey " )
Santiago deduced that humans and chimps were evolutionary cousins .
As sophisticated as we are ( compare our advanced sewage treatment plants to the chimps ' primitive technique of hurling the feces with their bare hands ) , the inescapable truth is we are just as limited by our mental hardware .
The primary difference is that monkeys are happy to stay in small groups and rarely interact with others outside their monkey gang .
This is why they rarely go to war , though when they do it is widely thought to be hilarious .
Humans , however , require cars and oil and quality manufactured goods by the fine folks at 3 M and Japanese video games and worldwide internets and , most importantly , governments .
All of these things take groups larger than 150 people to maintain effectively .
Thus , we routinely find ourselves functioning in bunches larger than our primate brains are able to cope with .
This is where the problems begin .
Like a fragile naked human pyramid , we are simultaneously supporting and resenting each other .
We bitch out loud about our soul - sucking job as an anonymous face on an assembly line , while at the exact same time riding in a car that only an assembly line could have produced .
It 's a constant contradiction that has left us pissed off and joining informal wrestling clubs in basements .
This is why I think it was with a great burden of sadness that Darwin turned to his assistant and lamented , " Jeje , we 're the monkeys . "

If you think about it , our entire society has evolved around the limitations of the Monkeysphere .
There is a reason why all of the really phat-ass nations with the biggest SUV's with the shiniest 22 - inch rims all have some kind of representative democracy ( where you vote for people to do the governing for you ) and all of them are , to some degree , capitalist ( where people actually get to buy property and keep some of what they earn ) .
Above : Democracy
A representative democracy allows a small group of people to make all of the decisions , while letting us common people feel like we 're doing something by going to a polling place every couple of years and pulling a lever that , in reality , has about the same effect as the darkness knob on your toaster .
We can simultaneously feel like we 're in charge while being contained enough that we can't cause any real monkey mayhem once we fly into one of our screeching , arm - flapping monkey frenzies ( " A woman showed her boob at the Super Bowl !
We want a boob and football ban immediately ! " )
Conversely , some people in the distant past naively thought they could sit all of the millions of monkeys down and say , " Okay , everybody go pick the bananas , then bring them here , and we 'll distribute them with a complex formula determining banana need !
Now go gather bananas for the good of society ! "
For the monkeys it was a confused , comical , tree - humping disaster .
Later , a far more realistic man sat the monkeys down and said , " You want bananas ?
Each of you go get your own .
I 'm taking a nap . "
That man , of course , was German philosopher Hans Capitalism .
As long as everybody gets their own bananas and shares with the few in their Monkeysphere , the system will thrive even though nobody is even trying to make the system thrive .
This is perhaps how Ayn Rand would have put it , had she not been such a hateful bitch .
Then , some time in the Third Century , French philosopher Pierre " Frenchy " LaFrench invented racism .
Above : The French
This was a way of simplifying the too - complex - for - monkeys world by imagining all people of a certain race as being the same person , thinking they all have the same attitudes and mannerisms and tastes in food and clothes and music .
It sort of works , as long as we think of that person as being a good person ( " Those Asians are so hard - working and precise and well - mannered ! " ) but when we start seeing them as being one , giant , gaping asshole ( the French , ironically ) our monkey happiness again breaks down .
It 's not all the French 's fault .
The truth is , all of these monkey management schemes only go so far .
For instance , today one in four Americans has some kind of mental illness , usually depression .
One in four .
Watch a basketball game .
The odds are at least two of those people on the floor are mentally ill .
Look around your house ; if everybody else there seems okay , it 's you .
Is it any surprise ?
You turn on the news and see a whole special on the Obesity Epidemic .
You 've had this worry laid on your shoulders about millions of other people eating too much .
What exactly are you supposed to do about the eating habits of 80 million people you do n't even know ?
You 've taken on the pork - laden burden of all these people outside the Monkeysphere and you now carry that useless weight of worry like , you know , some kind of animal on your back .
Food stamp use hits all - time high in Ohio Associated Press

Amid a sluggish economy , a record 1.1 million Ohioans are getting food stamps , the states welfare agency said .
That s about 10 percent of the states population .
Caseloads have almost doubled since 2001 , when an estimated 628,000 people were in the program , according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services .
Low wages , unemployment and more expensive groceries , gasoline and other necessities have contributed to financial hardships facing many families .
Ohios jobless rate is 5.3 percent , up from 4.4 percent in 2001 .
Caseloads have been increasing for the past seven years , said Brian Harter , spokesman for the Job and Family Services Department , which oversees the food stamp program .
 The economy and loss of manufacturing jobs are at the root of whats going on .
But lately ( its ) the rising cost of transportation and food  people who were barely getting by , are not getting by ,  said Jack Frech , director of the Athens County Department of Job and Family Services in southeast Ohio .
 It has pressed folks to the edge to have to rely on food stamps . 
Another 500,000
Ohioans are eligible for the program but not enrolled , experts who study poverty say .
Those in households that make up to 130 percent of the federal poverty level  $ 22,880 for a family of three  and with assets no greater than $ 2,000 , in most cases , are eligible for food stamps .
The federal government gives eligible families $ 100 a month in food stamps while the state covers administrative costs .
Recipients , however , are buying less with the money , advocates say .
 Food stamps provide only about $ 1 per person , per meal .
Who in the world is buying groceries with that ?  asked Lisa Hamler - Fugitt , executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Food Bank in Columbus .
On average , food stamps are now providing less than two weeks of groceries .
 There s the presumption that folks have the cash to make up the rest .
Well , they dont ,  Frech said .
Food pantries and soup kitchens across the state have been facing record demands , but like families , are having trouble keeping up .
In central Ohio , demand at the Mid-Ohio Food Bank in January was up 14 percent over the same period a year ago , with 120,000 requests for food .
The increased demand coupled with rising food costs and fewer donations have forced the food bank to reduce the five - day supply of food it had been giving out to a three - day supply .
 Milk is up 25 percent ,  said Mid-Ohio president Matt Habash .
 Applesauce , a big staple at food banks , has gone from $ 9 to $ 15 a case . 
In other areas of the state , pantries with their supplies depleted have been forced to temporarily close .
 The shortages are a double whammy for people who have been relying on food stamps and pantries ,  Hamler - Fugitt said .
What is " Project Integrity Management " ?
How is it different from Configuration Management ?
How does it make it any easier to prevent the dreaded project meltdown ?
I 'm glad you asked .
As mentioned in a previous article , Configuration Management attempts to control elements of a project , specifically controlling and managing the constant change of information associated with the project .
The amount of information to be tracked can be overwhelming , and the task soon becomes too complex to be performed manually .
This leads most projects to seek a " toolset " to manage their configuration for them .
While many commercial and some open source toolsets exist today , they all seem to be solving different problems .
This is most likely due to the variations in different people 's understanding of what Configuration Management consists of .
What many projects call CM is actually not configuration management at all , but simply source code control .
For this task , there are a number of software packages available that provide varying degrees of functionality and frustration .
But source code control is not configuration management .
I would even go so far as to say that it is not even part of the configuration management process , but I will save that argument for a later time when I feel like starting a flame war .
At this point you may be thinking " this guy is either crazy or high " !
I assure you that I am neither .
Read on .
In the interest of avoiding splitting hairs on what Configuration Management is or is not , I have opted to create a new term altogether that will represent the concepts that I feel are the ones that need to be defined in order to get a handle on the mess that many of us know as the " development project " .
This term is Project Integrity Management and although it is similar in some ways to Configuration Management , the two are not interchangeable , at least not with the definitions I have seen of CM .
So from here on out we will be speaking of IM instead of CM unless I am referring specifically to a Configuration Management concept .
First of all , IM is not source code control .
This has been done many times over and , although I do n't think that the approaches that are currently being used are great , I have nothing to add to that debate .
It is n't that I do n't think source control is important , I just think that the process is well understood and we should focus on some of the more vexing problems that have not been so thoroughly studied and developed for .
At the highest level , IM consists of the two following areas : VersioningEnvironment Management
These two concepts represent everything needed to completely track and control a project 's variables .
As you may have guessed , there are many lower levels to these concepts which we will explore , but first I would like to describe what is meant by these two terms .
Versioning is the most important concept in IM .
Without versioning , the rest is impossible .
In IM , everything is versioned .
If it is not versionable , we are not interested in it because the definition of " versionable " is " possible to change " .
If something is impossible to change throughout the life of a project , then why would we care about it ?
It is in an eternally known state and tracking it would be silly .
What would we track ?
The catch in this definition is the very important word " possible " is a pretty wide - open one .
For example , you may consider that the operating system that is being developed against is not going to change during the project , but you would likely be wrong .
Service packs change operating systems all of the time .
Servers can crash and be replaced with different machines .
Documents can be edited , corrected , and revised .
The upshot of this is that pretty much everything associated with a development project can change .
Nothing is " set in stone " .
What that means in IM is that everything must be versioned .
Yes , that includes operating systems , servers , and documents .
If it can change and it is part of a project ( i.e. part of a deliverable ) , it must be versioned .
We will explore the finer points of versioning soon , but for now this short discussion will serve our purposes .
The other high level concept in IM is Environment Management .
This may or may not be a new term to you ; I did n't make this one up !
But I am going to heavily redefine it to suite IM 's purposes .
What I am referring when I mention Environment Management is the control of all versioned items in each project environment .
Examples of environments in this context are " development " , " test " , " training " , and " production " .
However , as you will find out , this is not to say that there is only one development or test environment .
In most projects there are several .
The IM approach to Environment Management is one of " Just In Time " environment creation and destruction .
Environments are like Krispy Kreme doughnuts .
As soon as they are created , they start going stale .
I will also provide a detailed approach to implementing this JIT environment control plan .
Those are the high level concepts .
On their own they are not very useful though .
In fact , at this point , they may not even be comprehendible to any meaningful degree .
But if you could see the picture in my head ( which I hope to bring you around to doing ) , you would see that not only is it comprehendible , but very elegant and flexible .
Now that we have gotten the mile - high view , I want to jump to the other end of the spectrum and give you a peek into how this can be pulled off .
But first , a quick trip to the store .
Some of you older folks may remember a time when grocery stores put price stickers on everything .
Each can of green beans or salad dressing had a white or orange sticker on it with a price .
No barcode , just a simple number like " $ 1.29 " .
When you checked out , there was a cashier who could ( brace yourself ) actually type numbers into a cash register .
In fact , she could typically type them very fast with one hand and move the groceries to the bagging area with the other .
One day I noticed that some things that I bought at the grocery store had a new " built in " tag with a lot of lines on it .
It seemed completely useless to me because the only thing on it besides the row of lines was a seemingly random series of numbers .
I eventually learned that these were called " UPC " or Universal Product Code tags .
Since the tags were implemented long before most grocery stores received and installed the cash registers that could read these tags , they seemed rather pointless to most people .
But soon all of that changed .
Because each product carried a unique code , and that code was the same for that product whether it was on a store shelf in Akron Ohio or Pascagoula , Mississippi , products could be paid for , inventoried , and ordered all using the UPC number .
In fact , those processes eventually became completely automated .
Modern checkouts at large chain stores such as Wal - Mart or Target read the UPC code , look up the price , subtract a single item of the matching type from inventory , and if the supply is getting low , automatically order new stock .
There are currently some experimental stores that constantly monitor supply and demand and adjust the price of each item in the store based on these real - time statistics !
It is difficult to overstate the far reaching impact the simple UPC has had on the retail industry .
It has enabled stores with millions of items in stock to instantly know how many of each item is on the shelf , how many are on order , and how many were sold in the past hour .
That is all very interesting , but what has it go to do with what we are talking about ?
I am about to tell you !
Before the days of UPC , the task of pricing , inventorying , and ordering stock was very time consuming .
Since the cashier only had the price that was paid for an item to enter ( not what the item was ) , there was no way to know how much the inventory of a particular item had been depleted other than manually counting items or , more commonly , " eyeball ordering " .
A department manager ordered new stock when the stock on the shelf looked low .
In many ways , the problems they faced had a lot in common with the problems we now face on software projects .
We have a huge number of individual pieces which must be assembled in just the right way to work .
To make things worse , they are always changing .
It would be as if there were gremlins in the store that constantly rearranged the shelves when nobody was looking and mixed different items up .
Actually , I think those really did exist .
They were called kids .
I know because I mixed up a few shelves myself .
With this overwhelming amount of information to track and with many , many items changing all the time , something is needed to get the kind of control on project pieces in a similar way UPC codes allowed stores to get control of inventory .
We need a UPC for our project pieces .
Enter the Integrity Control Item .
This is a concept that treats anything that is versioned ( i.e. everything we care about ) as a unique item .
Similar to the way a can of Green Giant whole kernel corn has a code that is unique throughout the food supply system , our ICI is unique throughout our project .
Actually , properly implemented it is globally unique even between projects , but more on that later .
For now it is sufficient to say that a ICI is unique in a given project .
In our examples , I will just use a numeric value like " 324398675 " to represent an ICI .
So what does that do for us ?
Great .
Now instead of worrying about the Oracle Client drivers , I can worry about keeping up ICI # 324398675 and its thirty eight thousand brothers .
Yea , buddy ... that sure made my life easier !
But wait ... there 's more !
If the only thing we got out of an ICI was a hard to remember number it would be no better than a cell phone , but that is not the case .
When a grocery store orders something with a UPC code , when the order comes in , it has additional information with the UPC code .
For example , it may have the manufacturer , the product name , the quantity , and the country of origin .
You do n't need to know the country of origin to order the corn , you just need to know the UPC code , but if you need to know what that UPC represents , a large amount of information about it is available in the inventory control system .
Similarly , if we want to automatically check that an ICI is present in a particular release , we do n't need to know what it is or what its characteristics are ahead of time , those can be looked up when they are needed or not looked up when they are not .
There are many , many other advantages to tracking everything in your project with an ICI which will become more obvious as we dig deeper into this process , but for now I will let you ponder these ideas and try to shoot holes in them .
Next time I will discuss how versioning works with an ICI .
I hope you come back to read about it .

Thomas Harrison called it the " water treatment " .
On May 21 , 1951 , Lt Col Harrison 's F - 80 jet fighter was shot down over North Korea .
Two years later , Harrison returned home to Clovis , New Mexico a broken man .
His Communist captors , he said , " would bend my head back , put a towel over my face and pour water over the towel .
I could not breathe .
This went on hour after hour , day after day .
It was freezing cold .
When I would pass out , they would shake me and begin again . "
The treatment inflicted on downed airmen like Harrison spurred the Pentagon in the 1950s to study Communist torture .
False confessions , it was discovered , were drawn by methods designed to elicit dependency and dread employing water , cold air , forced standing , isolation and humiliation .
According to one 1956 CIA - sponsored report [ PDF ] :
The Communists do not look upon these assaults as ' torture ' .
Undoubtedly , they use the methods which they do in order to conform , in a typical legalistic manner to overt Communist principles which demand that ' no force or torture be used in extracting information from prisoners ' .
But these methods do , of course , constitute torture and physical coercion .
All of them lead to serious disturbances of many bodily processes .
On 2 October 2002 , a group of intelligence officials gathered at Guantanamo to discuss an array of coercive methods to be used on inmates .
Earlier that year , President Bush declared that the Geneva conventions do not protect Taliban and al - Qaida suspects in US custody .
" After 9/11 , " as the CIA 's then counterterror chief Cofer Black infamously put it , " the gloves came off . "
One participant at the October meeting , according to a recently declassified transcript [ PDF ] , asked about a " wet towel " technique .
CIA counterterrorism lawyer Jonathan Fredman responded : " If a well - trained individual is used to perform this technique it can feel like you 're drowning .
The lymphatic system will react as if you are suffocating , but your body will not cease to function . "
Torture , Fredman added , " is basically subject to perception … .
If the detainee dies , you 're doing it wrong . "
After approval by the Department of Justice and the National Security Council 's principles committee , which included Dick Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld and then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , waterboarding , plus an array of other coercive techniques , was used on at least three terrorism suspects .
Senior Democrats , including current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , were briefed on its application .
When these facts surfaced in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal , many rushed to defend use of the waterboard .
In 2006 , Cheney agreed that " a dunk in water is a no - brainer " to save lives .
For Rudy Giuliani , whether or not it is torture " depends on who does it . "
For others , waterboarding is " like swimming , freestyle , backstroke " , in the bizarre words of Republican Senator Kit Bond .
Presidential candidate John McCain , himself a Vietnam - era torture survivor , even voted against an amendment seeking to ban CIA authorization of waterboarding .
Now , neoconservative pundit Christopher Hitchens has waded into the debate .
In a new article for Vanity Fair , Hitchens - like several other journalists before him - underwent the procedure .
" If waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture , " noted Hitchens , who lasted roughly 10 seconds under the spout .
Hitchens cites the salient views of Malcolm Nance , a US counter - terrorism consultant who speaks eloquently against its use .
" Mr Nance told me that he had heard of someone 's being compelled to confess that he was a hermaphrodite , " recalled Hitchens , adding : " I later had an awful twinge while wondering if I myself could have been ' dunked ' this far . "
Still , Hitchens cannot escape the grip of American exceptionalism that has so permeated his work since 9/11 .
" Any call to indict the United States for torture is … a lame and diseased attempt to arrive at a moral equivalence between those who defend civilization and those who exploit its freedoms to hollow it out , and ultimately to bring it down , " he huffs .
For Hitchens , in America 's pitched battle with " tormentors and murderers " , the ends justify the means .
I disagree .
Communist techniques hinged on the infliction of pain elicit bad intelligence and helps fan the flames of hatred against the US .
In the case of the " water treatment " , poor means corrupt good ends .
Feel free to tell me I ’m nuts for asking the question , but does n’t it seem that , more and more , the McCain campaign is turning into the Clinton campaign ?
The comparison smacked me upside the head last week , when the turmoil and melodrama attending the internal functioning — or , rather , dysfunctioning — of the Republican nominee ’s organization burst into public view .
Just a few days after John McCain had shaken up his operation , demoting his campaign manager Rick Davis and elevating bullet - headed adjutant Steve Schmidt to a position of putative near - total authority , Bill Kristol confidently predicted in his column in the Times that McCain would soon bring consultant Mike Murphy aboard as the campaign ’s chief strategist .
Kristol was n’t flat wrong , or so I ’m told by a longtime McCain confidant .
The Arizona senator did indeed offer the gig to Murphy , who served on McCain ’s 2000 primary bid and whose counsel the candidate had been receiving on the down - low for months .
But the outcry among McCain ’s other advisers , many of whom openly loathe Murphy , was simply too intense .
So a little more than 24 hours after Kristol ’s column was published , Murphy announced that his reentry was n’t gonna happen ; instead , he would be going to work for MSNBC .
Now , it ’s fair to point out that strife is nothing new to McCain campaigns , which tend to be less well - oiled machines than spastic - goat rodeos .
Yet it ’s hard not to see the similarities between the chaos afflicting McCain - land now and what went on in Clinton - world during the primaries .
In the former , like the latter , you have an outfit with no clear lines of authority , rife with elephantine egos and feuding factions that have been at each other ’s throats for years , none with the slightest compunction about bearing their animosities ( albeit anonymously ) in the press .
And in McCain , like Clinton , you have a candidate who not only tolerates but seems to encourage an atmosphere of anarchy — and who finds it difficult to fire anyone , no matter how incompetent .
If the commonalities ended here , they would hardly be worth noting .
In presidential races , personnel and mechanics matter , but only on the margins .
Yet in ways large and small , strategic and tactical , temperamental and attitudinal , the McCain campaign strikes me as having been cut from the same cloth as Hillary Clinton ’s .
Same story with the candidates themselves , in particular when it comes to their jaundiced perceptions of their rival .
For supporters of Barack Obama , this might seem cheery news , since those perceptions led Clinton time and again to misplay her hand .
But general elections are very different from primaries — and there are reasons to worry that Clintonianism , taken to its logical ( and gruesome ) extreme , may serve McCain better than it did the real McCoy .
That Clinton and McCain would run similar races might seem odd .
Their ideological differences are severe , and no one sane would ever call Clinton a maverick or McCain a feminist .
But it ’s also true that they share a view of politics and policy .
They venerate the Senate as a noble institution , not as the imagination - deadening , soul - destroying hellhole that it is .
They regard legislative experience , forging compromises in the trenches , as formative and indispensable .
They see having national - security chops as a sine qua non for sitting in the Oval Office .
It was this conception of politics and the presidency , however , that got Hillary into so much trouble in her battle with Obama .
And while McCain largely avoids the rhetorical traps she fell into — the laundry - listy rhetoric , the countless small - bore policy proposals — the thrust of his campaign is much the same as hers was :
The emphasis on résumé , the willful avoidance of grappling with the desire for change so evident in the electorate , and , perhaps most problematic , the eschewal of big , bold , animating ideas and grand thematics .
This was not , it should be said , the kind of campaign that McCain and his advisers planned at the outset .
Back in the days when McCain was still being guided by John Weaver , the strategist–cum–soul mate who crafted his message in 2000 and then fell out of favor in mid-2007 when McCain ’s campaign imploded , the idea had been to run on a handful of sweeping reformist goals — entitlement reform , ethics reform , immigration reform , spending reform , etc. — and position McCain as willing to put country ahead of personal political ambition .
How ?
As reported first by The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder , when McCain announced his candidacy , he was “ inches away ” from pledging to serve only one term if elected .
“ It would have been the most selfless act in modern American politics , ” a Republican told Ambinder — and one that would have served as a powerful contrast point in a race against either Clinton or Obama .
But McCain was persuaded at the last minute to abandon the idea by his friends Senator Lindsey Graham and former senator Phil Gramm — just as Clinton was convinced not to run a bolder , more human campaign by the more conservative voices in her sphere .
Since then , McCain ’s effort , like Clinton ’s , has been increasingly poll - driven ( offshore oil drilling , anyone ? ) , corporate ( the phalanx of lobbyists that surrounds him , robbing him of his reformist cred ) , and almost entirely lacking any positive vision of what he wants to achieve as president , beyond winning the war in Iraq .
Indeed , McCain ’s assorted flip - flops , notably regarding his position on the Bush tax cuts , have left him vulnerable to the charge that was ultimately most damaging to Clinton and is even more damaging to him , given his image as a principled straight - talker : that he will say and do anything to win .
None of this is lost on the people around McCain , though they regard the perceptions as unfair .
And while none of them will put it anywhere near this bluntly , they believe that it hardly matters .
The fall election , in their view , will to a large extent be a referendum on Obama :
Will voters trust him enough to be president ?
Will they believe he is up to the job ?
Can the McCain campaign raise enough doubts about him to , in effect , elect their guy by default ?
And here we arrive at a second set of views held in common by McCain and Clinton : their views about Obama .
How closely in sync are the two of them when it comes to the hopemonger ?
The other day I suggested a sort of thought experiment to someone close to McCain for years :
If Hillary wrote down on paper all the things she thought about Obama and handed the paper to McCain and asked him to check the ones he agreed with , what percentage would be marked ?
“ Oh , 90 percent , at least , ” this person said .
The opinions of both of them , not surprisingly , would be skeptical , harsh , dismissive : that Obama is a lightweight , that he ’s a line - cutter , that he ’s arrogant , elitist , all talk no action .
And that perspective is evident in the campaign that McCain and the Republicans more broadly are running against Obama .
In tone and substance , once again , the similarities to the broadsides that Clinton and her people launched against him are striking .
More than one GOP e-mail in recent weeks has taunted him with the phrase “ Just words . ”
As was the case with Clinton , McCain ’s dismissiveness of Obama often seems to cross the line into resentment — and seems to have two primary sources .
The first revolves around Obama ’s rock - star status , around the size of his crowds , which McCain ’s aides are forever prone to mock .
“ Yeah , he ’s got his ‘ mine is bigger than yours ’ thing , but when does that get to be too much ? ” one said to me recently .
They point to his plans to deliver his nomination - acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in the Broncos ’ stadium rather than the arena in Denver — along with the possibility that he might orate at the Brandenburg Gate this summer — as signs of raging hubris .
The second source of resentment owes to Obama ’s treatment by the press , which the McCain people , as did the Clinton people , regard as slavishly biased .
“ Hillary got worse treatment from the press than anyone since Nixon , ” says one McCain strategist .
“ Now it ’s happening to us . ”
To be sure , there are merits to both these arguments .
Obama ’s craving for the big stage , the ginormous crowds , may in the end prove tactically unwise , if voters become convinced that it reflects a deep - seated egomania .
And it would be hard to argue with the notion that the press was tilted toward Obama and against Clinton in the Democratic primaries , though it ’s far from clear that the same dynamic will hold in his contest with McCain .
The relevant point , however , is that the resentments festering in McCain - land on both scores hold the danger of blinding the candidate and his people to larger truths : that Obama ’s throngs are representative of real excitement among the electorate ; that his glowing press derives from the power of the narrative that he and his campaign have constructed , which is a reality that ca n’t be wished — or cursed — away but that has to be countered , whether artfully or brutally .
For Hillary , of course , artfulness was beyond her and her campaign ’s skill set .
And to the extent she attempted brutality , it only backfired on her .
Yet for all the wailing and gnashing of Obamaniac teeth over HRC ’s harshness , her conduct was , in fact , fairly restrained .
As Clinton ’s strategists often pointed out privately , there were countless places Hillary could not go in her attempts to redefine Obama .
With a few exceptions , she steered away from Reverend Wright .
She indulged in no smear campaigns about Obama being a Muslim , or a communist , or whatever .
But McCain is under no such constraints — and disqualifying Obama is by definition easier in a general election than it was in a Democratic primary .
Consider that , despite the palpable lameness of his opponent ’s effort so far , he has only a paltry three - to - five - point lead in the current national polls .
The question for Obama is whether he can persuade the public that he is who he says he is , not the alien that the Republicans will try to portray him as .
It wo n’t be a simple task .
But making it just a little bit easier will be the fact that he ’s running against a man who seems intent on cross-dressing as the former First Lady .

Bank of America profit falls 77 percent in first quarter
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp , the second - largest U.S. bank , on Monday said first - quarter profit fell 77 percent , hurt by trading losses and a $ 3.3 billion increase in reserves for credit problems .
Net income for the Charlotte , North Carolina - based company fell to $ 1.21 billion , or 23 cents per share , from $ 5.26 billion , or $ 1.16 , a year earlier .
Net revenue dropped 6 percent to $ 17 billion , the bank said .
Analysts on average expected a profit of 45 cents per share on revenue of $ 16.33 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Results included $ 170 million of merger and restructuring charges and a $ 776 million gain from credit card network Visa Inc 's ( V.N : Quote , Profile , Research ) initial public offering last month .
Bank of America shares were off 36 cents to $ 38.20 in pre-market electronic trading .
" These results clearly did not meet our expectations , " Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said in a statement .
" The weakness in the economy and prolonged disruptions in the capital markets took their toll . "
Results included $ 1.31 billion of trading losses .
This reflected write - downs of $ 1.47 billion related to collateralized debt obligations and $ 439 million for loans to fund leveraged buyouts .
Trading losses declined from $ 5.15 billion from the fourth quarter .
Bank of America also said it set aside $ 6.01 billion for credit losses , quintuple the year - earlier level , hurt by credit costs in home equity , small business and homebuilder portfolios .
The bank 's Tier - 1 capital ratio , a measure of its ability to cover losses , rose to 7.51 percent from the fourth quarter 's 6.87 percent , following a sale of $ 12.9 billion of preferred stock .
Through Friday , Bank of America shares had fallen 7 percent this year compared with an 8 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .
BKX .
OTHER BANKS
Bank of America joined Citigroup Inc ( C.N : Quote , Profile , Research ) , JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N : Quote , Profile , Research ) , Wachovia Corp ( WB.N : Quote , Profile , Research ) and other banks in reporting losses related to leveraged loans , mortgages , consumer credit or a combination .
The bank , however , generates more of its business in the United States , exposing it more to weak economic conditions at home .
Lewis said he expects U.S. gross domestic product growth to be " minimal at best " this quarter , with a slight pickup in the second half of 2008 .
Profit in consumer and small business banking fell 59 percent to $ 1.09 billion .
The corporate and investment bank saw profit fall 92 percent to $ 115 million .
In wealth and investment management , profit fell 54 percent to $ 228 million , hurt by a $ 220 million loss to prop up some money funds in its Columbia Management unit .
Results were the second to reflect Bank of America's $ 21 billion purchase of ABN AMRO Holding NV's ( AAH.AS : Quote , Profile , Research ) LaSalle Bank on October 1 .
Bank of America ended the quarter with 6,148 U.S. branches , nearly twice as many as any other bank , and $ 1.74 trillion of assets .
Word spread quickly inside the windowless walls of the Elizabeth Detention Center , an immigration jail in New Jersey : A detainee had fallen , injured his head and become incoherent .
Guards had put him in solitary confinement , and late that night , an ambulance had taken him away more dead than alive .
But outside , for five days , no official notified the family of the detainee , Boubacar Bah , a 52 - year - old tailor from Guinea who had overstayed a tourist visa .
When frantic relatives located him at University Hospital in Newark on Feb.
5 , 2007 , he was in a coma after emergency surgery for a skull fracture and multiple brain hemorrhages .
He died there four months later without ever waking up , leaving family members on two continents trying to find out why .
Mr. Bah ’s name is one of 66 on a government list of deaths that occurred in immigration custody from January 2004 to November 2007 , when nearly a million people passed through .
The list , compiled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after Congress demanded the information , and obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act , is the fullest accounting to date of deaths in immigration detention , a patchwork of federal centers , county jails and privately run prisons that has become the nation ’s fastest - growing form of incarceration .
You have to wonder if some future version of the iPhone will be renamed to deemphasize the fact that it is , when all is said and done , a telephone .
The thought occurs while reading a summary of new consumer research conducted by iSuppli that shows most iPhone usage time is spent doing things other than yapping .
While the typical cell phone user spends 72 % of their time on their device talking , that figure drops to 47 % for the iPhone .
What are iPhone users doing most often instead ?
From this morning 's press release :
U.S. consumers said they spent 12.1 percent of their iPhone usage time accessing the Internet , a stark contrast with 2.4 percent for all mobile phones on average .
Furthermore , iPhone owners spent 11.9 percent of their usage time listening to music or other audio , compared to just 2.5 percent for all mobile handset users .
" This usage pattern shows Apple has succeeded in producing a true convergence product that consumers like to use for multiple purposes , " said Greg Sheppard , chief development officer for iSuppli .
" Apple has come as close as anyone to achieving a balanced convergence in mobile - handset features and usage . "
Of course , these figures really should n't come as a surprise to anyone , given the way the iPhone was designed , marketed and hyped .
It 's supposed to be much more than a phone .
Yet there 's still something notable about the fact that a bunch of phone owners are spending more than half their time doing things other talking .
( Update : Here 's another fresh iPhone survey , this one from Rubicon .
Among the more interesting tidbits : 40 % of users complain that the iPhone fumbles sites they want to visit , while an astounding one - third of owners admit to carrying a second mobile phone . )
( Update 2 : And then there 's this survey saying iPhone users are sick and tired of being surveyed ... no , actually it says they could n't be happier . )
( Update 3 : Keynote 's offering a way to get even more companies doing even more iPhone user surveys .
...
Will the madness ever end ? )
PRINCETON , NJ --
The race for the presidency has moved back into a statistical tie in the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update of national registered voters , with Barack Obama now ahead of John McCain by just one percentage point , 45 % to 44 % .
Today 's results are based on Gallup Poll Daily tracking from July 28 - 30 .
The latest three - day average confirms that Obama was unable to solidify the significant lead he briefly enjoyed among registered voters at the height of publicity surrounding his weeklong visit to Afghanistan , Iraq , the Middle East , and Europe .
Gallup tracking showed Obama 's lead rising at one point as high as nine percentage points ( for the average from last Thursday , Friday , and Saturday ) , but the presumptive Democratic nominee has been losing ground since that point .
The race has been very close before , with Obama holding a 1 - point lead as recently as July 15 - 17 , and the race tied for several days in late June .
The story of the election through the summer months has been a close race that simply does not seem to want to change .
Obama has generally been in the lead , and it is significant that McCain has never held even a 1 - point lead among registered voters in Gallup Poll Daily tracking since Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in early June .
Still , the relative stability of the race , even in the aftermath of such a high - visibility event as Obama 's foreign trip ( coupled , of course , with the McCain campaign 's vigorous efforts to defuse its impact ) continues to suggest that it may be the conventions in late August and early September that will offer the next potential timeframe for significant and / or sustained change .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from July 28 - 30 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,679 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Following yesterday 's announcement that Microsoft 's Office Open XML format ( OOXML ) has been approved as an ISO standard , critics of OOXML are voicing support for the competing OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) and have expressed concerns about the future of document standards and of the ISO .
Red Hat 's legal team published a statement criticizing the ISO fast track process and expressing disappointment with the outcome .
" Will the real interoperability standard please stand up ? " Red Hat 's legal team wrote .
" Red Hat thinks governments and enterprises are not so easily confused .
The Open Document Format , which has long been a multiparty - supported ISO standard , will continue to be a force in procurement decisions to be reckoned with .
Government and Enterprises are tired of the lack of choice , lack of innovation , and premium rents from vendor lock - in . "
IBM issued a statement affirming ongoing support for ODF too , but also expresses interest in collaborating with ISO to improve interoperability between ODF and OOXML in the future .
" IBM will continue to be an active supporter of ODF .
We look forward to being part of the community that works to harmonize ODF and OOXML for the sake of consumers , companies and governments , when OOXML control and maintenance is fully transferred to JTC1 ( ISO / IEC ) , " IBM told us .
Bob Sutor , IBM 's executive vice president of standards , has some additional comments in a blog entry .
He says that OOXML 's path to ISO approval illuminates a number of notable flaws in the standards process that reflect a bigger and more important issue than OOXML itself .
" I 'm energized to take the bigger fight for openness to the next level with the thousands of individuals who are now convinced that the standards system needs fixing , and soon , " he wrote .
A similar response came from Patrick Durusau , an ODF coeditor who has vocally supported ISO standardization for OOXML .
Although Durusau believes that OOXML is a " poster child for the open standards development process , " he says that ad hoc rules and " process failures " had a detrimental impact on the OOXML revision and approval effort .
Durusau calls for standards process reforms and argues that ISO needs to be more inclusive .
Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth was among those who criticized the outcome of the vote .
" It 's sad that the ISO was not willing to admit that its process was failing horribly , " Shuttleworth said in an interview .
" We 're not going to invest in trying to implement a standard that is poorly defined . "
Some questions remain about potential irregularities that cropped up during the voting process .
The European Commission is investigating whether Microsoft committed any antitrust abuses during OOXML 's journey through ISO .
Developers are also evaluating prospects for harmonizing OOXML and ODF and will watch closely to make sure that Microsoft lives up to its promise to make Office conform to the actual documented specification .

The following attempts to explain the most important idea in the history of social analysis .
The notion ( actually , it 's a description of reality that is all around us but rarely noticed ) has been around for centuries .
It was first observed by ancients .
It was first described with rigor by late - medieval monks working in Spain .
It was given scientific precision in the classical period .
It is the basis of advances in social theory in the 20th century .
In fact , it is an essential part of the case for freedom .
It was the basis of the belief of our ancestors that they could throw off tyrannical rule and still not have society descend into poverty and chaos .
The failure to comprehend this idea is at the very root of the pervasive bias against liberty and free enterprise in our times , on the Left and the Right .
I speak of the division of labor , also known as the law of comparative advantage or the law of comparative cost , and also known as the law of association .
Call it what you will , it is probably the single greatest contribution that economics has made to human understanding .
This law — a law like gravity , not a law like the speed limit — is a description of why people cooperate and the ubiquity of the conditions that lead to this cooperation .
If you can take a few minutes to learn it , you will understand how it is that society functions and grows wealthy even without a visible hand directing its path .
You will also see how the criticism that the market economy leads to the strong dominating the weak is actually a sham .
This law shows how it is that people can gain , materially and in every other way , by working together rather than working in isolation .
They do n't just gain the sense of satisfaction that comes with participation in solidarity with one 's fellow man ; they can actually gain in the real stuff of life , the goods and services that are available to us all .
What 's more , they gain more than the sum of their parts .
Through cooperation and exchange , we can produce more than if we work in isolation .
This applies in the simplest economic settings as well as the most complex ones .
It helps to lay this out more rigorously so that you can observe the magic of the marketplace at work .
( I owe the following exposition to Ludwig von Mises in Human Action , Murray Rothbard in " Freedom , Inequality … " and , especially , Manuel Ayau 's Not a Zero - Sum Game , which is available through Mises.org . )
Let 's say you and I can both make bagels and pies .
But there 's a problem : you make both with incredible efficiency .
In fact , you do a better job at making bagels and pies than anyone who has ever lived .
You are the world - class , all - time champion .
Meanwhile , I 'm not so hot at either .
My bagels taste as good as yours , but they seem to take me an age to make .
My pies are the same way .
I struggle and struggle , but try as I might , I just can't seem to crank them out the way that you can .
What is likely to happen under these conditions ?
The intuitive answer , which you will hear in just about every sociology class in the country , is that you will make all bagels and pies .
No one else will .
You will lord it over the rest of us , and have massive market power .
If anyone wants either , he or she must come to you and you alone .
You are privileged , favored , rich , powerful , and the rest of us can only sit in awe and beg from you .
But in fact , that 's not what happens at all .
Let 's back up a bit and see why .
Let 's say you and I have never met , and we are both making bagels and pies .
Here is what happens in a 24 - hour period :
You make 12 bagels in 12 hours , and 6 pies in the remaining 12 hours .
I , on the other hand , only manage to make 6 bagels in the first 12 hours , and a mere 2 pies in the remaining 12 hours .
Production in Isolation You You Me Me Hours 12 12 12 12 Production 12 bagels 6 pies 6 bagels 2 pies
If we both work at this pace , the total production is 18 bagels and 8 pies .
In each case , the cost of what you decide to do is the thing you give up .
So for you the cost of each pie is 2 bagels , and , likewise , the cost of each bagel is 1 / 2 of a pie .
For me , the opportunity cost of making a pie is 3 bagels , and the cost of making a bagel is 1/3 of a pie .
Just looking at this , you might observe that you have your act together , whereas I 'm pretty shabby .
What chance in life do I have ?
Well , my hope is bound up with the reality that your time and resources are scarce and you want ever more of each .
So you begin to think about exchange .
Even though I 'm not very good at either pies or bagels , you can still see that you can make more of one thing or the other by encouraging our cooperation , thereby freeing up your time to do what you do best .
If you specialize in making pies , you still need some bagels .
So you plan to exchange pies for bagels from me .
With this thought in mind , you increase pie production and reduce bagel production .
I , on the other hand , stop pie production completely and devote myself to bagel production in hopes of fobbing them off on you .
Production with Cooperation You You Me Me Hours 8 16 24 0 Production 8 bagels 8 pies 12 bagels 0 pies
So you now spend a mere 8 hours on bagel making , in which time you produce 8 bagels ; in the remaining 16 hours of your day , you are able to bake 8 pies .
Meanwhile , I can now devote all of my time to bagel - making , and I turn out 12 bagels in 24 hours .
Let 's total up the production .
Before cooperation : 18 bagels and 8 pies .
After cooperation : 20 bagels and 8 pies .
So what is the gain here ?
Precisely two bagels .
Can you believe it ?
Nothing else changed ; there was no increase in our productive potential , no increase in technology , no change in consumer demand or the weather or the linearity of history itself .
All that happened is that we agreed to produce in cooperative exchange rather than isolation , and voilà — two additional bagels .
You think there 's a trick ?
Go back and check the numbers and the assumptions .
I 'm just as shabby as ever , and you are just as fabulous .
And yet there 's a role for both of us .
Let 's say we now exchange the goods we make .
You might give me 2 of the pies you made in exchange for 5 bagels that I made .
That leaves you with 13 bagels and 6 pies , while I now have 7 bagels and 2 pies .
After Our Exchange
You You Me Me Results 13 bagels 6 pies 7 bagels 2 pies
This would be reasonable , since those bagels you buy from me would have cost you 5 hours of production time .
True , it took me 10 hours to make them , but what do I get if I exchange ?
I get 2 pies , which would have taken me 12 hours to make .
So there is a sense in which I , by specializing , have saved 2 hours .
And how many hours have you saved by encouraging me to make bagels ?
Five hours , during which time you made pies .
And what is the cost of exchange in material goods for each of us ?
You have given up 2 pies .
I have given up 5 bagels .
If our time is measured in terms of goods , you have given up the time equivalent of 4 bagels for 5 bagels , and thereby gained 1 .
I have given up 5 bagels but gained the time equivalent of 6 bagels , since my pie - to - bagel ratio is 3 to 1 .
So who gained the most ?
In terms of bagels , we gain the same : one .
In terms of time , I have gained more .
In terms of pies , you have saved more .
Who is the winner ?
Both of us .
Again , what made us gain ?
Cooperation and exchange .
Nothing more .
Now , you might say that this is absurd .
No one sits around drawing exchange matrixes to see how we might benefit by dividing up the production .
But in fact , we do this all the time .
I might be a wonderful musician and web programmer .
But my advantage is web programming , so I leave the music production to other people , even if they do it less effectively .
It 's true in the business world : the boss might do an amazing job at accounting , clean - up , marketing , and customer support .
He or she might do these things more efficiently than anyone else , but the cost of doing one thing is another thing given up .
It makes sense to depend on others so that we can all specialize .
Consider the great 19th - century pianist Franz Liszt .
He was the best and mostly highly paid musician in Europe .
Let 's say he was also a great piano tuner .
Would it make sense for him to give up practice time for a concert that would pay him $ 20,000 in order to tune his own piano ?
Not at all .
He would rather pay someone $ 200 to do that .
The opportunity cost of piano tuning for Liszt was very high , but for the tuner , it was very low .
They exchange , and both benefit .
It is the same with doctors and nurses .
The doctor might be great at prepping patients , but in doing so the doctor is giving up performing another surgery that would cost him many thousands of dollars .
Note that this makes sense even if one person has an absolute advantage in each area .
What matters for the real world is not absolute advantage but comparative advantage .
That is where the law of association comes into being .
It is true for two people , two hundred people , two thousand people , or all people all over the world .
Herein we have the case for international trade , for it changes nothing about the mutual advantage for people that they reside in different lands .
This is why it makes sense for both poor and rich countries to trade , as noted by Bartolomé de Albornoz as early as the 16th century :
If it were not for these contracts , some would lack the goods that others have in abundance , and they would not be able to share the goods that they have in exchange with those countries where they are scarce .
Note that these gains come not from design but merely from the freedom to associate , which Pope Leo XIII called a human right in his encyclical Rerum Novarum :
If [ the state ] forbids its citizens to form associations , it contradicts the very principle of its own existence ; for both they and it exist in virtue of the same principle , namely , the natural propensity of man to live in society .
Both the moral and practical advantages were reiterated by Pope John Paul II in Centesimus Annus :
It is becoming clearer how a person 's work is naturally interrelated with the work of others .
More than ever , work is work with others and work for others : it is a matter of doing something for someone else .
Work becomes ever more fruitful and productive to the extent that people become more knowledgeable of the productive potentialities of the earth and more profoundly cognizant of the needs of those for whom their work is done .
The law was formalized by David Ricardo in England , and further emphasized by economists ever since .
The significance is impossible to exaggerate :
It means that it is not necessary that all people of the world have the same talents in order to benefit from cooperation .
In fact , it is the very diversity of the human population that makes it advantageous for them to work together and trade to their mutual benefit .
What this means is that isolation and self - sufficiency lead to poverty .
Cooperation and the division of labor are the path to wealth .
Understand that , and you can refute libraries full of nonsense from both the Left and the Right .
Pakistan blocks US from searching for bin Laden Associated Press
Published : Sunday July 13 , 2008
Print This Email This
The top diplomat for Pakistan has said that there are currently no foreign military representatives in Pakistan hunting for Osama bin Laden , and that none would be allowed into the country to search for him .
In an interview Saturday , the Pakistani foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , said the new government of Pakistan had ruled out such military operations , covert or otherwise , to catch militants including Osama bin Laden , the head of Al Qaeda .
" Our government 's policy is that our troops , paramilitary forces and our regular forces are deployed in sufficient numbers , " Qureshi said .
" They are capable of taking action there .
And any foreign intrusion would be counterproductive .
People will not accept it .
Questions of sovereignty come in . "
The United States has grown increasingly frustrated as Al Qaeda , the Taliban and other militants thrive in Pakistan 's remote areas and in neighboring Afghanistan , where the United States has offered to contribute troops to strike at terror networks .
Critics in Washington also have expressed frustration with the new Pakistani government 's pursuit of peace deals in the region .
Bin Laden is believed to be hiding somewhere in the Afghan - Pakistan border region .
The newly elected civilian government of Pakistan is negotiating with tribal elders to secure peace with militants along the Afghan border in hopes of curbing a surge in violence .
It is a step back from the heavy - handed tactics pursued by the previous government led by supporters of President Pervez Musharraf .
Tension between the United States and Pakistan have been high since Pakistan said U.S. aircraft killed 11 of its soldiers at a border post in June .
U.S. officials have said that coalition aircraft dropped bombs during a clash with militants .
Despite statements by Pakistan saying that it does not allow U.S. forces on its territory , villagers in the border region that is a haven for Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters have reported seeing U.S. drones fire missiles at suspected militant targets on several occasions in recent years .
Qureshi said he tried to reassure Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a meeting Friday that his government was doing everything it could to combat militants in lawless tribal areas bordering Afghanistan .
Pakistan and Afghanistan regularly exchange criticisms about not doing more to fight extremists operating along their long , remote , mountainous border that is seen by the United States as crucial to stopping terrorism .
Qureshi acknowledged that " there are some infiltrations " still occurring , but said that there are no covert U.S. military operations trying to catch bin Laden or other Qaeda figures , Taliban members or any other suspected militants .
" There are none , " he said .
" It will create such an anti-U.S. feeling in Pakistan that I would say would mar the atmosphere of cooperation that exists between us , " he said .
Qureshi described Pakistani counterterrorism efforts as having a " grassroots " approach .
" Our strategy is that the military option alone is not enough , " he said .
" This war has to be fought besides the armies , with the help of the people , by winning hearts and minds . "
When asked if he believed that bin Laden was still in Pakistan , he said : " I do n't think so .
I 'm not sure , " he said .
" Nobody 's aware of that .
Nobody can speak with certainty .
But our policy 's very clear .
We are allies in this war .
And if Pakistan has actionable information vis-a - vis Osama bin laden or any other high value target , Pakistan will immediately take action . "
以前 、TRPG ( テーブルトークRPG ) の編集部にいたことがある。
今から14年くらい前の話なのだが、ロード・オブ・リングなんかでおなじみのあの世界観を、会話のやりとりで遊ぶゲームとして、TRPGというものがあった。当時、D&D*1、T&T*2などのアメリカ製のボックスゲームに加えて、国産のTRPGがあちこちから発売されて、そりゃもう賑やかな一時代があったのだった。
このとき のTRPGの興隆の話というのをふと思い出したら、いろいろ初音ミクのこの先を考える上でのヒントが隠されているような気がした。
ただ、何しろマニアというか一家言ある人がウヨウヨいる世界でもあるので、声の大きい人に「全然違うッ！」と言われそうな気がしなくもないｗ。ま、だいたい歴史は繰り返すものなんで、似てるとこ違うとこ回避のヒントなどの手掛かりを見つけられる人もいるかもしれないという前提に立って、敢えて思い出すまま書いてみよう。
まず 、TRPGの豆知識。
流れとしては 、PCやコンシューマのコンピュータゲームとは別の進化を続けてきたジャンルで、まずシミュレーションゲーム（ボードゲーム）があり、その後を継ぐような形で興隆してきたのがTRPG。そのTRPGの衰退期にはマジック・ザ・ギャザリングなどのトレーディングカードゲームが登場し、TRPGは舞台から消えていく。
で。
TRPGはなぜ滅んだのかというと、これは販売形態とそれをとりまくいろいろな大人の事情(都合)の狭間、歴史的に役目を終えたなどなど、様々な複合的理由があるのだが、ここでは「販売形態と大人の事情に限界があった」という視点から触れてみる。
TRPGというのは、まずゲームマスターとプレイヤー数人で遊ぶもので、遊ぶためにルールブックが必要になる。ルールブックというのは、戦闘や問題を解決するための手順や方法が書かれたもので、元々は数十頁程度の冊子の形をしている。敵と戦闘になったら、そこに書かれているルールに沿ってサイコロを振ったりして戦う。
必要なことはルールブックに書かれているので、ルールブックはゲームマスターが一冊持っていれば足りるし、その他はサイコロ、自分のキャラクターを示す駒*3があればよい。
で、このゲームは電源も要らないしルールブックが一冊あればどこででもできるので、非常にローコストで遊ぶことができた。また、初期のTRPGはルールがシンプルだったこともあって、ゲームマスター一人がルールブックを買っていれば用が足りたし、ルールをよく記憶している馴れたゲームマスターは、ルールブックが無くてもゲームを成立させることができた。
つまり、商品としてのルールブックは、ルールを憶えてしまったらなくても困らない。
また、商品としてのルールブックがゲームマスターに行き渡ってしまうと、それ以上は売れゆきが止まってしまう。ゲームマスターが1000人いたら、1000冊行き渡るとそれ以上は商品としては売れなくなってしまう。
ゲームマスターなどそうそういるものではなかったので、それ以前は「少人数に売れるだけでペイする値段」で売られていた。1000人に行き渡ったら、その商売は終わり、というもの。
でもそういう焼畑農業では商売が続かないので、「もう少し難しくした新しいルールブック」というのを出すようになった。そうすると、最初のルールブック*4を買った1000人のゲームマスターは、再びより高度なルールを買うので、また1000冊……とはいわないけど、それに届くかどうかくらいは売れるが、高度なルールは難しいので売れ行きは下がる。
やはりそのままでは、コア層をだんだん切り捨てながら高度化していってしまうことになってしまうので、今度は市場そのものを拡大する方向に舵を切った。
高度化したルールは、ゲームマスター一人だけでは処理しきれないので、ルールブックをゲームマスターだけではなく、ゲームプレイヤーにも必携させる方向に向く。これによって、それまでゲームマスターが一冊持っていれば需要が満たされていたものが、プレイヤーの人数分だけ売ることが出来るようになり、市場が拡大した。
さらに、既に飽和状態にあったアメリカから、日本に市場が拡大される。
TRPGというのは 「 ゲームである」ということもあって、日本では元々オモチャ流通に乗っていたものらしい。オモチャ流通では数百セットでペイし、数千セットも売れたらヒット商品という世界だったので、TRPGは「箱の中に数十頁のルールブックと称するパンフレットとサイコロが２〜３個、マス目を書いたボール板が１枚」という、非常にチープな構成ながら、数千円で販売されていた。
「 サイコロは別売で買えばいいし、マス目を書いたボール板はオプション販売するなり、手近にあるものを代用すればいい。ルールブックそのものは紙に印刷されたものなのだから、書籍の形態を取ればいい。量産すればコストも下がり、数百円で売れる。書籍流通に乗せれば、より一般の目に付きやすい」
……というような着想と流れから、ハコモノが主流だったTRPGは、書籍形態にシフトする。
値段が安くなれば手に取りやすいから売れるはずだ、という戦略が正しかったのかどうかはわからないけれど、それまで数百〜数千人程度が上限だったTRPG市場は、「最低でも１〜２万部は印刷」という市場規模に拡大。
市場が大きくなったところで、やはり「ルールブックが行き渡ったら、商品寿命が終わる」という焼畑農業的な頭打ち感から逃れることはできなかった。
ここから逃れるために、
1)ルールブックの高度化*5
2)追加ルールの販売*6
3)新しい物語背景＆システムの、新作の発売*7
という形で 、TRPG市場に商品を投入した。市場がある程度大きくなったことで、ユーザーには多様性や選択の余地が生まれたが、結果的に「同一の客を、複数の供給者が食い合う」というパイの奪い合いが発生。他社商品との差別化のため、一層システムが高度化して難しいものになっていく。*8
ルール（システムや性能）が高度化すると、やはりついて行けないユーザーは増えていく。そうなると、頭打ちどころかユーザー離れというマイナスへの逆転現象が起きてしまう。
このため 、TRPGは当初の「ルールブックを売る商売」から離れて、「ルールブックを必要とする世界観をベースにしたスピンオフ商品を売る商売」に発展を始める。
同時に、高度化しすぎてプレイできない一般/初心者ビギナーを、その「世界観」に繋ぎ止めつつ、TRPGを実際には遊んでいないのに遊んでいるような気分にさせる、
4 ) リプレイ
という商品が登場する。
これは、プロによるゲームプレイの様子を書き起こした読み物で、小説の一形態。世界観や登場人物を基軸に据えた、一種のキャラクタービジネスに進化した。「ロードス島戦記」*9などがこれに当たり、ロードス島戦記の元々のプレイシステムだったD&Dは態を潜め、ロードス島戦記の世界観、登場人物、ストーリーなどが、主商品となっていく。*10
ロードス島戦記の成功を手本に、「世界観とストーリーと登場人物に、システムがオマケで付く」というようなものを複数の出版社が競って新作を出すに至った。
キャラクタービジネスが成功したものはそれなりにキャラクター商品としてはヒットもしたのだが、高度化しすぎたTRPGそのものは、次第に遊ばれなくなっていった。
そして、数年に渡るブームが収束した後のTRPGは、マジック・ザ・ギャザリングのブームに取って代わられる。
マジック・ザ・ギャザリングがブレイクした理由は様々だが、事業的な面から言えば「ルールブックを買ったらもうおしまい」だったTRPGに対して、マジック・ザ・ギャザリングは「デッキを増強するために、カードを買い続けなければならない」という要素を加味した部分が非常に大きい。この概念は、遊戯王その他の国産カードゲームにも引き継がれ、長く「事業性のある構造」として支持・強化されてきた。収益性があり持続性があったことが、カードゲームを長期的に発展し続けられるものにし、TRPGを衰退させたと言える。
事業性について云々すると、また眉をしかめられそうなのだが(^^ ;)
、ユーザーにとって「気に入ったもので長く遊べる、そして新しい要素が常に加わり続ける」という状態が続くのが喜ばしいことであるわけで、そこに持続的事業性がなければ、その状態は長くは続かない、という視点は重要なんじゃないかと思う。
TRPGとカードゲームの明暗は、あんまり近視眼的・短絡的な見方をしてると、それについて熱烈に考えている人ほど、未来を細めてしまうかもよ、という警鐘とも言えなくもない。
ここで結論とし て 「 TRPGは滅びた」と言ってしまうと、多方面から「あいつは何もわかってない」とお叱りを受けるのでそうは言わないけれど、マニアでなければ処理できない高度な知識を必要とするものになった結果として、一般的に遊ばれ広く認知されるものではなくなったことは否めない。
ここまでの説明には、 「 人間のゲームマスターが処理してきた戦闘の解決を、コンピュータが代行してくれるコンピュータRPGが、TRPGより広く普及したことでTRPGの歴史的役目が終わった」という視点が抜け落ちているので、TRPGの衰退の原因を販売形態と大人の事情だけに求めて説明するのには無理がある。
が、ここから得られるヒントは次の点。
既存マニアへの依存を念頭に置いた商売は頭打ちになるのが早い
性能の高度化は時にビギナーユーザーを引きはがしてしまい、市場の縮退を早めることがある
既存マニアは購買意欲＆能力は高いが、既存マニアの購買能力をアテにしすぎるのは危険(消費者への商品供給が多すぎると、購買意欲のあるマニアは疲弊してしまう)
良いものを作ったから必ず売れるわけではない*11
うまくいったやり方への依存が高すぎるのは危険
売れ続ける構造( 収益があがる仕組み ) を維持しなければ、ジャンルとしての衰退からは逃れられない
音楽が売れ続けているのは、「売り続ける仕組み（産業構造）」が確立されている点と、音楽を聞くという需要そのものが潰えることはあり得ないから。作り手のクリエイティヴィティの発露というのはもちろん大きな推進力であることには変わりないのだが、「売れる」のは「買う」という需要があるからでもあり、需要と供給がうまくバランスを取るために産業構造が機能しているからであろうと思う。供給側が「これはいいもの」といっても、需要側が「でも必要ない」と言ってしまえば、この構造は成立しない。
ちなみに、エロが売れ続けているのも「生殖行為に対する本能的欲求」を満たすというものであるからだろうと思う。需要が尽きるのは人間が滅びた後だけであるわけで、需要が続く以上は供給が途絶えることはない。だからエロは求められ続けるし、リスクの低い産業として今後も永久に続く。*12
音楽を聴くという行為が本能的欲求かどうかはわからないんだけど(^^;)、僕はそれに近いモノだと思っているし、そうであってほしい気がする。
このエントリ はTRPGの興隆と衰退の覚え書きのようなものではあるんだけど、一言で言うと「結局、いちばん普及して欲しかったシステム(ゲームそのもの)は消え、スピンオフであったはずのキャラクター戦略だけが生き延びた」ということ。
TRPG を「初音ミク」というソフトウェアに、ゲームマスターをPに、多種多様なルールブックというのを今後出てくるかもしれない上位版や高機能なDAWソフトに、リプレイ本を楽曲に置き換えて考えてみることもできなくはない。若干こじつけっぽいが。
が、システム（＝この場合、初音ミクというソフト）を焼畑農業的に拡散普及させていくことは不可能だし、いずれ頭打ちになるのは間違いない。*13
行き渡ったルールブックを使ってプレイしたリプレイ本が命脈を繋いだように、行き渡った初音ミク*14で作られた楽曲で命脈を繋ぐという展開を考えるというのはやっておくべきだろなと思う。
そんなわけで、本日の話題は初音界だけでなく、僕の本業のほうやその他の「消費者が存在するあらゆる人気商売」を考える上でのヒントにもなるのかもしれない。そうでないかもしれない。明日はどっちだ。
業界的ロートルｗからの本日の心配事は以上です。
横田めぐみさん遺骨は偽物と「 断定」されたのか
この話題に関連して 。
こんな妙な転職があったとは全然知らなかった。報道されなかったよなあ。そういやDNA鑑定が出た直後に村上龍が「なぜ第三国に依頼して説得力を高めないんだ」とえらく筋の通ったことを言ってたが。これはヤバイだろ。
産経新聞は2005年3月26日朝刊の社会面にて、遺骨を鑑定した帝京大学の吉井さんが警視庁へ引き抜かれた件について報じています。こういうことは、多い。→報道は不十分なのか（2005-08-18）
北朝鮮が提出した 「 横田めぐみさんの遺骨」が偽物であったと日本国政府が発表したのは2004年12月8日午後の官房長官会見の場でした。新聞報道は翌9日朝刊に始まっています。
横田めぐみさんのものとされる「遺骨 」 はＤＮＡ鑑定により、二週間余りで「別人」との結論が出された。
「北」が遺骨を焼いたため、鑑定は困難とみられていたが、現在は一億八千万人中の一人を判別するまで鑑定技術が向上している。捜査関係者は「北は日本の科学捜査を甘くみていたのでは」と話している。
めぐみさんの事件を捜査する新潟県警は十一月下旬に警察庁科学警察研究所（科警研）と帝京大に依頼。遺骨は高温で焼かれた上に細かく「やってみなければ鑑定できるかどうかも分からない」（警察庁幹部）という状態で、科警研での鑑定はＤＮＡ検出が困難で「鑑定不能」だった。
しかし、帝京大で最先端のＤＮＡ鑑定の結果、「遺骨」から二人の人物のＤＮＡが検出された。関係者によると、横田さんの両親が大切に保存していためぐみさんの臍（へそ）の緒から抽出したＤＮＡと異なることが、七日に判明した。
帝京大の鑑定技術は「国内最高水準」（新潟県警）。オウム真理教による坂本堤弁護士一家殺害事件など、事件捜査で鑑定を行っているほか、旧ソ連に抑留されて現地で亡くなった戦没者の遺骨鑑定も担当、遺族の特定につなげた。
帝京大での成功について、民間のＤＮＡ鑑定会社「ＤＮＡソリューション」の船越一弘社長は「ＤＮＡの抽出に使った検体の違いや、試薬の種類、抽出後の鑑定作業の違いが結果につながった」とみる。 鑑定は、ＤＮＡを包んでいるタンパク質を試薬で酵素分解してＤＮＡだけを抽出、これを比較対象のＤＮＡと特徴を比べて行う。
「研究レベルであれば、試薬は最新のものも含め何種類もあるだろう。二人の人物のものとまで鑑定できたのであれば、正常なＤＮＡが抽出できたと思われる」と船越社長。抽出したＤＮＡの一部が破損していても「破損程度によっては時間と労力をかけＤＮＡの正常な特定部位を割り出し鑑定することも可能」という。
そして国会論戦の模様は以下の通り。
首藤委員 そういう話は我々はもう新聞でも何でも読んでいるわけですけれども。
では、何で障害になっているのかというと、それはやはり日本と北朝鮮との関係ですよね。障害になっているのは二国間の関係なんですよ。その二国間の関係のどこが起点かというと、それは昨年に外務省が派遣団を送って、そこで横田めぐみさんの遺骨と称されるものが送られてきた、それを科学分析に回したらにせものだった。そういうことで十二月から一挙に緊張感を強めて、日本は小泉さんが約束した人道支援まで打ち切っちゃったわけですね。
では、そのもととなった、横田めぐみさんの遺骨がにせものだった、かくも不誠実な国だ、かくも私たちをばかにしている国だ、こういうふうに一方的に言っているわけですけれども、では、その科学的分析というのは、これはもう前回言わせていただきましたこのネイチャーで、いや、そんなことでは、火葬になった骨の断片からは、今の技術ではミトコンドリアのＤＮＡは発見されないというのが科学的知見であり、発見されたとしても科学的にそれを確証できないという記事が出ました。
私は、世界を代表するような科学雑誌のネイチャーがそういうことを発表したのは驚いたんですけれども、さらにまた、それの継続でネイチャーは、日本政府をもう一度、日本政府のやっていることは科学を政治でゆがめているとエディトリアルで書いているわけですよ。
このネイチャーは、御存じのとおり、何か趣味の人が見るのではなくて、世界を代表するような科学者、何十万人の大科学者がそれを見ているわけですよ。だから、もしそういうことで、ネイチャーの言っていることに日本も反論できなければ、これはもう本当に日本の科学の水準、そしてまた科学を日本が悪用しているんじゃないかという批判にこたえられないわけですよ。
これは既にもうネイチャーだけではなくて、韓国でも大変強烈な批判があって、韓国は日本と違って、例の有名な地下鉄の火災事件というのがあって、地下鉄で犯人がガソリンをまいたために百人を超える人が焼死体になっている。本当にたくさんのサンプルがあるわけですよ。そこでも、こんなに限られた空間で、こういう火葬とかシステム的に高温の熱を与えるんじゃなくて、火葬というのはばらばらな条件があって、靴を履いていれば温度が下がったりいろいろなことがある。それにもかかわらず、韓国では、その焼死体の中の焼けた骨からは一切ＤＮＡが発見されなかったということなんですよね。
それから、九・一一のアメリカのテロの中でも、あれも本当に限られた、しかも火葬とかいうんじゃなくて本当にいろいろな条件があって、もっと検査という点ではよりＤＮＡが残りやすい状況にあったにもかかわらず、何と四割が確定できなかったというように言われているんですよ。
どうしてそれが日本で認められるのか。そんなだったら、日本の科学的水準が本当に怪しいものだ、しかも、それを政治がゆがめているという評価が定着していきますと、例えばＢＳＥの問題に関しても、日本がこういう科学的な成果があるからアメリカじゃなくて日本はこちらへ行くんだと言っても、世界で通らないじゃないですか。
ですから、そうしたネイチャーの第二回のものが、エディトリアルが出て、世界じゅうから日本のこの検査に関しては大変な批判がある、これに対して日本政府はどういうふうに対応しようとしているんでしょうか。いかがでしょうか。 町村国務大臣 ネイチャーが立派な雑誌であるということは私も承知をしておりますが、一々の報道等には、それは必要があれば反論してもいいのですが、私どもは一々それについて言う必要はない、こう考えております。
御指摘の取材を受けた関係者に対しても、これは私ども、直接というよりは捜査当局の方から事実関係を確認したわけでございますけれども、その関係者は取材の中で、焼かれた骨によるＤＮＡ鑑定の困難性一般論を述べたにとどまっておりまして、当該鑑定結果が確定的ではないんだという旨を言及したことではないということをその方が言っておられると私どもは聞いております。
いずれにいたしましても、この当該報道が今回私どもがやったこの鑑定結果に何らの影響を及ぼすものではない、私どもはそう判断をいたしております。 首藤委員 違いますよ、外務大臣、これは日本の、あるいは東アジアの安全が絡むかもしれない大きな問題なんですよ。いろいろ緊張関係があって、もっと大きな深刻な問題になったとき、あるいは日本が国際社会で拉致問題を解決するために訴えて、その起点がどこにあるか論争になったとき、日本の態度というものが、こんなに非科学的なことで日本が主張してきたということが明らかになれば、我が国は再度、私たちの名誉を失っていくわけですよ。ですから、このことは本当にそんな一雑誌の問題ではないんですよ。
私自身も、その雑誌の記事を書かれたシラノスキー記者にインタビューして詳しく聞きましたよ。そうすると、やはりこれは、それを分析された吉井講師自身が、これは驚いた、自分でもまさか出てくるとは思わなかったというぐらい、彼らにとってもたまたま出てきたことなんですね。
しかし、問題は、それがうそだとかいうんじゃなくて、明らかに、吉井講師自身が認めているように、骨というものはまるでスポンジのようにいろいろなＤＮＡを吸収してしまう。そこで人が話していて、例えばつばが飛んでいったり、あるいはそういう何か生体の微妙な飛沫、汗とか空気の中の湿気とか、そういうものでもＤＮＡというのは吸収されていくわけですね。
そこで、例えば、違うというならば、ほかの人のＤＮＡ、ミトコンドリアが出るというならば、例えばそこの研究室にいるすべての女性のＤＮＡをチェックしたか、そういうことが本当は必要となるわけですが、この問題がどういうふうにされたかは大変疑問なまま、あたかも科学的な証拠だとして外交の関係を断絶するぐらい大きなことをやり、それが六カ国協議の障害になっているんですね。この責任というのは、やはり政府の責任というのは余りにも大きいと思うんですね。
問題なのは、ではもう一回骨を出してくださいと言ったら、それは実験の過程で粉砕しちゃってなくなっちゃいましたと。証拠がなくなったら、これは反論しようがないじゃないですか。いかに北朝鮮のいわゆる備忘録がインチキだとかいったって、こちらも立証できなければいけない。
そこでお願いしたいのは、分析ですけれども、クローン化していくわけですね。ただその骨からＤＮＡを取り出すんじゃなくて、それを、そのミトコンドリアのＤＮＡをクローン化していく、いわゆるネステッドＰＣＲという方式で吉井講師が独自にやられるわけですけれども、当然のことながら、その結果として出たものは何かの形で残っているんです。
骨自体は、粉砕しそれを溶液に浸して溶かしてしまったかもしれない。しかし、その結果を遺伝子に写したプライマーや、あるいは、もし細菌とかそういうものに写したら、それはそこのコロニーには当然のことながら残っているわけですね。それは果たして残っているのか。もし残っていなかったら、私は、それは証拠を隠滅したことになる、そうじゃないでしょうか。警察の御意見をお聞きしたいと思いますが。
瀬川政府参考人 お答えいたします。
本件鑑定は、まず申し上げますと、横田めぐみさんの遺骨であるとして北朝鮮側から提供があったものにつきまして、刑事訴訟法の規定に基づきまして、厳格な手続によりまして、国内最高水準の研究機関であります帝京大学及び科学警察研究所でＤＮＡ鑑定を実施したものでございます。
今御質問の中で、いわゆるコンタミネーション、汚染の可能性ということも御指摘をされましたけれども、そういった問題については、鑑定人において十分考慮され、骨片をまず十分に洗浄した上で鑑定を行ったものと聞いております。その表面を洗浄した液からはＤＮＡは全く検出されていないということでございまして、骨表面の汚染物質によるＤＮＡ鑑定の結果ではないということが鑑定書の中においても明らかになっているところでございます。
それから、お尋ねの鑑定に供したＤＮＡの増幅物は保存されているのかということでございますが、具体的な鑑定の内容につきましては捜査上の問題でございますので差し控えさせていただきますけれども、一般論として申し上げれば、こういった鑑定に際しましては、鑑定の客観性を確保するために、可能な範囲で再鑑定のための考慮というものが払われているものであるということは申し上げておきたいというふうに思います。
ただ、本件の鑑定は、事の重大性、重要性を十分考慮しまして、鑑定人において二度にわたって行われました。二度とも同様の結果が出たものであるということを申し上げておきたいというふうに思います。 首藤委員 いや、局長、それはおかしいですよ。刑事訴訟法でこういうような手続で、例えば人の罪科が決まり、警察は柏に巨大な科学警察研究所、科警研を持っていて、にもかかわらず一私学の一講師がやっている研究機関が日本の最高水準というんだったら、それなら科警研は廃止したらいいじゃないですか。膨大な人間がいて。そんなことで有罪、無罪の証拠が出たら、科学警察じゃないし、近代警察じゃないですよ、それは。
それは、当然のことながらクロスチェックをして、もしこういうような国際的な問題だったら、国際機関にも頼んでやって、それから例えば先ほど言っていたネステッドＰＣＲの結果、サンプルが残っているならそれを今提示されたらどうですか。我が国も吉井講師以外にもいろいろな法医学の専門家がたくさんいて、その方たちが見て、ああ、それは間違いない、これは確かにそういうことがあって、コンタミネーションじゃないということがわかれば、それはそれでまた一つの外交をバックアップする事実になっていくわけです。ですから、どうしてそういうことをされないかですよ。
私は、吉井講師に会う必要はもちろんあると思いますけれども、それはまたこれからの話題として、その吉井講師が何と警視庁の科捜研の研究科長になっちゃった。これ、職員ですよ。科学警察の研究所へ出向されるとか、そういうことならともかく、一民間人のおよそ警察的な訓練を受けていない人が警視庁の科学捜査の、捜研の、それの職員になってしまう。それは、多くは今既に言われているように、証人隠しじゃないですか。
こんなことをやっていては日本がやはり世界から認められるわけないですよ。こんなこと、分析結果、私は北朝鮮の今までやったことも言っていることもでたらめだと思いますよ。しかし、相手がでたらめだからといってこちらがでたらめをやっていいということは何もないんですよ。やはりきちっとやっていかなければいけないんだと思うんですよ。
そうした問題に関して大臣にお聞きしたいんですよ。ですから、客観的に言うと、これは韓国でもアメリカでも、このネイチャー誌を見た人からもうぼろくそに言われています。それならば、なぜこんなインチキなものをやったか。二つしかないんですよ。
一つは、もういいから、北朝鮮との間はもう完全に国交を断絶するつもりでばんとぶつけてやる、もう言い言葉に返す言葉でぶつけてやると。あるいは、横田めぐみさんが本当にどこかで生きていると確証を持っていて、だから遺骨なんというのは全部うそなんだということを考えておられるのか。どっちのケースでしょうか。外務大臣、いかがでしょうか。 町村国務大臣 委員から我が方の科学的な鑑定のその信憑性をまことに疑わしめるような、そういう御発言があったのは、私は大変残念なことだと思います。私どもは、何の予断も持たずに、あらかじめどういう結論を引き出そうということで警察の鑑定を受けたわけではございません。あくまでも鑑定は鑑定として、客観的、第三者的なものに答えを出してもらおうということで警察の方がなさったわけであります。
それについてまことに今の委員の発言は、何かあたかも結論を持ってそういう結果をもうどんどん書いたと言わんばかりの御発言は、ぜひこれは、私どもがこの問題に真剣に取り組んでいるということに対する半ば侮辱ともとれるような御発言でありますから、ひとつ私は、その辺はよく慎重に言葉を選んで御発言をいただきたいとお願いをいたします。 首藤委員 いや、外務大臣、今おっしゃった言葉はそっくりお返ししますよ。私は、こういうことを言えば、私のところにはたくさんの抗議メールが来て、いろいろな電話がかかってきて、大変な思いをしているんですよ。しかし、私は、日本の名誉のために、国会議員として真実を明らかにしなければいけないと。
私は、別に政府を批判しているんじゃないんですよ。真実はどこにあるのか。真実を確証できるならば、証拠があるなら、もう一度確証したらどうですか、そういうことを言っているわけですよ。それは、ですから外務大臣、まさに同じ言葉をお返ししたいと思います。
残念ながら時間になりましたけれども、私は、この問題を明らかにしなければ必ず国際社会の場で日本が再度たたかれることになる、したがってやはりこの問題はしっかりして先へ進んでいきたい、そういうことを切に切にお願いして、質問を終わります。
どうもありがとうございました。
首藤信彦さんは2005年9月の衆議院議員選挙で落選しました。私は首藤さんの日頃の主張には感心しないことが多い。けれども与党に真実をきちんと明らかにする意欲が欠けている問題について、野党の追及は必要だとあらためて思う。
遺骨は偽物と発表して以来、「なぜ経済制裁しないのか」と世論が盛り上がっています。しかし政府は、次第に包囲網を狭めつつも、現在に至るまで強力な制裁を発動していません。それは何故か?
という問いに対する、ひとつの答えがここにあるのだと思う。
