In theory , it was simple : Congress gave two decommissioned Coast Guard cutters to a faith - based group in California , directing that the ships be used only to provide medical services to islands in the Central and South Pacific .
Coast Guard records show that the ships have been providing those services in the South Pacific since the medical mission took possession of them in 1999 .
In reality , the ships never got any closer to the South Pacific islands than the San Francisco Bay .
The mission group quickly sold one to a maritime equipment company , which sold it for substantially more to a pig farmer who uses it as a commercial ferry off Nicaragua .
The group sold the other ship to a Bay Area couple who rent it for eco-tours and marine research .
The gift of the two cutters was one of almost 900 grants Congress has made to faith - based organizations since 1987 through the use of provisions , called earmarks , that are tucked into bills to bypass normal government review and bidding procedures .
To the dog lover , the ability of man 's best friend to bark at the postman and fetch a stick is proof of his intelligence .
But they may be even brighter than that .
Scientists have welcomed dogs into a select club of species capable of using abstract concepts .
The research showed that dogs are able to mentally sort objects into categories , a talent for abstract thought that has only been shown in birds and primates before .
The researchers trained four dogs with a touch - screen test which involved choosing between two images which appeared simultaneously .
One was an image of a dog , the other a landscape .
The animals indicated their preference with a prod of their noses .
When they chose the dog they were rewarded with food .
If they chose the landscape they had to wait a few seconds before the same two images appeared again .
Next the team tested the dogs - two border collies , an Australian shepherd and a mongrel - with an unfamiliar set of dog pictures and landscapes .
To pass they would need to realise that " dog " is a category of object that unfamiliar objects also fall into .
Their success dropped slightly from about 80 % to 72 % .
" It shows us that dogs are able to use more or less abstract concepts , " said Dr Friederike Range , who carried out the work with colleagues at the University of Vienna .
Lastly , the experimenters used familiar landscapes as background with new dog images superimposed .
Again the animals were able to choose the ones with the dogs .
The research appears in the journal Animal Cognition and is reported today in New Scientist magazine .

The word came down suddenly in early January to the fifty or so U.S. troops stationed inside Camp Simba , a Kenyan naval base located on that country 's sandy coast :
Drop everything and pull everyone back inside the compound wire .
Then they were instructed to immediately clear a couple acres of dense forest .
Task Force 88 , a very secret American special - operations unit , needed to land three CH - 53 helicopters .
" We had everybody working nonstop , " says Navy Lieutenant Commander Steve Eron , commander of Contingency Operating Location Manda Bay , a new American base in Kenya , including a dozen or so on - site KBR contractors .
By the next day , every tree had been hauled off and the field graded and packed down using heavy machinery .
The pad was completed in thirty - six hours .
Soon after , U.S. special operators flying out of Manda Bay were landing in southernmost Somalia , searching for survivors among the foreign fighters and Al Qaeda operatives just targeted in a furious bombardment by a U.S. gunship launched from a secret airstrip in eastern Ethiopia .
The 88's job was simple : Kill anyone still alive and leave no unidentified bodies behind .
A few weeks later , the president would announce the creation of a new regional command -- Africa Command -- that would commit U.S. military personnel to the continent on a permanent basis .
The January operation would be , in effect , the first combat mission of Africa Command , and it would not go as planned .
Ethiopia 's Meles regime , which American Central Command officers describe as " xenophobic to the core , " was going into Somalia last December whether the Americans approved or not .
The recently installed Somali Council of Islamic Courts , with its loose talk of getting back another star point in its flag ( otherwise known as Ethiopia 's Ogaden region ) , simply had to go .
As it happened , the Americans , who had been quietly training the Ethiopian troops for years , did approve .
In fact , Centcom was very eager for the operation .
Most press leaks made it sound like our main targets were a trio of Al Qaeda senior operatives responsible for bombing American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania a decade ago .
But the real story is one of pure opportunism , according to a knowledgeable source within the headquarters : " There were three thousand foreign fighters in there .
Honestly , nobody had any idea just how many there really were .
But we wanted to get them all . "
When the invading Ethiopians quickly enjoyed unexpected success , Centcom 's plan became elegantly simple :
Let the blitzkrieging Ethiopian army drive the CIC , along with its foreign fighters and Al Qaeda operatives , south out of Mogadishu and toward the Kenyan border , where Kenyan troops would help trap them on the coast .
" We begged the Kenyans to get to the border as fast as possible , " the Centcom source says , " because the targets were so confused , they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off . "
Once boxed in by the sea and the Kenyans , the killing zone was set and America 's first AC - 130 gunship went wheels - up on January 7 from that secret Ethiopian airstrip .
After each strike , anybody left alive was to be wiped out by successive waves of Ethiopian commandos and Task Force 88 , operating out of Manda Bay .
The plan was to rinse and repeat " until no more bad guys , " as one officer put it .
" We could have solved all of East Africa in less than eight weeks , " says the Centcom source , who was involved in the planning .
Central Command was extremely wary of being portrayed in the media as Ethiopia 's puppet master .
In fact , its senior leaders wanted to keep America 's participation entirely secret .
The goal was for Ethiopia to get all the credit , further bolstering America 's controversial but burgeoning military ties with Meles Zenawi 's increasingly authoritarian regime .
Proud Kenya , still visibly nervous from the 1998 embassy bombing , would have been happy with a very quiet thank - you .
It was a good plan .
And it was leaked to the press almost as soon as it started .
Those involved in the Central Command operation suspected two sources : 1 ) somebody in the Office of the Secretary of Defense who could n't wait to trumpet their success to bitter personal rivals in the State Department , or 2 ) a dime dropper from our embassy in Kenya who simply could n't stand the notion that the Pentagon had once again suckered State into a secret war .
The first New York Times piece in early January broke the story of the initial AC - 130 bombardment , incorrectly identifying a U.S. military base in Djibouti as the launching point .
That leak just let the cat out of the bag , tipping off the main target , a senior CIC leader named Aden Hashi Ayro , who , according to Centcom intelligence , had been completely fooled up to that point , thinking the Ethiopians had somehow gotten the jump on him .
Ayro survived his injuries , and he's now back in action in Mogadishu and , by all accounts , mad as hell at both the Ethiopians and the Americans .
Six weeks and a second Times story later , the shit really hit the fan in Addis Ababa .
Now the intensely proud Ethiopians , who had done all the heavy lifting in the operation , were being portrayed as bit players in their own war -- simpleton proxies of the fiendishly clever Americans .
After angry denials were issued ( Meles 's spokesman called the story a " fabrication " ) , the Ethiopians decided that if the Americans were so hot to mastermind another intervention in Somalia , they would just wash their hands of this mess as quickly as possible .
The return of the foreign fighters to Mogadishu 's nasty mix , along with Ethiopia 's fit of pique , quickly sent the situation in Somalia spiraling downward .
The transitional Somali government , backed by the United Nations , is faltering , and in scenes reminiscent of America 's last misadventures in Mog , both Ethiopian troops and African Union peacekeepers are taking fire from 360 degrees ' worth of pissed - off Somali clans determined to -- once again -- drive off the invading infidels .
Osama bin Laden himself could n't have written a better ending .
Naturally , it was n't supposed to happen this way .
America 's Central Command set up shop in Djibouti in May 2003 , moving ashore a Marine - led Joint Task Force that had been established six months earlier aboard the command ship Mount Whitney to capture and kill Al Qaeda fighters fleeing American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The task force did register one immediate big hit in November 2002 : A top Al Qaeda leader was taken out in Yemen by a Hellfire air - to - ground missile launched from an unmanned Predator drone in a scene right out of Syriana .
But other than that , the great rush of rats fleeing the sinking ship has not yet materialized , and so the Marines took up residence in an old French Foreign Legion base located on Djibouti 's rocky shore , just outside the capital .
Uncomfortable just sitting around , the Marines quickly refashioned the task force with the blessing of General John Abizaid , then head of Central Command , who envisioned Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa ( CJTF - HOA ) as a sort of strategic inoculant .
If the Marines were n't going to get to kill anybody , then they 'd train the locals to do it instead .
But CJTF - HOA , whose area of responsibility stretched from Sudan down to Kenya , soon evolved into something so much more : an experiment in combining defense , diplomacy , and development -- the so - called three - D approach so clearly lacking in America 's recent postwar reconstruction efforts elsewhere .
Because the task force did n't own the sovereign space it was operating in , as U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq did , the Marines were forced to work under and through the American ambassadors , their State Department country teams , and the attached U.S. Agency for International Development missions .
If little of that cooperation was occurring in Kabul and Baghdad , then maybe Africa would be better suited .
The Horn of Africa was supposed to be Washington 's bureaucratic mea culpa for the Green Zone , a proving ground for the next generation of interagency cooperation that fuels America 's eventual victory in what Abizaid once dubbed the " long war " against radical Islam .
But as its first great test in Somalia demonstrated , the three D's are still a long way from being synchronized , and as the Pentagon sets up its new Africa Command in the summer of 2008 , the time for sloppy off - Broadway tryouts is running out .
Eventually , Al Qaeda 's penetration of Muslim Africa will happen -- witness the stunning recent appearance of suicide bombers in Casablanca -- and either the three D's will answer this challenge , or this road show will close faster than you can say " Black Hawk down . "
Djibouti
After being ignored since the beginning of time ( save for its slaves and its treasure ) , Africa just got strategically important enough for us to care about .
And the Bush administration 's decision to set up Africa Command is historic , but not for the reasons given or assumed .
There are n't enough Islamic terrorists in Africa to stand up a full combatant command .
If all we wanted were flies on eyeballs , a small number of special - operations trigger pullers would have sufficed for the foreseeable future .
There 's oil here , but the United States would get its share whether Africa burns or not , and it 's actually fairly quiet right now .
The Chinese are here en masse , typically embedded with regimes we can't stand or can't stand us , like Sudan and Zimbabwe .
But the Chinese are n't particularly liked in Africa and seem to have no designs for empire here .
Beijing just wants its energy and minerals , and that penetration , such as it is , does n't warrant Africa Command , either .
America is going to have an Africa Command for the same reason people buy real estate -- it 's a good investment .
Too many large , hostile powers surround Central Asia for the radical jihadists to expand there , but Africa ?
Africa 's the strategic backwater of the world .
Nobody cares about Africa except Western celebrities .
So as the Middle East middle - ages over the next three decades and Asia 's infrastructural build - out is completed , only Africa will remain as a source for both youth - driven revolution and cheap labor and commodities .
Toss in global warming and you 've got a recipe for the most deprived becoming the most depraved .
The U.S. , through its invasion and botched occupation of Iraq , has dramatically sped up globalization 's frightening reformatting process in the Middle East , and with Africa on deck , the United States military is engaging in a highly strategic flanking maneuver .
Africa Command promises to be everything Central Command has failed to become .
It will be interagency from the ground up .
It will be based on interactions with locals first and leaders second .
It will engage in preemptive nation - building instead of preemptive regime change .
It will " reduce the future battlespace " that America has neither intention nor desire to own .
It 'll be Iraq done right .
Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa here in Djibouti is the clear model for what comes next , according to Rear Admiral Bob Moeller , who heads up the Defense Department 's transition team planning Africom 's structure .
It is the franchise that will be replicated across the entire continent .
Camp Lemonier , home to CJTF - Horn of Africa , is one nasty , hot , and oh - so - stanky chunk of rock adjoining the Red Sea , a place where the view of the night sky is routinely blocked by the thick black smoke rising from the capital city 's burning garbage pit located just outside the base wire .
Take away the port and there 's not much reason for anyone to come here , where the bulk of Djibouti 's 750,000 citizens live .
Djibouti welcomes the Americans as a counterweight to its neighbors , none of whom have the country 's best interests in mind .
To the north is Eritrea , which broke off from Ethiopia years back and favors Somalia against their common archrival .
Landlocked Ethiopia to the west wants a stable Djibouti primarily for its access to the sea .
But as Addis Ababa does n't mind fomenting trouble in Somalia , to Djibouti 's south , the relationship is frequently strained .
Besides being welcoming , Djibouti was a natural place for the United States to plant its first African precinct :
It 's where Africa meets the Persian Gulf .
Camp Lemonier was just a bunch of tents surrounded by walls filled with sand for the first three years , with the serious settling in beginning when the Navy took over the command from the Marines in early 2006 .
Until recently , the camp 's roughly fifteen hundred sailors , marines , Army , Air Force , Coast Guard , and civilians were crammed into a very cramped hundred - acre plot , buttressed on one side by the sole runway the task force shares with both the Djibouti International Airport and a French marine base still operating there .
Now , thanks to a new five - year lease signed with the Djiboutian government , the camp has expanded to roughly five hundred acres , to include a sprawling suburb called " CLU City , " named after the rows and rows of containerized living units , housing two thousand people in all , plopped down in what is certainly one of the world 's most brutally utilitarian bedroom communities .
I got a glimpse of CLU City from the guard tower just inside the eastern wall of the base late one Sunday afternoon .
The task force 's public - affairs officer , Major David Malakoff , was right on my elbow the entire time .
Malakoff had walked me around the camp the day before , carefully pointing out the " wire within the wire " that is the special - operations compound .
He said no one would be answering questions about them because no one on base knows anything about what they do .
This is a common theme from senior officers at Lemonier .
Captain Bob Wright , who heads up strategic communications for the task force , told me that he had " absolutely no access " to the special - ops unit there , despite having " all the right clearances . "
As I stood up on the guard tower , snapping photos of CLU City , I looked over toward the Djibouti airport , and my eye was drawn to the sight of men dressed in black scrambling down the side of a nondescript building on the north side of the base .
" What 's going on over there ? " I asked , pointing .
" Over where ? "
Malakoff answered slowly .
" I do n't see anything . "
Behind me , the base commander 's aide was tensing up .
I pulled my eye back from my camera slowly , looked down off the tower , and calculated the drop in feet to the ground .
Better to continue this conversation below .
" Okay , got a nice shot of a plane .
I 'm done ! " I started heading to the ladder .
A rapid - fire chorus of " Great ! " " Good ! " and " All right ! " triggered everyone 's movement right on my heels .
Back on the ground , Malakoff turned to me and whispered , " You did n't take any shots of those guys on the building , did you ? "
" No . "
" Good , " Malakoff said .
" That would have been the end of your camera right there , and maybe more .
I 'm just trying to look out for you here . "
Special - operations enthusiasts , like the journalist Robert Kaplan , love to romanticize the almost limitless utility of the trigger pullers in globalization 's dark alleys like the Horn .
This makes some sense , as they tend to generate all the " kinetics , " or killing , and that 's what draws in the international press .
But with CJTF - HOA , the regular military is trying to reassume its historical role in the everything else that accompanies the trigger - pulling : the civil - affairs work , the humanitarian stuff , the community projects designed to win hearts and minds .
In a pinch , the SOF guys will do these sorts of things as well , but the long war has become one long squeeze on special operators , who are now such rare commodities -- recruitment - wise -- that some are commanding reenlistment bonuses well above $ 100,000 , lest Blackwater USA hire them all .
So the romantic view of special operations encouraged by Kaplan and others , that the SOF guys are all you need for a backwater like Africa , is yielding to a new normal : a strategic view that recognizes there are too few trigger pullers to go around , and with the Marines backfilling Special Operations Command where it can , bases like Lemonier are quickly being taken over , often by reservists who have n't been on an aircraft , ship , or submarine for years .
The U.S. Navy now commands the base , freeing up the Marines for more pressing duty elsewhere in the region , and although CJTF - HOA 's C is supposed to signify a " combined " effort involving coalition member states , only a dozen or so officers are actually drawn -- as liaisons -- from ten militaries ( five local , five distant ) other than our own .
Indeed , the French , with their roughly three thousand men next door , along with all their wives and kids living off base , constitute by far the largest foreign contingent in Djibouti .
In comparison , the Americans remain somewhat isolated on their base with their 10:00 p.m. curfew , as Lemonier is still considered a " hardship post " that rules out families .
The task force 's stated mission -- a profound expansion of , and evolution from , its original capture - and - kill orders -- is to prevent conflict by promoting stability regionally and , in that prophylactic approach , ultimately " prevail over extremism " by never letting its seeds find purchase in local soil .
In the Horn of Africa , when you 're talking urban , middle - class , educated , commercial , and connected , you 're more likely describing Christian populations , and when you 're talking rural , impoverished , uneducated , agrarian , and off - grid , you 're mostly describing Muslim villages .
So it 's not enough to interact with the capital 's elites .
You either go " downrange , " as task - force officers like to say , or you might as well stay on base .
In addition to Camp Lemonier , three permanent contingency operating locations are up and running , two in Ethiopia ( Bilate and Hurso ) and one in Kenya ( Manda Bay ) .
A fourth base was established more than a year ago in Gode , Ethiopia , but it was closed as events heated up next door in Somalia .
If CJTF - HOA does become the model for Africa Command , the United States could easily be running a couple dozen such military bases on the continent by 2012 .
The pattern of our military 's expanding presence in Africa seems clear : 1 ) look where the locals or former colonials set up shop previously ; 2 ) move inside the existing wire first with your special operators for capture / kill missions and military - to - military training with the locals to do the same ; and then 3 ) settle in more formally with new versions of Camp Lemonier .
Once set up , the task force storefront can be used to flow trigger pullers onto the scene at a moment 's notice -- the precinct that hosts the SWAT team .
To old hands in the State Department and USAID , the Pentagon 's growing incursion into long - neglected Africa arouses ancient bureaucratic impulses toward territoriality .
They can't help but feel like their turf 's being invaded by the gun-toting crowd , hell - bent on opening a new front in a new war .
If Djibouti is a front , then it's a messy one , because the fault lines seem more cultural than tactical .
The place is a great example of the tectonic stresses at work here , its battered visage almost exemplifying the numerous civilizations that have crashed into one another here on the streets of this ancient port city .
Djibouti was hopping my last night in town before I flew downrange .
Several thousand French sailors were on liberty that Sunday night , fresh off the carrier Charles de Gaulle and the other ships in its task force .
Half the port 's prostitutes are said to be HIV - positive , and the sailors were taking their lives in their hands .
As the French were landing , I headed out in a Toyota Land Cruiser with Captain Bob Wright and a few of his young officers to find the local Ethiopian restaurant that everyone at Lemonier raves about but no one can ever find .
An hour later , we 're still not there .
Finally , we head into Djibouti's main square , to a restaurant Captain Wright knows well .
He jumps out of the Toyota and chats up the owner , who takes the whole hospitality thing so seriously that he sends Bob back to the car with his eldest son as our guide .
We careen through back alleys that squeeze tighter and tighter and finally come upon the Ethiopian Community Club , nestled between a Coptic Orthodox Christian church and a mosque .
The captain pays a couple of kids hanging out in the alley to watch the car , and we head up to the unlighted rooftop restaurant .
Sitting atop the building in the warm night air , we are serenaded from three sides in a mash - up only Tom Friedman could love .
The Coptic priest is haranguing his parish in an endless sermon ; on the other side , the looming mosque tower is booming its taped call to prayers ; and , once our waiter gets around to opening up the makeshift bar on the roof , Eminem joins in about what a whore his mother is from a boom box in the corner .
Popping beers and shouting through the din , Captain Wright steers the conversation to the tension between the two halves of HOA 's mission , the civil - affairs stuff and what everyone keeps calling " the recent kinetics in Somalia . "
The whole affair was a nightmare to Wright and his officers , he says , trashing years of patient effort by hundreds of officers to present a new and different face of the U.S. military .
" Strategic communications " means that no one ever sees the men in black rappelling down that building , the same men in black I had n't seen the day before .
Walking back to the car , Wright says , " Stuff like that makes everyone think that what we 're trying to do here at HOA really does n't count , but it does .
You can't make the Horn a better place simply by killing bad guys . "
So the question becomes , Is the civil - affairs stuff just a continuing cover for the special operations , or will they eventually yield an Africa that makes American interventions unnecessary ?
There 's a lot of concern here that the establishment of Africa Command may do more harm than good -- the poised hammer that makes everything suddenly look like a nail .
Manda Bay , Kenya
Traveling to HOA 's contingency operating location in Manda Bay , along Kenya 's eastern coast , is a multiday affair from Djibouti , including a couple of long flights on Kenya 's national airline and a two - hour military transport from Nairobi to a makeshift airstrip a few miles ' drive from the surrounding Kenyan naval base .
On the C - 130 flight with the task force 's deputy commander , Rear Admiral Tim Moon , we shared the cargo bay with a couple of huge pallets of well - digging machinery and more cases of Red Bull than I could count .
The ground crew in Nairobi said we were dangerously overloaded for the short runway , but after being unable to find a forklift big enough to repack the load originally put on board in Djibouti , our Air Force pilots just said , " No worries " ( and yes , in Swahili that really is hakuna matata ) , and we were off in a plane built the year I was born ( 1962 ) .
We skimmed the landing zone on our first pass to make sure no wild animals were on the strip .
From inside the windowless C - 130 , that experience feels like a last - second aborted landing , which I handled okay because I 'd skipped lunch earlier .
My seat companion , Major Tesfa Dejene from Ethiopia , laughed when he caught my grimace .
" I thought all you Americans like excitement ! "
Camp Simba , the Kenyan navy 's name for the base , is a struggle against nature .
Lieutenant Commander Steve Eron warns you upon entry that the concertina wire strung around the base perimeter is useful only in stopping humans .
The animals -- baboons , monkeys , hyenas , deer , and probably more deadly snakes than anywhere else in the world -- " come on through like it 's not even there . "
" I call it the zoo in reverse , " says Eron .
" Because they come here to watch us . "
Something to remember at 3:00 a.m. when you 're making that walk to the latrine forty yards from your hut , which is kept incredibly cold with air - conditioning because " keeping it cold keeps those cold - blooded animals out , " Eron says .
I make a mental note of where the camp 's sole medical corpsman is located .
Manda
Bay 's origins tell you everything you need to know about why the Americans showed up here .
The Kenyan navy built the base in 1992 , in response to the collapse of the Siad Barre dictatorship in Somalia the year before , right about the time U.S. marines were stepping off their amphibious ships and entering Mogadishu .
Kenya 's predominantly Muslim northern coastal area is so remote that it was simply easier to send military supplies to its border with Somalia along the coast using naval vessels than to head up inland by vehicles , as the sandy roads are impassable in the rainy season .
Years later , as Somalia began spiraling downward yet again , Central Command sent a special - operations contingent into Manda to begin training the Kenyan navy on antiterrorism tactics using high - speed patrol craft .
That effort laid the groundwork for Task Force 88 's sudden appearance earlier this year .
Rear Admiral Rich Hunt , who commanded HOA in 2006 , likes to brag that " we 've never fired a round in anger , " which is a little like saying , " HOA does n't kill people ; special operators do . "
This is a part of the world where military trucks and helicopters suddenly appearing on the horizon typically set off alarm bells with the locals , because it has usually meant that troops from the capital were coming to round them up and / or kill them , just like our troops were doing to those high - value targets in southern Somalia earlier this year .
Here , you 're just another scary guy in a uniform until you prove differently .
Jumping out of the tail of the C - 130 in Manda Bay 's intense March heat , I am surrounded by marines temporarily bivouacked alongside the remote airstrip in a cluster of tents .
They 're here for a bilateral naval exercise with the Kenyans .
The engineering brigade will come ashore soon and help rebuild a school , and Marine doctors will vaccinate the locals and treat all their basic maladies .
If this is a cover , it is very convincing .
On posts like this , the rank - and - file American troops tend to fall for the locals .
Not in some white - man 's - burden sort of way but simply out of the desire not to be sitting around on their asses , marking time across their tours , waiting like firemen for the next blaze .
There 's nothing in the traditional military system that demands , recognizes , rewards , or basically gives a flying fuck about making friends with local populations .
But still , soldiers like Army Captain Steve McKnight do it .
Team leader of Team B/413th Civil Affairs Battalion , McKnight is an instantly likable fellow .
He 's a balding bear of a guy whose uniform is a Cubs cap and a bike - messenger bag , and he comes off like a good high school football coach .
And he did coach at a school in an unglamorous part of Miami .
" Suburban kids did n't need me because they 've already got parents , " he says .
Unmarried at forty - three , McKnight stumbled into this African posting because of bureaucratic downsizing .
" I 'm a medical - service - corps officer -- direct commission .
I got attached to a reserve combat hospital down in Miami that folded , and there was a civil - affairs unit next to mine , and I walked over there and I was like , ' Hey , I need a home .
You guys got a place for me ? ' "
Civil affairs promised him the most remote locations with the neediest clients .
Now sitting across from me at a seedy Internet café located in the sweltering waterfront of Lamu , Kenya , an ancient seafaring port , McKnight downs a huge beer in a single gulp and leans back , flashing his gap - tooth grin like Vince Lombardi .
He 's been in country for almost six months now and has put in repeated requests to extend his tour of duty , to no avail .
" I 'll probably get me something deep in South America next , " he says .
McKnight in his element is a superb intelligence gatherer ( or what they call in spycraft " human intelligence " ) .
We took a long tour of Lamu 's labyrinthine back alleys , where the carved wooden doors mark the homes of some of the world 's oldest slave traders , and the open sewers reek .
I 'm holding my nose while McKnight presses the flesh of every shopkeeper we pass , most of whom warmly yell out his name in greeting .
He 's like some muzungu running for office on Lamu 's south side : exchanging gossip , asking how business has been lately , needling them for details about this or that local issue .
Admiral Moon 's visit included a showy meeting with senior Kenyan military officers down on the coast to mark the bilateral military exercise with the Americans .
A message had just come down from the embassy , which McKnight relayed to Moon : " The embassy says it wants everybody in civvies today , Admiral , just to play it safe . "
" The embassy is concerned about some photojournalist snapping a shot of the admiral standing next to some Ethiopian officer in uniform , " McKnight said .
" After the recent events in Somalia , that could trigger a lot of negative coverage . "
McKnight and I skip the photo op because he's got a civil - affairs project to check on : the rebuild of a local rural school by a U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit 's engineering battalion .
McKnight had done the preliminary scouting work with the Marines weeks earlier , picking out a school that HOA had helped build three years ago but that was already showing some structural problems , in large part because the Americans had relied too much on local contractors , who tend to mix way too much sand in their cement to cut on costs .
" Handing the money over to the contractor , disappearing for the life of the project , and coming back for the dedication ?
That 's a recipe for disaster , " says McKnight .
So this time around , the Marine combat engineers not only rehab all the buildings , they erect a significant fence to surround the entire school compound to keep out the wildlife that constantly wanders in , threatening the kids , raiding the pantry , and eating its way through the crops the staff grow to feed themselves and provide meals to the kids .
There 's going to be a problem when the Marines fly in the VIPs for the school rededication .
Their Chinook helos need such a large landing space that the school 's kitchen , made of sticks and mud , is put at risk .
Huff and puff and blow your building down .
On the spot , the Marines offer to trash the old kitchen and build a new , wood - frame one from scratch .
The headmaster convinces the Marines to build a new food pantry right next door .
He is elated .
" When you have the food , the kids are so happy , and they come in great numbers , and we keep them in school . "
Having worked that scene , McKnight 's on to connect his next dot : Sammy Mbugua , deputy director of the local Kenyan National Youth Service facility , a sprawling agriculture camp that experiments with all manner of crops and helps local farmers adopt new practices .
It 's a run-down collection of buildings , and looking at all the holes that pepper every piece of wood in the place , you quickly come to the conclusion that ants run the place more than anybody else .
McKnight has to reassure Sammy about all those helicopters buzzing by .
Mbugua , a slow - moving , middle - aged man whose rheumy eyes say he's no stranger to tropical diseases , is looking for explanations to give all the local villagers who pester him with questions .
" Some people are worried , Steve , " he says .
" Can you hear them go , the aeroplanes ? "
McKnight does his best to explain all the activity , emphasizing all the civil - affairs projects being conducted simultaneously alongside military exercises .
" Please tell them there 's nothing to be alarmed about , " he says .
" They 're doing exercises .
Yeah , that 's nothing to worry about . "
When the kinetic troop buildup happened on the border earlier this year , it scared everyone .
" They were like , ' What 's happening ?
Is there going to be a big battle here or something ? ' " McKnight says .
" The secondary school that does not exist here anymore was taken over by General Morgan , a Somali warlord , in 1992 .
He destroyed it and they have n't had a secondary school since .
The people here remember that . "
McKnight confirms with Mbugua that all the youth - service personnel got checked out by the Marine doctors running a medical exercise down the road .
" Yes , yes , " says Sammy .
" They all got their shots . "
This is what McKnight calls " housekeeping . "
And in his work , he has the bearing of a Peace Corps volunteer , not an Army officer .
" It 's the little things that make the difference , " he says .
" It 's not the big - picture project stuff , it 's remembering to bring that fourth grader in Kiunga the English books that we promised her .
It 's remembering to bring the chief a new stainless - steel coffee thermos .
And it 's not just the material stuff , it 's doing the interaction .
It 's humanizing the relationship .
You know , this business of just giving stuff , it 's dehumanized us and it's dehumanized them . "
Promising to meet up with Sammy over drinks at a cocktail party hosted by the director of the National Youth Service next week in Nairobi , McKnight is out the door .
Cruising back to Manda Bay , we pass a couple of Kenya Wildlife Service trucks .
McKnight has our Kenyan driver pull over , and McKnight exchanges information with the group 's leader .
" Always got to say hello , " McKnight explains .
" Those guys are the best security operating in this neck of the woods . "
The captain 's been in every room along Kenya 's border with Somalia that Al Qaeda operatives have been in .
He has interacted with every leader they 've tried to recruit , telling me that clerics there immediately renounced these guys once their identities became known .
While conservative , none of Kenya 's Muslims seem , in McKnight 's opinion , particularly attracted to radical ideology promoting violent separation from the outside world .
Rather , the local mullahs are desperate to have roads improved so that teachers can be attracted from the cities to their remote villages .
" Jihadism is a failed concept here , " McKnight says .
" It 's like trying to sell a vegetarian steak . "
We 'll see .
He tells the story of a primary school deep in the Muslim village of Bargoni where all the girls would drop out once they hit puberty .
In Africa , the impulse would be to think : AIDS , birth control , clerics bearing down .
But it was something far more prosaic .
When I had first arrived inside the wire at Camp Lemonier , I 'd seen a portable toilet labeled " Muslim female . "
The girls at the school were forced to quit at puberty because strict Islamic practice says that males and females can't share the same bathroom once girls come of age .
McKnight and his crew offered a simple fix : HOA would build the school a bathroom just for girls .
The impact was immediate .
For the first time , girls stayed in school , parents were happy , mullahs were satisfied , local leaders immensely gratified .
Word got around : " The Americans did this ! "
McKnight 's eyes well up as he remembers .
Kinetics is what the military does .
Iraq is a quagmire because kinetics is all we planned for .
But in this new time , on this continent , the military also builds latrines for girls .
That simple act might someday keep trigger pullers out of this village .
" I do n't need to go back to Florida and my inner-city school , " McKnight says .
" I 've got it all here .
It feels just like home . "
Africom
For the Pentagon , the corporation that runs the only military on earth with a global reach , the world is carved into regional commands .
Until now , Africa has been nothing but a strategic backwater -- the one place where America clearly had no interests and no bureaucratic structure to manage those nonexistent interests .
Africa was divided haphazardly between European Command , Central Command , and Pacific Command .
In a globalized world where bad actors live to exploit unguarded seams , we seemed to be providing Al Qaeda with several to exploit .
The U.S. military 's strategic take on Africa has long been " We have no compelling interests there , and we sure as hell do n't want anybody else to have any , either ! "
It was that attitude that got Washington nervous about the Soviet Union 's seeming ideological penetration of the continent in the late 1970s , and it's what gets the Pentagon nervous today about China 's obvious economic penetration .
But denying other great powers strategic interests in the region does not constitute a strategy of our own , nor does the great hunt for " high - value targets . "
Which is why America has come to Africa militarily and is n't leaving anytime soon .
The same can be said for China in the economic realm .
To work , a lot of preconceptions about what an American military presence is really good for in underdeveloped countries will have to change .
What we 've not learned in Iraq -- or taken far too long to learn -- will have to be somehow acquired , soldier by soldier and tour by tour , on the ground in Africa .
Rounding a corner in Lamu's claustrophobic back alleys , Captain Steve McKnight leads a military group through a dirty , cluttered courtyard .
It 's happy hour , and this multinational force consists of six HOA liaison officers -- a Brit , a South Korean , two Ethiopians , a Djiboutian , and a French colonel -- and Admiral Moon , and the whole group is guarded by two " force protection " infantrymen who hover fore and aft like mother hens .
We stick out like sore thumbs , and must conjure the past , when Africa was cynically sized up by visiting military officers for its potential to join what passed for globalization a century ago .
Barefoot , dirty kids , wearing clothes whose logos faded two or three owners ago , kick up the dust as they chase one another around the cracked plastic buckets that serve as their mother 's laundry system .
She 's busy hanging clothes out to dry on lines strung between the buildings , and we 're ducking under her wash , trying not to interfere .
The woman 's husband sits on what passes for the stoop of their house -- a single slab of rock .
He 's busy slurping a bowl of soup .
The grizzled old fisherman looks up from his bowl at the parade of military officers in mufti and says in perfect English : " Welcome to another world . "
Admiral Moon passes under the clothesline , straightens up , and stops .
" Thanks .
We feel welcome , " he says .
The man dismisses us with his hand , turns away to finish his soup , and a few seconds later we 're gone .

It is not the cartoons that make your kids smack playmates or violently grab their toys but , rather , a lack of social skills , according to new research .
" It 's a natural behavior and it's surprising that the idea that children and adolescents learn aggression from the media is still relevant , " says Richard Tremblay , a professor of pediatrics , psychiatry and psychology at the University of Montreal , who has spent more than two decades tracking 35,000 Canadian children ( from age five months through their 20s ) in search of the roots of physical aggression .
" Clearly youth were violent before television appeared . "
Tremblay 's previous results have suggested that children on average reach a peak of violent behavior ( biting , scratching , screaming , hitting ) around 18 months of age .
The level of aggression begins to taper between the ages of two and five as they begin to learn other , more sophisticated ways of communicating their needs and wants .
Tremblay on Wednesday is set to present preliminary study results showing a genetic signature consistent with chronic violent behavior at a meeting of The Royal Society , the U.K.'s academy of science , in London .
" We 're looking at to what extent the chronically aggressive individuals show differences in terms of gene expressions compared to those on the normal trajectory , " he told ScientificAmerican.com .
" The individuals that are chronically aggressive have more genes that are not expressed . "
The fact that a gene can be silenced or the level of protein it encodes reduced , he added , " is an indication that the problem is at a very basic level . "
When children first begin to poke , prod and even slap , parents , teachers and siblings often react by indicating that those behaviors are inappropriate .
But , citing studies done in animals , Tremblay notes that an unfit environment beginning in the womb may affect a child 's ability to learn this lesson in the first place .
And he plans to extend his genetic studies to include expectant mothers to determine if their behavior during pregnancy is linked to the down tuning of genes that may be associated with chronic aggression .
" In the long studies we 've been doing , we 've measured a number of characteristics during pregnancy and after birth that are good predictors '' of chronic aggression in children , Tremblay notes .
Possible factors that might influence neurobiological development of the fetus , he says , include smoking , drinking , poor nutrition and excessive stress .
Tremblay speculates that genes play a significant role : for instance damaged genes may make it hard for children to acquire language , frustrating them and making them prone to violence , among other means of making themselves heard .
" When you do n't master language , " Tremblay says , " it 's hard to get people to understand what you want . "
Kate Keenan , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago , views this new genetic analysis as the logical next step in Tremblay 's long - term exploration into childhood aggression .
She believes Tremblay 's work may help uncover genetic profiles distinct to chronically aggressive children that may allow researchers to answer questions like , " Can we differentiate [ between these kids ] even earlier ? " [ and ]
" How early can you intervene ?

Google currently processes over 20 petabytes of data per day through an average of 100,000 MapReduce jobs spread across its massive computing clusters .
The average MapReduce job ran across approximately 400 machines in September 2007 , crunching approximately 11,000 machine years in a single month .
These are just some of the facts about the search giant ’s computational processing infrastructure revealed in an ACM paper by Google Fellows Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat .
Twenty petabytes ( 20,000 terabytes ) per day is a tremendous amount of data processing and a key contributor to Google ’s continued market dominance .
Competing search storage and processing systems at Microsoft ( Dyrad ) and Yahoo ! ( Hadoop ) are still playing catch - up to Google ’s suite of GFS , MapReduce , and BigTable .
MapReduce statistics for different months Aug. 2004 Mar. 2006 Sep. 2007 Number of jobs ( 1000s ) 29 171 2,217 Avg. completion time ( secs ) 634 874 395

Google processes its data on a standard machine cluster node consisting two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper - Threading enabled , 4 GB of memory , two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet link .
This type of machine costs approximately $ 2400 each through providers such as Penguin Computing or Dell or approximately $ 900 a month through a managed hosting provider such as Verio ( for startup comparisons ) .
The average MapReduce job runs across a $ 1 million hardware cluster , not including bandwidth fees , datacenter costs , or staffing .
Summary
The January 2008 MapReduce paper provides new insights into Google ’s hardware and software crunching processing tens of petabytes of data per day .
Google converted its search indexing systems to the MapReduce system in 2003 , and currently processes over 20 terabytes of raw web data .
It ’s some fascinating large - scale processing data that makes your head spin and appreciate the years of distributed computing fine - tuning applied to today ’s large problems .
PORTSMOUTH —
Same - sex couples throughout the state will be able to obtain civil union licenses as of Dec. 10 , which will go into effect New Year 's Day .
PORTSMOUTH —
Same - sex couples throughout the state will be able to obtain civil union licenses as of Dec. 10 , which will go into effect New Year 's Day .
Licenses will be available at all New Hampshire town and city halls for $ 45 per couple .
The worksheet is like a marriage license , except the words " bride " and " groom " are deleted .
" It 's much the same process as marriage licenses , " said Portsmouth City Clerk Kelli Barnaby .
" Only it does n't go into effect until Jan. 1 . "
That day will be a joyous one for members of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Portsmouth , which will celebrate the long - awaited law change with a New Year 's Day party , featuring live bands , speakers and a pot luck lunch .
The Rev. Roberta Finkelstein said a number of couples in her congregation have looked forward to the day for a long time .
" There 's two reasons we 're celebrating , " she said .
" One is the progress in the state of New Hampshire .
The other is to remind us and others that it 's progress , but it 's not enough .
Until marriage is offered to same - sex couples , we do n't feel our work is done . "
Finkelstein said there is some confusion as to how the process will work , but she expects that will be made clear in the next month .
The paperwork will be delivered to clerks ' offices statewide next week and a final computer systems check is scheduled for the weekend of Dec. 8 .
" As far as we 're concerned , everything is on schedule , " Deputy Secretary of State Dave Scanlan said .
Applicants must have picture identification available .
If married previously , applicants will be required to provide a certified copy of the divorce decree , death certificate or dissolution of a previous civil union .

Brothers behind bars
( 11 - 19 ) 17:54 PST SAN JOSE -
The brother of a man recently charged with a 24 - year - old San Jose killing was arrested after a DNA sample he provided to tie his brother to the crime linked him to the rape of an 81 - year - old woman , authorities said today .
David Leonard Holland , 46 , was arrested Friday in Salinas for the 2001 rape after his DNA sample matched evidence from the attack , authorities said .
" We have to assume he did n't expect this to happen , " said David Tomkins , assistant deputy district attorney .
Holland is accused of entering the woman 's home through an open door early Oct. 10 , 2001 , threatening to kill her , then raping her .
He left behind DNA that was entered into local , state and federal databases , but no match was found until recently , authorities said .
Holland 's brother , Christopher Holland , was charged last month with raping and murdering 17 - year - old Cynthia Munoz of Campbell in 1983 .
She was raped , strangled and stabbed in her bedroom .
To tie Christopher Holland to the crime , investigators got DNA samples from David Holland and another brother .
Y chromosomes are almost always the same among men who have the same father .
David Holland 's DNA sample was entered into a database maintained by the Santa Clara County crime laboratory , and matched the DNA left at the scene of the 2001 rape , authorities said .
The victim of the attack died in 2004 .
Both Holland brothers are being held in the Santa Clara County Jail .

This week : Cryptozoology / Myths
The Mongolian Death Worm lives in Mongolia , obviously , and is so named because it spits lethal concoctions of poison and / or electricity on whatever it pleases .
The creature 's never been officially documented , but locals have seen it – lots of locals .
It 's even ' real ' enough that the 1922 Prime Minister of Mongolia asked a man to bring one in .
Did the man succeed ?
No , the man did n't succeed .
But that does n't keep others from trying to catch / document one of the worms .
A Mongolian website has this to say about the super - slug :
" The Alghoi Khorkhoi ( literally intestinal worm ) is a mythical animal known by Mongolians since long time but not indexed by science for the reason that no specimen could yet be captured or studied .
It is described like a big worm of approximately 80 cm length living in very remote sand areas of Gobi desert and leaving to the free air only very seldom , in summer .
He is considered as a " terrible " animal able to kill in an unexplained way any man who touch it ( poison , static electricity ? )
" The first report on this animal came from the famous paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews which was asked to capture it by the Prime Minister of Mongolia in 1922 .
The local belief of the existence of Alghoi Khorkhoi is very widespread and could accredit the assumption that an unknown animal , worm or reptile could still remain unknown by science from its great discretion and its desertic and hostile unhabitat . "
According to locals , the Death Worm chiefly burrows through the sand , but comes to the surface after it rains , or when a particular flower ( the Goyo plant ) is in bloom .
One of the locals has had enough experience with the worm to make a wooden carving of it .
It looks to be a much smaller version of the ones Kevin Bacon and the dad from Family Ties had to fight in the movie Tremors .
One local account depicts a man who actually touched the worm .
As the Fortean Times puts it :
" One particularly graphic account was of a man who had mistakenly touched a khorkhoi ; his arm had started to burn , so he had stuck it in a bag of cooling airag , which turned green from the poison . "
Whether the arm burst into flames or if the burning described was more of a chemical nature , it is unknown .
We 're going to assume the flames though , as the worm 's been given electrical powers in some places we 've been reading up on it .
There have been quite a few accounts of the worms though .
The Fortean Times adventurer Adam Davies gives us another account .
This one is from a local man who assisted some geologists on an expedition several years earlier :
" He recalled how one of the geologists had first spotted a khorkhoi and asked him exactly what the creature was .
Both of them had been nervous and left the creature alone .
The following day , the survey team saw two more in the same area – which they had promptly burned …
When I asked the old man why , he turned towards me , stared me straight in the eye , and said : “ Because we were afraid .
I am afraid of this place .
It is a bad place .
Since then , I have only been back there twice in my life .
You will see … ”
There you have it , plenty of accounts from worm - witnesses , but no photographs , no recordings and no hard evidence .
There 've been multiple expeditions which have set out solely for the purpose of finding the worm , but all have failed .
It 's a bit Bigfoot - ish , really .
But that sure does n't mean the worm does n't exist .

# 1 If we do TDD , we do n’t need QA
TDD , also known as Test Driven Design , is more of a design activity and less of a testing activity .
The word test in it can be very confusing for people .
In fact , it is so confusing that some people think , we they do TDD they do n’t need QAs .
Folks like Dan North , identified this as a problem and coined a new term called BDD or Behavior Driven Development .
This makes it clear that the focus is not testing , its expressing behavior .
Another important fact to note is TDD is not just about unit level tests .
People who do Acceptance Test Driven Development or Story Testing , write a failing Acceptance test and then write just enough code to make the test work .
Irrespective of what level you write these “ tests ” [ actually lot of people prefer calling it behavioral specifications or intentions ] , their primary purpose is to drive development , and is not to critique the product .
QA who do exploratory testing and other forms of testing can add a lot of value to the development process .
# 2 Agile is about Rapid Software Development
Agile is not about Rapid Software Development .
# 3 Agile projects do n’t have cost or budget estimated
I wish this was true .
Life would have been peaceful .
Like any other project [ software or not ] , stakeholders want to know either of these
How much would the project cost them ?
[ Cost ]
When will the project be completed ?
[ Time ]
What exactly will be delivered ?
[ Scope ]
In case of Agile we really like to keep these as levers or knobs that can be varied based on the need .
We try and explain to the customer why trying to fix all these upfront , at the point when we have the least amount of info or knowledge is a really bad idea and recipe for failure .
As far a estimation goes , there are different techniques available out there .
Also we do not believe in a silver - bullet .
Depending on your needs you will have to choose a technique .
# 4 Agile projects do n’t plan .
It ’s very chaotic and direction - less .
At the heart of Agile is the embracing change mentality .
We strongly believe in adapting to change over following a plan .
We do see value is plans .
But planning for us is not a one time activity , its a continuous activity .
We do not deliver to a plan , we plan to deliver .
Guess what , no longer we have those big Microsoft project plans or Gantt charts that are followed as Bible .
We plan , we adapt , we refine as we go .
As more information is available uncertainty reduces .
We strongly believe in embrace uncertainty .
If you have not read Mary Poppendieck ’s Lean Development and The Predictability Paradox paper , its a must read .
# 5 Agile projects means No Contracts
The Agile Manifesto says “ Customer collaboration over contract negotiation ” .
Which means , we still need contracts in place , but not at the cost of customer collaboration .
Traditionally contracts have been written purely to project the parties from taking advantage of each other .
But unfortunately , over the last few decades , contracts have been used by companies as a shield .
Each party tries to push as much risk on to the other party in contract .
Which introduces a unique tension when it comes to writing contracts .
Hence contracts have earned a really bad reputation over the last few decades .
IMHO , Contracts are not bad and contracts are supposed to help us to ensure we ’ve come to a shared understanding of the terms upon which two parties will engage .
Although one of the consequences of a contract is the ability to sue , which is known as enforcement , this is not its primary purpose .
The primary purpose of a contract is to clarify the obligations of both parties .
Most people honor their obligations when those obligations are clear .
Having a clear understanding of which party is responsible for what furthers good client relations .
# 6 On Agile projects
We do n’t write documents
Documents are another entity that most people in the software world hate .
There are valid reasons behind this hatred .
I have been in organization where we were document driven .
Document was the only form of communication and document meant everything .
We all know the issue with document .
Agile emphasis on using richer forms of communication and collaboration .
Also I have found a lot of places where people think writing the document finishes their job .
Agile emphasizes on working software over comprehensive documentation .
We tend to focus on lot of short lived documents / artifacts which does one job well .
Also over the last few years , there are quite a few sophisticated tools that let you generate quality document from the code , rather than the other way round .
We believe in executable specification over comprehensive word document .
http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileDocumentation.htm is a good read .
# 7 Agile teams cannot be distributed
Distributed development sucks in general .
But Agile can help .
Lots of organizations are finding it helpful to use Agile on distributed projects .
# 8 Are there minimum processes to be followed to qualify to be Agile team
People usually tend to get into this argument .
Trying to qualify a team as Agile or Waterfall .
Basically this argument is a waste of time .
We do not achieve anything by having this argument .
Agile is certainly not about following a set of practices .
Agile is a culture or value system .
Hence its difficult to define minimum process / practices .
The Agile manifesto can be a good guide if you want to ask this question to yourself .
Also doing one or two practices does not make you Agile .
Evaluating number of practices to Agile maturity levels is the funniest thing you can hear .
# 9 User Stories are same as Use Cases
This is not true .
There are quite a few differences between the two .
Have a look at http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/article_view/27-advantages-of-user-stories-for-requirements
# 10 In Agile , we start coding day one
This is not true .
At least on the projects I have worked , we never starting coding day one .
Again Agile is not about churning out more code .
It ’s about delivering business value .
Agile and XP in particular is accused of “ missing the forest for a tree ” or “ missing the big picture ” .
This is true to some extent , coz when we talk about XP , people talk about starting with iteration zero and then starting actual development .
Sometimes we might need a couple of weeks to understand the existing business processes and understand the overall landscape .
Usually I guest a 2 week period to do this , before the iteration zero .
I certainly do n’t recommend anything in months for this phase .
# 11 My team uses a Agile project management tool , hence we are Agile
Using a tool does not make one Agile .
Sometimes tools can help .
And some times tools really get in the way .
We refer to them as bloatware .
Nor does using JUnit make you do TDD .
Remember : “ People and interaction OVER processes and tools ” .
Ironically , in my experience , Agile teams tend to use better tools than other teams .
Also there is a lot more rigor and discipline when it comes to process on Agile teams .
Video : Woman lights herself on fire as protest
Disturbing video from Rome , Italy shows a woman lighting herself on fire to protest a visit by the president of Senegal .
Reuters reported that the woman " wanted to kill herself at all costs , " according to a police officer who added that the woman " also wanted at one point to throw herself off a ledge . "
Senegalese officials said that the unidentified woman had sought to meet the president , Abdoulaye Wade .
Italian media reports described the woman , who lives in northern Italy , as an activist for Senegalese immigrant rights .
She suffered severe burns but was at last report alive and in critical condition .
Lieberman lobbies for confrontation with Iran
Earlier this week , Joe Lieberman said , “ Although no one desires a conflict with Iran , the fact is that the Iranian government by its actions has declared war on us . ”
Today , he elaborated on this idea in a Wall Street Journal op -ed .
As Lieberman describes it , Iran is not only evil , it ’s busy .
“ Iran ’s actions in Iraq fit a larger pattern of expansionist , extremist behavior across the Middle East today , ” Lieberman argues .
“ In addition to sponsoring insurgents in Iraq , Tehran is training , funding and equipping radical Islamist groups in Lebanon , Palestine and Afghanistan — where the Taliban now appear to be receiving Iranian help in their war against the government of President Hamid Karzai and its NATO defenders . ”
And , of course , Tehran is , according to Lieberman , also responsible for attacks on us .
America now has a solemn responsibility to utilize the instruments of our national power to convince Tehran to change its behavior , including the immediate cessation of its training and equipping extremists who are killing our troops .
Most of this work must be done by our diplomats , military and intelligence operatives in the field .
But Iran ’s increasingly brazen behavior also presents a test of our political leadership here at home .
When Congress reconvenes next week , all of us who are privileged to serve there should set aside whatever partisan or ideological differences divide us to send a clear , strong and unified message to Tehran that it must stop everything it is doing to bring about the death of American service members in Iraq .
It is of course everyone ’s hope that diplomacy alone can achieve this goal .
Iran ’s activities inside Iraq were the central issue raised by the U.S. ambassador to Iraq in his historic meeting with Iranian representatives in Baghdad this May .
However , as Gen. Bergner said on Monday , “ There does not seem to be any follow - through on the commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in addressing the destabilizing security issues here . ”
The fact is , any diplomacy with Iran is more likely to be effective if it is backed by a credible threat of force — credible in the dual sense that we mean it , and the Iranians believe it .
As Ezra put it , “ So when Congress reconvenes next week , all members should set aside party and ideology to tell Iran that , if they do n’t stop doing these things we can’t prove they ’re doing , we will invade them .
Spectacular plan . ” Indeed , I ca n’t wait to hear Lieberman ’s pitch for a ) how the military is prepared for another war in the Middle East ; and b ) how we ’ll assemble some kind of international support given the Bush / Cheney / Lieberman track record thus far .
And speaking of “ thus far , ” Lieberman manages to include his perspective on what a confrontation with Iran will mean for his beloved confrontation with Iraq .
I hope the new revelations about Iran ’s behavior will also temper the enthusiasm of some of those in Congress who are advocating the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq .
Iran ’s purpose in sponsoring attacks on American soldiers , after all , is clear :
It hopes to push the U.S. out of Iraq and Afghanistan , so that its proxies can then dominate these states .
Tehran knows that an American retreat under fire would send an unmistakable message throughout the region that Iran is on the rise and America is on the run .
That would be a disaster for the region and the U.S .
So , as Lieberman sees it , the United States needs to remain in Iraq indefinitely , no matter the cost , in order to deny Iran opportunities , which they would n’t have if we ’d only force a military confrontation and get it over with .
As Matt Yglesias concluded , “ I like that he ’s managing to compress what should be a years - long transition from moderate Democrat to psychotic rightwinger into just a few months . ”
100,000 Calls Across Nebraska
Help us call voters during this week of action .
to help Dems win !
An analysis of satellite imagery of the Gulf Coast shows that Hurricane Katrina destroyed an estimated 320 million trees in Mississippi and Louisiana , an unprecedented loss of forestland that will reshape the region for generations , Louisiana researchers reported today .
The death of the trees from wind damage and soaking in saltwater will ultimately release about 367 million tons of carbon dioxide as they decompose -- about the same amount that is absorbed by all U.S. forests in a year , according to the study published in the journal Science .
Considered on the vast scale of global climate change , Katrina ’s impact is small .
But as a one - time event , its infusion of carbon is significant , exceeding an entire season ’s worth of emissions from U.S. forest fires .
“ This is a one - shot massive hit to these systems , where you see this enormous impact , ” said Jason Neff , an assistant professor of geoscience at the University of Colorado at Boulder , who was not involved in the study .
Most of the lost trees in the Gulf region stood 70 to 100 feet tall , and others will not grow back for decades , if ever , experts said .
Hurricane Katrina , which made landfall in August 2005 with winds that reached 125 mph , damaged 5 million acres of forests , 80 % of them in Mississippi , according to the U.S. Forest Service .
By comparison , the 1980 eruption in Washington of Mt. St. Helens wiped out 150,000 acres of forest .
“ In some areas of southeast Louisiana and southeast Mississippi , it was 100 % damage , ” said Wayne Hagan , founder of Timberland Management Services of Louisiana in Clinton .
“ I had one landowner on 2,000 acres who had basically $ 4 million worth of trees on his place .
One hundred percent of the trees were blown over and broken down .
That ’s basically what the hurricane did . ”
Biologist Jeffrey Q. Chambers of Tulane University and his colleagues said the deforested land , once covered with native species such as longleaf pine , oak and cypress , is being taken over by invasive species that are changing the ecology of the area .
One of the most prolific , the Chinese tallow , oozes a milky , toxic sap that creates an inhospitable environment for insects , birds and small animals .
The trees that are growing back represent only a fraction of those destroyed , and they are surrounded by large quantities of decomposing lumber .
Combined with the drought now punishing the South , that is the recipe for a devastating forest fire , said James L. Cummins , executive director of the Mississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation .
“ If we have significant fires , all of those young trees are going to be toast , ” he said .
Chambers and his colleagues at Tulane and the University of New Hampshire estimated the damage using images from NASA ’s Landsat 5 satellite taken in May 2003 and June 2006 .
The images from the satellite ’s spectrometers enabled them to distinguish live trees from dead ones and from other vegetation .
Those data were verified by analyzing selected tracts on the ground , Chambers said by phone from Brazil , where he is studying the Amazon forest .
“ I was amazed , ” he said .
“ I did n’t expect that much damage . ”
The extent of losses was highly dependent on the type of tree in the hurricane ’s path .
Only about 10 % of stands of loblolly pine , favored by commercial timber growers , survived the assault .
In contrast , more than 90 % of native longleaf pine stands escaped damage .
But the acreage of longleaf pine is only about 2 % of what it was a century ago , Cummins said .
The only timber stands that survived were ones planted in the last 20 years , Hagan said .
Those trees were planted close together , so they were able to support each other through the high winds .
“ One tree leans on another , ” he said .
Experts said they expected that most of the lost forestland would never be replanted .
Most of the people who lost trees in the hurricane were tree farmers , and replacing the felled trees in the months after the storm was not a high priority .
Farming trees “ is hardly ever the only thing a private landowner does , ” said Amanda Box , a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Forestry Assn. in Jackson , Miss .
“ I may also have cattle , and I may be a schoolteacher . ”
The federal government earmarked $ 504 million for tree replacement , but the program typically provides only half the cost of replanting , along with a small stipend -- as low as a net of $ 100 per acre in some areas -- to keep the trees growing for a decade .
Owners struggling to rebuild their homes and businesses in the wake of Katrina were n’t able to make up the difference , Hagan said , and many sold their land to people who used it for residential construction .
Only about $ 70 million in government funds has been disbursed , and no more than 100,000 acres have been replanted , Cummins said .
Forestry advocates are pressing landowners to tap into those funds .
More forest recovery money will become available in the spring , Box said .
“ It ’s a major push here , and it ’s still ongoing , ” she said .
But it is probably too late to make a difference , Hagan said .
“ If you do n’t plant it the first year , then the vegetation grows up and it costs you about four times as much to plant , ” he said .
“ When you miss the boat the first time , it does n’t get planted . ”

Times staff writer Alan Zarembo contributed to this report .
A hard fought battle is raging in the District of Columbia U.S. District Court over the legal status of Taiwan between residents of the Pacific island and the Justice Department .
Roger Lin , the Taiwan Nation Party , and others are plaintiffs in a lawsuit , Lin , et. al. vs United States of America , 06 - 1825 , seeking a judicial declaration that the residents of Taiwan are U. S. " nationals " like the residents of American Samoa .
The Justice Department has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit , filed in October 2006 , as a political issue beyond the scope of the judiciary .
Meanwhile , the Taiwan plaintiffs are pressing for discovery to make their case .
Already the plaintiffs have assembled an impressive legal history of the island that does much to explain the murky status as a non-nation .
Twenty - four countries recognize the independence of Taiwan ; however , the United States does not .
Caught up in the cold war and post - World War II tension between communist China and the Republic of China , the U.S. allowed refugees to settle and govern themselves on Taiwan , formerly known as Formosa , as a government - in - exile .
Japan had long controlled Formosa and surrounding smaller islands since the Sino - Japanese War in 1895 but lost the island group to the United States when it was defeated in World War II .
Although the United States was the occupying military power under international law , the Chinese Nationalists were permitted to act as U.S. agents in the actual surrender of Japanese soldiers in 1945 .
On June 27 , 1950 , with the outbreak of the Korean War , President Truman reiterated U.S. military responsibility over Formosa while the Nationalist Chinese government - in - exile continued the claim it was the legal government of mainland China .
Truman called Taiwan 's legal status " undetermined . "
On April 28 , 1952 , Japan formally ceded Formosa and surrounding islands to the United States in the Treaty of San Francisco .
The U.S. has never ceded its possession to any other nation and has not relinquished its ownership to the current Taiwanese government creating the current unsettled legal status of the island group .
On August 5 , 1952 , Japan formally entered into a peace treaty with the Republic of China with the Treaty of Taipei but did not cede the island to the Taiwanese government .
In December 1954 , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles testified before the Senate that , " technical sovereignty over Formosa and the Pescadores has never been settled . "
On February 8 , 1955 , with adoption of a mutual defense treaty with the Republic of China the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations issued a statement that the mutual defense treaty for Taiwan did not alter the pre-existing status .
" It is the understanding of the Senate that nothing in the treaty shall be construed as affecting or modifying the legal status or sovereignty of the territories to which it applies . "
The closest the status of Taiwan has ever come to the full attention of the American public was during the 1960 presidential debate between Kennedy and Nixon when they squabbled over the islands of Qumoy and Matsu , then in the news because of Chinese military maneuvers .
Because of the cold war , the United Nations continued to recognize the Republic of China as the legitimate government of mainland China .
After that recognition was dropped in October 1971 , the U.N. declined to recognize the Republic of China as the government of Taiwan and the delegation was expelled .
The United Nations has since refused to recognize Taiwan as an independent nation fourteen times .
In January 1979 , the Taiwan Relations
Act was made law by Congress to protect and promote commercial ties with " the people of Taiwan " but did not recognize the government of Taiwan as an independent nation .
In July 1982 , the United States gave " Six Assurances " to the Taiwanese government that it would not alter its position on the sovereignty of Taiwan and China .
On October 25 , 2004 , Secretary of State Colin Powell stated , " Taiwan is not independent .
It does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation , and that remains our policy , our firm policy . "
Lin and his co-plaintiffs are now arguing that they deserve to enjoy the protections of the Constitution as do other " nationals " in U.S. oversees territories .
The Justice Department has responded , " For plaintiffs to prevail in this action this Court would have to declare the United States sovereign over Taiwan . "

Alarmed by the political crisis in Pakistan , U.S. spy agencies have stepped up their scrutiny of the country ’s nuclear weapons program and directed analysts to reexamine the risk that rising instability could lead to the loss of a nuclear device or material , U.S. intelligence officials said .
The officials emphasized that there was no new intelligence to suggest that Pakistan ’s tight controls on its nuclear facilities are in any danger of being compromised .
Officials said the effort underway at the CIA and other agencies focuses on identifying scenarios in which further deterioration of the political situation could weaken the Pakistani government ’s ability to keep track of its weapons , components or even scientists .
“ That was one of the things people immediately started asking about ” when Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared emergency rule in his country Saturday and suspended the constitution , a senior U.S. intelligence official said .
“ How do we game this out ?
How might it happen ? ”
Advertisement
The official spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing internal deliberations .
The scenarios being considered include an attempt by Al Qaeda or another terrorist network to launch an attack on a nuclear site , or a move by a faction of the powerful Pakistani military to gain power by aligning with Islamic militant groups .
Officials said they considered both to be remote possibilities .
More realistic scenarios , experts said , involve the risk that rogue scientists or security officials working in Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons program could seek to take advantage of the turmoil to sell technology , supplies or secrets .
“ That is my fundamental worry , ” said David Albright , president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington .
“ If there is [ further ] instability , Musharraf is going to have less ability to exercise tight control .
Pakistan tends to leak .
It has leaked vital nuclear weapons information .
It ’s the nature of the system . ”

Albright was referring to the illicit network of Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani nuclear scientist who has been held under house arrest in Islamabad , the Pakistani capital , since Western intelligence agencies unraveled a vast network he operated that sold nuclear secrets and technology to other countries .
Intelligence officials have testified that though Al Qaeda leaders have repeatedly expressed interest in obtaining nuclear capabilities , there is no indication the terrorism network has succeeded .
If Al Qaeda were able to obtain enough fissile material , experts said , it would require only a limited amount of expertise to assemble a powerful bomb .
Pakistan is the only nuclear - armed Muslim nation , and it is fiercely protective of information about its capabilities and the locations of its weapons and facilities .
Most experts believe that Pakistan has produced enough highly enriched uranium for about 50 nuclear weapons or warheads , and that the devices are distributed among half a dozen or more locations .
Pakistan also operates a constellation of weapons production facilities where hundreds of kilograms of fissile material are stored .
Advertisement
Experts said security around these sites is extremely tight and multilayered .
Pakistan does not use the electronic systems that require the input of access codes to arm warheads , but its weapons are stored disassembled , with key components kept in separate , secure vaults .
Musharraf has improved the security system , centralizing control in a single government agency and putting a special branch of the military known as the Strategic Plans Division in charge of operations and security .
The senior officers in that division are vetted to eliminate candidates with sympathies for Islamic militants , officials said .
The division is led by Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai , an officer with close ties to U.S. military officials .
“ If we started to see things deteriorate , there would be an urgent and immediate effort to reach out to him , ” said Daniel Markey , a former State Department official who focused on U.S. policy in South Asia .
Speaking of the Strategic Plans Division , Markey said , “ If there ’s a safe box within Pakistan ’s army , this is it . ”
Advertisement
Musharraf ’s commitment to securing Pakistan ’s weapons has contributed to anxiety over what might happen if he were to lose power .
Such concerns may help account for U.S. reluctance to impose sanctions or even issue more forceful rebukes to Musharraf for his decision to suspend the constitution .
Because the military is widely considered the most professional institution in the country , U.S. officials and experts said they regard the possibility of a failure of military control over the weapons as highly unlikely .
“ You ’d have to imagine competing forces within the officer corps at the highest levels , ” Markey said , “ and one of those sides deciding they want to align themselves with the more extreme side of the Pakistani political spectrum . ”
Due to the military ’s capabilities , most experts also discount the possibility of an attack on a Pakistani nuclear facility by Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups .
As a result , the most worrisome scenarios center on insiders in the Pakistani nuclear program , officials and experts said .
Advertisement
In 2001 , just weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks , two Pakistani nuclear experts met with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to discuss how Al Qaeda should go about building a nuclear device .
That meeting , and subsequent efforts by the CIA to track Al Qaeda ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons , was described by former CIA Director George J. Tenet in a book published last spring .
The experts , Sultan Bashirrudin Mahmood and Chaudhry Abdul Majeed , are believed to be under house arrest in Pakistan , officials said .
But intelligence experts worry that the political instability in Pakistan could weaken the country ’s ability or effort to keep track of scientists and experts who might be inclined to share nuclear secrets out of ideological affinity with extremist groups or simply for profit .
“ The control system is only as good as its weakest link , ” Albright said .
“ With tight controls and a strong leader you are OK .
But if it becomes less stable , you could have fewer constraints and someone may grab an opportunity to steal something and sell it . ”

Online storage start - ups are a dime a dozen .
And yet , entrepreneurs do n’t give up on this highly commoditized sector .
Dominik Grolimund is one of them .
He has started Wua.la , a Zurich - based company that is using principles of peer - to - peer networking and applying them to storage .
The five - person company has been funded so far by Grolimund ’s other start - up , a German - language CRM suite for small businesses .
Wua.la is offering a free online storage and sharing service that combines the best of Pando and Grouper .
It is elegant , clever , and easy to use , and its sharing features alone are worthy of giving it a whirl .
[ digg=http://digg.com/software/Wuala_Combining_the_Best_of_P2P_Storage_Sharing]
Here is how it works :
You download the Wua.la client ( works on Windows , Mac & Linux ) , and install it .
Once you open the client after installation , you are logged into the Wua.la network .
You get one gigabyte of storage capacity on their servers to get you going .
You can drag and drop files – images , videos , music , document – onto the client .
You can tag your files just like you would on Flickr or YouTube .
You can search through files like you would normally search on a web - based service .
You can even comment on the photos or videos .
All the metadata is stored locally on your drive .
The storage space is divided into folders that are color coded to indicate the level of privacy .
You can share the folders with one person or almost anyone , by making them public .
If you need more storage , you have to contribute to the entire P2P cloud .
And this is where I think it gets interesting : you can only join the cloud if you are online for at least five hours a day , and have a solid broadband connection .
The system gives you an incentive to stay online .
Say if you kick in 10 GB of local storage to the “ cloud ” and are online 70 percent of the day , then the system gives you an additional 7 GB of online storage .
The incentive for providing upload bandwidth is similar – the more upload bandwidth you provide , the faster your download speed will be .
They also have super nodes , a.k.a. servers , that ensure that your files are available all the time .
( How it works . )
Wua.la , in other words , is trying to avoid the problems associated with BitTorrent , where upstream connections become a problem .
Wua.la will make money by embedding small relevant ads or referral links in the client in order to make money .
I am not sure if this is going to pay the bills , and they ’d be better off offering premium storage options .
It also remains to be seen if the service can scale – it has a less than 1000 alpha users for now .
Nevertheless , it is an attractive option for those who crave privacy and do n’t want to share personal videos and photos over the web .
If you would like to try the service , visit http://gigaom.wua.la.
The first 100 visitors can use invite code gigaom , and download the client .
Let us know what you think of the service .
If you have feedback on the technology particularly , I would love to hear it .

EXCEPTION HANDLING :
A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY by Tom Cargill
This article first appeared in C++ Report , Volume 6 , Number 9 , November - December 1994 .
This " " extraordinary care " " demanded by exceptions originates in the subtle interactions among language features that can arise in exception handling .
Counter - intuitively , the hard part of coding exceptions is not the explicit throws and catches .
The really hard part of using exceptions is to write all the intervening code in such a way that an arbitrary exception can propagate from its throw site to its handler , arriving safely and without damaging other parts of the program along the way .
In the October 1993 issue of the C++ Report , David Reed argues in favor of exceptions that : " " Robust reusable types require a robust error handling mechanism that can be used in a consistent way across different reusable class libraries . " "
While entirely in favor of robust error handling , I have serious doubts that exceptions will engender software that is any more robust than that achieved by other means .
I am concerned that exceptions will lull programmers into a false sense of security , believing that their code is handling errors when in reality the exceptions are actually compounding errors and hindering the software .
To illustrate my concerns concretely I will examine the code that appeared in Reed 's article .
The code ( page 42 , October 1993 ) is a Stack class template .
To reduce the size of Reed 's code for presentation purposes , I have made two changes .
First , instead of throwing Exception objects , my version simply throws literal character strings .
The detailed encoding of the exception object is irrelevant for my purposes , because we will see no extraction of information from an exception object .
Second , to avoid having to break long lines of source text , I have abbreviated the identifier current_index to top .
Reed 's code follows .
Spend a few minutes studying it before reading on .
Pay particular attention to its exception handling .
[ Hint : Look for any of the classic problems associated with delete , such as too few delete operations , too man4ddelete operations or access to memory after its delete . ]
template class Stack { unsigned nelems ; int top ; T* v ; public : unsigned count ( ) ; void push ( T ) ; T pop ( ) ; Stack ( ) ; ~ Stack ( ) ; Stack ( const Stack& ) ; Stack& operator= ( const Stack& ) ; } ; template Stack :: Stack ( ) { top = - 1 ; v = new T[ nelems=10 ] ; if ( v == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; } template Stack :: Stack ( const Stack & s ) { v = new T[ nelems = s.nelems ] ; if ( v == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; if ( s.top > - 1 ) { for ( top = 0 ; top <= s.top ; top ++ ) v[top ] = s.v[ top ] ; top--; } } template Stack ::~Stack ( ) { delete [ ] v ; } template void Stack :: push ( T element ) { top ++ ; if ( top == nelems - 1 ) { T* new_buffer = new T[ nelems +=10 ] ; if ( new_buffer == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < top ; i++) new_buffer [i ] = v[i ] ; delete [ ] v ; v = new_buffer ; } v[top ] = element ; } template T Stack :: pop ( ) { if ( top < 0 ) throw " " pop on empty stack " " ; return v[top -- ] ; } template unsigned Stack :: count ( ) { return top+1 ; } template Stack & Stack ::operator= ( const Stack & s ) { delete [ ] v ; v = new T[ nelems=s.nelems ] ; if ( v == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; if ( s.top > - 1 ) { for ( top = 0 ; top <= s.top ; top ++ ) v[top ] = s.v[ top ] ; top --; } return * this ; }
My examination of the code is in three phases .
First , I study the code 's behavior along its " " normal , " " exception - free execution paths , those in which no exceptions are thrown .
Second , I study the consequences of exceptions thrown explicitly by the member functions of Stack .
Third , I study the consequences of exceptions thrown by the T objects that are manipulated by Stack .
Of these three phases , it is unquestionably the third that involves the most demanding analysis .
Normal Execution Paths
Stack y; Stack x = y ; assert ( y.count ( ) == 0 ) ; printf ( " " %u
" " , x.count ( ) ) ; 17736
The object x should be made empty , since it is copied from an empty master .
However , x is not empty according to x.count ( ) ; the value 17736 appears because x.top is not set by the copy constructor when copying an empty object .
The test that suppresses the copy loop for an empty object also suppresses the setting of top .
The value that top assumes is determined by the contents of its memory as left by the last occupant .
Now consider a similar situation with respect to assignment :
Stack a , b ; a.push ( 0 ) ; a = b ; printf ( " " %u
" " , a.count ( ) ) ; 1
Again , the object a should be empty .
Again , it is n't .
The boundary condition fault seen in the copy constructor also appears in operator= , so the value of a.top is not set to the value of b.top .
There is a second bug in operator= .
It does nothing to protect itself against self - assignment , that is , where the left - hand and right - hand sides of the assignment are the same object .
Such an assignment would cause operator= to attempt to access deleted memory , with undefined results .
Exceptions Thrown by Stack
Stack
new
pop
Stack
new
new
new
The throw expressions in the default constructor and copy constructor of Stack are benign , by and large .
When either of these constructors throws an exception , no Stack object remains and there is little left to say .
( The little that does remain is sufficiently subtle that I will defer it to a later column as well . )
The throw from push is more interesting .
Clearly , a Stack object that throws from a push operation has rejected the pushed value .
However , when rejecting the operation , in what state should push leave its object ?
On push failure , this stack class takes its object into an inconsistent state , because the increment of top precedes a check to see that any necessary growth can be accomplished .
The stack object is in an inconsistent state because the value of top indicates the presence of an element for which there is no corresponding entry in the allocated array .
Of course , the stack class might be documented to indicate that a throw from its push leaves the object in a state in which further member functions ( count , push and pop ) can no longer be used .
However , it is simpler to correct the code .
The push member function could be modified so that if an exception is thrown , the object is left in the state that it occupied before the push was attempted .
Exceptions do not provide a rationale for an object to enter an inconsistent state , thus requiring clients to know which member functions may be called .
A similar problem arises in operator= , which disposes of the original array before successfully allocating a new one .
If x and y are Stack objects and x = y throws the out - of - memory exception from x.operator= , the state of x is inconsistent .
The value returned by a.count ( ) does not reflect the number of elements that can be popped off the stack because the array of stacked elements no longer exists .
Exceptions Thrown by T
Stack
T
T
int
double
T
T
T
Stack
Stack >
T
Stack
The behavior of Stack should be " " exception neutral " " with respect to T .
The Stack class must let exceptions propagate correctly through its member functions without causing a failure of Stack .
This is much easier said than done .
Consider an exception thrown by the assignment operation in the for loop of the copy constructor :
template Stack :: Stack ( const Stack & s ) { v = new T[ nelems = s.nelems ] ; // leak if ( v == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; if ( s.top > - 1 ) { for ( top = 0 ; top <= s.top ; top ++ ) v[top ] = s.v[ top ] ; // throw top--; } }
Since the copy constructor does not catch it , the exception propagates to the context in which the Stack object is being created .
Because the exception came from a constructor , the creating context assumes that no object has been constructed .
The destructor for Stack does not execute .
Therefore , no attempt is made to delete the array of T objects allocated by the copy constructor .
This array has leaked .
The memory can never be recovered .
Perhaps some programs can tolerate limited memory leaks .
Many others cannot .
A long - lived system , one that catches and successfully recovers from this exception , may eventually be throttled by the memory leaked in the copy constructor .
A second memory leak can be found in push .
An exception thrown from the assignment of T in the for loop in push propagates out of the function , thereby leaking the newly allocated array , to which only new_buffer .
points :
template void Stack :: push ( T element ) { top ++ ; if ( top == nelems - 1 ) { T* new_buffer = new T[ nelems +=10 ] ; // leak if ( new_buffer == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < top ; i++) new_buffer [i ] = v[i ] ; // throw delete [ ] v ; v = new_buffer ; } v[top ] = element ; }
The next operation on T we examine is the copy construction of the T object returned from pop :
template T Stack :: pop ( ) { if ( top < 0 ) throw " " pop on empty stack " " ; return v[top --] ; // throw }
What happens if the copy construction of this object throws an exception ?
The pop operation fails because the object at the top of the stack cannot be copied ( not because the stack is empty ) .
Clearly , the caller does not receive a T object .
But what should happen to the state of the stack object on which a pop operation fails in this way ?
A simple policy would be that if an operation on a stack throws an exception , the state of the stack is unchanged .
A caller that removes the exception 's cause can then repeat the pop operation , perhaps successfully .
However , pop does change the state of the stack when the copy construction of its result fails .
The post - decrement of top appears in an argument expression to the copy constructor for T .
Argument expressions are fully evaluated before their function is called .
So top is decremented before the copy construction .
It is therefore impossible for a caller to recover from this exception and repeat the pop operation to retrieve that element off the stack .
Finally , consider an exception thrown by the default constructor for T during the creation of the dynamic array of T in operator= :
template Stack & Stack ::operator= ( const Stack & s ) { delete [ ] v ; // v undefined v = new T[ nelems=s.nelems ] ; // throw if ( v == 0 ) throw " " out of memory " " ; if ( s.top > - 1 ) { for ( top = 0 ; top <= s.top ; top ++ ) v[top ] = s.v[ top ] ; top --; } return * this ; }
The delete expression in operator= deletes the old array for the object on the left - hand side of the assignment .
The delete operator leaves the value of v undefined .
Mostimplementations leave v dangling unchanged , still pointing to the old array that has been returned to the heap .
Suppose the exception from T :: T( ) is thrown from within this assignment :
{ Stack x , y ; y = x ; // throw } // double delete
As the exception propagates out of y.operator= , y.v is left pointing to the deallocated array .
When the destructor for y executes at the end of the block , y.v still points to the deallocated array .
The delete in the Stack destructor therefore has undefined results - it is illegal to delete the array twice .

WHAT Goodman discovered is what most men have forgotten : that if they know how to throw now , it is because they spent time learning at some point long ago .
( Goodman says that he can remember learning to ride a bicycle but not learning to throw with his right hand . )
This brings us back to the roots of the " throwing like a girl " phenomenon .
The crucial factor is not that males and females are put together differently but that they typically spend their early years in different ways .
Little boys often learn to throw without noticing that they are throwing .
Little girls are more rarely in environments that encourage them in the same way .
A boy who wonders why a girl throws the way she does is like a Frenchman who wonders why so many Americans speak French " with an accent . "
" For young boys it is culturally acceptable and politically correct to develop these skills , " says Linda Wells , of the Arizona State softball team .
" They are mentored and networked .
Usually girls are not coached at all , or are coached by Mom — or if it 's by Dad , he may not be much of an athlete .
Girls are often stuck with the bottom of the male talent pool as examples .
I would argue that rather than learning to ' throw like a girl , ' they learn to throw like poor male athletes .
I say that a bad throw is ' throwing like an old man . '
This is not gender , it 's acculturation . "
Almost any motor skill , from doing handstands to dribbling a basketball , is easier to learn if you start young , which is why John Goodman did not realize that learning to throw is difficult until he attempted it as an adult .
Many girls reach adulthood having missed the chance to learn to throw when that would have been easiest to do .
And as adults they have neither John Goodman 's incentive to teach their muscles a new set of skills nor his confidence that the feat is possible .
Five years ago Joseph Russo , long a baseball coach at St. John 's University , gave athletic - talent tests to actresses who were trying out for roles in A League of Their Own , a movie about women 's baseball .
Most of them were " well coordinated in general , like for dancing , " he says .
But those who had not happened to play baseball or softball when they were young had a problem : " It sounds silly to say it , but they kept throwing like girls . "
( The best ball - field talents , by the way , were Madonna , Demi Moore , and the rock singer Joan Jett , who according to Russo " can really hit it hard . "
Careful viewers of A League of Their Own will note that only in a fleeting instant in one scene is the star , Geena Davis , shown actually throwing a ball . )
I 'm not sure that I buy Linda Wells 's theory that most boys are " mentored " or " networked " into developing ball skills .
Those who make the baseball team , maybe .
But for a far larger number the decisive ingredient seems to be the hundreds of idle hours spent throwing balls , sticks , rocks , and so on in the playground or the back yard .
Children on the playground , I think , demonstrate the moment when the kinetic chain begins to work .
It is when a little boy tries to throw a rock farther than his friend can , or to throw a stick over a telephone wire thirty feet up .
A toddler 's first , instinctive throw is a push from the shoulder , showing the essential traits of " throwing like a girl . "
But when a child is really trying to put some oomph into the throw , his natural instinct is to wind up his body and let fly with the links of the chain .
Little girls who do the same thing — compete with each other in distance throwing — learn the same way ; but whereas many boys do this , few girls do .
Tammy Richards , a woman who was raised on a farm in central California , says that she learned to throw by trying to heave dried cow chips farther than her brother could .
It may have helped that her father , Bob Richards , was a former Olympic competitor in the decathlon ( and two - time Olympic champion in the pole vault ) , and that he taught all his sons and daughters to throw not only the ball but also the discus , the shotput , and the javelin .
In the last 48 hours , N.Y .
Times best selling novelist , Steve Alten , author of , " The Shell Game , " was recently shocked and dumbfounded that he ’d become the victim of harassment , when someone not only put a map of his home and his personal private phone number and home address up on the internet , . . . but also either remotely accessed or intercepted personal private email between he and his publicist . . .
. . . and all because of the impending release of his new novel , " The Shell Game . "
http://theshellgame.net/
( See 9/11 truth links in the “ 911 Links ” section of his site , to learn why this impending block buster novel may be causing such actions ) .
Having been a patriotic citizen working to expose the deceptions leading us to war , I ’d personally become fascinated with Alten ’s new novel , “ The Shell Game . ”
I ’d contacted him through his website after a high school English teacher told me about “ The Shell Game , ” because it dealt with oil , war , and deceptions leading us to war .
So , when I learned this novelist had become increasingly a victim of bizarre harassment , I suspected “ why ” this may have happened , and then decided it might be instructive to explain it to others .
So I wrote this oped this morning .
For this , in my opinion , represents yet another event in the chronology of a movement for truth that has been attacked and maligned for years now .
For the novelist who wrote , “ The Shell Game , ” it ’s just a bizarre experience , for he ’s just trying to write a good novel , and from his perspective , well if it happens to spur discussion of important issues , well that ’s about as American as apple pie .
I think most people will think , if this novel has caused him to be targeted for such harassment , even before its release . . . well , it must have something “ very interesting ” to say .
And in my opinion it does .
http://theshellgame.net/
However , the bizarre harassment of this best selling author , from my perspective , is part of a long time pattern of harassment that those of us who ’ve been working along side the 9/11 families who have demanded a new independent 9/11 investigation , have experienced over and over again .
Even the Jersey Girls , the 9/11 widows who fought Washington to get the 9/11 Commission , were victims of it when Anne Coulter said they enjoyed their husband 's deaths .
So who does this story involve ?
The title of this OpEd , “ What Do a Renowned 9/11 Physicist and a N.Y. Times Best Selling Novelist Have in Common ? ” actually would be more appropriately titled , what do a former Los Angeles Police Department detective , a N.Y .
Times best selling novelist , a mild mannered respected physicist , an equally mild mannered and equally respected architectural design engineer , and concerned citizens demanding a new 9/11 investigation , all have in common ?
This is the story of the 9/11 truth movement , and perhaps the story of how all great movements for truth and justice are deliberately sabotaged by those powers who have an interest in keeping truth from the mass public .
Let ’s begin with the LAPD detective ’s story , who ’d become a research writer after leaving LAPD .
Not long after 9/11/2001 , researcher Michael C. Ruppert , a former LAPD detective , smelled something not quite right about the events of 9/11 .
His nose eventually led him to call on sources he ’d developed over the years as a researcher and author , with military and intelligence insiders , and discovered that mysteriously there had been many multiple war games . . . war games which do not happen that often . . . but coincidentally all were ordered by " someone " to be held on 9/11/2001 .
Yes , the same day as the infamous 9/11 attacks .
I personally became aware of Ruppert ’s work when he did what the US media failed to do , he followed up on mainstream media ’s initial insight that there had been mysterious “ insider stock trades ” in the days leading up to 9/11 that signaled that someone with “ insider knowledge ” of the coming attacks had profited obscenely by betting “ against ” United and American Airlines “ before ” 9/11 , by placing put options ( bets that a stock will fall ) on those ill fated airlines in trades that vastly eclipsed activity on other airlines in those days .
Ruppert ’s research found that $ 5 million in “ winnings ” were made at a known CIA - connected financial institution called AB Brown Trust .
AB Brown had been headed by the man who was the current Executive Director of the CIA , Buzzy Krongard , on 9/11 .
The current head of AB Brown , a friend of Krongard 's , mysteriously resigned with no explanation immediately after the attacks on 9/11 , and oddly $ 2.5 million of the winnings made against United and American Airlines by bets made the day before 9/11 . . . were never claimed .
As far as I know the man was never questioned about that , and the 9/11 Commission , led by Bush Admin .
confidant Phil Zelikow , refused to look into the insider trades with any enthusiasm .
However , it was Mike Ruppert ’s research into the mysteriously timed multiple war games of 9/11 that eventually evolved into his riveting research book entitled , Crossing the Rubicon .
His book asks why were war games which had the effect of causing a US Air Force stand down all scheduled for 9/11/2001 ?
Who ordered them ?
Was it Vice President Cheney , who appeared to have been in charge of a stand down order for our Air Force which allowed an aircraft to hit the Pentagon on 9/11 , when there was still time to take it down and save many lives ?
Transportation Secretary Norm Minetta ’s testimony to the 9/11 Commission , for any investigator worth his / her salt , would have called for detailed questioning of Cheney , which never happened .
Even more oddly the Transportation Secretary ’s testimony was left out of the 9/11 Commission report .
Left out by a Commission headed by Philip Zelikow a Bush Administration confidant , and co-author of a book with Condaleeza Rice , before his being forced down the throats of 9/11 family members who avidly protested a Bush Admin insider like Zelikow heading the Commission .

Believe us when we tell you that we 've seen Legos used in ways its creators could have never , ever imagined .
Thankfully , a team from the University of Illinois found a way to demonstrate a rather useful ( read : not bizarre ) technology with everyone 's favorite building block .
By setting up shop at the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers in Minnesota , students were able to show off an autonomous crop harvesting system that transferred heaps of BBs onto unloaders , which then hurried them away to meet artificial deadlines .
The setup was configured using Robolab software , and aside from requiring the creators to dump BBs into the harvester , the entire show was put on sans human interaction .
Granted , the idea behind all of this is far from fresh , but there 's just something strangely satisfying about putting a stash of spare Legos to work for you .
Is work slowly suffocating you ?
To - do lists , projects and random chores all piling up until they surround you ?
When this happens , your best strategy is to get ahead .
Get on top of all your work and go beyond completing today ’s tasks , complete more than you need to so you can have room to breathe .
How do you do this ?
When I face this problem , my answer is to take on what I like to call a Project - Kill Day .
This is a day where I am at my most productive state .
I set aside large amounts of time to kill off the projects on my to - do list and get ahead .
I ’ve found , if you plan it properly , you can make tomorrow up to 3 times as productive as ordinary days .
How to Set Up Your Own Project - Kill Day
I ’ve done hundreds of these Project - Kill days , so if you ’re looking to start your own here ’s how :
Wake Up Early –
If you are n’t normally an early riser , set your alarm clock early .
Getting up at 5:00 - 6:00 does two things .
First , it gives you quiet hours before you need to go to classes , job or your family wakes up .
Second , it builds a feeling of accomplishment that can motivate you forward throughout the day .
Morning Exercise –
This is n’t strictly necessary , but I find starting my early day with a run or even some push - ups in my room is another great way to build momentum .
Exercising for twenty or thirty minutes knocks the half - asleep feeling out of your body and gives you an early sense of accomplishment .
Create a Fixed To - Do List – Before you start the day , write down all the things you need to accomplish .
Once you complete that list , you ’re finished the day and can do whatever you want .
Having a fixed goal for work can focus your energies better than the “ work all day ” approach , which leads to procrastination .
Isolate Yourself – Most of my work is solitary .
This means that when I have a Project - Kill day , I have almost zero social contact .
It ’s fine to become a hermit for one day if it means you can focus without distractions .
Lock the door to your room or office and work until your list is finished .
Cut the Cables – Television , web , Facebook , phones and instant messengers all go offline during your day .
If you need the internet at all ( answering e-mails as part of your list ) stay tightly focused on your tasks , but go no further .
If you ’re addicted to clicking the Stumble button , unplug the internet if you have to .
Big Rocks First – Leo of ZenHabits has an excellent strategy for organizing your work .
Put the big rocks in first .
That means take the most important tasks you need to accomplish and put them at the start of your day , not the end .
This way the majority of your focus gets aimed at the most important tasks .
There are exceptions to this organization strategy , but as a general guideline it is good to follow .
No Mid-Task Breaks – Breaks of any kind should be minimized during your day .
But especially mid-task breaks .
The only valid time to get up and take a breather should be if you ’ve just taken down a chunk of your list .
If you ’re halfway through an essay , finish it before you decide to eat lunch .
Break Minimally – Not having long coffee breaks for one day wo n’t kill you .
My guideline is that 5 minute breaks are okay between big tasks .
Taking short 20 - 30 minute lunch , breakfast and possibly dinner breaks are also okay .
The idea is that until your list is finished , sitting around for an hour defeats the purpose of your Project - Kill Day .
Batch Small Tasks Together – Group up all of your small tasks ( taking out the garbage , fixing a door hinge , organizing binders , etc. ) and do them all at once .
This can help speed things along since there will be fewer interruptions in your regular workflow .
Walk Quickly –
There needs to be a sense of focus and urgency in everything you do during your day .
Walking at a brisk pace reminds me that if I need to get things between tasks , that I still have a vital mission to complete : destroying my to - do list .
If you need to commute or drive , put in audio tapes to infuse your passive time with the concept that you leave no time wasted .
Build Up Speed –
Take on tasks all at once and build up speed to them .
I ’ve written thirty page e-books in one sitting and often write a few thousand words in a row .
It can be difficult to avoid the temptation to take occasional breaks , but once you get into a flow , do anything to preserve it .
Do Something Important , Not Just Urgent –
It ’s been said before but it needs to be said again .
A Project - Kill Day is precisely the time you need to work on important , long - term tasks .
That means investing time beyond just solving current problems .
I recommend taking on one long - term project that might not have an immediate deadline to move forward in during your day .
Take the Following Day Off – After a successful day of killing your to - do list , take the next day off .
This helps you recover your energies after a tiring day of work .
Even if you do absolutely nothing the next day , the previous days work usually compensates .
Spend some time with your family , read a book or just sleep in until noon .
After a day of tripled productivity , you ’ve earned it !
Does this sound familiar ?
your program ( n ) : a maze of non-sequiturs littered with clever - clever tricks and irrelevant comments .
Compare MY PROGRAM .
my program ( n ) : a gem of algorithmic precision , offering the most sublime balance between compact , efficient coding on the one hand , and fully commented legibility for posterity on the other .
Compare YOUR PROGRAM .
I first read this in the original 1993 edition of Code Complete .
It 's quoted from a much earlier book , Stan Kelley - Bootle 's The Devil 's Dp Dictionary , which was published in 1981 .
It 's still true , more than 25 years later .
There 's a knee - jerk predisposition to look at code you did n't write , and for various reasons large and small , proclaim it absolute crap .
But figuring out who 's actually responsible for that crappy code takes some detective work .
The upcoming Visual Studio 2008 , or at least the Team System flavor of it , finally delivers a feature I 've wanted for years : it can display the code side - by - side with the person who last changed that code .
The last person to change any particular line is identified right there , next to the lines they changed , along with the date and revision number .
Hovering over the revision number reveals a tooltip containing any checkin comments associated with that change .
Clicking on the revision number brings up the full details dialog for that checkin .
Although I have mixed feelings about source control integration with the IDE , I think this is a fairly compelling argument in favor of it .
Sometimes you just want to know who wrote this crap , and having that information directly next to the code in your editor saves many tedious steps of manually tracking down the owner of those particular lines .
This feature is called " annotate " in Team System source control , but it 's called " blame " in Subversion and in Vault .
So if you 're wondering who to blame , now you know .
It 's all those other developers .
Obviously .
No one doubts Gardner will get the necessary signatures .
And anyone with a political memory going back to 1991 expects the fight for votes to be fierce .
The ’91 contest over a referendum similar to Gardner ’s was , at the time , the most expensive ballot campaign in the state ’s history .
Polls showed the law about to pass , but in the final weeks a barrage of television advertisements helped to defeat it .
In one ad , a healthy - looking man with a rural twang to his speech recounted that four years earlier doctors told him he had two weeks to live ; if a death - with - dignity law existed back then , he said , he might have chosen a quick death .
In another ad , a hospice nurse warned : “ Those who ca n’t afford health care and insurance could be pressured to have their lives ended .
It could become the ultimate in discrimination . ”
Gardner was governor during that battle , but , bafflingly to him , he can recall nothing about it .
“ I was completely oblivious to it , ” he told me .
“ I could n’t have been , but it ’s as if it never happened . ”
Nothing compelled him , as governor , to take a public position , and it appeared that he kept silent , yet this did n’t explain the void in his memory .
His Parkinson ’s does frequently rob him of short - term recall and may deplete his long - term recollections , but this particular and perfect blank was an improbable symptom .
Was it possible that he was completely oblivious at the time ?
The opening of his speech , to the union leaders and tonight at the cocktail party , offered a way of understanding this strange emptiness in his mind .
“ I was on a roll , ” he told his audiences about the years before his illness .
“ I was on the fast track .
The world was good .
I thought I was indestructible . ”
Perhaps , to an extreme degree , this athletic and powerful man had n’t wished to hear , to admit , that anything else was possible .
“ But then , ” he went on with his speech , “ I lost control of my life . ”
He saw his campaign not only as a way to give his life purpose but as a mission of morality , a final gesture in a career of public service , a career he traced back to his early 20s , to coaching a community football team for kids in one of Seattle ’s poorest neighborhoods .
In 2003 he was honored for this work of half a century ago ; the trophy , with a bronze bust of Jimi Hendrix above the words “ Jimi Hendrix Foundation Humanitarian Award ” and “ Inspiring Our Youth , ” sits in the basement of Gardner ’s house on Vashon Island .
Hendrix , as a young teenager , was on the team , Gardner told me , and somehow the foundation discovered this .
“ He had a forerunner of his famous Afro , and he did n’t have an athletic bone in his body , ” Gardner said .
Gardner wanted to cut him , but the other kids asked the coach to keep him on , and during the season , when Hendrix missed a series of practices , Gardner went to his house .
He found the utilities shut off and the boy upstairs in his darkened room fingering chords on a broom .
Gardner persuaded him to return to the team and , as he remembered it , sent him in at running back at the end of the season ’s last game .
“ On the first play he got clobbered , ” Gardner said .
“ So I called time and told the kids to block hard and the next time he gained eight yards . ”
Soon after declaring that he ’d lost control of his life , Gardner , standing in front of the 30 cocktail - party guests , lost control of his speech .
He gazed out at his audience , out at the mayor of Everett and at the editor of the Everett newspaper .
His eyes were n’t leprechaunlike or hard - set , but soft and scared , bewildered .
He could n’t remember what he meant to say , and several seconds went by before he recovered .
“ This law is the moral thing to do .
No one knows better than ourselves when we ’re ready to go . ”
He paused again , eyes now in full panic , Parkinson ’s ravaging the paths of recall .
At his side sat a white - haired woman , Arline Hinckley , from Compassion and Choices , who accompanied him to all his presentations to answer questions — about the specifics of the statute or statistics from Oregon — that were beyond him , but also to prompt him when he stopped , disoriented , in the middle of his speech , which was n’t written out ; to read his speech would n’t have fit his concept of who he was .
At the meeting with union leaders two days earlier , he asked her several times , “ Give me a word , ” and she said , “ safeguards , ” and later , “ dignity , ” to stir his brain to produce his next sentences .
But tonight he was n’t using her in this way , perhaps because she , too , did n’t fit his concept .
He found words at last .
“ I wish we could do a more liberal law , but we ’re going to pattern it after the Oregon law because it passed .
We ’re not going to go farther than that now . ”
Another protracted silence .
“ My goal is to lessen the pain of dying . ”
Jon Stewart climbs ' Bullshit Mountain ' with Attorney General David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 26 , 2007
Print This Email This Jon Stewart reported on Wednesday 's Daily Show that " the House Judiciary Committee has cited White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers with contempt of Congress " for their " refusal to testify under oath regarding Attorney General Alberto Gonzales 's alleged improper firing of nine United States Attorneys . "
Stewart then introduced a mountain - climbing metaphor to illuminate Gonzales 's most recent appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" I 've said before that Alberto Gonzales 's logic is , well , mind - numbing , but during yesterday 's testimony , he became the K2 of obfuscation , " Stewart said .
Stewart first showed Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) asking Gonzales if he will permit the execution of the contempt citations and Gonzales replying , " I am recused ... I 'm not going to answer that question . "
" Right about 10,000 feet right now , air 's getting thinner , " said Stewart .
" Let 's see if we can find anything this prick 'll answer . "
After offering a clip of Gonzales claiming that some US Attorneys had been asked to leave " because there was legitimate cause , " Stewart commented , " It would appear to many observers that the Attorney General just admitted that some of the lawyers were fired for not - legitimate cause .
Ah , but watch .
Watch Baryshnikov dance . "
He then showed Gonzales explaining what he meant by " legitimate cause " by offering examples of specific forms of misconduct that he admitted were not involved in any of the attorney firings .
" Air getting thin , " gasped Stewart again .
" If I can get this straight , and I 'm sure I can't , " Stewart concluded , " Alberto Gonzales is saying basically there are problems , of which he cannot speak , for which he is responsible yet not to blame .
And that he is the only one who can clean up the mess that he can neither confirm or deny exists .
...
Oh , we 're on the summit .
Take a look around boys . "
" How did the senators respond to being dragged up Bullshit Mountain ? "
Stewart asked , before showing clips of the committee members accusing Gonzales of lying .
" This has become surreal , " he told Senior White House Correspondent Ron Riggle .
" It 's almost as though Attorney General Gonzales and the administration are laughing at the very idea of Congressional oversight . "
Riggle , however , defended the members of Congress , saying , " They 're not taking this lying down .
...
Many have enrolled in art therapy classes .
...
Schumer , he 's back on the black tar heroin .
Says it keeps his ears from leaking sadness . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on July 25 .
One night a little over a year ago , Derek Conlon showed up as usual for his gig as the piano player at the Pine Bar in Mayfair .
Sat down at one of the tables for a cup of coffee .
Chatted with the barman , stretched , strolled over and started tickling the keys .
That cup of coffee has given him countless sleepless nights since .
Not long after , Conlon , an Irishman known for his ability to glide from Elton John to Frank Sinatra with ease , learned that the table had been occupied moments before by Alexander Litvinenko , the former Russian spy who died after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium - 210 .
It got worse : Even though it had been through the dishwasher , Conlon ’s coffee cup had also held Litvinenko ’s tea .

“ My jacket , my piano , my P.A. system , everything I sing through was contaminated .
I had people from the Health Protection Agency with Geiger counters in white suits going through my house .
All the neighbors were saying , ‘ What ’s going on ? ’ ” said Conlon , 44 , who was diagnosed with a significant , but not necessarily health - threatening , exposure to polonium .
On the one - year anniversary of Litvinenko ’s death on Nov. 23 , the Russian ’s family and friends traveled to the hospital where he had lain with his internal organs melting for nearly a month , and to the vine - covered Victorian cemetery in North London where he was finally buried in a lead - lined coffin .
They repeated their accusations against the government of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin , which they believe may have supplied the polonium used to kill Litvinenko as punishment for his repeated criticism .
But while the former agent ’s death has played out in high - profile international criminal investigations and tit - for - tat diplomatic expulsions between Britain and Russia , the 17 cases of collateral damage such as Conlon have gone largely unremarked .

Those cases include Litvinenko ’s widow , Marina , employees at the bar and healthcare workers at the hospital where he died .
All 17 people received doses of polonium high enough to pose a potential , if faint , threat to their long - term health , the British Health Protection Agency says .
Conlon has come to look at his life in terms of what happened before , and what happened after , the night he sat at a table just vacated by Litvinenko .
The settled , easygoing musician became anxious , afflicted with high blood pressure and subject to frequent “ panic attacks . ”
Convinced that no one wanted him in the bar anymore , Conlon quit his job and moved briefly to the Caribbean .
There , he said , he began writing songs , and some of them seemed to strike a chord with others .
His “ A Sad and Lonely Man , ” which recounts a man “ walking the streets at night , . . . no better place to be , ” was a runner - up in the jazz and blues category in this year ’s UK Songwriting Contest .

It all began with the news that Litvinenko had been fatally poisoned with a radioactive isotope , and the investigation began to zero in on the places he had spent his last hours before falling ill , Conlon said in an interview at the Piano Bar in Kensington , a small , second - story lounge where he now plays two nights a week .
‘ What ’s the bottom line ? ’
“ They said they would like me to have some tests , ” Conlon recalled .
He submitted a urine sample , and was called back a week later to the hotel , where several doctors were waiting .
“ The doctor was frowning .
He said , ‘ Come with us . ’
I said , ‘ This looks a bit serious , ’ ” he remembered .
“ He said , ‘ I ’ve got a little bit of bad news :
Your test results are a little bit high , of some concern . ’
They started to explain a thing called millisieverts .
From 1 to 10 is low , from tens to hundreds is a concern .
I had 40 . ”

They wanted him to report to the hospital for more tests .
“ Finally , I said , ‘ What ’s the bottom line , basically ? ’
They said , ‘ Short term , you should be fine .
Long term , you ’ve got a one in four chance of cancer ” -- very slightly above the risk most people have of developing the disease , but enough to give him and everyone around him a substantial scare .
“ They ’re checking my blood , checking my eyes .
‘ How do you feel when you sneeze ? ’ they ask me .
And you say , ‘ Oh , I ’ve got a pain . ’
You just start thinking all these things .
And people start saying , ‘ Is it safe to be around you ?
Are you OK ?’
“ I ’m terrible , I shake hands with people all the time , it ’s part of my job , and people would just pull their hand away , there ’s that split second when you ’re looking at them .
. . .
I said to myself , ‘ Let ’s just try and get by this bit . ’ ”
The Pine Bar had reopened in another part of the Millennium Hotel , and Conlon continued to play there , but he and everyone around had trouble putting the case behind them .

“ People were not wanting to come in the bar , ” he said .
“ I just felt I could n’t work there anymore .
I thought maybe I ought to change my environment , but that ’s easier said than done .
I mean , there ’s not many piano bars in town , and you feel self - conscious .
Will they have me here ?
Or are they thinking the same thing everybody else is thinking ? ”
Caribbean revival
When a job opened up in Barbados , Conlon grabbed it .
“ I got as far away as I could .
And in two weeks of having a great time , forgetting everything , I started edging back again .
Much more relaxed .
Caribbean life , if you ca n’t chill out there , you ’ve got serious problems , ” he said .
Advertisement
He started to write songs .
Someone talked him into entering “ A Sad and Lonely Man ” into the UK Songwriting Contest , and it ’s gotten airplay all over Britain .
He resurrected some songs he wrote a few years ago with country singer LeAnn Rimes ’ collaborator Ron Grimes for an album , which will be released on iTunes this month ; he recently returned from performance tours in Germany and Belgium .
“ I ’m songwriting all the time now , ” he said .
“ It ’s just taken off .
What I say is , another door has opened .
It was kind of like from the bad , you always look for the positive , and this was the positive .
It was recognition of something . ”
Polonium ’s biological half - life is 50 days , and he expects the results of his third test , to be completed soon , will show that the poison has all but disappeared from his body .

“ It is a tragedy , but it ’s not like I lost a husband , ” Conlon said .
“ I was unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time .
But it did n’t kill me .
And you ’ve got to kind of every day just do everything you can do , you know ? ”
And whatever you do , do n’t shoot the piano player .

A recently published article by The Register claims that an increase in encrypted BitTorrent traffic is due to the fact that people want to hide or scramble the files they are sharing .
Apparently some tech journalists , and in particular the anti-piracy organizations , have no clue what BitTorrent encryption actually does .
Encrypted BitTorrent traffic now accounts for 40 % of all BitTorrent traffic in the UK according to the article .
The Register claims that filesharers use encryption to scramble their data so they can protect themselves from being caught , and the comments from a music industry representative make it seem like people can indeed hide what they are sharing .
Unfortunately , none of it is true
This is what Matt Phillips , of the record industry trade association the British Phonographic Institute told the Register : “ Our internet investigations team , internet service providers and the police are well aware of encryption technology : it ’s been around for a long time and is commonplace in other areas of internet crime .
It should come as no surprise that if people think they can hide illegal activity they will attempt to . ”
So if it ’s not hiding anything , why do people use BitTorrent encryption then ?
I ’ll try to explain it once more to the BPI , IFPI and RIAA and some tech journalists , just so they do n’t embarrass themselves again in the future .
BitTorrent encryption has nothing to do with hiding the data you ’re sharing , it only hides the fact that you ’re using BitTorrent to do so .
Encryption was designed to prevent ISPs from throttling BitTorrent traffic , which they started doing approximately 2 years ago .
ISPs use so called traffic shaping devices to identify and slow down BitTorrent traffic because it takes up a lot of bandwidth ( read : costs a lot of money ) .
BitTorrent encryption , which is now supported by all the popular BitTorrent clients , hides the protocol header .
As a result , these devices ca n’t detect that someone is using BitTorrent and you can download at full speed .
So , encryption does not hide the actual data people are sharing , everyone can still connect to a BitTorrent swarm , record your IP - address , and send you an infringement notice .
Now back to the claim that 40 % of the BitTorrent traffic is encrypted in the UK .
My first question would be , how do they know that it ’s BitTorrent traffic if it ’s encrypted ?
Apart from that I think 40 % is a little too high , unless the ISP that reported the data is throttling BitTorrent traffic of course .
We ’ve been tracking the number of people who actually use encryption and it is currently slightly below 10 % .
It could be of course that these people are responsible for 40 % of the traffic , but I seriously doubt that .
Bottom line is , anti-piracy organizations should take some time to read up on what filesharing actually is before they are going to accuse people of something , but I guess that ’s wishful thinking .
Why Did So Many Libertarians Support the War ? By Bryan Caplan
When the Washington Times announced that libertarianism is trendy , I could n’t help but think “ It would be a lot trendier if libertarians had been against the Iraq War from the start . ”
Plenty of libertarians were against it , of course .
But if you remember how integral isolationist / non-interventionist foreign policy was to the libertarian idea back in the ’70s and ’ 80s , the libertarian reaction to the Iraq War ( and the War on Terror generally ) has been quite astonishing .
You might say that libertarians changed their mind because Islamic fundamentalism is such a serious threat .
But it ’s a lot less serious than the Soviet threat .
And back when the Soviets still ruled eastern Europe , the standard libertarian foreign policy prescription was to pull out of NATO , Korea , and Japan .
Similarly , you might say that Islamic fundamentalism is so ideologically repugnant to libertarians that they were willing to make an exception .
But from a libertarian perspective , Marxism - Leninism is even worse , is n’t it ?
So why did libertarian thinking on foreign policy change so sharply ?
Here are a few possibilities :
1. Libertarian commitment to non-interventionism was always much weaker than it appeared .
Rothbardians ( and ex-Rothbardians who did n’t want to seem like sell - outs ) had key positions in the Libertarian Party , think tanks , etc. , and falsely claimed to speak for all libertarians .
In fact , many libertarians held the diametrically opposed Rand / Goldwater view that the U.S. should take off the kid gloves and start “ really ” fighting the Soviets .
2 . The movement away from natural rights and toward consequentialism made libertarians more open to using government for good causes .
Indeed , the very fact that Islamic fundamentalism is a lot weaker than the USSR makes it a more attractive target .
3 . The movement away from philosophy and toward economics made libertarians vulnerable to the simple - minded view that “ getting tough ” is a free lunch .
4 . The rise of the “ Establishment libertarian ” led to moderation .
In the 70’s and 80’s , libertarianism was an alienated outsider movement .
Over time , however , many libertarian thinkers have been accepted into polite intellectual society .
The cost is that they had to distance themselves from “ impolite ” positions .
5 . The end of the Cold War revived the libertarian / conservative alliance , making libertarians more receptive to conservative positions on everything from foreign policy to immigration .
What do you think ?
Anyone got a better explanation ?
To repeat , the question is not whether the war was actually a good idea , but why so many libertarians supported it .
1. Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall
Who : Celebrity chef , ethical farmer and food campaigner
Why :
He 's fried a human placenta and consumed it on screen , showed us how to fish sustainably , and cook our own garden snails for supper .
He 's taught us how to forage , fricassee and grow your own .
And this month , Fearnley - Whittingstall tackled the problem of cheap chicken - and the life of those miserable two - for - a - fiver birds that supermarkets claim we demand .
' All we 've done with the chicken campaign is to start a conversation .
But we think it is an important one . '
So do we , Hugh .
So do we .
2. Harriet Lamb
Who : Managing director , Fairtrade Foundation
Why : Since she took over in 2001 , Lamb has guided the foundation through a period of rapid growth and recognition .
During that time the number of products certified as fairtrade has risen from 80 to 800 and is still increasing .
Lamb knows her stuff , from working for the German Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International where she co-ordinated initiatives worldwide , to living in rural India for 18 months .
Now based in London , she proves her holiness by cycling to meetings .
We salute her .

3 . The Prince of Wales
Who : Eco-royalty
Why : For his unstinting support of farmers and what he refers to as British ' agri- culture ' .
For not being afraid to challenge big businesses and putting up with ridicule from the press for his troubles .
For excellent ginger biscuits , and for convincing us that mutton ( mutton ! ) is delicious .
4. Stuart Rose
Who : CEO , Marks & Spencer
Why : For proving that even massive knicker - touting supermarkets can go green .
And for that whole ' there is no Plan B ' business .
We liked that .
5. Rebecca Hosking
Who : Wildlife camerawoman and anti-plastic bag campaigner
Why : After persuading her home town to ditch plastic bags she became an accidental hero for the anti-plastic movement .
6. Rupert Howes
Who : CEO Marine Stewardship Council
Why : Howes is the man making it OK to eat fish again .
When he took over at the MSC in 2004 it was a small charitable organisation dedicated to preventing over - fishing and to helping consumers understand what fish they should avoid .
At that time , 11 fisheries around the globe were certified as reaching the well - respected MSC standard .
Now that figure is 26 ( with another 47 on the way ) , accounting for 7 per cent of the world 's fisheries .
Between them last year they processed more than four million tonnes of fish .
Forty two per cent of the worldwide salmon catch and 40 per cent of the world 's prime white catch comes under the auspices of the MSC .
One thousand schools in the UK serve their fish and at least 1,100 fishy products carry the MSC blue tick .

7. Sophi Tranchell
Who : Managing director , Divine Chocolate
Why :
In 1999 Sophi Tranchell answered an ad that might have been written by Willy Wonka : ' Come and work in a chocolate company and change the world . '
Eight years later she 's the multi-award - winning managing director of a unique chocolate business , and has masterminded its expansion into America .
Divine Chocolate is made with cocoa bought from Kuapa Kokoo , a Ghanaian farmers ' co-op , at Fairtrade prices .
The farmers - who have representatives at every Divine board meeting - also receive $ 150 ( around £ 80 ) for per tonne that is invested into projects such as building schools and providing clean drinking water .
With a turnover of £ 9 million there 's a way to go before Divine rivals the likes of Mars , Cadbury and Nestlé , but at least their chocolate is guilt - free as well as really , really delicious .
Though , sadly , it can still make you fat .

8. Tim Lang
Who : Professor of food science , City University
Why : Thirty years ago people probably thought Lang was a bit loopy .
These days the esteemed professor of food science ( and food policy ) at London 's City University is a highly respected academic - the man who coined the phrase ' food miles ' , the expert who understood the link between diet and poverty and the pioneer who was bemoaning substandard food in schools before Jamie Oliver had even learned to mouth the word ' pukka ' .
Most likely to say : ' If a country does n't sort out how it feeds its children , it does n't deserve to be called civilised . '
Least likely to say : ' Turkey Twizzlers are a great source of vitamin C. '
9. Jamie Oliver
Who : TV chef and campaigner
Why : For making heroines of dinner ladies and now investigating the evils of cheap meat on primetime TV .
10 . Patrick Holden
Who : Director of the Soil Association
Why : For presiding over a tenfold increase in sales of Soil Association - accredited organic produce and for championing small producers and farmers .
soilassociation.org
11 . Andy Good
Who : Director , Equal Exchange
Why : Good runs this Scotland - based workers cooperative that sells fairtrade and organic food .
Equal Exchange have been pioneers in the fairtrade movement since they were founded back in 1979 but now , working with Twin Trading , they 're giving nut farmers a chance to escape poverty , launching Liberation nuts late last year .
Nut farmers in the developing world often get a very rough deal , with little access to clean water , let alone international markets , but Liberation has helped farmers in Malawi , Mozambique , Nicaragua and Kerala form their own co-operatives , and they make up the major shareholders ( 42 per cent ) of the company , too .
Even better , the farmers are being taught about sustainability , helping to safeguard valuable rainforests .
You can buy the nuts at Oxfam shops and soon in most major supermarkets too .

12 . Andrew Mallison
Who : Fish technologist for Marks & Spencer
Why :
He might not be up to speed on their washable cashmere V - necks and gold sequined trapeze dresses but what Andrew Mallison does n't know about fish probably is n't worth knowing .
From Scottish langoustines to Cornish sole , he 's weaned us off cod and helped to make M&S a global corporate leader in promoting sustainable seafood .
Even independent groups like Greenpeace and the Marine Conservation Society are impressed .
What next ?
Sustainably farmed tilapia fishcakes , anyone ?
13 . Guy Watson
Who : Founder , Riverford box scheme
Why : Notwithstanding the stockpile of gently rotting carrots in the bottom of the fridge , weekly veg deliveries have become de rigueur dinner - party conversation for the kolrabi-eating classes and the perfect excuse for not schlepping to the supermarket every week .
Guy Watson , Devon farmer - turned - New - York - management - consultant - turned - Devon - farmer - again , is the mastermind behind Riverford , one of the longest - running and most successful box schemes .
Back in 1985 he started growing organic vegetables on three acres with a wheelbarrow , a borrowed tractor and £ 4,000 of savings .
Now Riverford co-ordinates over 45,000 deliveries every week , with franchise farms across the UK .
If we 're not eating our five a day , Watson most certainly is n't the one to blame .

14 . David Cameron
Who : MP and Leader of the opposition
Why :
He cycles , he recycles and there 's no doubting the fact that David ' Dave ' Cameron has forced green issues onto the parliamentary agenda and into the mainstream .
15 . Richard Reed
Who : Co-founder , Innocent
Why : The Innocent juice story is inspiration to anyone in a suit who has questioned the meaning of life on a Monday morning .
Along with co-founders Adam Balon and Jon Wright , Richard Reed gave up his job as an advertising exec to launch a range of soft drinks .
Turned down 20 times by banks , in a market where their nearest rival was PepsiCo , the future looked bleak until an American investor came on board .
Now Innocent smoothies , which are made from 100 per cent fruit , has a turnover of almost £ 100 m and the kind of cool yet healthy image certain big brands would die for .
And they 've just started making their bottles from recycled plastic .
So , good , basically .
16 . Geetie Singh
Who :
The owner of the Duke of Cambridge organic pub
Why : Having been raised on a commune where they grew their own food , it 's fair to say Geetie Singh has always known her organic onions .
However , as the owner of Britain 's first organic gastropub she has proved herself a pioneer in her own right .
The pub in Islington , London , which opened back in the organic dark ages of 1998 , is the only one to have Soil Association accreditation .
Marine Stewardship Council certification for her exemplary sourcing of fresh fish is said to be next .

17 . Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley
Who : Founders , Green & Black 's Chocolate
Why : Sams and Fairley founded their organic chocolate company , Green & Black's , in 1991 and were the first people to bring organic and then fairtrade chocolate to a mass market .
Their organic Maya Gold chocolate bar ( the first British fairtrade product ) is the livelihood for a whole district of Belize , and the thing worth getting out of bed for for those of us with a sweet tooth .
And now , from their all - organic Judges Bakery in Hastings , the pair are going all out for sustainable fish .
greenandblacksdirect.com
18 . Rick Stein
Who : TV chef and restaurateur
Why : For his tireless pursuit of local food heroes , and his involvement in Cefas 's Clean Fishing projects , aiming to cut bycatch and create sustainable fisheries .
19 . Peter Singer
Who : Author and philosopher
Why : For giving fainthearted foodies a run for their money in his controversial book , Eating : What We Eat and Why It Matters ( co- written with Jim Mason ) .
For going beyond the usual predictable ethical arguments .
For speaking out against fancy restaurants .
For not taking a knee - jerk position on big brands .
For saying a five - mile drive in your four - wheel drive to purchase an organic lettuce is , well , just not helpful .
20 . Andrew Whitely
Who : Uber - baker
Why : Andrew Whitely is to bread what Heston Blumenthal is to the perfectly fried chip .
A former BBC Russian Service producer , it was way back in the Seventies when Whitely converted a stone barn next to his house in deepest Cumbria into a small bakery with a wood - fired bread oven .
But it was on a chance trip to Russia where he discovered a range of rye breads that brought Village Bakery to the attention of Britain 's foodies .
His book , Bread Matters , part polemic about the pitiful state of British baking , part domestic science A - level in all things yeasty , has become a bible for bread - lovers , and those who agree that the airing cupboard is the perfect spot for a pungent starter dough .

21 . Arthur Potts Dawson
Who : Chef and co-owner , Acorn House
Why : Is Potts Dawson 's Acorn House the only well - trendy restaurant with a wormery ?
In an industry renowned for diabolical amounts of waste , Acorn House in London has fast gained a reputation for prize - winning organic local food and a minimal carbon footprint .
They produce just one bag of rubbish per service , and they compost the leftovers on the roof .
Potts Dawson 's venture is also a training ground for the next generation of green chefs .
Next up , another new restaurant , the Water House , opening in February in East London , complete with composting toilets .

22 . Anya Hindmarch
Who : Fashion designer
Why : With her ' I 'm not a plastic bag ' bag , Hindmarch got us thinking about what we carry our shopping home in , and kick - started a planet - saving trend for cotton totes and hempy satchels .
23 . Hugh Raven
Who : Director , Soil Association Scotland
Why : One - time politico turned environmentalist , Raven tired of politics after two elections as a Scottish Labour candidate and became director of the Soil Association Scotland instead .
Raven 's family have been farmers in North Argyll for generations and he 's currently working towards making the Soil Association 's organic - sustainable ethos central to Scottish farming .
He lives in Edinburgh during the week , and at weekends , he and his wife manage a 60 - square - mile estate , Ardtornish , which has 20 miles of coastline , and an ecological restaurant , the Whitehouse , in the village of Lochaline - plus they 're both active in the Slow Food movement .
He 's also a keen line fisherman and sailor .
And he has kids .
But it 's not like he 's superhuman or anything .
soilassociationscotland.org
24 . Tom Aikens
Who : Chef and owner of Tom's Place
Why : For setting up , with his twin Robert , the most sustainable fish and chip shop he possibly could and campaigning on fish with Greenpeace .
tomsplace.org.uk
25 . Mike Small
Who : Inventor , The Fife Diet
Why :
If you thought the Fife Diet consisted of shortbread , lager and 20 Lambert & Butler then think again .
Mike Small , a writer from Burntisland in Fife on the east coast of Scotland , has corralled his wife , kids and most of his neighbours to eat locally in a bid to show how it 's possible to survive on produce sourced from nearby , whatever the season or the weather .
If you fancy barley hotpot with turnips and kale you know where to go .
Just do n't turn up with a bottle of Rioja .
fifediet.wordpress.com
26 . Peter Kindersley
Who : Farmer
Why : For not giving in to a peaceful retirement ( he sold his publishing house , Dorling Kindersley , in 2005 ) aged 62 ; for setting up his own farm , after buying little bits of land over 27 years near his home near Oxford .
For not using pesticides or anything synthetic on his produce .
For not dealing with supermarkets , but selling his produce from his website or at farmers ' markets .
For having an eco-centre that does ethical weddings , of all things .
Oh , and for zealously protecting all the little bats on his estate .
sheepdrove.com
27 . Ian Tolhurst ( aka Tolly )
Who : Vegetable farmer
Why : Tolhurst Organics is a sustainably - run farm , and has a veg - box scheme with a difference - by Tolly 's calculations , vegetables for one family for a year from his farm will use only five litres of diesel .
He only delivers to an area within 25 miles of the farm , and runs a drop - off scheme where vegetable boxes are left at collection points in local towns for people to fetch on journeys they'd be doing anyway .
He 's even written a plan for how he 'll carry on farming when fossil fuels run out .
Patrick Holden , director of the Soil Association says , ' Tolly has to be the future of how we 'll get our food ' .

28 . Carlo Leifert
Who : Professor of ecological agriculture , Newcastle University , director of the Nafferton Ecological Farming Group
Why : Last year , after a four - year , EU - funded study , Professor Leifert 's team at Nafferton Farm announced that organic food really is better for you , in direct defiance of the government 's line .
Defying the powers - that - be is no new thing for Leifert : he quit the government 's GM review panel in 2003 because he felt that the quality of science was too low and that the debate was dominated by biotech supporters .
The aim of Leifert 's team is to discover as many ways to help farmers work organically as possible .
Leifert 's current project speaks for itself ; it is called Better Organic Bread .

29 . Tim Wilson
Who : Pig farmer and founder of The Ginger Pig
Why :
This one - time antiques dealer and accidental pig farmer , who found himself with too much pork on his hands when his Tamworth hobbies all got pregnant , is slowly changing our expectations about how pork should taste and how pigs should be reared .
His exemplary produce , and kind but unsentimental rearing practices are a world away from mass - produced meat from miserable pigs .

30 . Lady Caroline Cranbrook
Who : Campaigner
Why : Yes , she sounds like an Oscar Wilde character but Lady Caroline Cranbrook is , in fact , a tireless rural campaigner who recently managed to see off
Tesco when the men in suits planned to open a superstore in her local town of Saxmundham .
A staunch supporter of local businesses , particularly in the east of England where she lives , she is to be found on countless committees doing battle with the Big Four .
Least likely to be overheard saying at the checkout : ' How many Nectar Card points do I get for a £ 2 chicken ? ' eeda.org.uk
31 . Richard Guy and Gilly Metherell
Who : Founders , the Real Meat Company
Why : Disgusted with the lack of ethical meat available , in 1986 Guy and Metherell set up their brand to provide people with meat they could trust .
More than two decades on , they still run the company with the same stringent codes of practice , and all the nay - sayers who thought they were crackpots are eating their words .
Everything they sell must be completely traceable - they even DNA - test the meat they supply to check no one 's sneaking in produce that does n't make the grade .
Their website is an impassioned treatise on why they do what they do - all capital letters and rants against the supermarkets - plus online ordering and technical tips for cooking their fabulous produce .
realmeat.co.uk
32 . Catherine Conway
Who : Ethical shopkeeper
Why : If Catherine Conway 's innovative grocery shop in northeast London had a mission statement , it might be ' This is not a bag ' .
The store , Unpackaged , has not only banished non-biodegradable carriers from behind the till , it 's also taken away almost all of its packaging , leaving shoppers to bring their own jars , pots and bags to fill with everything from organic wholefoods and dried fruits to eco-friendly laundry liquid and recycled loo paper .

33 . Jonathan Smith
Who : Farmer , Scilly Organics
Why : Not many 26 - year - olds lie awake at night , worrying about what the wind is doing to their polytunnels , but Jonathan Smith does , even if he 's spent a day hard at work with his hoe .
At the tender age of six , Smith declared that he wanted to be a farmer , and now , 20 years later , he 's realised his dream , singlehandedly running his own smallholding .
His watchwords are local , local , local - he only sells his produce on the Scilly Isles .
scillyorganics.co.uk
34 . Keith Abel and Elle Heeks
Who : Veg box entrepreneurs
Why :
They may have just sold a big chunk of their business , Abel & Cole , to a private equity firm , but since this means that they 're able to expand their veg - box delivery service beyond the M25 , then surely it 's forgivable .
They do n't use air - freighting , their delivery vans are LPG or biodiesel , packaging gets recycled and their organic produce is , on average , cheaper , or the same price , as supermarket equivalents .
abel-cole.co.uk
35 . Penny Newman
Who : Chief executive , Cafédirect
Why : A pink - haired former Avon lady , Penny Newman turned Cafédirect into a multimillion pound business ( with no majority shareholders ) when she took over 10 years ago , transforming it from a tiny little company selling distinctly average ( ' interesting ' is her word for it ) fairtrade coffee out of charity shop catalogues to a gourmet drinks company selling single - origin fairtrade produce in shops all over the country , without compromising the company 's values .
cafedirect.co.uk
36 . Zac Goldsmith
Who : Director , the Ecologist magazine
Why :
He may be worth about £ 300 million , but that has n't stopped him knuckling down and working hard to popularise the Ecologist , as well as establishing FARM , an organisation that aims to get environmentalists and farmers talking .
He has also advised the Conservatives on green policies .
37 . Barney Haughton
Who : Chef and restaurateur , Bordeaux Quay
Why : His Bristol restaurant is built from reclaimed and sustainable materials , his suppliers are all as local as possible , his tablecloths are organic cotton and there are whopping great solar panels on the roof .
He even employs a ' sustainability manager ' .
bordeaux-quay.co.uk
38 . Oliver Rowe
Who : Chef and owner , Konstam
Why : Rowe manages to achieve what sounds both implausible and , to be honest , unpleasant : sourcing at least 85 per cent of the food for his East London restaurant from within the tube map .
Amazingly it 's all delish .
konstam.co.uk
39 . Jody Scheckter
Who : Racing - driver - turned - organic - farmer
Why :
He might have made his money guzzling carbon on the track , but he 's putting it to good use now , farming organically and keeping rare animal breeds alive .

40 . Corinne Bailey Rae
Who : Eco-celebs , led by Corinne Bailey Rae
Why : Cynical as we sometimes are about celebrities going charity - wild , you 've got to hand it to them for getting causes into the headlines .
pumpaid.org
· Agree ? Disagree ?
Tell us who we missed on the food blog
· Nominations came from a range of experts including Joanna Blythman , Andrew Purvis , Alex Renton , Alex James , Patrick Holden , Jay Rayner , Lucy Siegle , and the OFM team
· This article was amended on February 11 2008 .
The article above described Mike Small , creator of the Fife Diet , as a ' writer from Burntisland on the island of Fife ' .
No man is an island - and neither is Fife .
This has been corrected .
I can't do it .
Maybe it's the cough medication talking .
Maybe it 's the season .
Maybe it 's the knowledge that we 're about to launch into a new presidency which seems already , by many of the most important measures , to be destined for either completely out - in - the - open Republican insanity or fear - spangled Democratic timidity .
But I have Outrage Overload , and I can't manage anything pithy to say about the current environment that does n't involve just climbing the nearest church steeple and swearing at the top of my lungs .
Let 's review the stories currently on the radar .
(1) The Wapo publishes completely false smears against Obama -- truly , the most poorly premised and written article I have seen since half past forever .
Akin to what the Swiftboat Vet stories would have been , if the Swiftboat Vets had not even been seasoned Republican operatives but just " some paranoid guy ranting incoherently from his South Carolina basement . "
Truly , the story reads like something plagiarized from the racist Human Events and rewritten into " Washington Post journalism " format just barely enough to make it by the apparently heavily drugged editors .
(2) Rove , trying an instance of the Great Conservative Walkback against ... well , himself ... claims the Democrats goaded Bush into the Iraq War .
This was apparently not done on a dare , or while under the influence of drugs , though it was done under the influence of Rove - style conservative Republicanism .
Whatever , I do n't know : but this is the sort of insane claim for which tarring and feathering was invented .
Can we please bring it back ?
I know , I know , I have previously written against torture .
I 've changed my mind .
If you can't torture someone for attempting to alter the fabric of spacetime through the power of their own proclamatory farts , then this world is no longer worth living in .
(3) Oh , this is wonderful .
No , really .
We find out that Rudy had the fuckin ' city of New York provide an official city - paid Booty Call Car And Driver
Set for his secret non-wifely hump buddy .
Seriously , he had the city provide his mistress a car and police driver .
And , upon learning all of this , which managed to stay under the radar for years and years in spite of being trivally easy to suss out and presumably a felony to boot , we 're sitting here wondering if the media is going to get off their asses and bother to give two shits , since they do n't have their usual Republican faxes telling them how to push the story ... since presumably , the Republican faxes right now all have to do with whether or not Barack Obama got muslim cooties from some brown - looking kid in second grade , which is far more important .
(4) Supposedly intelligent Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton says " yeah , that Colin Powell is a guy worth listening to ! " , under the apparent premise that the one guy singularly and most famously known for having the Most Total Lifetime Opportunities To Do The Right Thing During A Complete Clusterfuck Without Ever Goddamn Actually Doing It Even Once Even While Every Shred Of His Own Integrity Got Shoveled Into George W. Bush 's Boxer Shorts in fact represents the kind of moderation and foreign policy " bipartisanship " worth the attention of Democrats .
No , this is what seriously counts as " reasonable " , these days , even among prominent Democrats .
You do n't actually have to do the right thing .
You do n't have to do the right thing when given one opportunity , or two , or five , or twenty .
You just have to be declared the guy who seems like the guy most likely to maybe have done the right thing , except that you did n't , and that 's all it takes .
That 's " moderation " .
That 's being an " intelligent voice " , among the crew of the biggest ship of fools ever to set sail from the confines of their own hollow heads .
That 's enough to get all the Broders and , god help me , Clintons of the world saying by golly , that 's what we need .
After seven years of complete , disasterous clusterfuckery , the right thing to do would be to have an administration that is willing to take equal parts sensible policy and total clusterfuckery , adds them together , and we 're done !
Instant reasonableness !
And then we should torture half the people we normally do , and restore half the rights that should be restored , and help half the Americans that need our help , and get into half as many disastrously mismanaged trillion - dollar wars , and fix half the budget , and indict only half the criminals , and the entire Washington establishment will come to a shattering , orgasmic printed climax in honor of such reasonableness and bipartisanship .
Equal parts insanity plus non-insanity equals , in Washington eyes , the only approach worthy of respect .
God help you if you try anything more .
Because there 's nothing you can do to be discredited , these days .
And nothing Colin Powell ever did -- or pointedly prevented himself from doing -- will reflect in the slightest upon him .
(5) Joe Klein continues to walk the earth unraped by drunken bears .
This is evidence enough for me to doubt the existence of God .
(6) Oh -- and some Democratic - leaning military guy asked a question about teh gays at a Republican debate , thus rending the well - constructed Fortress of Republitude asunder , and causing all the Petraeus - loving patriots of the right to suddenly wonder if maybe military folks might be traitorous opinionated bastards injecting themselves into politics after all .
Does that about cover it ?
No , it does n't .
It 's not even half .
I mean , what the Holy .
Porcine .
Fuck ???
To hell with being polite about any of this -- apparently there 's no point .
To hell with trying to make the press " better " , or trying to keep Republicans " honest " , or pretending that Democrats are anything more than the battered spouses of their own bunglefucked advisors and consultants and hangers on and punditorial freebased stupidity pushers .
Right now I just want to run every last reporter and politician on earth through a cheese grater .
Maybe it 's the damn season .

Von Gabor Steingart
My name is Mary Ellen McCormack .
I do n't know how old I am ...
I have never had but one pair of shoes , but I can't recollect when that was .
I have no shoes or stockings this winter ...
I have never had on a particle of flannel .
My bed at night is only a piece of carpet , stretched on the floor underneath a window , and I sleep in my little undergarment , with a quilt over me .
I am never allowed to play with any children or have any company whatever .
Mamma has been in the habit of whipping and beating me almost every day .
She used to whip me with a twisted whip , a raw hide .
The whip always left black and blue marks on my body .
I have now on my head two black and blue marks , which were made by mamma with the whip , and a cut on the left side of my forehead , which was made by a pair of scissors in mamma's hand .
She struck me with the scissors and cut me .
I have no recollection of ever having been kissed , and have never been kissed by mamma .
I have never been taken on my mamma's lap , or caressed or petted .
I have never dared to speak to anybody , because if I did I would get whipped ...
Whenever mamma went out I was locked up in the bedroom ...
I have no recollection of ever being in the street in my life .
In 1894 , Mary Ellen McCormack , who was nine years old , was able to provide the testimony quoted above in court due , in large part , to laws against cruelty to animals that then existed in the state of New York .
This entry will explore the genesis of the laws that are now on the books against physical child abuse , starting with the laws against animal cruelty that are their origin .
It will also discuss the people and circumstances behind the creation of those laws .
Richard Martin and the RSPCA
Richard Martin was born in Dublin , Ireland in 1754 .
He was a wealthy landowner known for his love of animals and his quick temper when dealing with people .
It was generally known that any man on his property ( 200,000 acres ) who mistreated an animal would spend some time in the dungeons of his castle , subsisting on bread and water .
While he was a member of the Irish Parliament , that body once found itself threatened by rioters .
Armed only with a small pistol , Martin turned to face the estimated 10,000 rioters and said :
If you advance six inches , I 'll shoot every mother 's babe of you as dead as that paving stone .
The comedic value of a single man , armed only with a pistol , making this threat was not lost on the mob .
After the laughter subsided , the crowd gave him three cheers .
Martin was , in fact , the winner of any number of duels .
Asked why he so vigorously advocated kindness to animals while he regularly fought humans with pistols , he responded , ' because a cow cannot hold a pistol , sir ! '.
In 1822 , as a member of the British House of Commons , Martin managed to gain passage of what is believed to be the first animal welfare law ever passed by a nation .
The Martin Act , which has been called ' the animals ' Magna Carta ' , outlawed cruelty to cattle , horses and sheep .
During the debate on the bill , which was unruly , one Member of Parliament challenged Martin to a fight , to be held on the spot .
The fight took place , Martin won , and the man voted for the act .
It became evident that magistrates did n't want to try cruelty to animal cases , especially after Martin actually brought a donkey into court to show its wounds .
In 1824 , Martin and three other Members of Parliament formed the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( SPCA ) .
In 1840 , Queen Victoria commanded the Society to add Royal to its name .
She has been quoted as having said :
No country can be called civilised that does not provide proper care for animals .
Thus was born the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , which exists to this day .
Henry Bergh and the ASPCA
Henry Bergh was born into wealth , the son of a New York shipbuilder .
He did not follow in his father 's footsteps .
Instead , his first career , after he had failed as a writer , was as a diplomat .
In 1863 , United States President Abraham Lincoln appointed him to the US diplomatic legation in Russia .
His career as a diplomat lasted only one year .
Some sources say that Bergh was dismissed because his superior at the legation resented Bergh 's popularity with the Russians .
Other sources provide a more colourful story :
One day , Bergh saw a Russian peasant beating his horse .
This was not an unusual sight at all .
This time , though , Bergh ordered the driver of his carriage to stop .
He then walked up to the peasant and demanded that he stop beating the horse .
This got to be a habit with Bergh , to the point where his making this bizarre demand of peasants became a daily occurrence .
Over time , his behaviour resulted in the Russians requesting that he be recalled by the United States government .
Whatever the reason for Bergh 's sudden lack of employment , he did not return to the United States immediately .
Instead , he spent several months in London seeking another diplomatic position .
It was during this period that Bergh was exposed to the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty of Animals .
He set the formation of a similar organisation in the United States as his goal .
Using the influence of rich and politically powerful friends , Bergh succeeded in his efforts to get the New York State Legislature to pass An Act Better to Prevent Cruelty to Animals .
As a result of this Act , the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ASPCA ) was formed in 1866 .
This organisation was charged with overseeing the enforcement of the Act and given appropriate police powers .
Although the word ' American ' appeared in the organisation 's name , it was , in fact , empowered to act in the state of New York only .
Given the legal authority , Bergh did n't hesitate to use it for the protection of maltreated animals .
New York City 's public transportation in 1871 consisted of a system of horse - drawn streetcars .
The ASPCA repeatedly warned the streetcar company to either limit the number of passengers or increase the number of horses pulling the car .
During one heavy snowstorm , the streetcars ran as usual , with the usual number of horses and the usual number of passengers .
The layer of snow on the ground made the job of the overworked horses even more difficult than usual .
During the heaviest traffic period , when the workers were going home in the evening , Bergh stopped a car on Third Avenue , a major thoroughfare , and ordered the driver to have all of the passengers get out .
The driver refused .
Bergh then simply unhitched the team of horses , stopping that streetcar and all of the streetcars behind it .
When the streetcar company tried to detour on Fourth Avenue , Bergh ran to Fourth Avenue and unhitched the horses there .
The streetcars did n't move for over two hours , until the company hitched extra teams of horses to the cars .
Bergh 's name was in the headlines of the newspapers the next day , with varying reactions .
One newspaper proclaimed him ' The Good Genius of the Storm ' while another accused ' Five Thousand People Go Without Their Dinners to Oblige Bergh ' .
Mary Ellen
In 1864 , in New York City , a daughter was born to Thomas and Frances Wilson , whom they named Mary Ellen .
Later that same year , Thomas Wilson was killed in the United States Civil War .
Frances found that her widow 's pension was not adequate to maintain herself and her daughter , and that she had to take on a job .
Because she was unable to care for Mary Ellen while working , Frances placed Mary Ellen in the care of Mary Score , a woman who privately fostered children as her only source of income .
Frances stopped sending her two dollars per week payment to Mary Score shortly thereafter .
Mary turned Mary Ellen over to the New York Department of Charities , which sent her to an institution for destitute children .
On 2 January , 1866 , Thomas and Mary McCormack went to the Department of Charities .
They asserted that they were there to claim a child who , they said , was born to Thomas 's mistress and who was then abandoned by her mother .
Mary Ellen was turned over to the McCormacks ' care on the basis of their undocumented claim .
Thomas McCormack died within months of having brought Mary Ellen home .
Mary McCormack then married a man named Francis Connolly .
Over the next six years , neighbours and Margaret Bingham , the landlady of the Connolly apartment in New York City 's Hell 's Kitchen neighbourhood , became increasingly concerned about little Mary Ellen .
Mary Ellen 's body was covered with bruises and cuts .
Bingham had observed that Mary Ellen was kept confined in a small room during the heat of summer , underdressed in the cold of winter , forced to do manual labour beyond the capacity of any child and was even more malnourished than the other children in that impoverished and overcrowded tenement neighbourhood .
In 1873 , Bingham brought Mary Ellen 's plight to the attention of Etta Wheeler , a social worker acting under the auspices of the Methodist Church .
Bingham told
Wheeler that every time she had tried to speak to the Connollys on Mary Ellen 's behalf , Mary Connolly responded that she would call in the law before allowing any interference in her home .
One of the Connollys ' neighbours was a woman named Mary Smitt , who was seriously ill with tuberculosis .
After getting Smitt 's permission , Wheeler knocked on the Connollys ' door , planning to use the pretence of inquiring about Mary Smitt to see Mary Ellen 's living conditions for herself .
Etta
Wheeler describes the scene that greeted her with the following words :
It was December and the weather bitterly cold .
She was a tiny mite , the size of five years , though , as afterward appeared , she was then nine .
From a pan set upon a low stool she stood washing dishes , struggling with a frying pan about as heavy as herself .
Across the table lay a brutal whip of twisted leather strands and the child 's meagre arms and legs bore many marks of its use .
But the saddest part of her story was written on her face in its look of suppression and misery , the face of a child unloved , of a child that had seen only the fearsome side of life .
Wheeler asked the New York City Police Department to intervene .
They refused , on the grounds that they could do nothing without proof of assault .
Since there was no law allowing intervention inside a child 's home , there was no way they could enter the home to get any proof that a crime had been committed .
And without first having some kind of proof that a crime had been committed , they had neither proof of assault nor grounds to enter the home .
Wheeler then approached numerous charitable organisations .
They all agreed to provide care for Mary Ellen , but only if she came to them by legal means .
Finally , acting on the suggestion of her niece , Etta Wheeler approached Henry Bergh , the founder and moving force behind the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
Wheeler had prepared her argument that Mary Ellen , as a human , was a member of the animal kingdom and entitled to the protection of the ASPCA .
There are several versions of what happened after that .
The most popular , and colourful , version states that Bergh filed a court petition for legal protection and removal of Mary Ellen from her home , arguing that Mary Ellen , being human , was a member of the animal kingdom and therefore entitled to 'at least the same justice as the common cur ' .
The more accurate , if less dramatic , story is that Bergh hired a private investigator to look into the conditions in Mary Ellen 's home and how she came to be a member of the Connolly household .
Using the information obtained by the private investigators and the testimony of Etta Wheeler , lawyers working for Bergh filed a petition on behalf of Mary Ellen .
They argued that the Connollys , who were neither her natural parents nor her lawful custodians , held Mary Ellen illegally .
This argument was upheld , as no documentation had been presented by Thomas or Mary McCormack showing that they were related to Mary Ellen when they claimed her from the charitable institution that had been her previous home .
The petition described Mary Ellen and her living conditions .
Bergh 's lawyers offered a list of witnesses willing to testify on behalf of the child and concluded by stating that there was ample evidence to indicate that she was in clear danger of being maimed or even killed .
They requested that a warrant be issued , that Mary Ellen be removed from her home and placed in protective custody , and her parents brought to trial .
Judge Abraham R Lawrence issued a warrant under Section 65 of the Habeas Corpus Act as requested .
On 9 April , 1874 , Mary Ellen was brought into Judge Lawrence 's court .
At this point , the popular , if inaccurate , version of what happened quotes a journalist who was present as having said :
I saw a child brought in , covered in a horse - blanket , at the sight of which men wept aloud .
I saw it laid at the feet of the judge , who turned his face away , and in the stillness of that courtroom I heard the voice of Henry Bergh .
' The child is an animal ' , he said .
' If there is no justice for it as a human being , it shall at least have the rights of the cur in the streets .
It shall not be abused ' .
Mary Ellen was , in fact , brought into the courtroom wrapped in a carriage blanket , since she had no adequate clothing of her own .
The reporter and photojournalist Jacob Riis was present in the court .
His actual words were :
' I saw a child brought in ... at the sight of which men wept aloud , and I heard the story of little Mary Ellen told ... that stirred the soul of a city and roused the conscience of a world that had forgotten , and as I looked , I knew I was where the first chapter of children 's rights was being written ' .
Mary Ellen 's body and face were bruised .
Her hands and feet ' showed the plain marks of great exposure ' .
On her face there was a fresh gash through her eyebrow and across her left cheek that barely missed the eye itself .
That evening , Mary Ellen was turned over to the temporary custody of the matron of police headquarters .
The next day , five indictments were brought against Mary Connolly for assault and battery , felonious assault , assault with intent to do bodily harm , assault with intent to kill , and assault with intent to maim .
Margaret Bingham testified that she had seen Mary Ellen locked up in a room and had told other neighbours , but they said there was no point in interfering since the police would do nothing .
Bingham further testified that she had tried to open the window of Mary Ellen 's room to let in some air , but it would not lift more than an inch .
Etta
Wheeler testified on the conditions she had seen on the day she had visited Mary Ellen .
Mary Connolly , during her testimony in her own defence , accused the prosecuting lawyers of being ' ignorant of the difficulties of bringing up and governing children ' .
It took a jury only 20 minutes to reach a verdict of guilty of assault and battery .
Mary Connolly was sentenced to one year of hard labour in the city penitentiary .
In handing down this sentence , the judge defined it not only as a punishment to Connolly but also as a statement of precedence in child abuse cases .
It is interesting to note that no accusations were made , nor charges pressed , against Francis Connolly .
There is no readily available documentation as to his role in Mary Ellen 's home life or as to his circumstances during or after the trial .
Child Protection Agencies
As a result of the public outcry over Mary Ellen 's case , the New York State Legislature passed laws permitting the chartering of Societies for The Protection of Children .
In 1875 , The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NYSPCC ) was created , with Henry Bergh as one of its founding members and its first Vice President .
It is believed to have been the first child protection agency in the world .
The NYSPCC investigated 300 cases of child abuse in its first year .
In 1882 , an Englishman named Frederick Agnew visited the United States and saw the work being done by the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children .
Just as Henry Bergh had been inspired by the English Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , Frederick Agnew was inspired by the American New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children .
Agnew organised a similar society in Liverpool on his return home .
The idea spread throughout England .
The London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded in 1884 .
The Reverend Benjamin Waugh , a congregational minister in East London , was appointed Honorary Secretary .
Out of this organisation grew a national British SPCC .
England 's first Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act , which became law in 1889 , was in large part , a product of lobbying by Benjamin Waugh and his supporters .
In that same year , the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children ( NSPCC ) was founded with Benjamin Waugh as Director and Queen Victoria as Royal Patron .
In its first year , the NSPCC investigated 3937 cases of child abuse and neglect .
Thus , the creation of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals inspired the creation of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals made Henry Bergh a household name in New York City , starting the chain of events leading to the rescue of Mary Ellen from her hellish existence with the Connollys .
The publicity around the trial of Mary Connolly led to the first laws and organisations in the United States and England specifically designed to protect children from physical abuse .
Epilogue
Mary Ellen spent the rest of her childhood being cared for and raised by a sister of Etta Wheeler , in the town of North Chili , near Rochester , New York .
At the age of 24 , Mary Ellen married a widower named Louis Schutt .
Together , they had two children , Etta and Florence .
She also raised Louis Schutt 's three children from his first wife , and adopted another child .
It was a point of pride for Mary Ellen that she was able to provide her own children with a childhood so different from her own , the scars of which she bore for the rest of her life .
Mary Ellen Schutt died on 30 October , 1956 , at the age of 92 .

Al Gore , Global Warming , the Oscars and the Iraq War
That the Al Gore film “ An Inconvenient Truth ” was legitimized by an Oscar Sunday night for “ Best Documentary ” has wider implications for the future of the United States than it might seem , though admittedly it is a small step .
We know that Exxon Mobil is a significant funder of the American Enterprise Institute and has used it to attempt to bribe “ scientists ” to cast doubt on global warming .
Lee Raymond , who was CEO of Exxon Mobil until 2005 , is the vice - chair of AEI ’s board of directors .
We also know that the American Enterprise Institute is the most hawkish of the Washington “ think tanks , ” and that its staffers were key to thinking up and promoting the Iraq War with lies and propaganda .
A=B , B=C , therefore A=C. Exxon Mobil is a big behind the scenes player in the Iraq War by virtue of its support for AEI .
In fact , I think a boycott of its gas stations is in order until the company cuts off AEI and stops promoting the Iraq War and muddying the waters on global warming .
( It pledged to do the latter in the past , but obviously was lying ) .
So the point is that the American Enterprise Institute symbolizes the intersection of Oil and War , which are the two most menacing threats to the future of America .
Only by a Manhattan Project - scale government effort to develop green energy can we hope to avert the worst consequences of global warming , which is likely to raise sea levels at least a foot , and possibly 7 feet over the next century or century and a half .
( That would put a lot of cities on both coasts under water ) .
The arctic and antarctic ice shelfs are already falling into the ocean at rates that have astonished climate scientists .
The arctic alone lost perennial ice cover the size of Texas in 2004 - 2005 !
Warm water takes up more space than cold water * and the loss of white ice cover is bad because it radiates a lot of sunlight back out to space .
So it is a double whammy .
But the other problem with petroleum and gas as sources of energy is that they are getting scarcer .
No big new fields have been found for some time .
And in one recent year China generated 40 % of new demand for petroleum .
If a billion Chinese and a billion Indians adopt the American lifestyle and all want 1.5 automobiles and superhighways to crawl along on , the existing stocks of oil will become objects of fierce competition .
This process has already begun , and there is a sea change from the mid-1990s , when oil was still cheap and competition for it limited .
Iraq is an Oil War in the mind of politicians like Dick Cheney .
It was necessary to deny it to China and other rivals thirty to fifty years in the future .
It was necessary to open its vast petroleum fields up for exploration and cast aside anti-American Baath socialism .
Likewise , the religious rigidity of the Pushtun peoples of Helmand province is not the real reason for the US insistence on occupying Afghanistan .
It is the vast Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan gas fields that Cheney has his eye on .
It was the US hope to use a pipeline from Turkmenistan to supply Pakistan and India , and so forestall a deal by those two countries with Iran .
The inability of the Bush administration to calm things down in Afghanistan sufficiently for anyone to dream of putting in such a pipeline and having it avoid routine sabotage has made it likely that Iran will break out of the Bush boycott toward the East .
Hunger for future rights to petroleum and positioning the US to remain a superpower in a world of hydrocarbon scarcity is also driving the campaign to get up a war against Iran .
Why can Pakistan have a nuclear weapon , and that is all right , but Iran cannot ?
Pakistan has very little petroleum .
Iran has a lot , and maybe 750 trillion cubic feet of gas in the southwest .
If it gets a bomb , regime change becomes impossible , and if Iran wants to tie its supplies up in proprietary contracts with China and India , locking out the United States , it will be able to do so .
Continued heavy dependence on gas and oil therefore not only turns the world into a hothouse , with rising seas , ever more destructive hurricanes , and possibly disastrous shifts in the ocean currents , but it also drives the United States to more and more wars .
And , note that the wars are not even successful in allowing a practical oil grab of the sort Cheney and Lee Raymond dreamed of .
Indeed , you could now , in retrospect , turn their whole argument around on them .
US militarism cannot secure petroleum and gas supplies from places such as Iraq , because the pipelines are so easily sabotaged and local nationalisms and religious activism make it impossible for people to accept that kind of US hegemony .
Since the Pentagon cannot practically speaking hope to safeguard US petroleum supplies from the Gulf , national security requires a massive and rapid research and development program of green energy .
A lot of green technology , especially solar , would come down in price rapidly if enough government money were thrown at it .
We need to press Congress on this , and maybe Californians can craft some of their famous referendum items .
That would be one way to promote a new generation of electric cars .
Green energy– wind , thermal , solar , maybe ultimately fusion , etc. – is what would allow the US to retain its autonomy and independence into the next century , and what would allow it to avoid losing more cities the way Bush and Cheney lost New Orleans .
Oil and War will , in contrast , ruin us all .

Washington , D.C. --
Entrepreneurs , zip up your parkas and head for the plains !
South Dakota once again leads the list of U.S. states with the best tax and regulatory climate for small business , according to the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council 's latest ranking .
Rounding out the top three were Nevada and Wyoming , unchanged from last year .
The rest of the top 10 includes Washington , Florida , Michigan , Texas , South Carolina , Virginia and Alabama .
The nation 's capital came in dead last once again , preceeded by California and New Jersey .
Last year 's index used 29 factors to rank states with the lowest taxes and lightest regulatory burden .
This year 's list added two new criteria : corporate capital gains tax rates and transportation infrastructure .
" As the index changes we get a clearer picture of which states are better for small business , " says SBE chief economist Ray Keating .
The top and bottom ten both include a mix of small and large states spread across regions .
Rankings are determined by specific policies at the state level .
For example , Rust Belt neighbors Ohio and Michigan moved in different directions this year .
Ohio climbed from 38th to 29th on the list after passing a broad tax - relief package , while sixth - place Michigan will likely slide in next year 's rankings because it adopted income and sales tax increases after the SBE Council finalized its list .
" Even top states can make bad decisions , " Keating adds .
But do low taxes and limited regulation really equate to a better climate for small business ?
The SBE Council 's index does not address issues such as access to venture capital and a pool of educated , skilled workers , both areas in which California ( # 49 on the list ) and New York ( # 46 ) have a clear advantage over South Dakota and Nevada .
And many of the tax rates that the SBE index measures , such as estate taxes , have little impact on small - business owners because they only affect the wealthiest taxpayers .
" Most small businesses want low taxes for the lower and medium income group , " says John Arensmeyer , head of Small Business Majority , a California - based advocacy group .
According to Arensmayer , lower tax rates on the topmost bracket benefit only 2 % of U.S. small - business owners , who earn an average of $ 77,000 a year .
All that said , the SBE Council 's report notes that states in the top half of this year 's index registered double the population growth of states in the bottom half .
And the rate of job creation was 70 % faster in the top 25 states versus the bottom 26 .
South Dakota may be on to something .

I worked in a fairly large department that used a spreadsheet as the bug- submission - tracking " system " .
Naturally , the person who assigned the work kept it open at all time , making it impossible for anyone to actually open it to enter a new bug .
Part of my job was to evaluate new technologies to see if they could be of use in our department .
This time around , it was ColdFusion .
I installed and played with it a while , and decided that the best way to get a feel for it was to build a throw - away system that actually did something of substance .
Having been inflicted with the daily arguments about who left the bug - spreadsheet open , I decided that I 'd build a bug - tracking system .
At least it was something to focus on .
I quickly threw something together and , next thing you know , my boss said we should use my system for real .
Of course , there were no passwords , everything was passed in clear - text , etc. , but it was only for our department , and nobody would abuse it .
The thing actually worked fairly well .
I started the bug tracking numbers at 300 , so that they could prime it with the bugs from the spreadsheet .
Over the next year , the users feature - creeped the thing into a fairly useful utility .
Then it was my time to move on to another project .
I trained the newbie they hired on how it worked , what made it tick under the hood , the database , all its tables , etc .
Even the script that [ re ] created the database from scratch .
After all , you always do these things in a script , right ?
It was a ksh script that looked something like this :
#!/bin/ksh echo " DO NOT EVER RUN THIS SCRIPT - IT DESTROYS , THEN RE - CREATES THE DATABASE " exit 1 drop table ... create table ... ... # prime the database insert into table values ( ...
This particular script was also read - only , just to make sure that it was never run after people started using the system .
About a week later , everyone was running around , wondering , why are all the menus truncated ?
Where are all the bug reports ?
Wha .....
My boss asked me to look at it .
It took me one second to find the problem : the bug numbers for newly entered bugs were coming out at 305 , 306 , 307 , etc .
Between that , and the fact that all the menus had been reduced to their original default values , it seemed that the database had been recreated .
We went to the newbie to see what had happened .
He explained that he wanted to see what the database - creation script did , so he ran it .
When I asked how he was able to execute a read - only script , he replied that he made it executable .
I asked what he thought when the script printed " DO NOT EVER RUN THIS SCRIPT " and exited without doing anything .
The newbie said he saw that , but really wanted to see what it did , so he commented out the " exit 1 " and ran it again .
Then , when the users started complaining , he kept re-running the script to try and fix the problem .
We rolled back to the last checkpoint , and re-entered the few missing bugs by hand .
Thankfully , I had programmed it to dump stuff to log files .

Lendava to bid for European Capital of Culture title Lendava in the far east of Slovenia is making an ambitious bid to win the title European Capital of Culture for 2025 .
Slovenia 's Minister for Culture has endorsed the bid , saying that it represents an important chance to decentralise culture and spread it to small towns , not just to concentrate it in the bigger cities .
Campaigning proper will begin in earnest in 2019 but a conference has just taken place in the town to get the ball rolling .
Organisers say that Lendava will make the bid along with partner towns , citing Croatia 's Čakovec , Austria 's Bad Radkersburg and Hungary 's Szentgotthard as possibilities .

Plečnik chair sells for 40,000 Euro
A chair designed by Slovenia 's most celebrated architect Jože Plečnik has been sold at auction for over € 40,000 and returned to its original home at the same time .
Plečnik is usually associated with Ljubljana , having overseen the redesign of the large parts of the city in the first half of the twentieth century and his distinctive style is easy to spot .
However , he was also responsible for a major reworking of Prague Castle in the Czech capital between 1921 and 1934 and this chair was part of that project , having been designed to sit in the study of the President at the time , Tomas Garrigue Masaryk .
Plečnik actually had three of these chairs made but only one managed to stay in Prague Castle throughout the Communist period .
In fact , for a long time curators there thought that chair was one of a kind until a second chair was returned to Prague Castle in a bad condition in 2006 , and they were delighted when this third chair turned up at auction .

Blue skies 26 degrees , everything green its a very beautiful time !
Good Weather means enquiries
Its always interesting to see the corallation between good weather and increased enquiries for Slovenia real estate .
Over the past few weeks when its been cold and rainy enquiries were low , now people see the sun is coming back and the enquiries have risen .
Forget the moon !
We are ruled by the sun !
Success in Moscow
We are happy to report that our attendance at the Moscow Real Estate fair was a great success , we were the only representation Slovenia had and that proved effective .
There was much interest in Slovenia especially in the € 150 - €250,000 price range .
Many of the visitors to the Croatia stands were also coming our way so its good to know that many consider Slovenia as an alternative to Croatia .
Soca Interest Interest in the Soca region of Slovenia has reached the highest level in two years .
People have always loved this area for Slovenia real estate for its beauty but it seems people are really seeing all the benefits of this popular area and preferring it to other areas .
Karst Interest , new stone villas
We have seen a marked increase in enquiries for the Karst ( Kras ) region of Slovenia , we will soon be selling stone villas in a new exclusive development in Lipica , home of the famous Lipizzaner horses .
We will publish more information once we start the marketing campaign
Moscow Fair
We will be promoting 4 fabulous new developments at the fair as well as all our beautiful properties on our books .
As well as meeting all the agencies we work with and several we will hopefully be working with in the future .

Cloverfield Monster ( Video )
For all of you looking for the " Cloverfield " monster before the actual release of the film , someone has complied with your wishes and provided a video clip of the monster from the screening .
I believe this is actually a clip of the Cloverfield monster because it is being removed from YouTube due to " a copyright claim by Paramount Pictures Corporation . "
There would be no reason for Paramount to be taking that action if this were not an actual clip from the movie .
Spoiler alert :
Do n't continue reading and do n't watch the video if you are like me and like surprises .
I 'm not much into ' monster ' movies and usually find them silly and boring , but who knows , maybe the scary Cloverfield monster will actually be scary .
Naaa .

I wrote a first version of this posting on consistency models in December 2007 , but I was never happy with it as it was written in haste and the topic is important enough to receive a more thorough treatment .
ACM Queue asked me to revise it for use in their magazine and I took the opportunity to improve the article .
I posted an update to this article in December 2008 under the tile Eventually Consistent - Revisted .
- please read that article instead of this one .
I am leaving this one here for transparency / historical reasons and because the comments helped me improve the article .
For which I am grateful
Recently there has been a lot of discussion about the concept of eventual consistency in the context of data replication .
In this positing I would like to try to collect some of the principles and abstractions related to large scale data replication and the trade - offs between high - availability and data consistency .
I consider this work - in - progress as I do n't expect to get every definition crisp the first time .
There are two ways of looking at consistency .
One is from the developer / client point of view ; how they observe data updates .
The second way is from the server side ; how updates flow through the system and what guarantees systems can give with respect to updates .
Historical
In an ideal world there would only be one consistency model ; when an update is made all observers will see that update .
The first time this surfaced as difficult to achieve was in the database systems in the late seventies .
The best " period piece " on this topic is by Bruce Lindsay , et al , " Notes on Distributed Databases " , Research Report RJ2571( 33471 ) , IBM Research , July 1979 .
The fundamental principles for database replication are laid out in these notes and number of techniques are discussed deal with achieve consistency .
Many of these techniques try to achieve distribution transparency ; that to the user of the system it appears as if there is only one system instead of a number of collaborating systems .
Many of these systems took the approach that it was better to fail the system than to break this transparency .
In the mid-nineties , with the rise of larger internet systems , these practices were revisited .
At that time one started to give consideration to the idea that maybe availability was the more important property of these systems .
As a result people were struggling what it should be traded - off against .
Eric Brewer , Berkeley systems professor and at that time head of Inktomi , brought the different trade - offs together in a keynote to the PODC conference in 2000 .
Eric presented the CAP theorem , which states that of three properties of shared - data systems ; data consistency , system availability and tolerance to network partition one can only achieve two at any given time .
A more formal confirmation can be found in a paper by Gilbert and Lynch .
A system that is not tolerant to network partitions can achieve data consistency and availability , and often does so by using transaction protocols .
To make this work , client and storage systems are part of the same environment and they fail as a whole under certain scenarios and as such clients cannot observe partitions .
An important observation is that in larger distributed scale systems , network partitions are a given and as such consistency and availability cannot be achieved at the same time .
This means that one has two choices on what to drop ; relaxing consistency will allow the system to remain highly available under the partitionable conditions and prioritizing consistency means that under certain conditions the system will not be available .
Both require the client developer to be aware of what the system is offering .
If the system emphasizes consistency , the developer has to deal with the fact that system may not be available to take for example a write .
If this write fails because of system unavailability the developer will have to deal with what to do with the data to be written .
If the system emphasizes availability , it may always accept the write but under certain conditions a read will not reflect the result of a recently completed write .
The developer then has to make a decision about whether the client requires access to the absolute latest update all the time .
There is a range of applications that can handle slightly stale data and they are served well under this model .
In principle the consistency property of transaction systems as defined in the ACID properties is a different kind of consistency guarantee .
In ACID consistency relates to the guarantee that when a transaction is finished the database is in a consistent state ; for example when transferring money one from account to another the total amount held in both accounts should not change .
In ACID based systems this kind of consistency is often the responsibility of the developer writing the transaction , but can be assisted by the database managing integrity constraints .
Client side consistency
At the client side there are four components :
A storage system .
For the moment we 'll treat it as a black box , but if you want you should assume that under the covers it is something big and distributed and built to guarantee durability and availability .
Process A . A process that writes to and reads from the storage system .
Process B & C .
Two processes independent of process A that also write to and read from the storage system .
It is irrelevant whether these are really processes or threads within the same process , important is that they are independent and need to communicate the share information .
At the client side consistency has to do with how and when an observer ( in this case processes A , B or C ) sees updates made to a data object in the storage systems .
In the following examples Process A has made an update to a data object .
Strong consistency .
After the update completes any subsequent access ( by A , B or C ) will return the updated value .
Weak consistency .
The system does not guarantee that subsequent accesses will return the updated value .
A number of conditions need to be met before the value will be returned .
Often this condition is the passing of time .
The period between the update and the moment when it is guaranteed that any observer will always see the updated value is dubbed the inconsistency window .
Eventual consistency .
The storage system guarantees that if no new updates are made to the object eventually ( after the inconsistency window closes ) all accesses will return the last updated value .
The most popular system that implements eventual consistency is DNS , the domain name system .
Updates to a name are distributed according to a configured pattern and in combination with time controlled caches , eventually of client will see the update .
There are a number of variations on the eventual consistency model that are important to consider :
Causal consistency .
If process A has communicated to process B that it has updated a data item , a subsequent access by process B will return the updated value and a write is guaranteed to supersede the earlier write .
Access by process C that has no causal relationship to process A is subject to the normal eventual consistency rules .
Read - your - writes consistency .
This is an important model where process A after it has updated a data item always accesses the updated value and never will see an older value .
This is a special case of the causal consistency model .
Session consistency .
This is a practical version of the previous model , where a process accesses the storage system in the context of a session .
As long as the session exists , the system guarantees read - your - writes consistency .
If the session terminates because of certain failure scenarios a new session needs to be created , and the guarantees do not overlap the sessions .
Monotonic read consistency .
If a process has seen a particular value for the object any subsequent accesses will never return any previous values .
Monotonic write consistency .
In this case the system guarantees to serialize the writes by the same process .
Systems that do not guarantee this level of consistency are notoriously hard to program .
A number of these properties can be combined .
For example one can get monotonic reads combined with session level consistency .
From a practical point of view these two properties ( monotonic reads and read - your - writes ) are most desirable in an eventually consistent system , but not always required .
As you can see from the different variations there are quite a few different scenarios possible .
It depends on the particular applications whether or not one can deal with the consequences .
Eventually consistency is not some esoteric property of extreme distributed systems .
Many modern RDBMS systems that provide primary - backup reliability implement their replication techniques in both synchronous and asynchronous modes .
In synchronous mode the replica update is part of the transaction , in asynchronous mode the updates arrive at the backup in a delayed manner , often through log shipping .
In the last mode if the primary fails before the logs are shipped , reading from the promoted backup will produce old , inconsistent values .
Also to support better scalable read performance RDBMS systems have start to provide reading from the backup , which is a classical case of providing eventual consistency guarantees , where the inconsistency windows depends on the periodicity of the log shipping .
Server - side consistency .
We need to establish a few definitions before we can get started :
N - the number of nodes that store a replicas of the data
W - the number of replicas that need to acknowledge the receipt of the update before the update completes
R - the number of replicas that are contacted when a data object is accessed through a read operation
If W+R >
N than the write set and the read set always overlap and one can guarantee strong consistency .
In the primary - backup RDBMS scenario which implements synchronous replication N=2 , W=2 and R=1 .
No matter from which replica the client reads , it will always get a consistent answer .
In the asynchronous replication case with reading from the backup enabled N=2 , W=1 and R=1 .
In this case R+W=N and consistency cannot be guaranteed .
The problems with these configurations , which are basic quorum protocols , is that when because of failures the system cannot write to W nodes , the write operation has to fail , marking the unavailability of the system .
With N=3 and W=3 and only 2 nodes available the system will have to fail the write .
In distributed storage systems that need to address high - performance and high - availability the number of replicas is in general higher than 2 .
Systems that focus solely on fault - tolerance often use N=3 ( with W=2 and R=2 configurations ) .
Systems that need to serve very high read loads often replicate their data beyond what is required for fault - tolerance , where N can be tens or even hundreds of nodes and with R configured to 1 such that a single read will return a result .
For systems that are concerned about consistency they set W=N for updates , but which may decrease the probability of the write succeeding .
A common configuration for systems in this configuration that are concerned about fault - tolerance , but not consistency , is to run with W=3 to get basic durability of the update and then rely on a lazy ( epidemic ) technique to update the other replicas .
How to configure N , W and R depends on what the common case is and which performance path needs to be optimized .
In R=1 and N=W we optimize for the read case and in the W=1 and R=N we would optimize for a very fast write .
Of course in the latter case , durability is not guaranteed in the presence of failures , and if W < ( N+1 ) / 2 there is the possibility of conflicting writes because write sets do not overlap .
Weak / eventually consistency arises when W+R <= N , meaning that there is no overlap in the read and write set .
If this configuration is deliberate and not based on a failure case , than it hardly makes sense to set R to anything else but 1 .
There are two very common cases where this happens : the first is the massive replication for read scaling mentioned earlier and the second is where data access is more complicated .
In a simple key - value model it is easy to compare versions to determine which is the latest value but in systems that return sets of objects is it more difficult to determine what the correct latest set should be .
In these systems where the write set is smaller than the replica set , there is a mechanism in place that in a lazy manner applies the updates to the remaining nodes in the replicas set .
The period until all replicas have been updated is the inconsistency window discussed before .
If W+R <= N than the system is vulnerable to reading from nodes that have not yet received the updates .
Whether or not read - your - write , session and monotonic consistency can be achieved depends in general on the " stickiness " of clients to the server that executes the distributed protocol for them .
If this is the same server every time than it is relatively easy to guarantee read - your - writes and monotonic reads .
This makes it slightly harder to manage load balancing and fault - tolerance , but it is a simple solution .
Using sessions , which are sticky , makes this explicit and provides an exposure level that clients can reason about .
Sometimes read - your - writes and monotic reads are implemented by the client .
By adding versions on writes , the client discards reads of values with versions that precede the last seen version .
Partitions happen when some nodes in the system cannot reach other nodes , but all can be reached by clients .
If you use a classical majority quorum approach , than the partition that has W nodes of the replica set can continue to take updates while the other partition becomes unavailable .
The same for the read set .
Given that these two sets overlap , by definition the minority set becomes unavailable .
Partitions do n't happen that frequently , but they do occur , between datacenters as well inside datacenters .
Summary
Inconsistency can be tolerated for two reasons : for improving read and write performance under highly concurrent conditions and for handling partition cases where a majority model would render part of the system unavailable even though the nodes are up and running .
Whether or not inconsistencies are acceptable depends on the client application .
A specific popular case is a website scenario in which we can have the notion of user - perceived consistency ; the inconsistency window needs to be smaller than the time expected for the customer to return for the next page load .
This allows for updates to propagate through the system , before the next read is expected .
In this posting I have tried to collect some of the definitions and principles around consistency and availability models .
I expect this list to be incomplete , maybe even incorrect or lacking in subtlety .
I will continue to update this until it is more useful and complete .
Warren Buffett has been all over the business press recently suggesting that the very rich , those on the Forbes 400 list , are taxed advantageously to the rest of the workforce .
That it makes no sense that his tax bill as a percentage of income is lower than that of his secretary or housekeeper .
He is absolutely right .
It makes absolutely no sense that he , or I should pay a smaller percentage of our income than those who go to work 8 hours a day and have to save as much as they can to afford a vacation every year and stress out about whether or not they can pay their rent , mortgage or college for their kids .
Its also wrong that those who must live paycheck to paycheck find themselves paying the same amount of taxes on consumables as the super rich .
That 8 pct sales tax on life ’s basic necessities is real time cash out of pocket , a far greater percentage of income and much more expensive money than the federal taxes we pay the following April 15th .
I would be perfectly fine paying a higher percentage of income , both in federal income taxes and as part of a consumption tax on luxury items .
If Warren wants to buy or build a yacht for a hundred million dollars .
Nail him with a 10 pct federal tax surcharge .
If I want to buy a Gulfstream Jet for 40 mm dollars .
Nail me with a 10 pct federal surcharge above and beyond current taxes .
There are plenty of items , from jewelry to 100 k plus cars to 10 mm dollars or more first , 2nd and 3rd homes .
If you can afford to buy these kind of goodies , and choose to , cough it up .
Will i avoid the Gulfstream or Warren the Yacht because of the surcharge ?
Will I drive a used car instead of my new expensive Lexus Hybrid .
Nope .
You are rich when you know that money is no good unless you can enjoy it .
No one on the Forbes 400 or near by is going to let a 10 percent more increase in the cost of a luxury item get in the way of enjoying the lives they have always dreamed of .
The perspective that Hillary Clinton is offering that 250k in annual earnings qualifies you as rich is not only ridiculous but its a huge disincentive to those who work their asses off every day and have accomplished a salary that rewards their hard work .
It also will impact millions who can least afford it .
I will tell you who will suffer the most if a “ tax increase for the wealthy ” starts at only 250k .
The 50 plus year old executive who has spent the last 25 to 35 years working his or her butt off to reach a 250 k salary .
The 60 year old executive who is already scared shitless that their job could be eliminated tomorrow and that they have not saved enough for retirement .
Is that who you want to impact Hillary ?
Men and women who are approaching retirement already in fear of job security and their futures ?
Not a good idea .
Instead , go after those of us who are really rich .
I ’m OK with paying either higher taxes at my level of income OR paying a consumption tax on luxury items that cost more than the 250k threshold that Hillary thinks is the level of income that defines rich .
But my agreement to pay more taxes comes with a caveat .
Right now I hate paying taxes because I feel like I ’m giving money to a known crack addict .
However much you give , its not enough .
They will buy their crack , get a short term high and soon be back asking for more .
The federal government , whether in Republican or Democratic hands is the same way .
No matter how much you give , they are always asking for more , more , more .
Always spending on the ridiculous , without remorse and without the ability to restrain itself .
Just like a drug addict .
If you are going to raise my taxes , I want somethings in return .
Raise my taxes by 1 pct , by every 1 pct you cut federal spending .
Your choice of raising taxes on luxury items , or on annual income of 10 mm dollars per year or more .
Cutting spending means the government needs to raise less which allows you to raise the income threshold on which you charge this “ Forbes 400 surcharge ”
And I want 1 more thing .
I want transparency .
The way the government publishes information on money it spends , receives and owes is a joke .
No one in this country has any real knowledge of how much our country really owes .
There are so many hidden and unpublished liabilities that if our country were a public company , someone would go to jail .
The accounting data of this country is public domain information .
There is no reason why it ca n’t be published if not in real time on a government website , than at least quarterly .
Money coming in .
Money going out .
Money that is owed to us and from us .
It is currently being recorded somewhere , and someone has responsibility to collect it or pay it .
So it can be published .
Then every quarter , our federal government can publish an Income Statement and Balance Sheet according to GAAP principles .
It wont be perfect , but it will be a hell of a lot better than what we have today .
Without complete transparency , politicians will do what politicians always do .
They find ways to play with our hard earned tax dollars and to put a lien on our current and future earnings , and that of our kids and grand kids just so they can get elected and re-elected .
That ’s just wrong .
So if Warren Buffett wants the Forbes 400 Rich to pay more taxes , great .
Than Warren also needs to ask the two candidates he is supporting to do the same thing he would ask of any company he is investing in , show him accurate , up to the minute accounting data with transparent information supporting every number .
When that happens the government can take more of my money if they need it .
My guess however is that when the citizens of this country see how much we really owe and where the money is being spent , and the short and long term implications of our politicians spending like addicts , they may start voting for those who respect the value of a dollar .
Will your candidates agree to this Warren ?
I also have one more tax suggestion that I think will create so many jobs in this country that it really wont matter what else our politicians do .
If we really want to stimulate job creation in this country , take the same approach to small business with fewer than 25 employees that we take to Internet taxes .
Outlaw them .
No taxes of any kind on small businesses with fewer than 25 employees .
No employer payroll tax .
No state or local taxes .
No taxes on earnings .
Nada .
The business owners will pay income taxes on their personal income they pay themselves , but not corporate earnings
The only taxes they would collect and remit are sales taxes , the employee ’s portion of payroll taxes and of course they would still file personal income taxes on their individual earnings .
Today to start a business today is so frustratingly tax and paperwork burdensome that it requires hiring experts on taxes , state and local filings just to get started .
That is more of an impediment than trying to actually make the business work as a going concern .
It also pushes businesses underground so that they can operate on a cash basis and away from the tax collector .
I would rather have entrepreneurs think twice about their 26th employee than whether or not they think its worth the hassle to start up a licensed business .
Those are my ideas .
I have no illusions that any could actually happen .
UPDATE : For some reason some people seem to confuse the Luxury Tax of 1990 which put surcharges on minimal pricing thresholds of 10 k for jewelry , 100 k for boats and 25 k for planes with what I am suggesting .
Thresholds that low are not what I had in mind when i offered a 100 mm dollar yacht and a 40 mm dollar jet as examples .
For those who would rather conclude rather than ask , lets just say that nothing with a cost of under 10 mm dollars would be subject to a su
rcharge . .
And I will remind everyone that I would only support this IF government spending was reduced and transparency was introduced .
For some shocking reason bloggers who have linked to this post do n’t seem to comprehend the whole of the post .
Microsoft is trying to patent automatic goodbye messages , including " Have a great afternoon ! " and " Ciao , Harry ! "
Last week , the Redmond software giant tossed an application at the US Patent Office that demands the exclusive rights to a tool that lets you " automatically send a goodbye message when ending a conversation " over IM and VoIP services .
When you close your IM client , for instance , the tool could instantly send mini-missives to all your buddies .
And you 'd have free rein to customize these messages .
" As an example , the facility may select a goodbye message based on the identity of the converser , " the patent reads , in standard patent - speak .
" As another example , the facility may select a goodbye message randomly .
As another example , the facility may select a goodbye message based on other aspects of the conversation , such as time of day , length of conversation , mood indicated by the user , and so forth . "
The patent even describes what the missives might look like .
" Examples of such goodbye messages are : ' Have a great afternoon ! ' , ' Sorry , I have got to go ! ' , ' Have a terrific day ! ' and ' Ciao , Harry ! ' " .
You could argue that IRC clients have offered this sort of thing for years , but that has n't stopped Microsoft .
With their new patent application , Ballmer and company hope to eliminate rudeness across the net .
" Ending a conversation without first sending an appropriate communication or other content can sometimes be misunderstood by a converser with whom a conversation is ended , " the application continues .
" As an example , a converser may be insulted when the user terminates a conversation without saying goodbye or may consider it to be rude to end a conversation abruptly without a communication that the conversation is ending . "
Meanwhile , Microsoft is one of the leading voices calling for reforms to the US patent system . ®
Linux Ubuntu desktop users :
If you 're constantly creating " sudo " sessions in Nautilus ( or other applications ) , it 's very easy to confuse your sudo windows with your regular windows .
This often results in accidentally opening read - only versions of your system files — very frustrating !
A quick way to visually separate your simultaneous sessions , is to assign a different theme to your sudo applications .
To do this , open a terminal and type the following :
sudo gnome - theme - manger
Pick a new theme , and any time you launch an application using sudo , you will be able to clearly see the difference between your sudo windows and your regular windows .
Check out the difference in the Nautilus sessions shown above ( the sudo window is shown in brown on the right , and the regular user window is shown in blue on the left ) .
What other Ubuntu / Linux tips do you have ?
Let 's hear 'em in the comments .
Last Friday , the city of Chicago agreed to pay out $ 20 million to settle lawsuits filed by four former death - row inmates who said they had been tortured by police officers and subsequently wrongly convicted .
The four men were among dozens of black men who said they were tortured , beaten with phone books and suffocated with plastic typewriter covers while in police custody in the 1970s and 1980s , according to special prosecutors .
The stories of three of those four men , who were pardoned by former Gov. George Ryan in 2003 , were first told by John Conroy , a veteran reporter for The Chicago Reader , an alternative weekly .
On Friday , Mr. Conroy received a note from Jo Ann Patterson , whose son had been nearly suffocated in police custody in the process of obtaining a confession that proved to be false .
“ My son , Aaron Patterson , tortured by the Chicago Police Department , would not be alive today , I believe , without your articles about police torture in the City of Chicago .
You documented and wrote the realization of police torture , of which we will never forget .
You help save my son ’s life for which I thank you . ”
Mr. Conroy was busy dealing with a flurry of e-mail messages that day because on Thursday , he had been laid off .
The Chicago Reader , which had published his work for over 20 years , decided it could no longer afford to support his reporting .
Citing declining revenue and a need to trim costs , Alison True , the editor of the paper , laid off four of its most experienced reporters , including Mr. Conroy .
The Washington City Paper , another newsweekly owned by the same company , announced five newsroom layoffs as well .
THE boss of SABMiller , Graham Mackay , recently suggested that the big rush of consolidation in the brewing industry was over .
Like the bar talk encouraged by his company 's products the pronouncement was precise , certain — and wrong .
On Tuesday October 9th London - based SABMiller , one of the world 's bigger brewers and America 's second largest , and Molson Coors , America 's third - biggest beermaker , announced that they would get together in a joint venture in America .
The deal will create a huge operation with revenues of $ 6.6 billion .
The pair are teaming up to take on both Anheuser - Busch , America 's biggest brewer , and American drinkers who are showing a declining thirst for their wares .
Beer drinking in most rich countries is growing slowly or is in decline .
One estimate suggests that America might see spending on beer grow by just 1.5 % this year .
And the growth is courtesy of imported or small - scale craft - beer .
Rich drinkers prefer to tipple on premium ales or wine and spirits , so sales of the mass - market varieties are suffering .
By drawing together SABMiller and Molson Coors will be better placed in the bar brawl against Anheuser - Busch , which has nabbed around half of the American beer market and which pumps out 102.6 m barrels of beer a year .
MillerCoors , as the new venture will be known , will command some 29 % of the American beer market .
Apart from the chance to cut costs by an expected $ 500 m a year , MillerCoors expects to be more competitive in the costly price wars against Anheuser - Busch and its flagship Budweiser brand .
Beer is a largely a local business .
Faced with the prospect of dwindling sales in established markets brewers first consolidated to cut costs in their home countries , then went abroad in search of markets where growth at a decent clip was still possible , namely in Latin America , Asia , Eastern Europe and Africa .
In the last round of consolidation in 2004 - 05 SABMiller snapped up Grupo Empresarial Bavaria , South America 's second - largest brewer , and Belgium 's Interbrew created the world 's leading beermaker by volume , InBev , with its purchase of Brazil 's AmBev .
Anheuser - Busch also won a savage battle against SABMiller to buy Harbin , a leading Chinese brewer in the world 's leading beer market .
Since then the big brewers have picked off smaller targets around the world .
While competition is often fierce in these new markets and margins thin , analysts expect to see more robust growth .
And as drinkers in these countries get richer the brewers will hope to wean them onto more profitable imported drinks .
The deal between SABMiller and Molson Coors indicates that other attempted strategies to wring more cash out of the beermaking have not proved successful .
Despite some forays abroad Anheuser - Busch has largely eschewed spreading beyond its home market , still relying on America for 80 % of its profits .
And in 2002 when SAB , a South African brewer , bought America 's Miller for $ 5.6 billion it was with the intention of taking on Anheuser - Busch in its own back yard .
That has not proved a success for SABMiller .
Its new ally , Molson Coors , has a better record selling premium craft - beers , one area where the market is growing .
SABMiller has been sniffy about their prospects in the past .
But then that company is stumping up 58 % of the assets for the new business whereas control will be split 50 - 50 .
And Molson Coors will provide the chairman and chief executive for the new venture .
Even if this is a sign of failure in America at least SABMiller has a thriving worldwide business to fall back on .
In America the battle between Anheuser - Busch and MillerCoors is likely to intensify in years to come .
And Anheuser - Busch has nowhere to run , unless you believe the pub talk that is : that a tie - up with Inbev is now on the cards .

New Yorker article points to advanced US preparations for war on Iran
By Peter Symonds
3 October 2007
A lengthy article by veteran journalist Seymour Hersh published in the New Yorker on Sunday provides further confirmation of the Bush administration ’s well - developed military and political preparations for attacking Iran .
According to Hersh , the Pentagon has drawn up new war plans , the CIA has allocated substantial extra resources and the White House has already sounded out US allies , including Israel , Britain and Australia , for support in any military strike .
The article “ Shifting Targets : The Administration ’s plan for Iran ” focusses on the changing pretext for war : from allegations that Tehran is building a nuclear bomb to a new propaganda campaign claiming that Iran is arming , training and supporting insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan who are killing US troops .
The cynical ease with which the White House has switched from one unsubstantiated claim to another underscores the fact that a US attack will have nothing to do with any threat posed by Iran , but will aim at furthering US ambitions for the domination of the resource - rich region .
Like the lies that were used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration is casting around for a casus belli to try to stampede public opinion behind an attack on Iran .
At the same time , however , the White House confronts deep - seated suspicion , hostility and opposition — in the US and internationally — to any new US military adventure .
Hersh told CNN on Sunday : “ The name of the game used to be , they ’re a nuclear threat ...
Sort of the same game we had before the war in Iraq .
And what ’s happened is in the last few months , they ’ve come to the realisation they ’re not selling it .
It is n’t working ...
So they switched really . ”
According to Hersh , the new bombing plan targets the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp ( IRGC ) , which Washington alleges has been assisting Shiite militias in Iraq .
“ The strategy calls for the use of sea - launched cruise missiles and more precisely targetted ground attacks and bombing strikes , including plans to destroy the most important Revolutionary Guard training camps , supply depots , and command and control facilities , ” he wrote in the New Yorker .
A former senior American intelligence official told Hersh : “ [ Vice President Dick ]
Cheney ’s option is now for a fast in and out — for surgical strikes .
The Navy ’s planes , ships , and cruise missiles are in place in the Gulf and operating daily .
They ’ve got everything they need — even AWACS are in place and the targets in Iran have been programmed .
The Navy is flying FA - 18 missions every day in the Gulf . ”
Hersh also cited a Pentagon consultant who explained that the air war would be accompanied by “ short , sharp incursions ” by Special Forces units against suspected Iranian training sites .
“ Cheney is devoted to this , no question , ” he said .
Ominously , the consultant also explained that while the initial bombing campaign might be limited , there was an “ escalation special ” that could also include attacks on Iran ’s ally Syria , as well as against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon .
“ [ A ] dd - ons are always there in strike planning , ” he said .
In the early northern summer , Hersh reports in the New Yorker , President Bush told Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador to Iraq , via a secure videoconference that he was thinking of attacking Iranian targets across the border and that the British “ were on board ” .
Bush concluded by instructing Crocker to tell Iran to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution .
In a separate interview with DemocracyNow , Hersh admitted that Bush had been even blunter .
“ The President was very clear that he is interested in going across the border and whacking the Iranians , ” he said .
The New Yorker article presents the new war plans as limited , precision strikes against specific IRGC targets , but such acts of aggression always entail the danger of rapid escalation into all - out war for which military planners prepare .
Moreover , other recent articles in the British press have pointed to a discussion in Washington of a far more extensive “ shock and awe ” bombardment aimed at levelling Iran ’s military , industrial capacity , transport and communications .
As Hersh acknowledged in an interview with DemocracyNow , a limited military strike appeared to be a tactical factional compromise in the White House between Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who has previously advocated extended diplomatic moves .
“ She [ Rice ] favours a limited bombing , so I hear , ” Hersh said .
“ If you want to really get a dark scenario , Cheney has gone along with the limited bombing .
Basically , they call the limited bombing the third option , because there ’s one option to do nothing , the other is to bring in the Air Force and rake ... everything . ”
Not only the military , but the CIA has now made Iran the top priority .
A recently retired CIA official explained : “ They ’re moving everybody to the Iran desk .
They ’re dragging in a lot of analysts and ramping up everything .
It ’s just like the fall of 2002 [ prior to the invasion of Iraq ] ...
The guys now running the Iranian program have limited direct experience with Iran .
In the event of an attack , how will the Iranians react ?
They will react , and the Administration has not thought it all the way through . ”
Hersh told CNN that the CIA has established “ something called the Iranian Operations Group .
We had the same kind of a group for the Iraq war ...
It ’s suddenly exploded in manpower .
And they have been going around , just dragging a dozen people here , a dozen there .
They built it up into a large , large operational group . ”
He also explained that “ the National Security Council inside the White House is focussed much more on attacking Iran and what ’s going on in Iran than it has been before . ”
Diplomatic feelers have already been put out to a number of countries .
But as Hersh explained , even among close US allies there is scepticism and resistance .
One of the reasons for scaling back the attack plans and shifting emphasis is to secure backing in Europe in particular , where few believe that Iran will have the capacity to construct a nuclear bomb , even if it wanted to , in less than five years .
Plans for a strike have received the “ most positive reception ” from the British government .
Hersh explained to CNN that the White House had received “ expressions of interest ” from Australia and other countries .
While backing the strikes , Israel is still insisting on a more extensive war that includes the destruction of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The Bush administration ’s new justification for war is just as riddled with holes as the previous one .
Beyond repeated bald assertions that Iran is helping to kill US troops and lurid stories fed to a compliant American media about the sinister activities of the IRGC ’s elite Quds Force in Iraq , the only publicly presented “ evidence ” has been the occasional display of Iranian manufactured weapons .
No attempt has been made to rule out other obvious sources for such arms , including the region ’s extensive blackmarket in weapons and the huge stockpiles of arms that existed in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion .
In his interview with DemocracyNow , Hersh pointed to the scepticism in US military and intelligence circles over the Bush administration ’s claims .
“ There is a tremendous dispute about all of those assertions inside the American government .
There ’s just a lot of questions about it inside the government .
They do n’t see the case as being nearly as strong as the White House is saying in public , ” he said .
Some of the most telling comments have been those of David Kay , former CIA adviser , UN weapons inspector and the man who headed the large US team hunting for evidence of WMDs following the 2003 invasion .
Even though he was a vigorous proponent of the pre-invasion lies about Iraqi WMDs , Kay was forced to conclude that Saddam Hussein ’s regime had no biological , nuclear or chemical weapons , their precursors or any plans for their future construction .
To deflect attention from the lies concocted by the Bush administration , Kay attributed his findings to a massive “ intelligence failure ” .
Kay told Hersh that his inspection teams had been astonished , in the aftermath of the two Iraq wars , by “ the huge amounts of arms ” it had found .
“ He recalled seeing stockpiles of explosively formed penetrators , as well as charges that had been recovered from unexploded cluster bombs .
Arms also had been supplied years ago by the Iranians to their Shiite allies in southern Iraq , ” Hersh explained .
The existence of “ stockpiles of explosively formed penetrators ” or EFPs , is particularly significant as one of the Pentagon ’s chief accusations is that Tehran is currently supplying EFPs to Iraqi insurgents .
It raises the possibility that these weapons were looted during the US invasion and obtained by militias , either directly or through the blackmarket .
Commenting on Bush ’s campaign , Kay told Hersh : “ When the White House started its anti-Iran campaign six months ago , I thought it was all craziness . ”
Even as he repeats the current White House line , Kay is cautious in his assessment : “ Now it looks like there is some selective smuggling by Iran , but much of it has been in response to American pressure and American threats — more a shot across the bow sort of thing , to let Washington know that it was not going to get away with its threats so freely .
Iran is not giving the Iraqis the good stuff — the anti-aircraft missiles that can shoot down American planes and its advanced anti-tank weapons . ”
Well aware of public scepticism , Patrick Clawson , from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , advised the Bush administration to provide some evidence for its increasingly improbable claims .
“ If you are going to attack , you have to prepare the groundwork , and you have to be prepared to show some evidence , ” he told Hersh .
Clawson also cautioned that an attack on Iran could compound US problems in Iraq , where it relies on a government headed by Shiite parties with longstanding ties to Tehran .
“ What is the attitude of Iraq going to be if we hit Iran ?
Such an attack would put a strain on the Iraqi government , ” he said .
Hersh noted that the Bush administration would not be deterred from war by the potential impact on the Republican Party .
A former intelligence official explained : “ There is a desperate attempt by Cheney et al. to bring military action to Iran as soon as possible .
Meanwhile the politicians are saying , ‘ You ca n’t do it , because every Republican is going to be defeated , and we ’re only one fact from going over the cliff in Iraq . ’
But Cheney does n’t give a rat ’s ass about the Republican worries , and neither does the President . ”
The New Yorker article explained that the Bush administrated planned to counter any objections from the Democrats by pointing to the record of the Clinton administration in unilaterally bombing Afghanistan , Sudan and Iraq during the 1990s .
But there is already ample evidence that the Democrats would support a new war on Iran .
The main Democratic presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards — have already declared that all options are on the table .
A majority of Democrats supported a Senate amendment last week calling on the administration to provocatively declare the entire 125,000 - strong Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a “ terrorist organisation ” .
Even the support of the Democrats , however , will not halt the eruption of mass antiwar opposition .
To energise its own rightwing base , the Bush administration desperately needs to goad the Iranian regime into a confrontation , or , failing that , to concoct an incident that can be blamed on Tehran .
Asked about his assessment of the new US war plans , a retired four - star general candidly told Hersh that the revised bombing plan “ could work — if it ’s in response to an Iranian attack .
The British may want to do it to get even , but the more reasonable people are saying , ‘ Let ’s do it if the Iranians stage a cross - border attack inside Iraq . ’
It ’s got to be ten dead American soldiers and four burned trucks . ”
All of Hersh ’s sources stressed that the President had not yet issued a final , formal “ execute order ” .
But in emphasising that the US military is not about to attack Iran tomorrow , their comments only confirm that the administration ’s plans for war are far advanced and can be executed at short notice .

Google “ improve brain power ” and you ’ll find all sorts of tips , techniques , books , and games explaining how you could improve your brain power .
Most of them involve physical exercise , balanced nutrition and complex mental exercises .
While it would be cool if everyone could incorporate these tips , I highly doubt that after reading such advice you will start jogging for one hour every morning and change your diet to incorporate more fiber and omega - 3 fatty acids .
Some people do n’t do that even when they are at risk of having a heart attack !
For the lazy crowd looking to give a little boost to the brain functions , is there anything easier ?
Luckily yes .
Switch the side of your mouse - pad
Yes , it is as simple as that .
By switching the side of your mouse - pad you will force yourself to use your non-dominant hand .
This , in turn , will stimulate the neural connections between the right and left hemispheres on your brain .
Scientific research confirmed that people that use both hands equally have 10 % more nerve fibers joining the two sides of the brain .
Ideally you want to perform as many activities as possible with your non-dominant hand , but some of them might become cumbersome .
I tried to brush my teeth using my left hand for one week or so , only to find out that the tartar was building up .
Using the mouse with the opposite hand is something that you can easily integrate into your life .
During the first couple of days it will feel weird , and you might need to switch back when using programs that require intense “ clicking ” sessions .
After this adaptation phase however , you ’ll be navigating the computer just as efficiently with both hands .
Force yourself to remember things
Sometimes you want to remember the name of a song that is playing or the name of an old acquaintance that passed by .
It is right there , on the tip of your tongue , but you ca n’t remember it .
What would you normally do in such situation ?
Probably ask some nearby friend for the name , and upon the revelation you will even shout marveled , “ Oh yeah !
That is it . ”
The next time this happens force yourself to remember that name .
The brain can be stimulated just like your muscles and the more you exercise it the stronger it will get .
Do not limit yourself to remembering names .
Are you calling your mother to get the phone number of your uncle ?
Forget pen and paper – you can memorize it .
Try to look at the keyboard of your phone in order to create a mental picture of what the sequence of numbers looks like .
The worse that can happens is that you will need to call your mom again …
Play games that involve some thinking
You do n’t need to participate in the Mathematical Olympic Games in order to stretch your brain capabilities .
Oh no , games and activities as simple as sudoku or crosswords will already have a tangible impact upon your brain performance .
Regularity is very important here , so try to incorporate these games or exercises into your routine .
You could bring a crosswords book with you on the daily commute , for instance .
Personally I like to play a chess match every day before I start working .
It takes around 15 minutes , but it ensures that my brain gets a kick - start every morning .

ElGarlic : Spending your life waiting for the messiah to come save the world is like waiting around for the straight piece to come in Tetris .
ElGarlic :
Even if it comes , by that time you 've accumulated a mountain of shit so high that you 're fucked no matter what you do .
3 ) Did n’t we used to think it was a good thing when kids wanted to grow up to be president ?
Personally , I would love to be able to vote for a candidate who ’s spent his / her life preparing to serve the country as competently as possible .
The one thing we do n’t want is somebody who just lucks into the job and then does n’t even seem to particularly want to do it .
( Stop here and try to think of the name of a person who fits that description . )
The Democrats had a debate this week on National Public Radio — an extremely decorous affair without cameras or a studio audience .
The candidates were n’t even allowed to thank the Iowa State Historical Museum for hosting the event and the people of Iowa for , well , just existing .
It quickly became clear that The National Intelligence Estimate did Hillary Clinton no favors when it expressed “ high confidence ” that Iran had dropped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
It took no time at all for John Edwards to point out that Clinton had supported that misbegotten Senate resolution declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and proliferator of weapons of mass destruction .
“ Many of us believe that , ” said Clinton somewhat reluctantly , pointing out that a lot of other Democrats voted for it besides her .
( Sure , and if Dick Durbin and Carl Levin tell you to jump off a bridge ... )
However , a meeting of the minds did seem to evolve over the need for “ carrots and sticks . ”
Clinton called for carrots and sticks twice , and when Edwards echoed her , the debate seemed on the verge of a consensus that Iran is best handled with what , for variety ’s sake , we can think of as a vegetables - and - twigs strategy .
Cruelly , however , the moderators brought in a tape of the resolution ’s sponsor , Joe Lieberman , announcing that if economic sanctions do n’t stop the Iranians from messing with Iraq “ we really have to consider military action to stop them from doing it , perhaps by striking the bases around Tehran . ”
Strategically , this would appear to lie beyond carrots and sticks and somewhat closer to a really big log .
We have had these candidates with us so long now that their little tics and mini-panders echo like a dripping faucet .
How long , when the topic turns to trade , will it take for Edwards to mention that his father worked in a mill ?
When we move on to immigration , how many times will Chris Dodd point out that he speaks Spanish ?
What the heck is Mike Gravel doing back on stage ?
Did n’t we get rid of him 10 or 20 debates ago ?
Still , give them credit .
Nobody tried to compete to see who could get most hysterical about illegal immigrants .
And they all sounded as if they had been preparing for a long time .
There has been unrest in parts of Kenya where opposition candidate Raila Odinga has taken on President Mwai Kibaki in a presidential election .
There have been claims of vote rigging and demands for votes to be recounted .
Raila Odinga has been ahead in the count , but his supporters turned violent on Saturday when the electoral commission announced a reduction in his lead .
Mr Odinga 's camp has raised allegations that Mr Kibaki 's side may be seeking to rig the results .
In Nairobi's Kibera slum , people began attacking and looting shops .
Whatever the modest shops contained was carried off .
As the violence got worse riot police moved in .
People were chased down and arrested .
Anyone caught looting was dealt with harshly .

I mean , is this the craziest helmet ever ?
It looks like bogies could die of fright before being shot down .
Gazette and Herald ( Wiltshire , UK )
Fighter pilots get a clear vision
By Gazette Reporter
Futuristic new helmets will enable fighter jet pilots to see through their own aircraft , the Ministry of Defence said today .
The head gear being developed for the hi-tech F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter is being tested by MoD scientists at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire .
An MoD spokesman said : " Unlike other jet aircraft the JSF , which is planned to replace the Harrier , does not have a traditional head - up display
Instead the computerised symbology will be displayed directly on to the pilot 's visors , providing the pilot with cues for flying , navigating and fighting the aircraft .
" It even will superimpose infra-red imagery on to the visor to allow the pilot to look through the cockpit floor at night and see the world below - like something out of Terminator .
" This is absolutely the cutting edge of technology .
No other helmet will be able to do this . "
The head gear , currently at prototype stage , is being developed by Vision Systems International and Helmet Integrated Systems Limited .
Art Conrad has an issue with the commercialism of Christmas , and his protest has gone way beyond just shunning the malls or turning off his television .
The US resident nailed Santa Claus to a 4.5 crucifix in front of his house in Bremerton , in Washington state on the US Pacific coast .
" Santa has been perverted from who he started out to be , " Conrad said .
" Now he 's the person being used by corporations to get us to buy more stuff . "
Brain scans show we measure our success by others ' earnings
Scans reveal that being paid more than a co-worker stimulates the " reward centre " in the male brain .
Traditional economic theory assumes the only important factor is the absolute size of the reward .
But researchers in the journal Science have shown the relative size of one 's earnings play a major role .
In the study , 38 pairs of male volunteers were asked to perform the same simple task simultaneously , and promised payment for success .
Both " players " were asked to estimate the number of dots appearing on a screen .
Providing the right answer earned a real financial reward between 30 ( £ 22 ) and 120 ( £ 86 ) euros .
Each of the participants was told how their partners had performed and how much they were paid .
' Brain scan '
Brain scans showing high activation ( top ) and low activation ( bottom )
Neuroscientist Dr Bernd Weber explains : " One area in particular , the ventral striatum , is the region where part of what we call the ' reward system ' is located .
In this area , we observed an activation when the player completed his task correctly . "
A wrong answer , and no payment , resulted in a reduction in blood flow to the " reward region " .
But the area " lit up " when volunteers earned money , and interestingly showed far more activity if a player received more than his partner .
This indicated that stimulation of the reward centre was not merely linked to individual success , but to the success of others .
While behavioural experiments have suggested relative rewards may play a role in economic motivation , economist Professor Dr Armin Falk , co-author of the paper , said : " It is the first time this hypothesis has been challenged using such an experimental approach . "
The professor emphasised to BBC News , that unlike behavioural experiments , brain scans had " no cognitive filter ; we were monitoring immediate brain reaction " .
Congo is about the size of Western Europe and has an estimated population of 65 million people .
It is one of the least - developed nations in the world , with less than 300 miles of roads , most of them in poor condition .
In 1997 , Mr. Conteh recalled in an interview , he heard Laurent D. Kabila , then the country ’s president , deliver a speech in which he called upon his countrymen to rebuild Congo ’s infrastructure after the 30 - year dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko .
Mr. Conteh , who had no experience in telecommunications , said he was inspired .
He decided to build the nation ’s first GSM ( Global System for Mobile communications ) digital network .
At the time , according to Mr. Conteh , fewer than 10,000 people living in Congo — mainly business people , foreigners and government employees — had mobile handsets .
They paid $ 7 to $ 10 a minute to make a call , using an older technology .
Less than 15,000 homes had a telephone landline .
Mr. Conteh said he went , cap in hand , to the minister of communications to ask for the country ’s first GSM license .
In January 1998 he got it — but he first had to pay the government a license fee of $ 100,000 .
Over the years , and with little explanation , he said , the government , which is often terribly short of money , increased the license fee , first to $ 400,000 , then $ 2 million .
Since , at first , no Western investors had any faith in the country ’s mobile market , Mr. Conteh said he wrote the first checks to the government .
And he paid $ 1.5 million to Nortel , the telecommunications equipment provider , to help create his network .
To help raise the money , he had to sell his coffee trucks .
In February 1999 , Mr. Conteh introduced the Congo Wireless Network , with just 3,000 subscribers .
Throughout the early days of his company , Mr. Conteh faced challenges unknown to Western businesses .
Once , after equipment providers declined to send engineers to Congo during a dangerous time in the country ’s unending civil strife , he encouraged the citizens of Kinshasa , the capital , to collect scrap metal and weld them into a cellphone tower .
In 2001 , he sold 51 percent of the company to Vodacom , South Africa ’s largest mobile service provider , to get the capital to expand the mobile network to millions of Congelese .

They supported Hizbullah during the war - whether by free will or the constraints of the times – and Hizbullah promised them no end in compensation for their loyalty .
But now the residents of southern Lebanon say they feel abandoned by the organization that swore to rebuild their homes and lives .
' Admission of Defeat ' Hizbullah : Peres admitted defeat Ronny Sofer Hizbullah spokesperson cites vice premier ’s testimony before Winograd Commission as Israeli ‘ admission of defeat ’ in recent war in Lebanon .
Peres ’ office responds : Hizbullah twisting and distorting the facts as usual Hizbullah : Peres admitted defeat
Umm Qasem had just finished preparing lunch for her family on July 12th when a Hizbullah fighter burst into her home in the southern Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil and instructed the family to flee their home at once .
His organization has just seized two Israeli soldiers , he announced , and a harsh retaliation was expected .
Umm Qasem remained silent , and her family decided to stay .
Had she decided differently her fate would likely have been different .
During the war she lost two of her sons and her house on the same day .
At the time , she was quick to respond , saying that this was " deliverance in the name of the ' Sayyed ' ( Hizbullah chief Hassan Nasrallah 's nickname ) . "
But now , seven months after the war the rhetoric seems to have changed .
Umm Qasem , and with her numerous other residents of southern Lebanon are no longer afraid to question the necessity of Hizbullah 's action to kidnap the Israeli soldiers .
The critique is implied , hesitant , but outside Lebanon 's borders it is clear and desive .
A recent article in the London - based ' Al - Hayat ' newspaper focused on the issue of bringing different voices from southern Lebanon .
The paper shed light on the stories of residents who lost their homes and businesses , and who struggled to cope with the cold winter ; forgotten while Hizbullah focused its efforts on waging political battle against Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in Beirut .

' Deliverance in the name of the Sayyed , ' said the residents , is no longer the most popular saying .
Residents also told the paper they believed that after the Israel 's withdrawal in 2000 , they never believed they would see the IDF again .
“ The ‘ Sayyed ’ promised us that our homes would never be destroyed , and that our sons would never be killed .
We removed the concept of ‘ war ’ from out inner dictionary , and suddenly , war broke out , ” said Hassan , a southern villager , while standing on the ruins of what used to be his home .
Hizbullah corruption
And what about the compensation they promised Lebanese citizens ?
Hizbullah did in fact distribute some $ 10,000 in reparations to every family to rent a furnished apartment for one year , but this is not nearly sufficient and residents are still waiting for the compensation promised by the Siniora administration , turning their bitterness towards him .
Piles of ruins remain , and there is no sign of their impending removal .
Regional council chairman for the of Bint Jbeil area tried to explain : “ The reason for delaying the removal of the debris is an agreement by which Bint Jbeil will be built out of the same type of stone that was used in the past .
It must retain its character .
Qatar took it upon itself to rebuild the houses out the very same stones rather than give the money directly to the people . ”
But this is n’t the only reason for the tough criticism of Hizbullah .
The group , which is heading a political battle against Siniora ’s government in Beirut , is naturally less present in the south .
“ The ‘ Resistance ’ youth ( Hizbullah ) provided us with food and water during the war .
Thanks to the ‘ Resistance ’ , south Lebanon was liberated and we could hold our heads high among the Arabs , ” Bint Jbeil resident Um Hussein explained .
In the same breath she added : “ But we do n’t see them anymore .
After the war they forgot us and went to Beirut .
They forgot the south and started seeking power . ”
Others fear Hizbullah is discriminating against them regarding dispensing reparation money .
Haj Bazi , who was in Bint Jbeil during the war with his family , lost his home and two shops under his ownership .
Besides the immediate aid , he has n’t gotten any more money , and he sees both Hizbullah and the government responsible for the situation .
“ After the war , there was not a single one of us left who was n’t hurt in some way .
We looked death in the eye , and we ’re living with a great deal of suffering , ” he says .
He claims Hizbullah is n’t handing out compensation in a uniform fashion .
“ We would n’t have thought Hizbullah ’s leaders would hold onto wealth , but those left here have been compensated not nearly worth half of what they lost , ” he said .

Hizbullah spokesperson Hussein Rahaal completely rejected the criticism .
“ It may be the ( compensation ) committees have made mistakes , but we always correct our mistakes , ” he said .
Ali , who owns a candy and clothing stand , criticized Siniora and Hizbullah both .
“ The state does n’t know that there ’s a village called Bint Jbeil that suffered more than the rest .
None of them visited us .
We do n’t trust them .
A few opposition members ( Hizbullah parliamentarians ) came to visit but then disappeared .
None of them listened to our requests .
I do n’t know what ’s worse – the coalition or the opposition , ” Ali said .
He got $ 400 “ as a present for the store I lost ” , and he is n’t afraid to slam Hizbullah .
“ They have other concerns .
They ’re busy in Beirut , ” he said .
Funding Hizbullah ’s rivals
Bold criticism of Hizbullah and Iran ’s support of the Lebanese group was heard this week in Iran itself .
“ On the one hand , supporting Hizbullah is n’t just a question of monetary support , but supporting your brothers .
On the other hand , due to the poor economic state ( in Iran ) , many Iranians have started to think twice and wonder – how does Iran benefit from this aid ? ” an Iranian youth told London - based pan-Arab newspaper a - Sharq al - Awsat , under condition of anonymity .
Recalling the Iran - Iraq war , he said : “ Why are we determined to deal with Arab problems ?
I still remember when I was young , my mother sent me and my sister to the cellar so we would n’t hear the sound of Saddam Hussein ’s rockets flying overhead . ”
However , regarding Lebanon , it appears that there is more than meets the eye .
Experts and retired intelligence agents told Reuters that all the Gulf nations , and Saudi Arabia in particular , funnel money to radical Islamic - Sunni groups in Lebanon to strengthen the Sunni ’s stance against Hizbullah .
The experts noted that the funding started last December , to gather power against Hizbullah and “ as part of Saudi Arabia ’s effort to strengthen Sunni Islam in the developing conflict against Shiites in the Middle East and Africa . ”
“ Saudi money flows to radical Sunni groups with one sole purpose – to stand against the Shiites and Hizbullah in Lebanon , ” they said .
What is Iran ’s view of the matter ?
Iran ’s deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Mustafa told a - Sharq al - Awsat that his nation supports Hizbullah only “ from the moral and diplomatic perspective . ”
Regarding funds provided by Iran , which is suffering economic hardship , Mustafa explained that the aid was sent by individuals to Hizbullah , not through the state .
“ Iranians have always supported Hizbullah on an individual and volunteer basis , ” he clarified .
RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - A Brazilian judge barred a samba group on Thursday from featuring a Holocaust display and a dancer dressed as Adolf Hitler in its Carnival parade after fierce complaints from Jewish groups .

State judge Juliana Kalichszteim ruled the Viradouro samba group , or school , would be subject to a $ 110,000 fine for the float and $ 28,000 for the Hitler impersonation if it went ahead with its original parade plan .
“ Carnival should not be used as an instrument of hatred , any kind of racism and clear trivialization or barbaric and unjustified acts against minorities , ” the judge said .
Viradouro planned to feature a tableau of a pile of dead model bodies when it marches in the Sambadrome stadium on Sunday night .
The globally televised parades , led by virtually naked Carnival queens and featuring thousands of dancers and drummers , are the highlight of the celebrations in Rio de Janeiro .
The official script also said an actor would pose as Nazi leader Hitler on the float .
Viradouro officials said they have not yet received the judge ’s ruling and would decide later whether to appeal .
The Israelite Federation in Rio de Janeiro state was the first to object earlier this week and was later joined by the Simon Wiesenthal Center , a prominent international Jewish human rights group .
Some six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust , an extermination program carried out in World War Two by Nazi Germany .
“ A guy dressed as Hitler atop a pile of dead Jews , that ’s too much .
It ’s beyond the limits of common sense .
There is no way we could accept that , ” said Sergio Niskier , president of the Rio federation , hailing the judge ’s decision .
Viradouro officials have said the float was “ extremely respectful ” and was meant as a warning about the horrors of the past so that they never happen again .
The school ’s parade theme is “ Shockers ” and it includes floats depicting the shock of birth , the shock of horror and the shock of cold .
On Wednesday , another samba group agreed to remove the swastika symbol from uniforms that its dancers planned to wear in its Carnival parade about the predictions of Nostradamus after complaints from the Jewish federation .
The Estacio de Sa group also said it would drop a section of the parade named after Hitler .
( CNN ) --
Under fire for its treatment of a rape victim , the Saudi Arabian government on Saturday said that the woman had an " illegitimate relationship " with a man who was not her husband , and that both " exposed themselves to this heinous crime . "
Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim .
In a statement , the kingdom 's Ministry of Justice said it was " forced ... to clarify the role of the woman and the man who was accompanying her in this case and its circumstances " because of what it claimed were false media reports .
The 19 - year - old woman was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for meeting with the man -- described by her attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph .
The seven attackers , who abducted the pair and raped her , received sentences ranging from 10 months to five years in jail .
When the woman appealed her sentence , a Saudi court more than doubled it .
The Qatif General Court also increased the sentence for the rapists , to two to nine years in prison .
The case has drawn international attention , provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law .
Watch why official reaction has been muted »
The ministry has previously said the woman 's punishment was increased after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence .
She was convicted of violating the kingdom 's Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her .
The attacks took place in March 2006 , when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married .
The government statement said that according to the woman 's signed confession , she called a man on her cell phone and " asked to be with him alone , illegally . "
The two met at a marketplace , then rode in the man 's car to " a dark area of the beach , and stayed there for some time , " the ministry said .
The group of attackers " saw her in a compromising situation , her clothes on the ground , " the statement said .
" The men at this point assaulted her and the man with her . "
The woman knew that being alone with a man who was n't her husband was illegal , " and therefore she violated the covenant of marriage . "
However , the woman was engaged -- not married -- at the time .
After the incident , the woman and the man did not come forward about the assaults or press charges until someone contacted the woman 's husband " telling him what happened , and about his wife 's affair and adultery , " the ministry said .
" She then confessed ... the husband therefore came forward to the police and formally complained nearly three months after the incident . "
The woman and her companion " exposed themselves to this heinous crime , causing the crime to take place because of their violations of the pure Sharia ruling " -- the country 's strict Islamic law .
The case was handled through regular court procedures , and the woman , her male companion and the attackers all agreed in court to the initial sentences , the government said in a previous statement .
The woman 's husband told CNN earlier this week that " from the onset , my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime .
She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes . "
Asked about the ministry 's statement Saturday , the husband declined to comment publicly .
The woman 's attorney , Abdulrahman al - Lahim , has said his law license was revoked to punish him for speaking to the Saudi - controlled news media about the case .
Attempts by CNN to reach al - Lahim Saturday were unsuccessful .
Al - Lahim previously said the woman met the man at a shopping mall in order to retrieve an innocuous photograph from him .
He has also said the man was blackmailing his client and forced her to have the meeting to save her engagement and avoid embarrassment .
The woman 's husband did not find out about the crime until his friends told him the rapists were bragging about it in the Qatif community , The Arab News reported in its Sunday editions , citing a source close to the case .
Earlier this week , the woman 's husband blamed his wife 's treatment on a judge with a personal vendetta .
Al - Lahim told CNN that the head judge in the three - judge panel that considered the case was opposed to his client from the beginning .
Both said they believe the man forced the woman to meet with him , but said she was not allowed to present that in court .
The government has said that al - Lahim was punished by a disciplinary committee for exhibiting " disrespectful behavior toward the court . "
Under Saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery .
Al - Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing next month at the ministry , where he faces a possible three - year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch .

All About Saudi Arabia
By Humphrey Hawksley
BBC News , Washington
The US and UK governments are developing increasingly sophisticated gadgets to keep individuals under their surveillance .
When it comes to technology , the US is determined to stay ahead of the game .
Humphrey Hawksley 's data is captured by a camera in one second
" Five nine , five ten , " said the research student , pushing down a laptop button to seal the measurement .
" That 's your height . "
" Spot on , " I said .
" OK , we 're freezing you now , " interjected another student , studying his computer screen .
" So we have height and tracking and your gait DNA " .
" Gait DNA ? " I interrupted , raising my head , so inadvertently my full face was caught on a video camera .
" Have we got that ? " asked their teacher Professor Rama Chellappa .
" We rely on just 30 frames - about one second - to get a picture we can work with , " he explained .
Tracking individuals
I was at the University of Maryland just outside Washington DC , where Professor Chellappa and his team are inventing the next generation of citizen surveillance .
They had pushed back furniture in the conference room for me to walk back and forth and set up cameras to feed my individual data back to their laptops .
Gait DNA , for example , is creating an individual code for the way I walk .
Their goal is to invent a system whereby a facial image can be matched to your gait , your height , your weight and other elements , so a computer will be able to identify instantly who you are .
How you walk could be used to identify you in a crowd
Since 9/11 , some of the best scientific minds in the defence industry have switched their concentration from tracking nuclear missiles to tracking individuals such as suicide bombers .
Surveillance society
My next stop was a Pentagon agency whose headquarters is a drab suburban building in Virginia .
The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) had one specific mission - to ensure that when it comes to technology America is always ahead of the game .
Its track record is impressive .
Back in the 70s , while we were working with typewriters and carbon paper , Darpa was developing the internet .
In the 90s , while we pored over maps , Darpa invented satellite navigation that many of us now have in our cars .
" We ask the top people what keeps them awake at night , " said its enthusiastic and forthright director Dr Tony Tether , " what problems they see long after they have left their posts . "
" And what are they ? " I asked .
He paused , hand on chin .
" I 'd prefer not to say .
It 's classified . "
" All right then , can you say what you 're actually working on now . "
" Oh , language , " he answered enthusiastically , clasping his fingers together .
" Unless we 're going to train every American citizen and soldier in 16 different languages we have to develop a technology that allows them to understand - whatever country they are in - what 's going on around them .
" I hope in the future we 'll be able to have conversations , if say you 're speaking in French and I 'm speaking in English , and it will be natural . "
" And the computer will do the translation ? "
Opinion polls , both in the US and Britain , say that about 75 % of us want more , not less , surveillance
" Yep .
All by computer , " he said .
" And this idea about a total surveillance society , " I asked .
" Is that science fiction ? "
" No , that 's not science fiction .
We 're developing an unmanned airplane - a UAV - which may be able to stay up five years with cameras on it , constantly being cued to look here and there .
This is done today to a limited amount in Baghdad .
But it 's the way to go . "
In Britain we are monitored 24/7 by four million CCTV cameras
Smarter technology
Interestingly , we , the public , do n't seem to mind .
Opinion polls , both in the US and Britain , say that about 75 % of us want more , not less , surveillance .
Some American cities like New York and Chicago are thinking of taking a lead from Britain where our movements are monitored round the clock by four million CCTV cameras .
So far there is no gadget that can actually see inside our houses , but even that 's about to change .
Ian Kitajima flew to Washington from his laboratories in Hawaii to show me sense - through - the - wall technology .
" Each individual has a characteristic profile , " explained Ian , holding a green rectangular box that looked like a TV remote control .
Using radio waves , you point it a wall and it tells you if anyone is on the other side .
His company , Oceanit , is due to test it with the Hawaii National Guard in Iraq next year , and it turns out that the human body gives off such sensitive radio signals , that it can even pick up breathing and heart rates .
" First , you can tell whether someone is dead or alive on the battlefield , " said Ian .
" But it will also show whether someone inside a house is looking to harm you , because if they are , their heart rate will be raised .
And 10 years from now , the technology will be much smarter .
We 'll scan a person with one of these things and tell what they 're actually thinking . "
He glanced at me quizzically , noticing my apprehension .
" Yeah , I know , " he said .
" It sounds very Star Trekkish , but that 's what 's ahead . "

Yet many experts also surmise that while Mr. Murdoch ’s influence on the pages of The Journal is inevitable , it will matter less than people think , especially in the short run .
His primary business strategy in buying Dow Jones is to use The Journal and the newswires as a source of content and credibility for the Fox Business Channel , which he plans to introduce in October .

“ He ’s saying , ‘ I like this paper , I ’ve paid a lot of money for it , I think The Journal and its brand are a valuable part of my global strategy , ’ and he ’s not going to mess that up , ” said Anne K. Gordon , a partner at Dubilier & Company , a private investment firm , and a former managing editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer .
She said people who predict that Mr. Murdoch would intervene aggressively , in damaging ways , “ do not give him enough credit . ”
Ken Doctor , a media analyst with Outsell , a business research firm , said that when it comes to changing The Journal , “ I also think he ’ll go slow , at least at first , ” because Mr. Murdoch “ does n’t want to jeopardize the brand he ’s buying . ”
Even so , he said , “ I find it just about impossible to imagine that if he really wants to make changes , any agreement will hold him back for very long . ”
The tentative deal still must pass muster with the Bancrofts , some of whom have accused Mr. Murdoch of warping news coverage for political or business reasons .
It is impossible to describe exactly how the controls will work , experts say , in part because they know of no real precedent for the structure it puts in place , in media companies or any other business .
“ The agreement would be an obstacle to editorial interference , ” said Louis Ureneck , chairman of the journalism department at Boston University , and a former deputy managing editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer .
“ But it ’s not a firewall .
The composition of the special committee would be the result of negotiation and compromise , since both parties need to agree to it , and that invites political compromise at the outset . ”
Mr. Murdoch would also be able to set the editors ’ budgets , and he has talked of pumping more money into the Journal ’s news department , at a time when many newspapers are struggling and cutting their staffs .
Under those circumstances , any owner would want some say in what kind of coverage is beefed up in the process .
David Ritz , the veteran American spam - fighter , has been hit by $ 60,000 in fines plus lawyers fees after losing a civil suit that accused him of illegal hacking .
Sierra Corporate Design , a North Dakota business run by alleged former spammer Jerry Reynolds , sued Ritz for hacking and trespass offences .
Ritz was accused of conducting unauthorized whois and DNS lookups .
Edward Falk , another anti-spam campaigner and operator of the " Spam Tracking Page " , was named as co-defendant .
The complaint alleged that Ritz " hacked " servers owned by Sierra ( which describes itself as a specialist web hosting and internet services firm ) , obtaining confidential internal network configuration data ( using a zone transfer , host - l command ) and domain name information ( using whois ) before publishing that data on the net .
It was alleged that Falk assisted Ritz by republishing his findings .
The case was originally filed in May 2005 .
An injunction , which allowed Sierra 's lawyers to ask Google to purge its Usenet archives of " offending material " was issued in August 2005 .
In October 2006 , the North Dakota court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over Falk , a Californian resident , dismissing the suit against him .
The case against Ritz proceeded .
Hearings in Fargo last October before Judge Cynthia Rothe - Seeger resulted in a surprise 11 January ruling ( PDF , transcript with commentary ) against Ritz .
He was ordered to pay $ 53,000 in damages , a $ 10,000 fine for contempt against breaching an injunction and lawyers ' fees , which could run into tens of thousands .
It 's unclear if Ritz intends to appeal .
His problems do n't stop there because he faces possible criminal prosecution over the same supposed offences .
The case has sparked concern and support from the anti-spam community .
" He [ Ritz ] got prosecuted for using the same Unix tools that the rest of us use all the time to troubleshoot problems , admin our systems , and track spammers , " notes Reg reader Mark .
Supporters are urged to donate to a legal defense fund , set up to defend anti-spam activists against so - called SLAPP lawsuits ( getting sued for speaking out on a matter of public concern ) .
In a separate case Reynolds sued Falk unsuccessfully for defamation for calling him a porn spammer .
Falk had accused Reynolds of involvement with Netzilla , for a time the single largest source of spam on Usenet .
The published allegations led to the unsuccessful " John Doe " lawsuit against Falk in Reynolds ' home town of Fargo , ND .

Map Of World Happiness - A Global Projection of Subjective Well - Being
The first World Map of Happiness has been published by scholars from the University of Leicester .
The map is a global projection of subjective well - being ( SWB ) , taken from a variety of recent sources , and compared with related data from UNESCO , the UN and even the CIA .
Adrian G. White , of the University of Leicester in the UK , points out in his study that the search for happiness is somewhat intangible , but very important .
He notes that the US Declaration of Independence clearly points out " certain inalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . "
Philosophers like Jeremy Bentham pointed out in the eighteenth century that the purpose of politics was to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people .
A recent survey in the UK found that 81 % of the UK population agreed that the Government 's primary objective should be the creation of happiness rather than wealth .
One prominent UK politician argued this past year " It s time we admitted that theres more to life than money , and its time we focused not just on GDP , but on GWB  general well - being . "
So how do you quantify and research subjective well - being ( SWB ) ?
It 's true that temporary moods can sway a given individual 's response on a particular day ; however , levels of SWB can be changed by circumstances ( countering the idea that SWB is biologically determined ) .
The map is drawn with data extracted from a meta- analysis by Marks , Abdallah , Simms and Thompson , who published the Happy Planet Index in 2006 .
An overall satisfaction with life scale ( SWLS ) is extracted from their study , which calculates happiness based on life satisfaction , life expectancy and ecological footprint .
That is , it reflects the average years of happy life per unit of planetary resources consumed .
Adrian
White 's analysis seems to correlate well with data from other studies :
It is immediately evident that there is an effect of poverty on levels of SWB .
The map itself mirrors other projection of poverty and GDP .
This data on SWB was compared with data on access to education ( UNESCO , 2005 ) , health ( United Nations , 2005 ) , and poverty ( CIA , 2006 ) .
It was found that SWB correlated most strongly with health ( .7 ) closely followed by wealth ( .6 ) and access to basic education ( .6 ) .
This adds to the evidence that from a global perspective the biggest causes of SWB are poverty and associated variables .
It turns out that people in Denmark and Switzerland have the highest overall satisfaction with life ; these results were published in a recent New York Times article .
The Happy Planet Index site also has a world happiness index map - remember , their index includes the impact of their material lifestyle on the environment .
The link below the map takes you to their very nicely implemented interactive map .

The Happy Planet site has a nifty survey that you can take to determine your own HPI ; it takes about 5 minutes and is completely anonymous .

The US is the world 's second - largest producer of cotton
John Negroponte was defending ongonig subsidies on US cotton growers during a visit to Burkina Faso , in west Africa .
The country is Africa 's leading cotton grower , although it produces just 6 % of the amount of cotton the US does .
The region 's small farmers complain that they must compete against highly mechanised , well - subsidised US rivals .
They say American subsidies also serve to depress prices on world markets .
Mr Negroponte met Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore after arriving from the Ivory Coast .
He defended his government 's refusal to withdraw subsidies .
" We have clearly indicated that we are ready to reduce our farms subsidies on the condition that our European Union partners can equally make the same gesture so we can work together in this direction , " he said , according to Reuters news agency .
He said the US had worked to promote cotton farming in Burkina Faso by providing aid funds to finance increased production and marketing .
" We have worked with certain parties , notably the farmers , to see how to arrange contacts with American operators to place Burkinabe cotton on the American market - particularly the very high quality cotton that you produce here , " he added .
' Disappointed '
But critics accuse Washington of hypocrisy - of frequently demanding that other nations scrap protections for domestic industries under the banner of free trade , while only doing so on a selective basis itself .
The World Trade Organisation criticised Washington earlier this year , as it upheld a 2004 ruling in favour of Brazil , which had argued that US cotton subsidies were unfair .
The US said it had scrapped a number of payments and credits to farmers , but the WTO said they were insufficient to meet trade rules and it was " very disappointed " .
During the tortuous six years of the Doha Round of trade talks , which now seem to be in deadlock , domestic opposition in the US to cuts in subsidies for cotton farmers has grown .
Lawmakers from the country 's southern states have threatened to block any world trade deal that proposes major cuts to subsidies .
The US is the world 's second producer of cotton after China , producing some 40 % of cotton on world markets .
In a telephone interview on Wednesday , Mr. Christie said he chose Mr. Ashcroft and the others for the monitoring assignments because they had impeccable legal credentials and he knew and trusted them .
“ It ’s really important that the working relationship between this office and the monitors is very , very close , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t tell you how much work we do with these monitors . ”
He said he had selected Mr. Ashcroft to work with Zimmer , the largest of five companies in the criminal investigation , because “ I knew he was somebody who understands these issues and would be taken seriously by the company as an authority figure . ”
Mr. Christie has disputed accusations raised by Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey that it was a conflict of interest for him to direct large , no - bid contracts to former colleagues and friends , but he has referred those questions to the Justice Department in Washington .
Department officials said they had no formal comment but noted that the monitoring agreements were not given only to Republicans and that Mr. Christie ’s recommendations of outside monitors in other large corporate investigations had been praised .
Although he was a prosecutor in the Bush administration , Mr. Kelley has registered as a Democrat in the past .
Mr. Kelley , who has done legal work for The New York Times , did not respond to e-mail messages on Wednesday .
Mr. Samson and Ms. Yang did not return phone calls .
The dollar value of the contracts obtained by Mr. Kelley , Ms. Yang and Mr. Samson is unclear , since the medical - supply companies they are monitoring have not revealed those details , suggesting that they are smaller than Mr. Ashcroft’s .
Under the settlements with the Justice Department , the companies negotiate the fees with the monitors themselves , a situation legal scholars say has the potential for abuse because companies might be overly generous to encourage leniency .
According to James B. Appel , Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology at USC , LSD causes permanent changes to visual perception in lab rats , and I assume in humans .
However , my assumption might be confounded by effective dosage and / or compensatory strategies .
Unfortunately , there is n't much scientific research that looks at LSD 's pharmacology in humans .
Due to personal experience with LSD and based on my training in cognitive psychology , I hypothesize that LSD disrupts iconic memory , i.e. the visual mode of sensory memory , because , in the widely accepted information - processing system models of cognition , sensory memory is the next stage of processing after sensory input .
Iconic memory retains information for between 0.5 and 1.0 second , whereas echoic memory , the auditory mode sensory memory , lasts between 3.0 and 4.0 seconds , just long enough for working memory to grab hold of salient information .
In particular , working memory recognizes patterns and feeds distilled information to long term memory where comprehension processes take over ( i.e. the lexicon in the case of reading ) .
Regardless of whether attention is the result of bottom - up or top - down phenomena ( or both ) , sensory memory is a constantly renewed copy of low level perception .
Photographic memory occurs when iconic memory is precisely tuned and orderly to the extent that incoming visual stimuli do not rapidly decay .
As to what this mechanism must be like , it does not employ afterimages or normal mental imagery .
The human visual system is " hard wired " at infancy , and there is no hope for the full recovery of visual perception , as stated earlier .
Also , considering that occular dominance columns must develop before a critical age , it is clear that the foundation the visual system does not deal very well with insult .
Concerning the gradual extinction of visual tracers , this is probably due to attentional compensation provided through working memory , and is not the result of an increase in available visual information .
After using LSD , the representation of a visual stimulus in iconic memory is no longer governed by precise neuronal firing patterns , but is rather subject to whatever alterations has LSD wrought .
LSD is not neurotoxic , yet it does alter synaptic configurations .
In the early visual pathway , these changes are not readily reversed .
Thus , as goes the early visual pathway , so goes the quality of information in iconic memory .
Just as a photograph 's detail is limited by the lens , so to is the detail of a memory limited by perceptual fluency .
In conclusion , you can kiss your perfect photographic memory good bye forever the first time you take LSD !
One afternoon last winter , two ships lined up side by side in a field of pack ice at the mouth of the Ross Sea , off the coast of Antarctica .
They belonged to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , a vigilante organization founded by Paul Watson , thirty years ago , to protect the world ’s marine life from the destructive habits and the voracious appetites of humankind .
Watson and a crew of fifty - two volunteers had sailed the ships — the Farley Mowat , from Australia , and the Robert Hunter , from Scotland — to the Ross Sea with the intention of saving whales in one of their principal habitats .
A century ago , when Ernest Shackleton and his crew sailed into the Ross Sea , they discovered so many whales “ spouting all around ” that they named part of it the Bay of Whales .
( “ A veritable playground for these monsters , ” Shackleton wrote . )
During much of the twentieth century , though , whales were intensively hunted in the area , and a Japanese fleet still sails into Antarctic waters every winter to catch minke whales and endangered fin whales .
Watson believes in coercive conservation , and for several decades he has been using his private navy to ram whaling and fishing vessels on the high seas .
Ramming is his signature tactic , and it is what he and his crew intended to do to the Japanese fleet , if they could find it .
Watson is fifty - six years old , pudgy and muscular .
His hair , which is white , often hangs over his eyes in unkempt bangs .
During trips to Antarctica , he usually grows a beard or a goatee .
On January 19th , the day he moored his ships together in the Ross Sea , he wore a black , military - style sweater adorned with Sea Shepherd patches , and a rainbow - colored belt that held a sheathed knife .
Watson was captaining the Farley , a rusty North Sea trawler built in Norway in 1958 .
The ship , black with yellow trim , featured a skull and crossbones painted across its superstructure and , on the forward deck , a customized device called “ the can opener ” : a sharpened steel I - beam that is propelled outward from the ship ’s starboard side and is used to scrape the hulls of adversaries .
Watson ’s plan was to transfer as much furniture , equipment , and crew as he could from the Farley to the Hunter , in part because the Farley was old and barely seaworthy , in part because it was operating illegally and could be confiscated upon entry into port , and in part to ready it for a procedure that he called Operation Asshole — so named because it involved ramming one vessel into another ’s stern .
When Watson is separated from land , he tends to behave like Captain Nemo , which is to say that he does what he thinks is right , even if it involves a violation of custom or the destruction of property .
There are a number of rules belonging to civilization that outrage his sense of morality , among them the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , which asserts that sovereign states alone are the ocean ’s enforcers .
If such rules interfere with his agenda , then , as far as he is concerned , rules be damned .
This is particularly true when whales are at issue .
Watson believes that whales are more intelligent than people , and that their slaughter is tantamount to murder .
( He once compared their extermination to the Holocaust . )
The Japanese take a different view .
They have been hunting whales with a modern industrial fleet since the nineteen - thirties , and the more resolutely the rest of the world condemns their hunt the more adamantly their government seems to support it .
Watson maintains that if his opponents are forced to defend their actions in public they will demonstrate the untenable nature of their position .
A key part of his strategy is to force the issue .
Whaling is not banned , but it is not exactly permitted , either — an ambiguity resulting from political compromise and shortsightedness .
In 1946 , the world ’s major whaling nations formed the International Whaling Commission to manage the world ’s whale fisheries .
It did a terrible job .
By the nineteen - seventies , several species were nearing extinction , and by the early eighties the I.
W.C. decided that commercial hunts should be halted .
This is often referred to as the “ ban ” on commercial whaling , but it is more accurate to call it a moratorium .
Even so , several leading whaling countries declined to abide by it .
Whaling for the sake of science has always been permitted anywhere and without restrictions .
The Japanese say that they are hunting whales off Antarctica in order to ascertain when there will be enough to harvest for profit .
In the winter of 2005 , they killed more than a thousand , nearly double the commercial catch of Norway , which rejected the moratorium .
The Japanese fleet is run by the government - subsidized Institute for Cetacean Research , in Tokyo , but the institute has produced virtually no research of any regard , and all the whales that are purported to be under study are also butchered for the purpose of selling whale meat to the Japanese public .
Watson has a tendency to see things in their essence rather than in their particulars .
A diplomat might say that the Japanese whaling fleet is technically complying with the rules of the I.W.C. , and that to stop it one must first upset the status quo that permits the fleet to hunt whales .
Watson , who cannot be bothered with the legal nuances of international regulations , insists that the Japanese fleet is breaking the law , and that , because the I.
W.C. refuses to act , he and his crew must .
He calls his fleet Neptune ’s Navy , and he regards it as a law - enforcement agency .
Moments before ramming a vessel , Watson will radio its captain and say something that sounds very official , such as “ Please remove yourselves from these waters .
You are in violation of international conservation regulations . ”
At times , he loses his cool .
“ We ’re no protest ship , ” he once told an intransigent captain .
“ Now , get out of here . ”
His sense of urgency , his impressive ego , his argumentativeness , his love of theatrics , his tendency to bend the truth , his willingness to risk lives or injury for his beliefs ( or for publicity ) , and his courage ( or recklessness ) have earned him both loathing and veneration from those who are familiar with his activism .
Watson ’s celebrity supporters , some of whom he has come to know personally , include Mick Jagger , Pierce Brosnan , Sean Penn , Aidan Quinn , William Shatner , Edward Norton , Orlando Bloom , and Uma Thurman .
In 1995 , Martin Sheen travelled with Watson and other activists to the Magdalen Islands , in Quebec , to protest the clubbing of baby seals .
The group was threatened by a mob of angry sealers , and Watson was badly beaten .
“ He ’s one of the gutsiest guys on the planet , ” Sheen told me .
“ I am just so grateful to him for his commitment and his courage and his daring and his humanity . ”
Steve Wynn , the Las Vegas casino magnate , once helped Watson buy a submarine ( though it was missing essential parts and so could n’t be used ) .
John Paul DeJoria , the C.E.O. of John Paul Mitchell Systems , the hair - care - products company , has raised tens of thousands of dollars for Watson ’s campaigns .
Sea Shepherd ’s board of advisers includes Elizabeth May , the leader of Canada ’s Green Party , and Roger Payne , one of the world ’s foremost experts on whales .
Watson is portrayed as a savior in the fiction of Edward Abbey , the author of “ The Monkey Wrench Gang ” ( 1975 ) , a seminal book for eco-saboteurs .
The Dalai Lama has given him a written endorsement and a statue of Hayagriva , a wrathful deity who , according to early Buddhist texts , yells with a “ dreadful voice ” and “ subdues all demons and all evils . ”
Within the animal - rights community , Watson is treated like a demigod .
“ I think he ’s a hero , ” Peter Singer , the Princeton ethicist and the author of “ Animal Liberation , ” told me .
“ He ’s been prepared to put himself on the line to stop the abuse of animals in places where no one else was prepared to go . ”
Watson ’s detractors are no less adamant .
Officials in Iceland , Denmark , Norway , Japan , Canada , and Costa Rica have denounced him ; some have even called him a terrorist .
In the mid-nineties , Norway convicted him of attempting to scuttle a whaler named Nybræna , and he spent eighty days in prison .
“ He is persona non grata in Iceland , ” Kristján Loftsson , the managing director of Hvalur , Iceland ’s largest whaling company , told me .
Watson has made enemies of other conservationists , too .
For decades , Greenpeace has wanted nothing to do with him — a rebuke that is particularly stinging because he was a founder of the organization .
Last year , Watson resigned from the Sierra Club ’s national board , after feuding with other members about the group ’s policies .
He has been barred from I.W.C. meetings since 1986 , when Sea Shepherd scuttled two of Hvalur ’s ships in Reykjavik ’s harbor — an act of sabotage that many conservationists believe helped turn Icelandic public opinion against the cause of saving whales .
Sidney Holt , one of the principal architects of the whaling moratorium , told me , “ I think his involvement in all this is an absolute disaster .
Almost everything he has been doing has had blowback for those who want to see an end to whaling .
In too many cases , playing piracy on the ocean , and creating danger for other ships , is simply not liked . ”
Déja vu ?
Did n't this all happen last year with the Jack field in the Gulf of Mexico ?
In fact since the late hours of the previous day the media was reporting “ the largest world oil find in the last 20 years " .
Once again our energy problems were over , goodbye 90 dollar oil and so on .
On the morning of November 12th a friend called me saying that the largest oil field in the world had just been found off Brasil .
I then explained to him what the largest oil field in the world was like , and how implausible that information was .
Jack was a media stunt that mistaken an assessment of an entire layer corresponding to the Lower Tertiary with a single field .
Fireworks came and went , oil prices came down and went up to stay one year later 20 dollars above the price just prior to Jack 's announcement .
As of now it is unknown when production from that layer will start .
Last week the name was Tupi , a field found by Petrobras in the Campos Basin off Brasil ; with prospects of 5 to 8 Gb of intermediate gravity oil ( 28 º API ) and gas , it boosted the country 's reserves of hydrocarbons by 50 % .
A remarkable find ( for today 's standards ) announced again in a period of high prices .
It took some days for the dust to settle down and for a clear picture to emerge from the various and sometimes contradictory reports circling in the press ; something reminiscent of the lack of preparation by some journalists to deal with this kind of information .
What is it ?
First of all , does 5 to 8 Gb refer to oil in place or recoverable reserves ?
During the first reports the field was given as capable of producing 100 Kb/d , a number that indicated lower reserves making those 8 Gb sound like oil in place .
Later in the week the production target was given as high as 4 Mb/d then settling at 400 Kb/d , reassuring that the numbers given were in fact recoverable reserves .
Petrobras ' officials were stated as directly using those terms .
Is Tupi a single field ?
The information available at the moment and the quotes from Petrobras ' geologists point to that .
Tupi is either a single field or a complex of closely lying reservoirs in an area some 800 Km long by 200 Km wide of pre-salt rock formations under a column of water ranging from 2000 to 3000 meters deep .
What 's the oil to gas ratio ?
An important question , given the field 's depth the temperatures could be high enough to form gas , and most media reports refer to “ oil and gas reserves " .
It is likely that at this stage the company itself may not know exactly what 's this ratio and hence the large reserves interval given .
As for the production schedule , first oil is placed in different places in time by different media sources , but none points to earlier than 2011 .
There 's an obligatory two year gap to get the equipment from the current tight rig market and at least two more years to get commercial oil flows .
A possible calendar :
First drilling 2009 First production at 100 Kb/d 2011 - 2013 Peak / plateau production at 400 Kb/d 2015
At some point there were reports of production reaching 4 Mb/d , which were likely confusing the overall company targets with the field 's target .
Recent reports state a company target of 4.5 Mb/d and 400 Kb/d for Tupi in 2015 .
Khebab made the following calculations using the Pickering relation :
Region Parameters Max .
Production ( Kb/d ) World ( Small Fringe ) 0.0435 / 0.0418 260 - 390 Cantarell ( Mexico ) 2.1 / 11 1000 - 1500 Statfjord ( Norway ) 0.637 / 5.53 580 - 920 Ekofisk ( Norway ) 0.299 / 5.10 290 - 470
These numbers put in perspective what Tupi represents globally , at its peak the field will produce less than half a percent of the world oil production .
Even if the higher estimate of 8
Gb is confirmed , the field 's reserves represent 14 weeks of world oil consumption .
The Challenge
Nonetheless , with the information gathered Tupi looks for real and not just another media stunt .
A major piece of insight was published in the journal O Estado de São Paulo this weekend , were several experts were interviewed .
Tupi is a real technological challenge , lying in a geological setting never before approached in Brasil .
The pre-salt layer is found under water depths that vary between 2000 and 3000 meters , after which there 's a layer of 2000 meters of rock .
The salt layer itself is also some 2000 meters deep and only after that is found the reservoir .
Sketch of the pre-salt layer setting .
Petrobras is today exploring fields over 5000 meters deep from water line to the reservoir ; Tupi 's depth by itself does not frighten the world leader in offshore exploration .
The problem is the salt layer through which it has to be drilled .
Nelson Ebecken from the Coordination of Post - Doctoral Engineering Programmes ( COPPE ) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) had this to say :
We have to develop that technology . [...]
If that layer was onshore it would be difficult .
Imagine then at three or four thousand meters deep .
Drilling through layers of salt has been done in other places , but not at that depth , neither through such thickness .
At such depths , under immense pressure and warmed by the planet 's internal heat the salt behaves more like a fluid than a rock .
It is like drilling through jelly , a hole is opened but closes immediately after .
Well maintenance in these conditions can be problematic ; Edison Prates de Lima , also from the UFRJ :
The rock is hard but stable .
The salt is n't as hard but it 's unstable .
A difficult task , but at the reach of Brasilian engineering .
Giuseppe Bacoccolli from COPPE 's Laboratory of Computational Methods in Engineering put it this way :
I do n't see a paradigm break , it is another evolution .
But there 's a problem : cost , that grows exponentially with depth .
Bacoccolli again :
We may reach the conclusion that we can , but we should n't .
Defeating the salt layer implies a considerable additional cost .
COPPE has presently three hyperbaric chambers that allow to replicate the operating conditions at depths up to 6000 meters , were the equipment used in drilling is tested .
A fourth chamber that will be able to replicate operating conditions up to 7000 meters deep is being built , that will start operating by the beginning of 2009 .
Drilling at the mentioned depths has to be made entirely by robots operated remotely .
“ It 's like driving a Formula 1 car entirely from the pit box " said Segen Estefan also from COPPE .
Other problems include the thermal shock oil endures when it gets out of the rock layer , in the reservoir temperatures could be close to 100 º C and at the ocean floor crude meets temperatures as low as 4 º C .
The crude can create high density bulbs that block the flow to the surface .
This problem can be mitigated with pipe heating or insulation .
The pipes themselves can be problematic due to their weight in steel , making the experts from COPPE contemplate the use of titanium .
The question comes down to cost , as Segen Estefan puts it :
We are operating in the limits of technology .
The problem is cost , if it will be too expensive or not .
The first well drilled in the Tupi field cost 240 million dollars , a number that fell to 60 million in later field assessments .
A total of 15 wells were drilled through the salt layer with 8 of these reaching the hydrocarbon reservoir .
Giuseppe Bacoccolli expects the costs to fall even further to 30 million dollars per well during commercial operation .
Still a number that implies a base price of at least 30 dollars per barrel of oil produced , four times Petrobras ' present cost of deep offshore production and not factoring in equipment costs .
Bacoccolli thinks that the operations will require between 6 and 12 FPSO platforms , each connected to 10 to 15 wells .
Also according to Giuseppe Bacoccolli further volumes of recoverable reserves can be confirmed , depending on new assessments to be made on the remaining of the pre-salt layer where Tupi was found .
Conclusion
All things considered , Tupi seems a markedly different case from last year 's announcement of Jack .
Scrutinizing the information circulated by the media leads to a sound picture of a field buried at the current technological offshore exploration frontier .
Judging by the Brasilian academics ' excitement , cost can in fact be the limiting factor but not technology by itself .
A final question should be answered , was Petrobras needing this kind of media attention ?
In reality it does n't look so .
Petrobras is the most profitable private company ( of all commercial sectors ) in South America , posting almost 9 billion dollars solely in the first nine months of this year .
Current reliable world 2P crude reserves lay somewhere around 800 Gb ; given that :
a ) 1000 Gb of crude have already been produced and
b ) most reliable models point to a crude URR of 2000 Gb or higher ,
there are still at least 200 Gb of crude oil yet to find .
This implies that entire oil regions the size of the North Sea are yet to be discovered .
The pre-salt layer of the Campos Basin off Brasil , where Tupi was found , may well be one of those .

The Oil Drum : Europe
— from Salon
On Sunday evening , the New York Times published a blockbuster story based on the tax returns that Donald Trump has gone all the way to the Supreme Court to keep hidden .
He did n't want Congress to see it , he did n't want the Manhattan district attorney to see it and he did n't want us to see it — and now we know why .
He is deeply in debt and has paid virtually no federal income taxes for the last 15 years .
Last year he paid $ 750 .
There are no zeros missing from that sentence .
It 's surely coincidental that this big story hit just two days before the next big event of the presidential campaign : Trump 's first debate with Joe Biden on Tuesday night .
but you may recall this exchange in the debate with Hillary Clinton in 2016 :
I can operate almost any user interface .
After all , I have 33 years ' experience using computers and 25 years ' professional experience analyzing bad designs : I know most of the ways interaction designers can confuse or annoy users .
I 've seen it all before .
Or so I thought .
Despite my prowess at defeating complicated user interfaces , I was recently stumped by a simple dialog box .
I simply could n't figure out how to proceed , so I had to close the application and use another program to achieve my goal .
The offending software shall remain nameless ; it 's a nice piece of shareware that I enjoy enough to have paid the fee .
Also , a single developer serves as both the programmer and interface designer on the application , so it would be unfair to pick on him .
Where 's the OK Button ?
The usability problem appeared after I upgraded to the application 's newest release and wanted to save a file in a new image format .
As the following screenshots show , this brought up the expected " Save As " dialog box , along with a smaller , overlaid dialog box containing a property sheet with the image format 's special options .
The dialog boxes that appeared when saving a file .
The options window should have included a Help feature , because many of its options were rather obscure .
As is typical of users who do n't understand their options , I left the settings at the default values , particularly since I was satisfied with the defaults for those settings that I did understand .
This is as it should be : if you pick good defaults , most users can ignore any advanced options and simply proceed .
My obvious next step was to accept the default options by clicking the OK button to dismiss the options box .
Surprise : there was no such button !
However hard I tried , I could n't get the application to show me an OK button .
I tried saving in another format .
I tried rebooting first the app , and then the entire computer .
Nothing worked .
It was impossible for me to get rid of the active dialog box and get back to my " Save As " dialog box .
I gave up .
Defeated by a dialog box .
What You 're Supposed to Do
A week later , I tried the software again .
This time , for some reason , I clicked the Save button in the main dialog box without messing with the options .
Surprise again : this worked , and my file was saved .
Turns out that you do n't have to accept the option settings .
The software will apply whatever settings are active in the options window when you click Save in the " Save As " dialog box .
This completely non-standard GUI behavior caused a catastrophic failure in usability : the user ( me ) completely abandoned the application .
Having the user give up represents a usability problem of the highest severity level .
It 's only because I had positive experiences with several previous releases that I gave this app one more chance .
If I 'd been trying this piece of software for the first time , there would n't have been a second time .
Upon further experimentation , I discovered another way of getting rid of the options box : uncheck the checkbox marked " Show options dialog . "
This , of course , completely violates the design rules for checkboxes and radio buttons , which are not supposed to have any immediate effect when they are clicked .
Only after the user clicks OK should the system take action on any checkbox selections .
Respect the User Illusion
Once you know how to operate this user interface , it 's easy enough to use .
But of course , users do n't magically understand special interaction techniques , whether they appear in a software upgrade or a new application .
Most users know only the standard interaction techniques that all of their other applications use .
Users understand standard GUI rules such as :
One window at a time is active , and that 's the one you interact with , because that 's the one that has input focus .
The latest window to open is the active one ; when one window spawns a sub- window , you have to deal with it first .
You can change the input focus to another window by clicking within it .
( I did n't try this because I " knew " it would be necessary to specify the options first . )
Dialog boxes are dismissed by clicking OK or Cancel .
There are many more rules as well , and all of them have remained the same since 1984 , when the original specifications for the modern GUI were published in Inside Macintosh .
When you comply with these standard rules , users can focus on your application 's meaning , rather than the physical operation of the mouse .
There is enough complexity in the app's feature set ; do n't add to users ' confusion by making them solve problems before they can click a button or type data into a text field .
Figuring out which button to click and what data to type is hard enough .
One of the modern GUI 's greatest advances is the user illusion that the mouse pointer is an extension of your hand : you own the pointer , which has a certain physicality to it as you use it to manipulate objects on the screen .
Of course , all of this is only an illusion , because the mouse pointer is really under software control .
Clicking the physical mouse while the on - screen pointer rests on a picture of something is n't really the same as clicking an object .
However , you must retain the user illusion of direct manipulation at all cost , because that 's what makes users feel in charge of their computers .
Because there 's no true physicality , the user illusion is maintained by complying with the low - level rules for GUI object behavior .
Even the smallest deviation bursts the bubble and reveals the fact that users are n't really controlling their destinies .
It 's very disconcerting when the laws of nature stop working .
It blows away all that you thought you knew , and leaves you feeling weak and threatened .
Obeying design conventions and standards is the way to retain and strengthen users ' feelings of mastery over technology .
Solutions
Fixing this usability problem is easy enough .
There are four main possibilities , all of which operate within the standard GUI interaction rules :
Retain the current two - window design , but add OK and Cancel buttons to the options dialog .
( Although you should usually avoid Cancel and Reset buttons on websites , applications need Cancel because users sometimes experiment with alternate options , so they need a way to back out and retain the standard settings . )
, but add OK and Cancel buttons to the options dialog .
( Although you should usually avoid Cancel and Reset buttons on websites , applications need Cancel because users sometimes experiment with alternate options , so they need a way to back out and retain the standard settings . )
Eliminate the separate options box and show the options within the main " Save As " window using progressive disclosure : make options visible only when the user clicks a button to change options .
using progressive disclosure : make options visible only when the user clicks a button to change options .
Have users proceed through a sequence of dialog boxes , so that only one box is visible at any given time .
Photoshop uses this approach : first you go through " Save As " and specify where the application should save the file , and which format it should use .
You then get a separate dialog box to specify the chosen image format 's settings .

Photoshop uses this approach : first you go through " Save As " and specify where the application should save the file , and which format it should use .
You then get a separate dialog box to specify the chosen image format 's settings .
Make the image format options into a preference setting that users must specify in advance , before they issue the Save command .
This is dangerous if the options are important , because many users will overlook the need to go through a special step before issuing a command .
But for obscure options that most people will never need , the preference route works well because it 's less likely to distract or confuse novice users .
To summarize the four designs , the options can be presented next to the main window , within this window , after the main command , or before it .
The one - dialog design is my preferred solution , because it 's the simplest for the common scenario in which users do n't want to change the options .
Photoshop 's two - step design might be better if there are many options or if you need sub-dialogs to specify particularly advanced settings .
The Key Lesson : Consistency
The lesson from this case study is not how to design a better " Save As " dialog .
Depending on the circumstances , you could use any of the four designs I listed , or perhaps even design a fifth that works better for your particular type of data .
It 's easy enough to find out what 's best for your users and their tasks : mock up the leading contenders as paper prototypes , and test them with a handful of users .
The big lesson here is the need to stick with the design conventions that users know .
Whatever design you pick should work in the expected manner .
Do n't redesign the meaning of the vocabulary you employ to communicate with users .
You can put words together in new ways , as long as you keep using words from the standard language .
Just because a GUI uses a visual language of buttons , windows , and the like does n't change the fact that it's a language .
Changing the interaction design primitives has the same effect as writing in Greek to an English - speaking audience .

How do these two statements square ? :
" I was not involved in the deliberations over whether or not the US attorneys should resign ... "
" I know why I asked these United States attorneys to leave and it was not for improper reasons ... "
So , he had nothing whatsover to do with selecting which attorneys to get rid of , yet he knows why he got rid of them ?
Is he trying to say that he had nothing to do with " the deliberations " -- meaning his subordinates reviewed the cases and recommended these particular eight -- then signed off on it personally based soley on their advice ?
Either way , this does n't fly because the " performance - related reasons " excuse -- the only possible explanation other than deliberate poltical interference -- is bogus .

Photo Slider Tutorial
See an Example .
Requirements
jquery
photoslider.js
photoslider.css
Very basic knowledge of html & javascript
If you would prefer to have everything in one package , you can download the photoslider.tar.gz
Instructions
Step 1 - Pick Your Photos
First we need to start off with some images .
You 'll want these images to be thumbnails that also have a larger view available .
In this tutorial I 'm using a thumbnail size of 50x50 and a full view of 600x400 .
You can have any size for the " full view " but the thumbnails must all be the same size .
We 'll start with 4 thumbnails .
It 's worth noting that you can easily use the photo slider to query a server script to load the images .
If you want to see an example of this you can view my wife 's wedding portfolio .
If you examine the slideshow .js you 'll see it fires off a call to a PHP script " fetch.php " using image ids .
Step 2 - Import Your Images
Now we need to tell our photo slider which images we want to use .
Here we can either set them directly using the bucket hash or we can give it an array of image ids .
in the < head > tag
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " media= " screen " href= " photoslider.css " /> < script type =" text / javascript " src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" photoslider.js " ></ script >
in the < body > tag
< div class=" photoslider " id =" default " ></div > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { // change the ' baseURL ' to reflect the host and or path to your images FOTO .
Slider.baseURL = ' http://example.com/path/';
// set images by filling our bucket directly FOTO .
Slider .
bucket = { ' default ' : { 0 : {'thumb ' : ' t _0.jpg ' , ' main ' : ' 0.jpg ' , ' caption ' : ' Opie'} , 1 : {'thumb ' : ' t _1.jpg ' , ' main ' : ' 1.jpg'} , 2 : {'thumb ' : ' t _2.jpg ' , ' main ' : ' 2.jpg ' , ' caption ' : ' Trash the Dress'} , 3 : {'thumb ' : ' t_3.jpg ' , ' main ' : ' 3. jp g'} } } ; // or set our images by the bucket importer var ids = new Array ( 0,1,2,3 ) ; FOTO.Slider.importBucketFromIds(' default ', ids ) ; } ) ; </script >
If your image urls can fit into a pattern you can use the importBucketFromIds which uses the thumbURL and mainURL string to determine how to generate the url .
If you 're generating the ids it makes importing much easier .
If you want captions on your images set the caption in the bucket .
Step 3 - Load the Photo Slider
FOTO.Slider.reload( ' default ' ) ;
Optional - Slideshow
If you want to you can add slideshow controls , along with automatically playing on load .
/ /enable the slideshow and build the controls FOTO.Slider.enableSlideshow ( ' default ' ) ; //automatically play FOTO.Slider.play ( ' default ' ) ;
Optional - Preload Images
If you want the images to start pre-loading before a user clicks on them , run the preloadImages method .
FOTO.Slider.preloadImages(' default ' ) ;
Finished Look
Now everything is complete , so just load up your page .
Full JavaScript Code Used in Example
< script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var ids = new Array ( 0,1,2,3 ) ; FOTO.Slider.importBucketFromIds('default ', ids ) ; FOTO.Slider.reload( ' default ' ) ; FOTO.Slider.preloadImages (' default ' ) ; FOTO.Slider.enableSlideshow ( ' default ' ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Notes
If you change the thumbnail width , you will need to modify the this .
data[ key ] [ ' thumbWidth ' ] in the reload function and set the number to the total width ( width + border - left + border - right + margin - left + margin - right + padding - left + padding - right ) .

A baby born in sub-Saharan Africa faces a lifetime of health risks , but none more challenging than surviving its first five years .
A major reason for that is malaria , a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes .
Of the more than one million malaria deaths worldwide annually , roughly 90 percent are in children under five years of age and as many as 50 percent of the severe cases occur in babies under 18 months of age .
But new results indicate that a vaccine previously shown to be safe and effective in adults and small children can also be safely administered to infants , potentially dramatically decreasing their risk of contracting the disease .
" In endemic areas , and particularly in the high - transmission areas of sub-Saharan Africa , children under one year of age carry a disproportionately high burden of disease , " says physician Pedro Alonso , director of the Barcelona Center for International Health Research at the Hospital Clinic of the University of Barcelona , who led the new clinical trial .
" You need to get to them and protect them as early as possible . "
Researchers report in The Lancet that there were 62 percent fewer new cases of the disease among 214 infants between 10 and 18 months who had received the full three - dose course of the RTS , S / AS02A vaccine during this trial .
And among all infants from a rural area in southern Mozambique who had received at least one injection , there were 35 percent fewer malaria episodes .
" As a father and a grandfather , and not just as a doctor and a policymaker , I tell you that this vaccine can make a profound difference in our lives , " says physician Pascoal Mocumbi , a former Mozambican prime minister who also had served as health minister .
This " will save lives . "
The clinical trial is one of many being undertaken to assess the safety of the RTS , S vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .
Researchers say that it caused initial pain at the injection site ( the thigh in babies ) but that no other serious side effects were reported .
A previous study showed the vaccine , created in 1987 , reduced the malaria risk of young children between one and four years by 30 percent — an inoculation that lasted for at least 18 months .
The vaccine also protected 34 percent of men in a study in Gambia .
RTS , S works by fusing a protein secreted by the malaria parasite with a molecule on the surface of hepatitis B virus that the human immune system recognizes and attacks .
The researchers speculate that it works much like other vaccines , especially because the amount of protection conferred depends on the amount of malaria antibodies in the blood and malaria - recognizing , disease - fighting T cells in the liver .
Neither on its own is sufficient , however , according to physician W. Ripley Ballou , vice president of global clinical research and development at GSK Biologicals .
" There is something really important , " he says , " in having both arms of the immune system working . "
A large trial to determine the overall efficacy of the vaccine in children of all ages is expected to begin late next year , assuming results from ongoing safety trials continue to be positive .
That trial will enroll at least 16,000 children from as many as 10 areas in seven African countries , Ballou says .
It will investigate , among other things , whether adding a booster shot later in life provides added protection .
The good news is that the vaccine appears to be effective against all strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum , and those initially protected have not shown any rebound effects later in life .
" The vaccine does not seem to protect specifically against certain parasites , " says molecular biologist Joe Cohen , vice president of research and development for emerging diseases , HIV and vaccines at GSK Biologicals .
But " this is a question that we will need to continue to address in further studies and even probably after the vaccine has been implemented , " which could come as soon as 2011 if all trials go well .

But new results indicate that a vaccine previously shown to be safe and effective in adults and small children can also be safely administered to infants , potentially dramatically decreasing their risk of contracting the disease .
" In endemic areas , and particularly in the high - transmission areas of sub-Saharan Africa , children under one year of age carry a disproportionately high burden of disease , " says physician Pedro Alonso , director of the Barcelona Center for International Health Research at the Hospital Clinic of the University of Barcelona , who led the new clinical trial .
" You need to get to them and protect them as early as possible . "
Researchers report in The Lancet that there were 62 percent fewer new cases of the disease among 214 infants between 10 and 18 months who had received the full three - dose course of the RTS , S / AS02A vaccine during this trial .
And among all infants from a rural area in southern Mozambique who had received at least one injection , there were 35 percent fewer malaria episodes .
" As a father and a grandfather , and not just as a doctor and a policymaker , I tell you that this vaccine can make a profound difference in our lives , " says physician Pascoal Mocumbi , a former Mozambican prime minister who also had served as health minister .
This " will save lives . "
The clinical trial is one of many being undertaken to assess the safety of the RTS , S vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .
Researchers say that it caused initial pain at the injection site ( the thigh in babies ) but that no other serious side effects were reported .
A previous study showed the vaccine , created in 1987 , reduced the malaria risk of young children between one and four years by 30 percent — an inoculation that lasted for at least 18 months .
The vaccine also protected 34 percent of men in a study in Gambia .
RTS , S works by fusing a protein secreted by the malaria parasite with a molecule on the surface of hepatitis B virus that the human immune system recognizes and attacks .
The researchers speculate that it works much like other vaccines , especially because the amount of protection conferred depends on the amount of malaria antibodies in the blood and malaria - recognizing , disease - fighting T cells in the liver .
Neither on its own is sufficient , however , according to physician W. Ripley Ballou , vice president of global clinical research and development at GSK Biologicals .
" There is something really important , " he says , " in having both arms of the immune system working . "
A large trial to determine the overall efficacy of the vaccine in children of all ages is expected to begin late next year , assuming results from ongoing safety trials continue to be positive .
That trial will enroll at least 16,000 children from as many as 10 areas in seven African countries , Ballou says .
It will investigate , among other things , whether adding a booster shot later in life provides added protection .
The good news is that the vaccine appears to be effective against all strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum , and those initially protected have not shown any rebound effects later in life .
" The vaccine does not seem to protect specifically against certain parasites , " says molecular biologist Joe Cohen , vice president of research and development for emerging diseases , HIV and vaccines at GSK Biologicals .
But " this is a question that we will need to continue to address in further studies and even probably after the vaccine has been implemented , " which could come as soon as 2011 if all trials go well .
In the meantime , researchers are encouraged that the vaccine has proved especially effective in protecting the most vulnerable population : babies .
In conjunction with other proven methods — treated bed nets and DDT spraying , as mandated by the Mozambican government — it could slash malaria infections and deaths in children .
" We may be seeing the synergy that we would predict would exist between vaccination and other modalities of malaria control , " Ballou says .
And the vaccine may also provide broader benefits : " A vaccine acts as a magnet , drawing in multiple generations of a family for basic services when the children come to get vaccinated , " Mozambique 's Mocumbi says .
" When we protect children we are investing for the future of our nation . "

The metaphorical ink had no sooner dried on last week ’s skin cell - to - stem cell breakthrough than President Bush and his supporters took credit for it .
Echoing a celebratory White House press release , Bush policy adviser Karl Zinsmeister told the New York Times that " This is very much in accord with the president ’s vision from the get - go … .
I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that the president ’s drawing of lines on cloning and embryo use was a positive factor in making this come to fruition . ”
The message reverberated through conservative circles and reached a fever pitch in the National Review Online , where the Discovery Institute ’s Wesley Smith wrote :
So thank you for your courageous leadership , Mr. President .
Because of your willingness to absorb the brickbats of the Science Establishment , the Media Elite , and weak - kneed Republican and Democratic politicians alike — we now have the very real potential of developing thriving and robust stem - cell medicine and scientific research sectors that will bridge , rather than exacerbate , our moral differences over the importance and meaning of human life .
Now , there ’s nothing wrong with being excited at the prospect of embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) equivalents that do n’t require embryos to be destroyed .
And it ’s probably true that — thanks to Bush ’s decision to ban federally funded research on all but a handful of early ESC lines , and his subsequent vetos of stem cell research bills — a few would - be ESC
scientists ended up looking at alternatives .
But as Marcy Darnovsky , associate director for the Center for Genetics and Society and a longtime ESC research critic , told me last week ,
" Cloning - based stem cell research has not proceeded the way it would have if it had n’t been tangled up in the culture wars . "
Darnovsky thinks that all the controversy led scientists and a politically infuriated public to overhype embryonic stem cells and downplay the alternatives .
Take away the culture wars , take away the fight for dwindling federal money , take away the necessity of convincing states to fund research on their own , and embryonic stem cells would have been one alternative among many — promising , but not dominant .
So - called ethical alternatives might actually have progressed faster and been better - received , as they would n’t have fallen by default onto one side of a vicious ethical battle .
That itself is a controversial position .
But leaving it aside , Yamanaka and Yu’s wondrous skin cell - to - stem cell transformations would not have been possible without techniques and developmental insights generated by the very same embryonic stem cell research that Bush condemns .
Embryonic and non-embryonic pluripotent stem cell research did n’t take place on parallel paths ; it was intellectually interdependent .
As for whether Bush or anyone else should pat themselves on the back ,
Arlen Specter ( R - Pennsylvania ) told the New York Times , “ I really do n’t think anybody ought to take credit in light of the six - year delay we ’ve had … .
My own view is that science ought to be unfettered and that every possible alternative ought to be explored . ”

US broadcaster NBC has confirmed it is to remake 80s drama Knight Rider , which propelled David Hasselhoff to fame , following the success of its " reimagining " of the Bionic Woman .
Ben Silverman , the recently installed co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and the man behind the American version of The Office , announced today that a two - hour broadcast pilot of the new drama would air in the US during the February advertising sweeps next year .
Mr Silverman added that he had decided to bring Knight Rider back following the success of the remake of Bionic Woman , which stars former EastEnders actress Michelle Ryan .
The Bionic Woman 's launch two weeks ago gave NBC its best Wednesday night audience in eight years .
" I can announce today that we are bringing back Knight Rider after we looked at how well Bionic Woman did , " Mr Silverman told delegates during his keynote speech at the Mipcom TV market in Cannes .
When asked if Hasselhoff would appear in the new version , Mr Silverman laughed and said : " If the market wants it he will be there . "
Mr Silverman added that the producers would also be approaching the major car makers to come up with a new version of Kitt , the talking Knight Rider car .
" We get to do product placement in the States so we will be in discussions with a number of the key auto groups over who will deliver a new car , " he said .
The original Knight Rider ran for four seasons and 90 episodes on NBC between 1982 and 1986 .
Hasselhoff starred as Michael Knight , a latter - day knight of the road who fought crime from his talking car , the Knight 2000 or Kitt - short for Knight Industries Two Thousand .
Knight Rider was the brainchild of producer Glen Larson , who also created the original Battlestar Galactica in the 70s .
It was revived for a 1991 movie Knight Rider 2000 , in which the action was located in a futuristic city and Kitt had been replaced by the Knight 4000 vehicle .
A spinoff series , Team Knight Rider , featuring a host of different talking vehicles , aired in the 1997 - 98 season .
Mr Silverman also announced in Cannes today that NBC had bought American women 's cable channel Oxygen , which airs BBC comedy Absolutely Fabulous .

Two executives from Village Voice Media — a company that owns a number of alternative weeklies including The Village Voice , The LA Weekly and The Phoenix Times — were arrested Thursday night in Phoenix on charges that a story published earlier in the day in The Phoenix New Times revealed grand jury secrets .
Michael Lacey , the executive editor , and Jim Larkin , chief executive , were arrested at their homes after they wrote a story that revealed that the Village Voice Media company , its executives , its reporters and even the names of the readers of its website had been subpoenaed by a special prosecutor .
The special prosecutor had been appointed to look into allegations that the newspaper had violated the law in publishing the home address of Maricopa Sheriff Joe Arpaio ’s home address on its website more than three years ago .
The weekly and its leadership has been in a long running battle with Mr. Arpaio , after the weekly published a series of stories about his real estate dealings .
“ They did not have a warrant , but they told me that I was being arrested for unlawful disclosure of grand jury information , ” Mr. Larkin said by phone from his home early this morning , after he was released from jail .
Mr. Lacey remained in jail early this morning .
Captain Paul Chagolla , a spokesman for the sheriff did not return a call for comment .

Lesbian Gangs : A National Threat ? / Bill O'Reilly 's homoerotic fantasies go nuclear
I was chillin ' in the hood , kickin ' it under the rainbow flag with my homegirls , sippin ' a 40 and working up to find some schoolkids to indoctrinate and go teach some straight people a few lessons , when it hit me .
That square do - gooder O'Reilly had blown our cover .
His recent Lesbian Gangs segment on Fox News , where he exposed a national network of lesbian and gay gangs , had the world 's eyes spun in our direction like a chamber packed with one bullet , and all I could do now was spill a little Smirnoff Ice on the corner of Market and Castro for my fallen homos .
Actually , the segment was the funniest thing I 'd watched all week , and I wondered how Fox News had managed to borrow the Daily Show 's writers for some good 'ol news - as - fake - news comedy .
In the Lesbian Gangs segment Bill O'Reilly reported on the epidemic of lesbian and gay gangs he assured us is sweeping the nation .
Beginning with Dwayne Buckle ( " attacked by a lesbian gang here in New York City last August . " ) , then careening into a " lesbian gang " in Tennessee " called GTO : Gays Take Over " who are " raping young girls " and then to Philly , where " a gang called DTO " ' Dykes Take Over ' " are allegedly terrorizing people as well . "
This was lurid , exciting -- this was Weekly World News on airplane glue and Anal Eze .
But really , who will protect the straight people 's children from lesbian rape ?
There 's a new detective on that beat , and it 's O'Reilly ( finally proving there 's a reason detectives wear trench coats ) .
O'Reilly anchored his entire segment on the Dwayne Buckle / Lesbian Seven case , lest it be forgotten in the history of homosexual lawlessness .
Left out of the Lesbian Gangs segment were the case 's details : Buckle harassed seven women on the street in the East Village last August .
According to written statements by a community organization ( FIERCE ) that has made a call to action to defend the four women , as well as verbal accounts from court observers and evidence from a surveillance camera , Buckle spat on them , followed them , flicked a lit cigarette at them , accosted one of the women and pulled out her hair and told them he'd " f-- them straight . " .
It was all captured on video , video that , ironically , played in the background during O'Reilly 's piece .
Some of what happened after that is still up for debate ; in the end Buckle was stabbed , and four women have been sentenced to prison .
But after the titillating intro , Bill brought in a beard -- I mean , " crime analyst " Rod Wheeler -- a member of Jericho City of Praise , a conservative Christian church in Landover , Md. , whose leadership publicly advocates against equal rights for gays and lesbians .
This Fox Crime Analyst is an O'Reilly favorite , whom Bill calls , " America 's most recognized and trusted authority on crime analysis and law enforcement . "
He 's also a White House darling , whose wWeb site boasted a quote from White House Press Secretary Tony Snow saying , " We turn to Rod Wheeler to help us better understand and solve some of these terrible crimes in America . "
Southern Poverty Law Center tells us that Wheeler , when not talking about fantasy lesbian gang rape on Fox News , " spent seven years in professional law enforcement before going to work as a corporate security officer for McDonald 's Corp. , a job he has since left .
These days , Wheeler is a ' food defense specialist ' for the American Institute of Baking .
Just this spring , he publicly warned that the Big Mac is vulnerable to bioterrorist attacks at ' 250 points ' during production . "
But the heart of this segment , let 's not forget , is pure conservative porn .
With some very creepy , dirty - uncle - Bill prodding ( " when they recruit the kids are they indoctrinating them into homosexuality ? " )
Wheeler tells us that , " (...) some of the kids have reported that they were forced into , you know , performing sex acts and doing sex acts with some of these people . "
Now we 're talking .
This is the kind of sexual hysteria that conservatives can jack off to .
And as a porn connoisseur , the combined conservative sexual hysteria and titillation affected me like a psychosexual can of Pringles -- you know it 's bad , and will probably make your trips to the bathroom unpleasant , but irresistible in its junk - food nature .
I ate -- I mean watched -- the whole thing twice without even realizing it .
I was deeply disappointed that they didnt tell me what the lesbian gangs were wearing .
I was hoping for schoolgirl outfits , nun 's habits , or even cheerleader uniforms .
No , Wheeler dryly cited numbers claiming , " We 've actually counted just in the Washington , D.C. , area alone .
That 's Washington , Maryland , and Virginia , well over 150 of these crews or gangs or networks or houses , whatever you want to call them . "
But according to the SPL Center , " Gaithersburg , Md. , Detective Patrick Word , president of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Gang Investigators Network , an intelligence - sharing organization of 400 criminal justice professionals in Maryland , Washington , D.C. , and Virginia , said there is no evidence whatsoever of a lesbian gang epidemic in his region .
' Our membership reports only one lesbian gang , ' Word told the Intelligence Report . "
Sgt. Brett Parson , a member and former commander of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department 's Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit , also questioned Wheeler 's numbers .
" We have 150 to 175 total gangs in the D.C. area , and out of those only nine where the predominance of members are female , " he said .
" You simply can't make the jump that they are lesbians .
I think it is fair to talk about violence and female gangs .
But to sensationalize or marginalize a community by making a statement like that seems irresponsible . "
Confronted by the Intelligence Report , Wheeler was unable , in several phone and e-mail exchanges over a two - day period , to specify a single law enforcement agency or officer , police report , media account or any other source he relied upon for his D.C. area lesbian gangs claim .
But he insisted that his report was accurate and that any law enforcement officer who disagrees is " out of touch . "
Hey , I know that Fox News , like porn , is just entertainment , and should never be taken seriously .
But I worry about the women and children that are being exploited to fund this billion - dollar - a - year industry .
Fox and O'Reilly and Wheeler can make all these outrageous claims and prey on sexual panic because they believe that gays and lesbians are by nature discredited by their very existence .
Hiding behind Fox 's perceived authority , O'Reilly ( and the Malkins , and others ) can trample all the sexual minorities they want to .
Never mind that GLAAD has demanded Fox News apologize and retract itstheir unsubstantiated claims .
Or that blogs are frothing about the whole thing .
And never mind that the organization Pink Pistols , cited as a gang in the segment , is also demanding an apology .
Or that the Southern Poverty Law Center delivered The Oh - Really Factor , a superlative point - by - point rebuttal , showing where the Fox News fact - checkers decided to stop reading the news and turn airtime into Showtime - after - midnight fantasies about gay rape , lesbian attackers and pink Glocks .
Which , of course , I wish was the true part of all of it , because I really really want a pink Glock .
Okay , and maybe I wish there were lesbian gangs , too .
Hey , we all have fantasies .
I just happen to have the outfits , that 's all .

This is his first post for DANGER ROOM .
Everyone is freaking out , over this " spy satellite " that 's re-entering the atmosphere .
But the chances of there being any danger to people is pretty darn minuscule .
178 tracked objects re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere last year .
Of those , 27
were actual satellite payloads .
The vast , vast majority of the time , these objects breakup in the atmosphere from the heat of re-entry and only very small fragments ever reach the ground .
This video was taken last year of a Russian rocket body that re-entered over the Denver area and you can clearly see that what was once a solid cylinder is now just a mass of tiny pieces :
www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mhvkoxg1W4
However , occasionally intact pieces do survive re-entry and are found .
Here 's a picture of a Delta II rocket body which landed near Georgetown , TX in January 1997 :
It 's from “ The
Realities of Reentry Disposal , ” a paper on the subject that 's worth your while if you want to delve deeper into the subject .
The worst - case scenario is one where an object with radioactive materials re-enters .
This happened back in January 1978 when the Russian COSMOS 954 satellite re-entered over Canada and left a radioactive debris field strewn across a ( thankfully ) sparsely populated area .
But since then , a whole set of procedures have been put in place to cope with threats from above .
For everyone one of these objects , the military 's Joint Space Operations Center ( JSpOC ) predicts where it will impact the ground and notifies military leadership and in turn civilian leadership .
If it will impact over the United States or Canada , NORAD is notified along with FEMA and its Canadian equivalent .
Risks are assessed and emergency plans are made if there is even the slightest chance of danger .
The Center also produces re-entry warnings for objects .
These warnings , also called TIP Messages ( Trajectory and Impact
Prediction ) , start at about 4 days prior to impact and occur at set intervals .
These are posted on the same website as the normal catalog data , and can be downloaded and viewed by anyone .
You do need an account to get access but it is free and simple and anyone can do it .
There are a couple of caveats .
First , only those objects which are large enough to be tracked by the US military 's network of sensors have re-entry predictions .
Usually this means objects bigger than 10 cm ( about the size of a softball ) .
Second , there are some objects that , as far as the US
gov't is concerned , do n't exist in the satellite catalog and therefore do n't have re-entry notifications .
This object that everyone is buzzing about happens to be one of those .
Of course , anything the size of a school bus in low Earth orbit can be seen by anyone with a backyard telescope and some patience .
Amateurs track many of the " black objects " and sometimes can produce locations .
The best source of info is the
See - Sat mailing list .
Here 's a fun fact - the military operators that track and produce TIPs on all the normal space objects are n't allowed to know where the " spy satellites " are .
They actually know less than the amateurs .
The tracking and re-entry prediction for black satellites is handled by a completely separate unit .
So do n't go blaming the military guys about keeping this stuff secret , point the finger at the NRO people who insist on keeping secrets on objects that everyone can plainly see .
The ironic part is that by keeping it a secret , everyone in the media ( and every arm - chair
" analyst ) " is able to make up whatever they want about the object and thus it gets more well known than if it was a standard unclassified object .
Now the question is , should there be concern over this particular object ?
The answer is maybe , but probably not .
Yes , it is re-entering in an uncontrolled manner when normally this type of satellite would be intentionally destroyed over the ocean far from prying eyes .
The only reason that this particular object ( and for that matter any satellite ) would pose significant threat would be if it contained a radioactive power supply , such as the Snap series .
There has been some discussion on the amateur mailing list over whether or not this satellite has such a power supply .
Some have indicated that since solar panels ca n’t be seen it might indeed use one .
Others have responded that since the satellite went into safe mode shortly after launch , the solar panels might not have deployed and that could be the reason for their absence .
And in either case , there is evidence
( and significant incentive ) for the US to have secured any radioactive material within a protective shell that could survive re-entry , if only to keep the materials from falling into the wrong hands .
We can all be assured that the amateur observers will be tracking this object over the rest of its orbital life and providing the best indicators ( and analysis ) of when and where it might re-enter .
The really sad part of this story is that the US government is withholding information on a potentially dangerous object in the name of national security , but that same information is readily available to anyone with a telescope , a trained mind , and a starry night to collect for themselves .

David Gardner , chief operating officer for EA 's worldwide studios , was speaking to a conference in Edinburgh .
He said : " We have all been talking about this for a long , long time . "
EA 's own research found that 40 % of teenage girls played video games versus 90 % of teenage boys and most girls lost interest in games within a year .
Viewing figures
" We are only reaching a small proportion - not only geographically but also genetically , " said Mr Gardner .
He said if EA cracked the problem the firm " could add a billion dollars to its sales . "
He said the industry had to learn from the film business .
" The movie industry does n't just make films for boys .
" Star wars was the biggest film of all time until Titanic came along ; Titanic became the biggest because women went to see it and women went to see it multiple times .
" Just boys saw Star Wars multiple times . "
Mr Gardner said one of the biggest problems was that the content aimed at women gamers was not appealing .
" They do n't want ' pink games ' .
They are not trying to play girly games where Paris Hilton and Britney Spears go shopping and put make - up on .
" Those kind of things have not been that successful . "
But he said games such as The Sims and websites such as Pogo.com proved there was a market for women gamers .
" Most of the Sims players are girls - 70 % are women under 25 , " he said .
" The Sims is really a game about relationships - and that 's what girls want - they want relationships , they want to be able to chat . "
The Sims , which is published by EA , is arguably the world 's most successful game - with more than 40 million copies sold .
Mr Gardner said the industry needed to " create some mega hits in the girl space . "
He added : " One of the things that is going to make games for girls happen is creative teams .
It 's going to be new people and experiments .
Four of our 11 studios around the world are run by women .
That 's an important start .
" Investing in new and upcoming talent is critical . "
Guess he 's still relevant enough to merit a robocall from Hillary that hits him on policy and character .
Here 's the call ( .mp3 ) , and here 's the transcript , from The Page :
Hello ,
This is the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign .
Before you vote on Saturday , you should know that John Edwards voted for permanent trade relations with China .
That ’s right , John Edwards voted for the bill that cost thousands of jobs .
Like the ones in the textile mills he talks about so much down here .
You should also know that John Edwards made nearly a half a million dollars working for a Wall Street investment fund .
A fund that ’s been profiting on foreclosing on the homes of families ; including 100 homes right here in South Carolina .
That ’s according to The State newspaper .
Here in South Carolina , Edwards says he ’s one of us , but up on Wall Street he was just another one of them .
Can you trust John Edwards ?
In November , I attended a workshop on improving the understanding between customers and software development teams .
The attendees were split into seven or eight groups , and there was an exercise at the end asking the members of each group to come up with a practice that could significantly improve the shared understanding with their customers .
Five groups independently came to the same conclusion : “ Spend some time working at the customer ’s location . ”
Being in touch with customers is nothing new , in fact that is one of the core agile practices .
XP
Explained states that a “ real customer must sit with the team , available to answer questions … ” .
That person helps to resolve disputes and helps developers get a better understanding of business rules .
But when our software goes into production , the other side needs more help .
Like we need a real customer readily available to answer questions , they need a developer readily available for the same purpose .
Are we still playing Chinese whispers ?
A single on - site customer helps several developers by providing quick feedback .
We ask for such help in order to get relevant information , knowing that it will not get distorted by going through several levels of bureaucracy .
But what about real users of our software ?
Very often in enterprise environments , developers and actual users never meet .
The users will get training from a person that was trained by someone that attended a training session …
The end result often reminds me of the Chinese whispers game .
Although those cumulative differences may have been amusing when we were children , they are not so funny when it comes to solving real problems that obstruct people in doing their jobs .
There is simply no real replacement for cheek - to - cheek communication .
A customer representative on site helps us much much more than someone who is available over phone or instant messaging .
The same logic can be applied in the other direction – a developer available on site is worth to the customers much more then the one available over phone .
A friend of mine works on a large - scale retail trading system .
One of his customers often complained about poor performance of the point - of - sale trading application .
Screenshots were sent , with steps to reproduce the problem , but to no avail .
The application was profiled , several bottlenecks were identified and removed , but the complaints were still coming in .
After a few rounds of finger - pointing and blaming , middle - managers meeting with middle - managers and drawing up action plans , it turned out that all those problems were actually happening at a single location .
So this friend of mine went to that shop and spent a busy trading day there .
To his disbelief , the application started to freeze during peak hours .
It took him about five minutes to diagnose the problem – there was a batch job running on a local cache server .
Because of some stale table statistics , the batch job was eating up all the processor power .
The application simply could not get to the data .
Fixing the problem took ten more minutes , and the shop manager now regards my friend as a hero .
This issue simply could not be resolved remotely – there was too much noise because of the Chinese whispers effect .
Developers did try to help and spent hours improving the application , but the information they got on the end was simply misleading .
On the other hand , it was unrealistic to expect a shop assistant to report that there was a problem with statistics on the local cache server .
Improving the feedback loop
It ’s not just the customers that can benefit from us actually spending some time with them .
First of all , that is a great chance to see what kind of problems our customers are facing , not just with the software but with their business in general .
Keeping an open eye for things that can be automated is a great way to find new ideas for improving our software .
People working in a shop or a call centre might have a completely different set of problems than their managers .
The customer representative that participates in development is probably a business domain expert , so he or she will know quite a lot about the business rules , but that person is often too high in the customer organisation to know about mundane operational problems .
Finding out how our applications are actually being used might provide some interesting insights on how to improve them .
If you have not done that before , spend some time just looking at how people actually use your application – you might be surprised .
Sometimes they find a loop - hole that is a bit dangerous , use some workarounds that they found out themselves , or just use the system in a strange way that makes no sense .
A few years ago , I noticed that a trader was exporting data to Excel , sorting it there and importing back into our application .
Imagine the look on his face when I showed him an option to sort it in place .
Spending time with the actual application users is also a great chance to learn more about the problem domain from the trenches .
Direct information , undistorted by Chinese whispers , is invaluable .
New year 's resolution for software development teams
I propose a New Year ’s resolution for software development teams – spend a week or two this year working at your customer ’s location .
You might not get a lot done in terms of coding , but it will make a significant difference to your users .
Answer questions about about the software , learn about their problems and see first - hand how your software is used .
Share the knowledge and improve mutual understanding .
You might even fix some problems on the spot and earn yourself a few beers .

Fox : ' Atheist Outrage ' over holiday ' Tree of Knowledge ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday December 3 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Fox & Friends launched a salvo in the War on Christmas Monday , attacking an atheist group 's " tree of knowledge " erected in front of a Philadelphia courthouse alongside a creche and menorah , while ignoring a 32 - foot tree dedicated to " commercial attraction " in the same public square .
The perky hosts objected because the Freethought Society of Great Philadelphia has set up a " Tree of Knowledge " as part of a seasonal display in front of the Chester County courthouse .
The center of the display is a 32 - foot Christmas tree erected by the Chamber of Commerce .
The president of the Chamber explained to the Philadelphia Inquirer that " this will be the 28th year in a row " for the display and that " we 've always seen the tree as a commercial attraction . "
A Christian creche and a Jewish menorah were added for the first time last year , and the Freethought Society asked to have its tree , which is decorated with the book covers of atheist works alongside the Bible and the Koran , included this year as well .
Margaret Downey , president of the Freethought Society , was invited by Fox News to debate regular Fox contributor Father Jonathan Morris about the display .
Downey began by rejecting
Fox 's suggestion that her group had pressured the commissioners into including them by threatening to prevent them from having any display at all .
" We asked the commissioners last year to designate the area in front of the courthouse as a free speech zone , " she stated .
" And that enables everyone in the community to participate . "
Father Jonathan 's comments were frequently interrupted by Downey , but he appeared to be trying to make the point that he supports free speech but feels that Downey 's group should have had the delicacy to refrain from exercising it .
" If we were living in anything but a ' free thought zone ' in the United States of America , I would go with Margaret , " he began .
" But this is Christmas time , and to use ... "
" You do not own Christmas , " Downey broke in .
" You do not own the winter holiday . "
" I do n't think it 's doing a service to that very good point of yours ... to sabotage a Christian holiday , " Morris stated .
" Do you feel that intimidated ? " Downey asked .
" Do you feel so intimidated by our presence ?
Do you feel so intimidated that you can't even allow us to participate as a fellow citizen ? "
" So many people who I work with on a daily basis , who are really struggling with faith , look and say , ' You know what ?
I 'm embarrassed , ' " said Morris .
" Because you 're an atheist , you 're trying to say therefore we 're going to sabotage what is a holiday , a religious holiday . "
" You should not look at it as a sabotage , " Downey responded .
" Because your faith should be strong enough where anybody standing there with a question would not intimidate you . "

NEW YORK ( AP ) — Remember the war in Iraq ?
The question is n’t entirely facetious .
The war has nearly vanished from TV screens over the past few months , replaced by stories about the fascinating presidential campaign and faltering economy .
Yet Americans continue to fight and die there , five years after the war started in March 2003 .
“ It ’s no big secret that this is a war that everyone has grown tired of , ” said CNN correspondent Arwa Damon , whose documentary “ On Deadly Ground : The Women of Iraq ” is airing several times this month .
“ Iraqis are aware of it .
They think it ’s a story that people are tired of hearing about .
That ’s what makes our job more crucial . ”
ABC News will draw attention to the war this week with the fifth edition of its “ Where Things Stand ” series , polling and interviewing Iraqis about what is happening in their country .
Statistics clearly illustrate the diminished attention .
For the first 10 weeks of the year , the war accounted for 3 percent of television , newspaper and Internet stories in the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s survey of news coverage .
During the same period in 2007 , Iraq filled 23 percent of the news hole .
The difference is even more stark on cable news networks : 24 percent of the time spent on Iraq last year , just 1 percent this year .
“ The fact that it went down did n’t surprise me , ” said Tom Rosenstiel , the project ’s director .
“ But the fact that it almost disappeared is something I did n’t expect . ”
The fatigue factor is hard to fight .

India is in serious danger — no , not from Pakistan or internal strife .
India is in danger from an Indian - made vehicle : a $ 2,500 passenger car , the world ’s cheapest .
India ’s Tata Motors recently announced that it plans to begin turning out a four - door , four - seat , rear - engine car for $ 2,500 next year and hopes to sell one million of them annually , primarily to those living at the “ bottom of the pyramid ” in India and the developing world .
Welcome to one of the emerging problems of the flat world : Blessedly , many more people now have the incomes to live an American lifestyle , and the Indian and Chinese low - cost manufacturing platforms can deliver them that lifestyle at lower and lower costs .
But the energy and environmental implications could be enormous , for India and the world .
We have no right to tell Indians what cars to make or drive .
But we can urge them to think hard about following our model , without a real mass transit alternative in place .
Cheap conventional four - wheel cars , which would encourage millions of Indians to give up their two - wheel motor scooters and three - wheel motorized rickshaws , could overwhelm India ’s already strained road system , increase its dependence on imported oil and gridlock the country ’s megacities .

It 's interesting to look the producer price index and consider how extreme and relentless are price increases over time , and it strikes me that the lack of public outcry about this must represent some sort of price - trend acculturation that has taken place .
We have come to expect it , the way we expect government to rob us of 30 - 40 % of our income through one means or another .
Sonar , underwater camera and scanning equipment will be used
Marine archaeologist Stuart Bacon and Professor David Sear , of the University of Southampton , will explore the lost city of Dunwich , off the Suffolk coast .
Dunwich gradually disappeared into the sea because of coastal erosion .
" It 's about the application of new technology to investigate Britain 's Atlantis , then to give this information to the public , " Professor Sear said .
Mr Bacon , director of the Suffolk Underwater Studies , first located the debris of the lost city in the 1970s .
Technical advances
" I know the site like the back of my hand because I have dived on it about 1,000 times , " said Mr Bacon who has been working on the medieval site since 1971 .
" We have found three churches and one chapel . "
There is diving evidence of debris from lost chapels and churches but high silt levels in the water means visibility is only a few centimetres .
Dunwich has been dubbed the UK's ' Atlantis '
Mr Sear , professor in physical geography at the University of Southampton , said : " Technical advances have massively improved our ability to create accurate acoustic images of the seafloor . "
The expedition will use the latest sonar , underwater camera and scanning equipment to build up a picture of the ancient sunken city , that lies between 10 ft ( 3 m ) and 50ft ( 15 m ) down .
Dunwich was the capital of East Anglia 1,500 years ago .
Its decline began in 1286 when a sea surge hit the East Anglian coast and it was eventually reduced through coastal erosion to the village it is today .
Mr Bacon and Professor Sear hope to begin exploring the seabed in June .
The expedition will cost £ 25,000 - £ 20,000 of which has already been raised through a donation from the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation .
Maps and images of the lost city will be exhibited at the Dunwich museum .
A dive of the site will take place later in the year .

This page demonstrates three different ways to calculate a linear regression from python :
Pure Python - Gary Strangman 's linregress function
In Python , Gary Strangman 's library ( available in the SciPy library ) can be used to do a simple linear regression as follows : -
>>> from scipy import stats
>>> x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ]
>>> y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ]
>>> gradient , intercept , r_value , p_value , std_err = stats.linregress(x , y )
>>> print " Gradient and intercept " , gradient , intercept
Gradient and intercept ( 5.3935773611970186 , -16.281127993087829 )
>>> print " R- squared " , r_value **2
R-squared 0.524806275136
>>> print " p- value " , p_value
p-value 0.27556485788150242
Typing help ( stats.linregress ) will tell you about the return values ( gradient , y- axis intercept , r , two - tailed probability , and the standard error of the estimate ) .
R from Python - R's lsfit function ( Least Squares Fit )
A simple way to do this in the R language is to use the lsfit function ( Least Squares Fit ) :
> x <- c( 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ) > y <- c( 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ) > lsfit( x , y ) $ coefficients Intercept X -16.281128 5.393577
From Python using RPy ( R from Python ) , this is just : -
>>> from rpy import r
>>> x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ]
>>> y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ]
>>> print r.lsfit(x , y ) [ ' coefficients ' ]
{'X ' : 5.3935773611970212 , ' Intercept ' : -16.281127993087839}
Plotting the Regression line from R's lsfit function ( Least Squares Fit )
If you are using R , its very easy to do an x-y scatter plot with the linear model regression line :
x <- c( 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ) y <- c( 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ) plot( x , y , main = " Example Scatter with regression " ) abline ( lsfit( x , y ) $ coefficients , col= " red " )
Again , we can do this with Python - to try and reduce the confusion between all the different meanings of x and y , I am calling the python list variables my_x and my_y here :
from rpy import r my_x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ] my_y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ] ls_fit = r.lsfit ( my_x , my_y ) gradient = ls_fit [ ' coefficients ' ] [ ' X ' ] yintercept= ls_fit [ ' coefficients ' ] [ ' Intercept ' ] r.png ( " scatter_regression.png " , width=400 , height=350 ) r.plot ( x=my_x , y=my_y , xlab= " x " , ylab= " y " , xlim= ( 0,7 ) , ylim= ( - 16,27 ) , main = " Example Scatter with regression " ) r.abline ( a=yintercept , b=gradient , col= " red " ) r.dev_off ( )
I have explicitly chosen the axes limits to show the y - axis intersect at - 16.28 as previously determined :
Note that we have explicitly pulled out the gradient and y- intercept from the coefficients ( which is a python dictionary ) and given them to the abline function as named arguments .
If we simply pass the coefficients dictionary back to the abline function we have no guarantee that its elements will be in the " right " order .
Alternatively , we could turn off rpy 's conversion and keep everything as R objects .
Also notice we have told R to write the graphics to a file , instead of showing them on screen .
This was firstly to make getting an image for this webpage easier , and secondly this approach is usually more reliable on Windows .
R from Python - R's lm function ( Linear Model )
This third method is much more complicated ( especially from python ) but offers more information than just the linear regression coefficient : R's linear model fitting :
> x <- c( 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ) > y <- c( 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ) > lm(y ~ x ) $coefficients ( Intercept ) x - 16.281128 5.393577
The syntax y ~ x tells the lm function to use y depends on x as its model .
Its hard work , but we can still do this from within Python using RPy .
Part of the problem is python does n't have a built in equivalent to the ~ operator , so we have to use rpy 's " evaluate a string " functionality .
>>> from rpy import r
>>> my_x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ]
>>> my_y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ]
>>> print r.lm ( r( "y ~ x " ) , data = r.data_frame ( x=my_x , y=my_y ) ) [ ' coefficients ' ]
{'x ' : 5.3935773611970212 , '( Intercept ) ' : -16.281127993087839}
Plotting the Regression line from R's Linear Model
If you are using R , its very easy to do an x-y scatter plot with the linear model regression line :
> x <- c( 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ) > y <- c( 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ) > plot( x , y , main = " Example Scatter with regression " ) > abline ( coef ( lm(y ~ x ) ) , col= " red " )
Again , we can do this with Python :
from rpy import r my_x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ] my_y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ] linear_model = r.lm ( r ( "y ~ x " ) , data = r.data_frame ( x=my_x , y=my_y ) ) gradient = linear_model [ ' coefficients ' ] ['x ' ] yintercept= linear_model [ ' coefficients ' ] [ '( Intercept ) ' ] r.png ( " scatter_regression.png " , width=400 , height=350 ) r.plot ( x=my_x , y=my_y , xlab= " x " , ylab= " y " , xlim= ( 0,7 ) , ylim= ( - 16,27 ) , main = " Example Scatter with regression " ) r.abline ( a=yintercept , b=gradient , col= " red " ) r.dev_off ( )
As above , this is the exciting result - I have explicitly chosen the axes limits to show the y - axis intersect at - 16.28 as previously determined :
Standard errors etc from R's Linear Model
Finally , as a slight aside following a question from a Derek Bandler , here is a handy bit of R code to get the standard errors , p-values etc from a regression model using the R summary command :
> x <- c( 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ) > y <- c( 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ) > lm(y ~ x ) $coefficients ( Intercept ) x - 16.281128 5.393577 > summary ( lm (y~x ) )
Call : lm( formula = y ~ x )
Residuals : 1 2 3 4 - 9.306 6.374 - 6.962 9.894 Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t value Pr( > |t| ) ( Intercept ) - 16.281 17.065 - 0.954 0.441 x 5.394 3.629 1.486 0.276 Residual standard error : 11.7 on 2 degrees of freedom Multiple R- Squared : 0.5248 , Adjusted R-squared : 0.2872 F-statistic : 2.209 on 1 and 2 DF , p-value : 0.2756
The next question is how to do this in Python with rpy .
Well , using rpy 's default object conversion mode would mean the lm results would be converted from an R dataframe into a Python dictionary .
The python dictionary is n't quite good enough to hold all the information R stores in a dataframe , so if rpy tries to convert it back again , the R summary command can't understand it
One solution is to keep the linear model as an R object ( by turning off rpy 's conversion temporarily ) .
We can then pass this to back the R summary command without problem , and we can still treat the linear model as a Python dictionary using the as_py method - to access its coefficients for example :
>>> import rpy
>>> x = [ 5.05 , 6.75 , 3.21 , 2.66 ]
>>> y = [ 1.65 , 26.5 , - 5.93 , 7.96 ]
>>> rpy.set_default_mode(rpy.NO_CONVERSION )
>>> linear_model = rpy.r.lm( rpy.r( "y ~ x " ) , data = rpy.r.data_frame( x=x , y=y ) )
>>> rpy.set_default_mode(rpy.BASIC_CONVERSION )
>>> print linear_model.as_py ( ) [ ' coefficients ' ]
{'x ' : 5.3935773611970212 , '( Intercept ) ' : -16.281127993087839}
>>> print rpy.r.summary( linear_model )
{'terms ' : < Robj object at 0x0089E240 > , ' fstatistic ' : {' dendf ' : 2.0 , ' value ' : 2.2088097871524752 , ' numdf ' : 1.0} , ' aliased ' : {'x ' : False , '( Intercept ) ' : False} , ' df ' : [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] , ' call ' : < Robj object at 0x0089E340 > , ' residuals ' : {' 1 ' : -9.3064376809571137 , ' 3 ' : -6.9622553363545983 , ' 2 ' : 6.3744808050079511 , ' 4 ' : 9.8942122123037599} , 'adj.r.squared ' : 0.28720941270437206 , ' cov.unscaled ' : array ( [ [ 2.1286381 , - 0.42527178 ] , [ - 0.42527178 , 0.09626979 ] ] ) , ' r.squared ' : 0.524806275136248 , ' sigma ' : 11.696414461570097 , ' coefficients ' : array ( [ [ - 16.28112799 , 17.06489672 , -0.95407129 , 0.44073772 ] , [ 5.39357736 , 3.62909012 , 1.48620651 , 0.27556486 ] ] ) }

The heads of several Canadian content trade groups ( including the CRIA , which represents the four major labels ) recently sat down with the editorial board of the Ottawa Citizen for an hour of conversation about the copyright reform bill soon coming to Canada and what content owners want to see changed .
Despite the poor recording quality , the bad questions , and the general " I 'm just going to talk over you " approach of the content owners , the conversation is worth a listen to anyone ( not just Canadians ) who wants to understand where content owners are coming from .
Or you could just let me sum it up for you in two words : they 're coming from Frustration Junction .
Graham Henderson , the boss of CRIA , comes across as a man not out to screw the world ( as CRIA is sometimes portrayed ) , but as a man about ready to tear out his own hair in frustration over the fact that the music industry is so consistently demonized by consumers even as those consumers take its core product without paying .
A skilled talker , Henderson is the most interesting person at the table , and it 's actually quite humanizing to listen as his polished façade cracks a bit .
He points out that Canadian labels have not chosen to sue their fans , but then goes plaintive for a moment , saying , " We get absolutely zero credit for that . "
One of his main points is that music industry is not simply sticking its head in the sand and dreaming about the coked - up glory days of yesteryear .
The music business as a whole recognizes that change is coming ; with the advent of digital music sales , a " singles market " may be emerging that could largely displace the focus on albums .
Henderson points out that the music industry has seen this before , in the 1950s and 60s .
The market was largely a singles market then until the Beatles made the album relevant .
The music industry will adapt to changing conditions , but this is obviously made more difficult when it has competition in the form of file - swapping .
Should file - swapping continue at its present levels , Henderson argues that performers will essentially returned to the economic model of the 1800s , where the only way to make cash was to get up on a stage somewhere and perform .
While that 's certainly lucrative for some artists , Henderson does n't believe that constant touring is sustainable for the industry as a whole .
He and the other members of the discussion ( who represent independent recording labels and actors , among others ) have some disagreements , but all want to see the 1996 WIPO intellectual property treaties at last incorporated into Canadian law .
This is what led to the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 , but the content owners are sick of hearing Canada 's upcoming copyright reform bill called the " Canadian DMCA " ( as law professor Michael Geist and others have dubbed it ) , largely because the law has n't even been introduced yet , and no one knows for sure what 's in it .
Instead , Henderson says , the bill should be considered on its merits , as should proposals from the content industries .
Fair enough .
So what have the content industries put forward in the way of ideas about copyright reform ?
Henderson and others spoke approvingly about government - mandated ISP filtering in Europe and private - sector sponsored filtering in the US ( from AT&T ) .
They would love to see such filtering made part of Canadian law , and point out that " the roof has n't fallen in on privacy " in Europe .
All agree that anticircumvention measures for DRM are important .
This is part of the WIPO treaties , though it can be implemented in such a way that it only affects those who want to do something illegal with the content .
Canada 's privacy commissioner has just raised her own concerns about anticircumvention , pointing out that some DRM schemes can traffic in personal data ; not allowing users to bypass or break such schemes could put privacy at risk .
The Creators ' Copyright Coalition , which represents 16 trade groups for actors , writers , filmmakers , and songwriters , has just issued its own extensive proposal for copyright reform .
It does n't start well , complaining in the introduction about " the tendency to privilege users " and " the concept of ‘ users ' rights ' . "
The group wants to give artists total control over transferring their works to " to another medium , " which appears targeted at CD ripping , among other things .
Speaking specifically of digitization , the CCC says that it 's " essential that rights holders preserve their exclusive right to authorize or forbid , and extract remuneration from , all forms of reproduction . "
CCC wants Canada 's current levy system for music expanded to cover " all categories of work covered by the Copyright Act , " including books , films , and paintings .
That means new tariffs for all sorts of devices , with the money designed to cover " private copying . "
This does n't legalize file - swapping in any way .
Copyright law currently allows people to read a " reasonable extract " of a published work without infringing copyright ; the CCC wants this right removed .
Canada should also adopt a " notice and takedown " system for ISPs that would function much like the DMCA in the US .
This has actually worked quite well , and has allowed ISPs to avoid playing the cop so long as they respond to appropriate requests from others .
Taken together , these sound a lot like the DMCA , so it 's not clear why Henderson and the others are so offended by the comparison .
But whatever the merits of these ideas , a newly - energized Canadian public is unlikely to let them all pass .
Mandated ISP filtering , for instance , seems to have little chance of success .
Michael Geist notes that " mandatory filtering sounds better suited to China rather than Canada and one would hope that Prentice and the Conservatives would know better than to jump on the mandated ISP filtering bandwagon as it would undoubtedly generate even greater opposition from virtually all stakeholders . "
The fact that CRIA is still lobbying heavily for its proposals and that substantive new proposals are coming out of the CCC and other groups would seem to suggest that the issue is still one in need of debate , though Henderson claimed that the issue has been talked to death for years and that action — not words — are needed now .
Update : Several readers rightly thought it worth mentioning that CRIA did in fact file lawsuits against 29 file - swappers in 2004 .
The suits failed and have not been pursued since .
In contrast , the RIAA has launched an estimated 20,000 suits against US file - swappers .
DIGG THIS
It always perturbed me that the wide variety of neocon commentators on television regularly pronounce with such fury and unison that Ron Paul " ca n’t win " but never give any reasons why he could n’t win the presidential race .
At first , I assumed that these guys would be denying he had a chance up until and including Ron Paul ’s inauguration day .
And why should n’t I assume that ?
The pundits probably do n’t give any reasons he can’t win , I thought , because there are n’t any .
Then I thought more deeply , and found that there are plenty of reasons why Ron Paul ca n’t be elected .
Here are the ten top reasons why Ron Paul ca n’t win , in the format of David Letterman ’s Top Ten List .
My logic is flawless .
As Bill O’Reilly would say , " you ca n’t even argue it . "
10 . Ron Paul is too popular among people who know where he stands .
Instant polling numbers among focus groups watching the debates have his popularity at about 75 percent .
But Americans do n’t vote for people who are that popular .
It ’s true that George W. Bush got a little more than 50 percent of the vote in 2004 — just barely — but that was a fluke .
Bush ’s popularity numbers have since sunk back to the traditional 25 — 35 percent range .
Before 2004 , not one of the winners in the last three Presidential campaigns even got 50 percent of the vote .
Dubya did n’t even win a plurality of the popular vote in 2000 .
So it ’s a clear modern precedent that in order to become President , you need to be unpopular rather than widely popular .
Ron Paul simply can’t win if he remains that popular , and there ’s no reason to believe people will begin to hate him .
9 . He ’s got too much money , and nowhere to spend it .
It ’s great that Ron Paul ’s official campaign is raising nearly as much money as the frontrunners .
But it wo n’t do him any good .
What would he spend it on ?
He does n’t need to spend it on local campaigning , because he ’s already got more than 700 Meetups across the country .
( More on that in reason # 8 ) .
Many of these Meetups are printing bumper stickers , fliers , and yard signs without money from the campaign .
They are creating phone banks on their own .
A few are even making their own media advertising buys .
Therefore , the campaign does n’t need money for any of these things .
So the massive Ron Paul campaign fundraising , while impressive , is superfluous at best .
Money simply wo n’t help .
8. Ron Paul is cheating by harnessing the fervor of an army of volunteers , rather than the method pursued by the other candidates — who must pay a huge campaign staff to get their message out .
It ’s not fair that Ron Paul has excited volunteers who will spend their own money to get him elected , while the other candidates have to pay lots of people salaries to work for their campaigns .
So do n’t think that the other candidates wo n’t cry " foul " when they notice that most of Ron Paul ’s campaign contributions are " off the books " in these Meetups .
Collectively , the Meetups may be spending more money than the frontrunner campaigns .
I noticed this myself recently when I attended a Ron Paul Meetup in Pawtucket , Rhode Island .
I got handed a wad of Ron Paul bumper stickers from a guy who printed them up himself .
Others passed me self - printed fliers and lapel stickers while the whole group passed the hat to print road signs on their own .
Do you really think these expenditures were sent in to the Federal Election Commission as a campaign contribution ?
I doubt it .
" We need a campaign u2018 fairness doctrine ’ to level the playing field , " the other candidates will argue , quite possibly to great effect .
7. Ron Paul tells the truth .
Ron Paul has a 20 - year career in Congress of always voting the way he ’s promised , even sometimes on positions that could hurt him politically ( See reason # 5 for more on this ) .
He ’s honest even when it hurts him , and that ’s great .
But let ’s face it , Americans long ago tired of electing honest presidents .
They very much prefer presidents who will lie to us " for your own good . "
This explains why they elected George " Read my lips , no new taxes " Bush , Bill " I did not have sexual relations with that woman " Clinton , and most recently , George " Law enforcement officers need a federal judge ’s permission to wiretap a foreign terrorist ’s phone " Bush .
Need I elaborate more ?
The American people long ago tired of honesty !
Honesty just does n’t sell .
6 . He ’s for lower spending AND lower taxes .
Most Americans want lower taxes , so Ron Paul ’s halfway there , but they do n’t want to cut spending .
Americans want a candidate who talks about lower spending but actually increases spending .
This explains the Bill " the era of big government is over " Clinton and George " compassionate conservative " Bush presidencies .
Of course , Americans also want balanced budgets … and Ron Paul ’s philosophy would give them both lower taxes and a balanced budget .
But I still think the American people would settle for another candidate who promises to enact a balanced budget precisely four years after the end of his last term — four years after any influence he has over spending ends .
5. Ron Paul is a man of principle .
Ron Paul is known for voting against pork even for his own congressional district .
He voted against the Iraq war even when the American people were backing it in polling by three - to - one margins .
He ’s the " 1 " in more 434 - 1 votes than all of the rest of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives put together .
He does n’t take congressional pay raises or participate in the generous congressional pension system .
While that might lead some people to think it would attract voters to his candidacy , it actually hurts him .
Despite the fact that his campaign rallies regularly draw more supporters than any other candidate , these huge crowds have made him a very , very lonely man .
Crowds are isolating psychological phenomena .
Getting the biggest crowds at rallies only exaggerates the loneliness that people always have in crowds .
Psychologically speaking , he can’t take any more of the loneliness of those crowds .
No one could .
That ’s why the other candidates have limited themselves to smaller crowds of mostly salaried campaign officials and government employees .
4. Ron Paul has peaked .
He wins first or second place in all of the online polls , so his expectations have been raised too high for him to win a primary .
Ron Paul has already lost the expectations game , unless he can somehow pull out 274.8 percent or more of the total vote in the Iowa primary .
I ’m no mathematical expert , but my accountant tells me it ’s mathematically impossible for Ron Paul to pull in that kind of a vote .
3 . He ’s been against the Iraq war from the start .
You might think that taking a position against the Iraq war from the start would help a candidate in a campaign where the American people oppose the war by a two - to - one margin or more .
But the truth is , the American people do n’t want a know - it - all candidate who has demonstrated foresight .
They want a dumb bumbler that they can make fun of ; it ’s the same social phenomena that caused people to watch the old Jerry Springer show .
They want a president who ca n’t pronounce " nuclear , " preferably one who physically resembles a simian .
Also , and perhaps more importantly , the troops are about to pull out a dramatic victory from Iraq .
Not with the current surge , but with the post - surge surge .
The fact that Ron Paul is raking in more campaign contributions from veterans than any other candidate should not be taken as a sign that the troops want out of there .
The troops are n’t voting with their wallets , they ’re just getting tanned , rested and ready for the final surge .
The campaign contributions are a diversional maneuver designed to draw out al Qaeda fighters , and those weapons of mass destruction Sean Hannity says were secretly stored in Syria .
The post - surge surge will also expose the mystery behind Area 51 , end world hunger and cure male - pattern baldness .
This issue will be a loser for any anti-war candidate in short order .
Just wait and see .
2. Ron Paul ’s a medical doctor , OB / GYN , and a graduate of Duke Medical School , but not a government health care management professional .
Therefore , no American could possibly take him seriously when he gives his opinion on medicine .
It ’s a good thing that Dr. Paul has not been given an opportunity to comment on any question about health care in any of the Presidential debates , because the other candidates ’ expertise on medicine would blow him away .
It ’s only a matter of time before they embarrass him .
Other candidates like Mitt Romney have experience as part of a " management team " capable of delivering a " wide range of services . "
Ron Paul has only ensured proper health care for a few thousand individual people .
The other candidates know that government policy can deliver much better health care for less cost than country doctors .
Take , for example , Boston ’s " Big Dig . "
The Big Dig , the depression of Boston ’s central artery , is the largest public works project in history at $ 15 billion and counting .
This could never have been accomplished by the private sector , and the Big Dig construction is almost finished after 10 years and going only 800 percent over budget .
It ’s true the Big Dig has already killed a motorist who was crushed by the falling three - ton concrete blocks used as ceiling tiles .
( How could anyone possibly have foreseen such an outcome from an innovative design of precariously fastening concrete ceiling tiles ? )
But the truth is that we need government to bring the same cost controls and safety controls of the Big Dig to health care .
Ron Paul just does n’t understand this vital macroeconomic point .
1. George Stephanopoulos says Ron Paul can’t win .
George Stephanopoulos may only stand nine inches tall without television camera tricks , but that ’s because he ’s the only documented Greek Leprechaun in modern history .
He therefore wields powerful clairvoyance powers that can shape the future .
That explains Bill Clinton ’s election and reelection over the seemingly unstoppable Bob Dole .
If you do n’t have George Stephanopoulos on your side , your cause is hopeless .
Fortunately for Boston Red Sox fans , Stephanopoulos withdrew his longstanding " The Red Sox can never win the World Series " edict in October 2004 .
Let ’s face it , the evidence against a Ron Paul victory is overwhelming .
Dr. Paul will never be the " front - Ron-ner . "
At least , not until he takes his oath of office at his inauguration .

Fox guest :
Sex ed teaches children strangers with candy are ' not so creepy ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Fox News on Monday invited former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and a young conservative pro-abstinence pundit , Christine O'Donnell , to discuss Barack Obama 's recent suggestion that age - appropriate sex education should begin in kindergarten .
Elders said she agreed fully with Obama that for their own protection kindergarteners should be told about inappropriate touching .
O'Donnell not only disagreed but attacked Elders , claiming that when she was surgeon general , her office proposed using " cartoon characters of naked children so - called touching themselves with inanimate objects . "
" This breaks down the natural modesty that exists within children to protect them , " O'Donnell continued , arguing that if children get comfortable talking about personal things to their kindergarten teachers , " then suddenly talking to that stranger with candy on the playground is not so creepy . "
Elders responded that even though 55 % of " parents do not teach their children anything about sex , " 81 % want them to receive sex education in school .
" It is the parents ' decision to decide , " insisted O'Donnell , adding to clinch the argument that " if the parents are n't as involved in the children 's life as they should be , the school should be offering parenting classes ! "
" We have a sexually unhealthy society , " began Elders , but O'Donnell quickly cut her off , saying with a broad grin , " And that is wonderful .
...
It 's called modesty . "
" Dr. Elders , I 'm going to give you the last comment , said the Fox host , at which O'Donnell laughed loudly .
As Elders started to say " Ignorance is not bliss , " O'Donnell interrupted yet again with a loud , " And neither is promiscuity ! "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends broadcast on July 23 .

It has been a day of carnage on the Australian share market , with investors wiping nearly $ 100 billion off the value of local stocks .
The market has closed down 7.3 per cent - its worst one - day fall since 1989 .
Today , investors took their cue from Asia and Europe , where the FTSE fell more than 5.5 per cent .
Wall Street was closed for a public holiday , and there are fears about what is to come when it reopens tonight .
The plunges comes on the back of new fears the US economic slowdown is spreading across the world .
The All Ordinaries dived 409 points to 5,222 and the ASX 200 slumped 394 points to 5,187 .
No sectors have been secure from the hammering .
The miners have been deeply in the red on lower base metals prices .
Rio Tinto shed 11.6 per cent to $ 101 .
BHP Billiton dropped 6.9 per cent to $ 31 .
As for the financial sector , the ANZ suffered a 7.1 per cent loss to $ 24.35 .
It has been such a volatile day that the website of Australia 's largest online sharebroker CommSec crashed after being overloaded with an unprecedented number of trades on the site as the market opened .
But the Commonwealth Bank fared the best of the big banks , losing a relatively meagre 3.8 per cent to $ 48.85 .
In the property sector , Centro Properties lost 14 per cent , while the related Centro Retail Group has been hammered and has closed nearly 25 per cent down .
About the only performer has been Consolidated Media Holdings ( CMH ) , after news that Lachlan Murdoch and James Packer want to buy it from shareholders for $ 3.3 billion .
After coming out of a trading halt , CMH shares have skyrocketed 9.6 per cent to $ 4.23 .
About 5:00 pm AEDT , the Australian dollar was buying 85.95 US cents , 44.3 UK pence , 91.22 Japanese yen , and 59.53 euro cents .
West Texas crude oil was fetching $ US88.62 a barrel and spot gold was worth $ US859 an ounce .
Asian markets
Asian stock markets also took a battering today , with key markets shedding up to 8 per cent .
By midday AEDT , every market in the region was in virtual free - fall .
Trading was briefly suspended in South Korea and India , while jittery investors elsewhere in Asia watched markets open sharply in the red and then keep plummeting .
Japanese shares fell more than 5 per cent to a 28 - month low , while Indian shares pared losses after losing 11.5 per cent in early trade .
South Korean shares closed down at almost 4.5 per cent , while Taiwan 's share prices closed 6.5 per cent lower .
In London , the FTSE 100 index of leading shares plunged by 3.3 per cent to 5,393 points just after the start of trade .
Moves to ease concerns
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the Australian economy remains strong , despite the share market turmoil .
He has tried to ease concerns saying the Federal Government is laying strong foundations for the economy , with plans for Budget surpluses and investment in skills and infrastructure .
" Responsible economic management are core businesses for the Australian Government , " he said .
" That 's why the economy was the absolute central focus of the first Cabinet meeting fo the Government yesterday in Perth , when we established Infrastructure Australia . "
Meanwhile , a leading economist says the share market turbulence may lead the Reserve Bank ( RBA ) to keep interest rates on hold .
Chris Richardson from Access Economics says the investment woes of Australians may in fact be the silver lining for people facing mortgage hikes .
But Mr Richardson says tomorrow 's quarterly inflation figure will be make or break for the RBA when it meets in February .
" If it 's bad enough , the Reserve will raise rates , " he said .
" The tipping point on underlying inflation in the last three months , if that 's 0.8 [ per cent ] or worse , you can expect the Reserve Bank will pull the trigger . "

Oligarchies We Can't Directly Boycott
Exploring JPEG
This file is both a HTML file and a literate Haskell program .
If you rename it to .lhs you can compile it with GHC 6.6 .
This is a functional , if limited , JPEG decoder .
It only decodes grayscale , 8 - bit images and is overly sensitive to the options used .
I thought that people might like to learn a little about the JPEG standard .
Frankly , you can just skip all the code if you do n't understand Haskell .
Segments
A JPEG bitstream consists of several segments .
Every byte in the file belongs to a segment and each segment follows a common format :
u8 0xff u8 0x01 .. 0xfe ( segment type ) u16 be header length ( often included , but not always )
After header length bytes may come an encoded stream of bytes .
If the encoded stream of bytes contains an 0xff , a 0x00 is stuffed in afterwards to make sure that the 0xff is n't confused with the start of the next header .
I 'm going to put in the first chunk of code now , so I have to get the module stuff out of the way .
You can ignore this ; these are all standard modules except for BitSyntax which is a helper module for parsing binary formats .
> import Maybe ( fromJust ) > import BitSyntax > import qualified Data.
ByteString as BS > import System .IO ( openFile , IOMode (.. ) , hPutStr , hClose ) > import Data.Bits > import Data .
List ( mapAccumL ) > import Data .
Word > import Control .
Monad .
Writer > import qualified Data .
Map as Map
Now , here 's the code which takes a JPEG file and returns a list of segments .
It searches for the segment start marker and returns a list of segment types and the body of that segment .
It 's a little loose because it does n't skip the segment header for those segments which have a length .
Thus it 's possible that it will find a marker in the headers .
However , it suffices for our needs .
> jpegSegments :: BS.ByteString -> [ ( Word8 , BS. ByteString ) ] > jpegSegments jpegdata = > if marker == 0xd9 > then [ ( marker , BS.empty ) ] > else ( marker , bytes ) : jpegSegments rest > where > marker = jpegdata ` BS.index` 1 > indexes = BS.findSubstrings ff jpegdata > ff = BS. pack [ 0xff ] > nextmarker = head $ tail $ filter ( isMarker At jpegdata ) indexes > is MarkerAt jpegdata i = nextbyte /= 00 && nextbyte /= 0xff > where nextbyte = jpegdata ` BS.index` ( i + 1 ) > bytes = BS.drop 2 $ BS . take nextmarker jpegdata > rest = BS.drop nextmarker jpegdata
At this point I 'll introduce our test image :
Running jpegSegments on this file gives the following segments
Type of segment Length of segment Start of image 0 APP0 16 Quantisation table 67 Start of frame : baseline DCT 11 Huffman table 28 Huffman table 63 Start of scan 49363
End of image 0
The APP0 segment marks this file as a JFIF / JPEG .
JFIF defines some extra fields ( like the image resolution and an optional thumbnail ) and you can find out more about it here .
Nearly all JPEGs found in the wild will be JFIF files .
The outline of the JPEG file is that it contains one frame ( image ) and that frame can one of more scans .
Scans can give progressively more detail , or can be different axis of the colour space etc .
For this example we have only one scan and only one axis of color space ( luminance , because it 's grayscale ) .
The quantisation and Huffman tables are needed for decoding the image so the first thing we do is parse and store the information in them .
We 'll be storing the information in a structure :
> data JpegState = JpegState { jsHuffTables :: Map.Map ( Integer , Integer ) Tree , > jsQuantTable :: Map.Map Integer [ Integer ] , > jsWidth :: Int , jsHeight :: Int , > jsACTable :: Int , jsDCTable :: Int , jsData :: BS .
ByteString } deriving ( Show )
There can be many Huffman and quantisation tables defined and different scans might use different tables .
So we store a map of tables , although we only expect one .
First we parse the quantisation table ( the segment is called DQT in the JPEG spec and you 'll see these triplet names popping up now and then ) .
Do n't worry about what a quantisation table is quite yet , we 'll get to that later , it 's basically just an array of 64 values .
The quantisation table segment looks like :
u8 0xff u8 0xdb ( type of segment ) u16 be length of segment 4 - bits precision in bits 4 - bits table id 64 elements of u8 or u16 quantisation values in zigzag order
The last three rows are repeated for the length of the segment .
Here 's the parsing code
> parseDQT dqt = > parseTable $ BS. drop 2 dqt where > parseTable bytes = > if BS. length remainingbytes == 0 > then [ ( id , values ) ] > else ( id , values ) : parseTable remainingbytes > where >
Just ( [ 0 , id ] , rest ) = $ ( bitSyn [ PackedBits [ 4 , 4 ] , Rest ] ) bytes > ( valuesbytes , remainingbytes ) = BS.splitAt 64 rest > values = map fromIntegral $ BS.unpack valuesbytes >
Huffman coding
I 'm going to assume that you know what Huffman coding is , if not you can read up on it .
JPEG defines a mode for both Huffman and arithmetic coding but , due to patent issues , only Huffman is ever seen in the wild .
Arithmetic coding is slower , but gets about 10 % better compression for JPEG files .
The Huffman trees in JPEG are never deeper than 16 elements and they are communicated with two lists .
The first is 16 elements long and gives the number of values at each depth in the tree .
( So the first element gives the number of values which are only one step from the root of the tree , the second the number which are two steps etc. ) .
The second list is a list of elements , in order of depth .
The JPEG standard gives a very complex definition of how to construct the Huffman trees ( which appears to be a case of premature - optimisation ) .
The actual algorithm is this :
Start with an empty tree For each ( element , depth ) pair in the list of elements ( in order ) : Go " depth " steps from the root , always going left at each step if there 's space to do so .
( Elements are always at the leaves of the trees , so if the left subtree is an element , or is a tree fully terminated by elements , you can not go left )
Where you stop , insert the element
Here 's our tree structure :
> data Tree = Empty | Full Int | Tree Bool Tree
Tree deriving ( Show , Eq ) > data Branch = TLeft | TRight deriving ( Show , Eq )
Each node in the tree is either Empty , Full ( a leaf node , with in Int element ) or a tree with a fullness - flag , and left + right children .
The fullness flag for each
Tree node is true if no more elements can be inserted in it .
This saves us from ever needing to backtrack .
The Branch type is used to store the steps which we took to insert the element .
This is needed if you 're going to implement a fast table lookup ( we are n't in this case , so it 's just an example . )
Here 's the function for adding an element to the tree .
You can check the patterns if you like :
> huffTreeAdd :: forall ( m :: * -> *) a. > ( MonadWriter [ [ Branch ] ] m , Num a ) => > Tree -> a -> Int -> m
Tree > huffTreeAdd tree n ele = huffTreeInner tree n [ ] > where > huffTreeInner tree n path = > if n == 1 > then case tree of > Empty -> do tell [ reverse ( TLeft : path ) ] > return $ Tree False ( Full ele ) Empty > ( Tree False left@( Full _) Empty ) -> do tell [ reverse ( TRight : path ) ] > return $ Tree True left ( Full ele ) > else case tree of > Empty -> do left return $ Tree False left Empty > ( Tree False left@( Full _) right ) -> do > right ' @( Tree rightfull _ _ ) return $ Tree rightfull left right ' >
( Tree False left@( Tree False _ _ ) Empty ) -> do > left ' return $ Tree False left '
Empty > ( Tree False left@( Tree True _ _ ) right ) -> do > right ' @( Tree rightfull _ _ ) return $ Tree rightfull left right ' > otherwise -> error $ " Did n't match " ++ show tree
Building a tree is then just a case of calling huffTreeAdd for each ( depth , element ) pair in the Huffman table .
We throw away the path of Branch es , but this is where you would construct a lookup table if you wanted speed .
> huffBuildTree :: forall a. ( Num a ) => [ ( a , Int ) ] ->
Tree > huffBuildTree values = > fst $ runWriter $ foldM ( \tree ( depth , value ) -> huffTreeAdd tree depth value )
Empty values >
Looking up values from the tree is very simple , you just walk the tree until you hit an element .
This function uses a list of Bool s as a list of bits where true means taking the right subtree .
It returns the element and the remaining list of bits .
> huffTreeLookup :: Tree -> [ Bool ] -> ( Int , [ Bool ] ) > huffTreeLookup origtree origbits = > huffTreeInner origtree origbits where > huffTreeInner tree bits = > case tree of > Empty -> error $ " Bad Huffman code : " ++ ( show origtree ) ++ " " ++ ( show $ take 15 origbits ) ++ " " ++ ( show $ length origbits ) > ( Full x ) -> ( x , bits ) >
( Tree _ left right ) -> > if head bits > then huffTreeInner right $ tail bits > else huffTreeInner left $ tail bits >
Now that you know the theory , there 's just the question of how to read the bytes .
Remember that we just need the list of lengths and the list of elements , from that the segment layout is obvious :
u8 0xff u8 0xc4 ( type of segment ) u16 be length of segment 4 - bits class ( 0 is DC , 1 is AC , more on this later ) 4 - bits table id array of 16 u8 number of elements for each of 16 depths array of u8 elements , in order of depth
Like the quantisation table , the last four rows are repeated for the length of the segment .
Here 's the parsing function , it returns the class , id and a list of ( depth , element ) pairs :
> parseDHT :: forall b a . >
( Show [ b ] , Num b , Num a , Enum a ) => > BS.ByteString -> [ ( Integer , Integer , [ ( a , b ) ] ) ] > parseDHT dht = > parseTable $ BS. drop 2 dht where > parseTable bytes = > if BS. length remainingbytes == 0 > then [ ( tableclass , ident , reverse values ) ] > else ( tableclass , ident , reverse values ) : parseTable remainingbytes > where >
Just ( [ tableclass , ident ] , rest ) = $ ( bitSyn [ PackedBits [ 4 , 4 ] , Rest ] ) bytes > ( lengthsbytes , rest ' ) = BS.splitAt 16 rest > lengths = map fromIntegral $ BS.unpack lengthsbytes > valueslength = sum lengths > ( valuesbytes , remainingbytes ) = BS.splitAt valueslength rest ' > values = snd $ foldl ( \( values , acc ) ( length , number ) -> > let ( v , newvalues ) = splitAt number values > in > ( newvalues , ( reverse ( zip ( repeat length ) v ) ) ++ acc ) ) > ( ( map fromIntegral $ BS.unpack valuesbytes ) , [ ] ) > ( zip [ 1..16 ] lengths ) >
There are two other segments we need to parse , the start of frame and start of scan .
Their exact formats are n't important , they contain what you would expect : the width and height of the image , number of components ( axis of colour space ) and which tables to use in decoding :
> parseSOF sof = > ( fromIntegral height , fromIntegral width , Map.fromList comps ' ) where >
Just ( _ , _ , height , width , ncomps , rest ) = $ ( bitSyn [ Unsigned 2 , Unsigned 1 , Unsigned 2 , Unsigned 2 , Unsigned 1 , Rest ] ) sof > comps = snd $ foldl ( \( bytes , acc ) _ ->
( BS.drop 3 bytes , ( fromJust $ $( bitSyn [ Unsigned 1 , PackedBits [ 4 , 4 ] , Unsigned 1 ] ) bytes ) : acc ) ) ( rest , [ ] ) [ 1..ncomps ] > comps ' = map ( \( compid , [ hor , ver ] , qt ) -> ( fromIntegral compid , ( hor , ver , from Integral qt ) ) ) comps > > parseSOS sos = > ( fromIntegral ncomps , fromIntegral dctable , fromIntegral actable , rest ) where >
Just ( headlen , ncomps , _ , [ dctable , actable ] ) = $( bitSyn [ Unsigned 2 , Unsigned 1 , Unsigned 1 , PackedBits [ 4 , 4 ] , Ignore $ Skip 3 ] ) sos > rest = BS.drop ( fromIntegral headlen ) sos
There 's also a function which translates the return values of these parsing functions into changes in the JpegState structure ( which we defined way above if you remember ) :
> updateJpegState state ( segType , bytes ) = > case segType of > 0xc4 -> foldl addHuffTable state $ parseDHT bytes where > addHuffTable state ( key1 , key2 , values ) = > state { jsHuffTables = Map.insert key tree ( jsHuffTables state ) } where > key = ( key1 , key2 ) > tree = huffBuildTree $ values > 0xdb -> foldl addQuantTable state $ parseDQT bytes where > addQuantTable state ( id , values ) = > state { jsQuantTable = Map.insert id values ( jsQuantTable state ) } > 0xc0 -> state { jsWidth = width , jsHeight = height } where > ( height , width , comps ) = parseSOF bytes > 0xda -> state { jsData = rest , jsDCTable = dctable , jsACTable = actable} where > ( 1 , dctable , actable , rest ) = parseSOS bytes > otherwise -> state
The Discrete Cosine Transform
We 're almost ready to start decoding the heart of JPEG - the DCT .
When encoding an image , it 's split into 8x8 squares of pixels .
Each of those squares is then transformed via the DCT ( which is fully reversible ) .
You can think of the DCT as changing the pixels from the time to the frequency domain : the time vs amplitude plot of a waveform is in the time domain and the frequency vs amplitude plot ( like you see on a graphic equaliser ) is in the frequency domain .
The DCT is fully reversible .
You can also think of the DCT as a function which turns an 8x8 pixel grid into a linear combination of the following , graphical basis functions :
There are 64 , 8x8 images there .
The top left one is called the DC component and all the rest are AC components .
Hopefully you can see that a solid 8x8 block is always some fraction of the top left tile .
If the 8x8 block fades towards the bottom , then add in a little of the tile just below .
It might not be obvious that all 8x8 pixel blocks can be represented as linear combinations of these tiles , but it 's true .
The DC component is the cosine wave which makes no cycles over the 8x8 block .
Going one tile left , that 's the cosine wave which makes half a cycle over the block .
Next tile along makes one cycle over the block and so on .
Going left increases the horizontal frequency and going down increases the vertical frequency .
However , the human eye has different sensitivities at these frequencies .
Most of the high frequency tiles can be thrown away without any noticeable effect .
This " throwing away " is managed by dividing the amplitude of each tile by a fixed number in the hope that many of them go to zero .
The bigger the divisor , the lower the quality and the divisors are weighted so that the high frequency components get divided by a larger number .
The list of divisors is the quantisation table which we dealt with before .
You can perform the DCT by correlating the pixel values with the cosine functions , which , for the 1 - d case , is the same as multiplying by the DCT matrix :
0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 0.4904 0.4157 0.2778 0.0975 - 0.0975 - 0.2778 - 0.4157 -0.4904 0.4619 0.1913 - 0.1913 - 0.4619 - 0.4619 - 0.1913 0.1913 0.4619 0.4157 - 0.0975 - 0.4904 - 0.2778 0.2778 0.4904 0.0975 - 0.4157 0.3536 - 0.3536 - 0.3536 0.3536 0.3536 - 0.3536 - 0.3536 0.3536 0.2778 -0.4904 0.0975 0.4157 - 0.4157 -0.0975 0.4904 - 0.2778 0.1913 - 0.4619 0.4619 - 0.1913 - 0.1913 0.4619 - 0.4619 0.1913 0.0975 - 0.2778 0.4157 -0.4904 0.4904 - 0.4157 0.2778 - 0.0975
Since each row is orthogonal , the inverse of this matrix is just its transpose .
We represent a matrix as a list of rows , where each row is a list of values .
This gives us the transpose , vector*vector , matrix * vector and matrix * matrix functions :
> trans l = if any null l > then [ ] > else map head l : trans ( map tail l ) > > vv v1 v2 = sum $ map ( uncurry ( * ) ) $ zip v 1 v2 > mv mat vec = map ( vv vec ) mat > mm mat mat2 = trans $ map ( mv mat ) $ trans mat2
We can also define the inverse 8x8 DCT matrix :
> dctmat n = ( take ( fromIntegral n ) $ repeat $ sqrt ( 1.0 / iN ) ) : ( map row [ 2..n ] ) > where >
iN = fromIntegral n > row k = map ( point k ) [ 1..n ] > point k i = ( sqrt ( 2.0 /iN ) ) * ( cos (( pi * ( 2.0 * iI - 1.0 ) * ( iK - 1.0 ) ) / ( 2.0 * iN ) ) ) where >
iI = fromIntegral i > iK = fromIntegral k > > idct8 = trans $ dctmat 8
DCT encoding
Now we understand that to decode the image we just need to get the DCT coefficients for each 8x8 block , multiply by the quantisation table and perform the inverse DCT to get the pixel values .
The remaining question is how to decode the DCT coefficients .
First , the 8x8 blocks are encoded in raster order ( left - to - right , top - to - bottom ) and , where the image is n't an integer number of 8x8 blocks , the rightmost and bottommost pixels are repeated to make it so .
For each 8x8 block the DC coefficient is encoded first using one Huffman table and the AC coefficients follow ( all 63 of them ) using another Huffman table ( and another coding scheme ) .
Both DC and AC use the same integer encoding scheme however , which is what we 'll cover next :
An integer is encoded by Huffman encoding its range and then two 's complement encoding the offset within that range .
The ranges look like this :
SSSS ( range number ) Range 0 0 1 - 1 , 1 2 - 3.. - 2 , 2..3 3 - 7.. - 4 , 4..7 4 - 15 ..- 8 , 8..15 5 - 31..- 16 , 16..31 ... ...
The SSSS value is both the element of the Huffman tree ( for DC ) and the number of trailing bits .
So if you decode 3 from the Huffman tree you take the following three bits from the bitstream .
The first of those bits is true if you 're counting from the bottom of the positive subrange and false if you 're counting from the bottom of the negative subrange .
The last two are the number to add onto that base value :
> bitsToInt :: forall a. ( Bits a ) => [ Bool ] -> a > bitsToInt bits = > foldl ( \acc v -> ( acc `shiftL` 1 ) + ( if v then 1 else 0 ) ) 0 bits > > jpegDecodeInt :: Int -> [ Bool ] ->
Int > jpegDecodeInt ssss bits = > value where > classvalue = ( 1 `shiftL` ( ssss - 1 ) ) > positive = head bits > basevalue = if positive > then classvalue > else 1 - classvalue * 2 > extravalue = bitsToInt $ tail bits > value = basevalue + extravalue
The DC value of each DCT block is encoded as the difference from the DC value of the last block decoded .
( The DC value of the block before the first one is taken to be 0 ) .
This code does n't do the difference , it just decodes the value :
> huffDCDecode :: Tree -> [ Bool ] -> ( Int , [ Bool ] ) > huffDCDecode tree bits = > ( decodedvalue , remainingbits ) where > ( ssss , rest ) = huffTreeLookup tree bits > ( decodedvalue , remainingbits ) = > if ssss == 0 > then ( 0 , rest ) > else ( value , rest ' ) where > ( ssssbits , rest ' ) = splitAt ssss rest > value = jpegDecodeInt ssss ssssbits
AC values are a little different .
Firstly , there 's 63 of them in each block and there are usually long runs of zeros between values .
Thus the AC Huffman tree decodes two values : an SSSS value ( in the lower 4 bits ) , just like above and an RRRR value ( in the upper four bits ) , which gives the number of preceding zeros .
So if the AC Huffman tree decodes a value of 0x53 , that 's SSSS = 3 and RRRR = 5 and results in the values [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , x ] , where x is in the range - 31..- 16,16..31 .
You decode the following three bits to find the exact value for x .
There are also special codes for 16 zeros ( 0x00 ) and to terminate the AC values for this block ( 0xf0 ) since blocks often end with many zero values .
> huffACDecode :: Tree -> [ Bool ] -> ( [ Int ] , [ Bool ] ) > huffACDecode tree bits = > ( reverse $ concatMap id result , rest ) where > ( result , rest ) = huffACDecodeInner tree bits [ ]
63 > huffACDecodeInner tree bits acc 0 = ( acc , bits ) > huffACDecodeInner tree bits acc n = > let > ( rrrrssss , rest ) = huffTreeLookup tree bits > ( rrrr , ssss ) = ( rrrrssss `shiftR` 4 , rrrrssss .&. 15 ) > ( ssssbits , rest ' ) = splitAt ssss rest > in > if ( rrrr == 0 && ssss == 0 ) > then ( ( take n $ repeat 0 ) : acc , rest ) > else > if rrrr == 15 && ssss == 0 > then huffACDecodeInner tree rest ( ( take 16 $ repeat 0 ) : acc ) ( n - 16 ) > else huffACDecodeInner tree rest ' ( [( jpegDecodeInt ssss ssssbits ) ] : ( take rrrr $ repeat 0 ) : acc ) ( n - ( rrrr + 1 ) )
Clearly , the Huffman encoding of the AC values works best when there are lots of runs of zeros and lots of zeros at the end .
High frequency components are likely to be quantised to zero , but if we take the AC values in raster order the highest frequency components are n't always at the end .
Thus the AC values are encoded in zigzag order .
Here 's a diagram :
And here 's the code :
> deZigZag :: forall a . [ a ] -> [ a ] > deZigZag dctvalues = > map ( (!!) dctvalues ) zigzag where > zigzag = [ 0 , 1 , 5 , 6 , 14 , 15 , 27 , 28 , > 2 , 4 , 7 , 13 , 16 , 26 , 29 , 42 , > 3 , 8 , 12 , 17 , 25 , 30 , 41 , 43 , > 9 , 11 , 18 , 24 , 31 , 40 , 44 , 53 , > 10 , 19 , 23 , 32 , 39 , 45 , 52 , 54 , > 20 , 22 , 33 , 38 , 46 , 51 , 55 , 60 , > 21 , 34 , 37 , 47 , 50 , 56 , 59 , 61 , > 35 , 36 , 48 , 49 , 57 , 58 , 62 , 63 ]
We are , at last ready to decode the JPEG , but first I need to get some helper functions out of the way .
The first two ( groupSize and d8ru ) are trivial .
The last , bytesToBits converts a block of in memory data into a list of bits , removing the stuffed 0x00 after every 0xff ( remember that those stuffed bytes are put there to stop Huffman data looking like the beginning of the next segment ) .
> -- |
Take a list of elements and return a list of lists where each top - level > -- list is l elements long > groupSize :: forall a. Int -> [ a ] -> [ [ a ] ] > groupSize size l = > if length l == 0 > then [ ] > else take size l : ( groupSize size $ drop size l ) > -- |
Divide by 8 , rounding up > d8ru :: Int ->
Int > d8ru x = ceiling ( ( fromIntegral x :: Float ) / 8.0 ) > > bytesToBits :: BS.ByteString -> [ Bool ] > bytesToBits bytes = > concatMap bitsOf $ removeStuffedBytes $ BS.unpack bytes where > bitsOf b = map ( \x -> if x == 0 then False else True ) $ map ( (.&. ) 1 ) $ map ( shiftR b ) $ reverse [ 0..7 ] > removeStuffedBytes :: [ Word8 ] -> [ Word8 ] > removeStuffedBytes word8s = > removeStuffedBytesInner word8s False where > removeStuffedBytesInner [ ]
False = [ ] > removeStuffedBytesInner ( w:ws ) dropThis = > if dropThis > then if w /= 0 > then error " Bad marker in stream " > else removeStuffedBytesInner ws False > else w : ( removeStuffed BytesInner ws ( w == 0xff ) )
Now , the decoding function .
I 've added comments at the end of some of the lines so you can follow along .
First we figure out how many DCT blocks there are ( 0 ) , this is just the number of blocks in a row times the number of rows over the height of a block .
Next , ( 1 ) we decode the DC delta and add it to the last DC value ( 2 ) .
Then we can decode all the AC values ( 3 ) and multiply all the DCT coefficients by the quantisation table ( 4 ) .
Finally we de-zigzag and perform the inverse DCT ( 5 ) and we 're done .
This is done for each DCT block in the file and we end up with a list of 8x8 , pixel value matrices .
These pixel values run from - 128 to 128 ( because the DCT works better when they are symmetric about 0 ) .
Due to some rounding errors , the actual values may exceed that range and thus they need to be clamped at output time .
> decodeJpeg :: JpegState -> [ [ [ Double ] ] ] > decodeJpeg state = > blocks where > ( ( dcvalue , rest ) , blocks ) = mapAccumL decodeBlock ( 0 , bits ) [ 1..numblocks ] > decodeBlock ( pred , bits ) _ = > ( ( dcvalue , rest ' ) , trans $ map ( mv idct8 ) $ trans $ map ( mv idct8 ) ( groupSize 8 $ map fromIntegral $ deZigZag dctvalues ) ) where -- 5 > dctvalues = map ( uncurry ( * ) ) $ zip ( dcvalue : acvalues ) $ map fromIntegral quanttable -- 4 > ( dcdelta , rest ) = huffDCDecode dctree bits -- 1 > dcvalue = dcdelta + pred -- 2 > ( acvalues , rest ' ) = huffACDecode actree rest -- 3 > Just quanttable = Map.lookup 0 $ jsQuantTable state >
Just dctree = Map.lookup ( 0 , fromIntegral $ jsDCTable state ) $ jsHuffTables state >
Just actree = Map.lookup ( 1 , fromIntegral $ jsACTable state ) $ jsHuffTables state > bits = bytesToBits $ jsData state > blocksX = d8ru $ jsWidth state > blocksY = d8ru $ jsHeight state > numblocks = blocksX * blocksY -- 0
Finishing up
The last function outputs the list of pixel value matrices to a PGM file .
We walk each row of DCT values eight times to get each scanline ( 0 ) and , for each pixel value we add 128 and clamp the range ( 1 ) .
And then there 's the main function which just makes an example decoder which reads from test.jpeg and writes to out.pgm .
> writePGM :: forall a. ( RealFrac a ) => String -> JpegState -> [ [ [ a ] ] ] -> IO ( ) > writePGM filename state blocks = do > h hPutStr h ( " P5 " ++ ( show $ 8 * ( d8ru $ jsWidth state ) ) ++ " " ++ ( show $ 8 * ( d8ru $ jsHeight state ) ) ++ " 255
" ) > let outputBlockRow n block = > BS .h Put h $ to Bytes ( block !! n ) > toBytes values = > BS. pack $ map ( \x -> fromIntegral $ min 255 $ max 0 ( ( truncate ( x + 128.0 ) ) :: Int ) ) values -- 1 > outputBlocksInRow blocks = > sequence_ $ concatMap (
-> map ( outputBlockRow n ) blocks ) [ 0..7 ] -- 0 > outputImage = sequence_ $ map outputBlocksInRow $ groupSize blocksX $ take ( blocksX * blocksY ) $ cycle blocks > blocksX = d8ru $ jsWidth state > blocksY = d8ru $ jsHeight state > outputImage > h Close h > > > main = do > h jpegdata let segments = jpegSegments jpegdata > state = foldl updateJpegState ( JpegState Map.empty Map.empty 0 0 0 0 BS.empty ) segments > writePGM " out.pgm " state $ decodeJpeg state
Here 's the result ( converted to a PNG ) :

BBC News , Delhi
Sharadah and her husband work 12 - hour days collecting waste
For many people , discussing toilets may not be an appealing conversation over a cup of tea .
But for experts from more than 40 countries , that is what they are doing at the World Toilet Summit in the Indian capital , Delhi .
The 170 delegates are spending four days examining new ways to provide a basic need to nearly half the world 's population .
It 's an issue that also affects the 700 million Indians without access to toilets , and the hundreds of thousands of Indians who collect their waste .
Worldwide , an estimated 2.6 billion people have no access to safe and hygienic toilets , a number the UN hopes to halve by 2015 as part of its Millennium Development Goals .
We already have flush toilets - what is needed is rehabilitation
Campaigner Bezwada Wilson
India 's sanitation struggle
" Sanitation is an important and urgent issue , " says Bindeshwar Pathak of Sulabh International , an Indian NGO that promotes usage of inexpensive toilets and is joint organiser of this year 's seventh annual summit .
" To achieve the Millennium Goals , it 's essential for us to adopt low - cost technology which is easy to use and simple to implement . "
Open drains
In India , many localities are dependent on what is known as manual scavenging .
Mr Pathak has campaigned on the issue for 30 years
Scavengers , who are invariably from the lower - caste , " untouchable " ( Dalit ) community , clear rubbish and human waste from the streets and open drains outside homes .
Mr Pathak remembers being reprimanded by his grandmother for touching a low - caste woman in his village in the state of Uttar Pradesh .
" She forced me to swallow cow dung , cow urine , sand and Ganges water to purify myself , " recalls Mr Pathak .
He later lived in a scavenger community for over three months , where he was shocked to come across the case of a newly - married woman forced by her in - laws and husband to clean toilets .
For the past three decades , Mr Pathak has worked in the hope that his organisation can liberate scavengers .
He has helped develop a range of cheap , squat - type toilets .
" In India we have half a million scavengers who still manually clean about 10 million toilets daily , " says Mr Pathak .
" If they have done good things for the society by cleaning toilets , what has the society done for them ?
" Society has kept them at the lowest level of the social hierarchy - the untouchables , the lowest among the low . "
' Untouchables '
Most of these scavengers are Dalits - the lowest rung of Hindu society who continue to face discrimination and prejudice .
And an overwhelming 80 % of them are women .
" I 've grown old doing this dirty work , " says Sharadah , a manual scavenger in Nand Nagri , a village on the outskirts of Delhi .
" For the past 20 years I 've been cleaning toilets because this is the only way I can feed my children .
Everyone considers us dirty and stays away from us .
If I was able to find another job , why would I do this ? "
When I first went to do this job ...
I was so overwhelmed by the stench and smell that I felt sick and fainted
Sharadah
Manual scavenger
With a broken cycle - rickshaw , Sharadah and her husband head out every morning to clear away waste .
Visiting about 40 houses and working for more than 12 hours a day , they earn just $ 15 a month - barely enough to support their seven children .
" When I first went to do this job I was 21 years old .
I was so overwhelmed by the stench and smell that I felt sick and fainted , falling in the gutter , " says Sharadah .
" No one came to pick me up because I was covered with filth .
I sat there crying until one of my family members came .
I felt so disgusted that I could not eat the whole day ! "
Sharadah 's daughter , Meena , started working as a scavenger after failing to find other work .
" My husband was unemployed and often drank alcohol or took drugs .
We had no income and I had to find a way out , " she says .
" Initially , I tried looking for a job in a school or nursing home , but no one would take me .
The first question they always ask is your caste - system . "
Eradication
Meena is currently working as a volunteer with Safai Karamchari Andolan ( SKA ) , a nationwide movement aimed at eradicating manual scavenging in India by 2010 .
Manual scavenging was banned by the government
" Manual scavenging is most prevalent in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat , " says Bezwada Wilson , the national convener of SKA .
" This is an issue of dignity .
But working in such nasty conditions , scavengers are also suffering from health problems , " he says .
According to Mr Wilson , the stench forces scavengers to hold their breath for long periods of time , causing respiratory problems .
The Indian government banned manual scavenging in 1993 , but the law is not widely implemented .
" There has not been a single prosecution for violating this law in India , so who will obey or implement this act ?
Most districts are not even aware [ of the law ] , " Mr Wilson says .
" Because of the practice of the caste system in India , people have been forced to do such menial jobs .
Focus should now be given on how to liberate scavengers from this . "
" We already have flush toilets - what is needed is rehabilitation . "
There is a small , but increasingly vocal , group of Republicans who have spoken out in favor of the bill currently pending before the Senate that would give the District of Columbia a vote in the House of Representatives .
As I ’ve mentioned before , one of the chief sponsors of the bill in the House was a Republican , Tom Davis of Virginia , and 22 of his fellow Republicans voted with him .
In the Senate , Orrin Hatch , and apparently his collegue from Utah Robert Bennett , have announced support for the Senate version of the bill .
And , now , apparently , Jack Kemp is prowling the halls of Congress arguing in favor of the bill :
Several Republicans who have switched sides on D.C. voting rights in recent weeks said that Kemp persuaded them to focus on this as the premier civil rights question of the day .
“ I would like someday for African Americans to feel more at home in the Republican Party than they have in the past 70 years , ” said Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana .
“ I cannot believe the Founders intended to deny 550,000 Americans representation . ”
They did n’t .
Frankly , they never really intended for the Federal City to become a major metropolitan area to begin with .
Certainly , outside of the so - called Federal Core in downtown D.C. , most of the city is engaged in business that has little to do with actually running ( as opposed to influencing ) the Federal Government .
That ’s why retrocession of the non-Federal parts of the city to Maryland is what ultimiately makes the most sense .
What the Founders certaintly did n’t intend , though , is for legislators to ignore the Constitution , which is exactly what Kemp and Davis are asking them to do :
Kemp points to Republican opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights
Act as the moment when his party lost the bulk of its black support , and he warns against a repeat performance .
“ Members say , ‘ Well , black people in L.A. do n’t care about this , ’ ” Kemp says of his conversations with lawmakers .
“ Let me tell you , African Americans know that Washington , D.C. , is a majority - black city with an African American mayor .
This is one of the last chances the Republicans have to be a truly national party . ”
Jack , you ’ve been preaching this gospel for almost 30 years now .
And yet every single good idea you had , from tax cuts to enterprise zones , was shot down by the Democratic Party .
Why , then , are you playing into their hands now ?
Do you really think that giving D.C. a vote in Congress is going to attract more African - Americans to the Republican Party ?
If you do , you ’re kidding yourself .
For the many Republicans who still believe that the Constitution poses an impassable barrier , Davis has one plea :
Let the courts decide .
And he has a delicious tool of persuasion , a strongly argued brief in favor of the constitutionality of a D.C. vote written by former special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr and law professor Viet D. Dinh , who helped write the USA Patriot Act .
Both are conservative scholars who draw deep respect from Republicans .
“ I talk to members of Congress about this and they literally walk away , saying the bill is unconstitutional .
Unconstitutional ?
They voted for the Patriot Act ! ” Kemp says .
“ A presidential veto on this would consign the Republican Party in perpetuity to 8 to 10 percent of the black vote . ”
So for the sake of a few votes , Jack Kemp is willing to sacrifice the Constitution and convince legislators to vote for something they know to be unconstitutional .
It makes one wonder just what kind of Republican Party will be left when he ’s done .

Japan puts spacecraft into orbit around the moon
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : October 4 , 2007 ;
Updated with confirmed orbital parameters
Japan 's Kaguya probe slid into lunar orbit late Wednesday after a circuitous 20 - day trek from Earth to begin more than a dozen science investigations designed to gain insights about the moon 's history .
Credit : JAXA
The two - ton spacecraft fired its maneuvering thruster for between 10 and 20 minutes at about 2055 GMT ( 4:55 p.m. EDT ) Wednesday , or in the predawn hours Thursday Japanese time , according to JAXA spokesperson Satoki Kurokawa .
" We have completely done it and found no problem , " Kurokawa said .
Kaguya entered an egg - shaped polar orbit circling the moon at distances ranging from 63 miles up to about 7,296 miles , according to a JAXA statement issued Thursday night .
Subsequent maneuvers are planned over the next two weeks before the spacecraft arrives in a circular orbit with an altitude of about 60 miles .
Two small 110 - pound satellites will be released from Kaguya at different points in the altitude reduction maneuvers .
Called RSAT and VRAD , the satellites will help the main Kaguya orbiter study the weak gravity field on the moon 's far side and probe the tenuous lunar ionosphere by observing interference of radio signals .
RSAT will be released Oct. 9 in an orbit with a high point of 1,500 miles , while VRAD is set for an Oct. 12 deployment in an orbit stretching up to 500 miles from the moon .
Kaguya is scheduled to complete the engine firings by Oct. 19 .
After several more weeks of instrument checkouts , the ten - month observation phase of the mission will begin in December .
A mission extension is likely if Kaguya 's systems are in good health late next year , according to JAXA officials .
The $ 480 million mission began with a fiery Sept. 14 liftoff from Japan 's primary launch site on Tanegashima Island .
The pickup truck - sized probe - also known as SELENE - was deployed from the H - 2A rocket about 45 minutes later .

On - board engines conducted a series of firings to gradually raise the craft 's orbit before eventually sending Kaguya on an arcing trajectory to intercept the moon .
The final burn before arriving at the moon occurred on Saturday to boost Kaguya 's orbit high enough for the probe to be grasped by the moon 's gravity .
The mission includes the first high - definition television camera ever carried to deep space , and the 36 - pound camera already beamed back stunning images of Earth Saturday from a distance of nearly 70,000 miles .
More videos are expected throughout the mission , including spectacular footage of Earth rising above the lunar horizon .
Kurokawa said imagery of the moon from the high - definition camera is expected sometime in December .
The camera was provided to the mission by Japanese broadcasting giant NHK .
The mission features a total of 15 instruments to survey the moon to help chart its history and evolution .
The payload will map the surface , look for evidence of ice trapped in cold spots near the lunar poles , and study the environment in space around the moon .
Kaguya will measure chemical abundances on the moon , and a radar sounder on the probe will pierce the lunar surface to chart underground structures to a depth of several miles .
Spectral instruments on the spacecraft will search for traces of hydrogen near the lunar poles .
Hydrogen is often a signature for the signature for water , and scientists believe deep craters near the moon 's poles could harbor water ice because they never see sunlight .
A sensor at the tip of a 39 - foot - long boom will gather data on the moon 's feeble magnetic field .
Other space environment payloads included aboard Kaguya will study the solar wind and lunar ionosphere .
Information on the lunar radiation environment will prove valuable in planning future human voyages to the moon , according to JAXA scientists .

My brother loves Woot , an online store that sells “ cool stuff ” for cheap .
Woot sells one geeky item every day .
The site can be addictive .
You 've been warned .
Finally , if you purchase products online , do n't forget to use PriceProtectr , the smart little web app that helps you take advantage of “ price protection ” guarantees .
A Word of Warning
If you visit these sites , you 'll see that many offer the same services : online coupon codes , deal aggregation , rebate tracking , etc .
How do you decide which one to use ?
I think it ultimately comes down to which interface you prefer , which site makes it easiest to find deals on the items you regularly purchase .
That last point is key : A deal is only a deal if it's a good price on something you would purchase anyhow .
If a site induces you to buy something you had n't intended to buy in the first place , it 's not saving you any money .
This is why I avoid sites like Woot .
Yes , I know Woot offers great deals .
But I 'm worried that it would simply cause me to buy stuff I do not want or need .
Wow , the NY Post hits Rudy over his touting of 9/11 ...
And I thought he said he was n't running on 9/11 :
Rudy Giuliani is trumpeting his leadership in the wake of 9/11 in campaign mailings to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire .
In one piece , Giuliani is hailed as " America 's Mayor " who displayed " Strength through Leadership .
Giuliani has repeatedly challenged accusations that his candidacy is based solely on the attacks , saying during a recent debate , " The reality is that I 'm not running on what I did on Sept. 11 . "
NYers will not let him get away with this .
Well , on the New Hampshire delegate count : 12 to Clinton 's 11 .
If I 'm reading it right .
Fired up !
Ready to go !
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
First off , I would like to say much thanks to Gwoo for finally helping me to understand this thing .
So I know what you 're thinking ; I 'm probably the last person to finally figure out the CakePHP 's Auth Component .
For the past few months , I 've been using obAuth because that 's the only authentication I could get to work with CakePHP .
I think that I was just making it more difficult than it should have been .
My main resource for learning the Auth Component has been Chris 's tutorial , but even then I still needed help .
Also , I 'm the type that does n't really learn much without code .
Note that I 'm running off of the CaekPHP 1.2 beta .
Getting Started
Now you can modify this however you like , but I 'm starting out with the basics .
You 're going to need the following :
A user database with fields username , password .
Of course they do n't need to be named that way , but defaults are fun .
A User Model with Controller and Views -
This can be baked from CakePHP
A login view for the user .
And a base app_controller .
php .
That 's it .
The Setup - app_controller and users_controller
So here 's the minimum in app_controller :
var $ components = array ( ' Auth ' ) ; function beforeFilter ( ) { $ this -> Auth -> loginAction = array ( ' controller ' => ' users ' , ' action ' => ' login ' ) ; $ this -> Auth -> loginRedirect = array ( ' controller ' => ' pages ' , ' action ' => ' display ' , ' home ' ) ; $ this -> Auth -> allow ( ' display ' ) ; $ this -> Auth -> authorize = ' controller ' ; } function isAuthorized ( ) { return true ; }
You can always visit the API for a better understanding of what 's going on , but right now we 're just trying to get stuff working .
After that there 's the users_controller .
php .
This you can get straight out of CakePHP 's baking .
You do need a small modification :
function login ( ) { } function logout ( ) { $ this -> Session ->setFlash ( ' Logout ' ) ; $ this ->redirect ( $ this -> Auth -> logout ( ) ) ; }
Brief Explanation
Honestly , it 's magic ; automagic to be precise .
If you want to know how it works , you can read up in the API .
But what I will do , is give you some of the magic words .
$ this -> Auth -> authorize = ‘ controller ’
There are different types of authorization action ( ugh - ACL stuff ) , CRUD ( basically locks up all the editing stuff ) , and controller ( gives you some need control ) .
Hey , sorry I do n't know too much of what it does , just what I need .
$ this ->Auth-> loginAction = array ( ‘ controller ’ => ‘ users ’ , ‘ action ’ => ‘ login ’ )
This tells yo what the login page is .
It also controls where the user is redirected to if he 's not authorized to view a page .
$ this ->Auth->loginRedirect = array ( ‘ controller ’ => ‘ pages ’ , ‘ display ’ => ‘ home ’ )
Self explanatory : default action to redirect the user to when logged in if they go straight to the login page .
If , however , they tried to access a restricted page then this will be ignored and when they login they 'll be redirected to where they wanted to go to .
$ this -> Auth -> allow ( array ( ‘ display ’ ) )
This is one of the magic functions .
By default , adding the authentication component locks down all actions , except the login and logout .
This is your way of telling the component let me in to the ‘ display ’ action for every controller .
You at least want to see the homepage right ?
You can also add to this in the beforeFilter ( ) of each controller you you need ( do n't forget the parent : : beforeFilter ( ) to make sure the Auth stuff is still called ) .
Likewise there 's a $ this -> Auth -> deny ( ) , which does the reverse .
One small tip : you can also use allow ( array ( '*' ) ) to allow everything .
User Controller
For right now , the login ( ) action can be left as is .
The Auth Component handles all that foot work beautifully .
You just need to make sure you call $ this -> Auth -> logout ( ) in your logout ( ) action .
It has the added benefit of returning the Auth 's logoutRedirect , so $ this -> redirect ( $ this -> Auth -> logout ( ) works great .
There you have it , I hope that helps .
Now if you 're still having a hard time , I got a present for you :
CakePHP Auth 1 ( 4.3 KiB , 18,444 hits )
There you 'll find some code , to get you up and running .
It 's slightly different from what I got above ( some extra stuff ) , but it 's heavily documented .
Enjoy and Happy Baking !

Ralph Nader Flirts with Presidential Bid With harsh words for current field , Nader says candidacy as urgent as ever
Jan. 30 , 2008  -- Ralph Nader has formed a presidential exploratory committee , and said in an interview Wednesday that he will launch another presidential bid if he 's convinced he can raise enough money to appear on the vast majority of state ballots this fall .
Nader , who ran as an independent candidate in each of the past three presidential elections , told ABCNews.com that he will run in 2008 if he is convinced over the next month that he would be able to raise $ 10 million over the course of the campaign — and attract enough lawyers willing to work free of charge to get his name on state ballots .
Nader said he established an exploratory committee and launched a Web site after Dennis Kucinich , a liberal Ohio congressman , announced his decision to withdraw from the presidential race last week .
He was set to announce that he had formed an exploratory committee Wednesday , even before former Sen .
John Edwards made it known that he'd be ending his candidacy .
But with Edwards — who has made economic populism and ending poverty cornerstones of his campaign — leaving the Democratic field , Nader said , he feels his candidacy is more urgent than ever .
" When Kucinich threw in the towel , now you have Edwards gone — who 's going to carry the torch of democratic populism against the relentless domination of powerful corporations of our government ? "
Nader said .
" You ca n't just brush these issues to the side because the candidates are ignoring them . "
He has harsh words for the leading Democratic candidates , Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama , chastising them for failing to advance aggressive plans to tax corporations more fairly , and to fight for a vastly higher minimum wage .
Obama , he said , is a particular disappointment , since his background suggests that he knows the importance of progressive issues yet has n't fought for them in the Senate .
" His record in the Senate is pretty mediocre , " Nader said .
" His most distinctive characteristic is the extent to which he censors himself .
He has n't performed as a really progressive first - term senator would . "
His " self - censorship , " Nader said , " is a reflection of character . "
He 's no kinder to the Republican frontrunner , Sen. John McCain .
" Senator McCain is the candidate of perpetual war , " he said .
Nader also rejects the " spoiler " label many Democrats have applied to him since 2000 , when his candidacy was blamed in some circles for helping defeat Democratic candidate Al Gore .
" That is the sign of political bigotry , " he said .
" Why are n't the major candidates spoilers ?
They represent parties that spoil our electoral system and our government . "

The Albion Park section of Second Life is generally a quiet place , a haven of whispering fir trees and babbling brooks set aside for those who " need to be alone to think , or want to chat privately . "
But shortly after 5 pm Eastern time on November 16 , an avatar appeared in the 3 - D - graphical skies above this online sanctuary and proceeded to unleash a mass of undiluted digital jackassery .
The avatar , whom witnesses would describe as an African - American male clad head to toe in gleaming red battle armor , detonated a device that instantly filled the air with 30 - foot - wide tumbling blue cubes and gaping cartoon mouths .
For several minutes the freakish objects rained down , immobilizing nearby players with code that forced them to either log off or watch their avatars endlessly text - shout Arnold Schwarzenegger 's " Get to the choppaaaaaaa ! " tagline from Predator .
The incident , it turns out , was not an isolated one .
The same scene , with minor variations , was unfolding simultaneously throughout the virtual geography of Second Life .
Some cubes were adorned on every side with the infamous , soul - searing " goatse " image ; others were covered with the grinning face of Bill Cosby proffering a Pudding Pop .
Soon after the attacks began , the governance team at San Francisco - based Linden Lab , the company that runs Second Life , identified the vandals and suspended their accounts .
In the popular NorthStar hangout , players located the offending avatars and fired auto - cagers , which wrapped the attackers ' heads in big metallic boxes .
And at the Gorean city of Rovere — a Second Life island given over to a peculiarly hardcore genre of fantasy role - play gaming — a player named Chixxa Lusch straddled his giant eagle mount and flew up to confront the invaders avatar - to - avatar as they hovered high above his lovingly re-created medieval village , blanketing it with bouncing 10 - foot high Super Mario figures .
" Give us a break you fucks , " typed Chixxa Lusch , and when it became clear that they had no such intention , he added their names to the island 's list of banned avatars and watched them disappear .
" Wankers , " he added , descending into the mess of Super Marios they 'd left behind for him to clear .
Bans and cages and account blocks could only slow the attackers , not stop them .
The raiders , constantly creating new accounts , moved from one location to another throughout the night until , by way of a finale , they simultaneously crashed many of the servers that run Second Life .
And by that time , there was not the slightest mystery in anyone 's minds who these particular wankers were : The Patriotic Nigras had struck again .
The Patriotic Nigras consist of some 150 shadowy individuals who , in the words of their official slogan , have been " ruining your Second Life since 2006 . "
Before that , many of them were doing their best to ruin Habbo Hotel , a Finland - based virtual world for teens inhabited by millions of squat avatars reminiscent of Fisher - Price 's Little People toys .
That 's when the PNs adopted their signature dark - skinned avatar with outsize Afro and Armani suit .
Though real - life details are difficult to come by , it 's clear that few , if any , PNs are in fact African - American .
But their blackface shenanigans , they say , are n't racist in any heartfelt sense .
" Yeah , the thing about the racist thing , " says ban , leader of the Patriotic Nigras , " is ... it 's all just a joke . "
It 's only one element , he insists , in an arsenal of PN techniques designed to push users past the brink of moral outrage toward that rare moment — at once humiliating and enlightening — when they find themselves crying over a computer game .
Getting that response is what it 's all about , the Nigras say .
" We do it for the lulz , " ban says — for laughs .
Asked how some people can find their greatest amusement in pissing off others , ban gives the question a moment 's thought : " Most of us , " he says finally , with a wry chuckle , " are psychotic . "
In 2006 , griefers let loose with a rain of phalluses to interrupt a CNET interview in Second Life .
__Pwnage , zerging , phat lewts — __online gaming has birthed a rich lexicon .
But none , perhaps , deserves our attention as much as the notion of the griefer .
Broadly speaking , a griefer is an online version of the spoilsport — someone who takes pleasure in shattering the world of play itself .
Not that griefers do n't like online games .
It 's just that what they most enjoy about those games is making other players not enjoy them .
They are corpse campers , noob baiters , kill stealers , ninja looters .
Their work is complete when the victims log off in a huff .
Griefing , as a term , dates to the late 1990s , when it was used to describe the willfully antisocial behaviors seen in early massively multiplayer games like Ultima Online and first - person shooters like Counter - Strike ( fragging your own teammates , for instance , or repeatedly killing a player many levels below you ) .
But even before it had a name , grieferlike behavior was familiar in prehistoric text - based virtual worlds like LambdaMOO , where joyriding invaders visited " virtual rape " and similar offenses on the local populace .
While ban and his pals stand squarely in this tradition , they also stand for something new : the rise of organized griefing , grounded in online message - board communities and thick with in - jokes , code words , taboos , and an increasingly articulate sense of purpose .
No longer just an isolated pathology , griefing has developed a full - fledged culture .
This particular culture 's roots can be traced to a semi-mythic place of origin : the members - only message forums of Something Awful , an online humor site dedicated to a brand of scorching irreverence and gross - out wit that , in its eight years of existence , has attracted a fanatical and almost all - male following .
Strictly governed by its founder , Rich " Lowtax " Kyanka , the site boasts more than 100,000 registered Goons ( as members proudly call themselves ) and has spawned a small diaspora of spinoff sites .
Most noticeable is the anime fan community 4 chan , with its notorious /b/ forum and communities of " / b/ tards . "
Flowing from this vast ecosystem are some of the Web 's most infectious memes and catchphrases ( " all your base are belong to us " was popularized by Something Awful , for example ; 4 chan gave us lolcats ) and online gaming 's most exasperating wiseasses .
Not all the message boards celebrate the griefers in their midst : Kyanka finds griefing lame , as do many Goons and / b/ tards .
Nor do the griefers themselves all get along .
Patriotic Nigras , /b/ tards all , look on the somewhat better - behaved Goon community — in particular the W - Hats , a Second Life group open only to registered Something Awful members — as a bunch of uptight sellouts .
The W - Hats disavow any affiliation with the " immature " and " uncreative " Nigras other than to ruefully acknowledge them as " sort of our retarded children . "
If there 's one thing , though , that all these factions seem to agree on , it 's the philosophy summed up in a regularly invoked catchphrase : " The Internet is serious business . "
Look it up in the Encyclopedia Dramatica ( a wikified lexicon of all things /b/) and you 'll find it defined as : " a phrase used to remind [ the reader ] that being mocked on the Internets is , in fact , the end of the world . "
In short , " the Internet is serious business " means exactly the opposite of what it says .
It encodes two truths held as self - evident by Goons and / b/ tards alike — that nothing on the Internet is so serious it can't be laughed at , and that nothing is so laughable as people who think otherwise .
To see the philosophy in action , skim the pages of Something Awful or Encyclopedia Dramatica , where it seems every pocket of the Web harbors objects of ridicule .
Vampire goths with MySpace pages , white supremacist bloggers , self - diagnosed Asperger 's sufferers coming out to share their struggles with the online world — all these and many others have been found guilty of taking themselves seriously and condemned to crude but hilarious derision .
You might think that the realm of online games would be exempt from the scorn of Goons and / b/ tards .
How seriously can anyone take a game , after all ?
And yet , if you 've ever felt your cheeks flush with anger and humiliation when some 14 - year - old Night Elf in virtual leather tights kicks your ass , then you know that games are the place where online seriousness and online ridiculousness converge most intensely .
And it's this fact that truly sets the griefer apart from the mere spoilsport .
Amid the complex alchemy of seriousness and play that makes online games so uniquely compelling , the griefer is the one player whose fun depends on finding that elusive edge where online levity starts to take on real - life weight — and the fight against serious business has finally made it seem as though griefers ' fun might have something like a point .
Second Life entrepreneur Prokofy Neva ( Catherine Fitzpatrick in real life ) likens griefer attacks to terrorism .
Photo : Michael SchmellingHistory has forgotten the name of the Something Awful Goon who first laid eyes on Second Life , but his initial reaction was undoubtedly along the lines of " Bingo . "
It was mid-2004 , and Goons were already an organized presence in online games , making a name for themselves as formidable players as well as flamboyantly creative griefers .
The Goon Squad guilds in games like Dark Age of Camelot and Star Wars : Galaxies had been active for several years .
In World of Warcraft , the legendary Goons of the Mal ' ganis server had figured out a way to slay the revered nonplayer character that rules their in - game faction — an achievement tantamount to killing your own team mascot .
But Second Life represented a new frontier in troublemaking potential .
It was serious business run amok .
Here was an entire population of players that insisted Second Life was not a game — and a developer that encouraged them to believe it , facilitating the exchange of in - game Linden dollars for real money and inviting corporations to market virtual versions of their actual products .
And better still , here was a game that had somehow become the Internet 's top destination for a specimen of online weirdo the Goons had long ago adopted as their favorite target : the Furries , with their dedication to role - playing the lives — and sex lives — of cuddly anthropomorphic woodland creatures .
Thus began the Second Life Goon tradition of jaw - droppingly offensive theme lands .
This has included the re-creation of the burning Twin Towers ( tiny falling bodies included ) and a truly icky murdered - hooker crime scene ( in which a hermaphrodite Furry prostitute lay naked , violated , and disemboweled on a four - poster bed , while an assortment of coded - in options gave the visitor chances for further violation ) .
But the first and perhaps most expertly engineered of these provocations was Tacowood — a parody of the Furry region known as Luskwood .
In Tacowood , rainbow - dappled woodlands have been overrun by the bulldozers and chain saws of a genocidal " defurrestation " campaign and populated with the corpses of formerly adorable cartoon animal folk now variously beheaded , mutilated , and nailed to crosses .
As the media hype around Second Life grew , the Goons began to aim at bigger targets .
When a virtual campaign headquarters for presidential candidate John Edwards was erected , a parody site and scatological vandalism followed .
When SL real estate magnate Anshe Chung announced she had accumulated more than $ 1 million in virtual assets and got her avatar 's picture splashed across the cover of BusinessWeek , the stage was set for a Second Life goondom 's spotlight moment : the interruption of a CNET interview with Chung by a procession of floating phalluses that danced out of thin air and across the stage .
People laughed at those attacks , but for Prokofy Neva , another well - known Second Life real estate entrepreneur , no amount of humor or creativity can excuse what she sees as " terrorism . "
Prokofy ( Catherine Fitzpatrick in real life , a Manhattan resident , mother of two , and Russian translator and human - rights worker by trade ) earns a modest but bankable income renting out her Second Life properties , and griefing attacks aimed at her , she says , have rattled some tenants enough to make them cancel their leases .
Which is why her response to those who defend her griefers as anything but glorified criminals is blunt : " Fuck , this is a denial - of - service attack ... it 's anti-civilization ... it 's wrong ... it costs me hundreds of US dollars . "
Of course , this attitude delights the terrorists in question , and they 've made Prokofy a favorite target .
The 51 - year - old Fitzpatrick 's avatar is male , but Goons got ahold of a photo of her , and great sport has been made of it ever since .
One build featured a giant Easter Island head of Fitzpatrick spitting out screenshots of her blog .
Another time , Prokofy teleported into one of her rental areas and had the " very creepy " experience of seeing her own face looking straight down from a giant airborne image overhead .
Still , even the fiercest of Prokofy 's antagonists recognize her central point :
Once real money is at stake , " serious business " starts to look a lot like , well , serious business , and messing with it starts to take on buzz - killing legal implications .
Pressed as to the legality of their griefing , PNs are quick to cite the distinction made in Second Life 's own terms of service between real money and the " fictional currency " that circulates in - game .
As ban puts it , " This is our razor - thin disclaimer which protects us in real - life " from what /b/ tards refer to as " a ride in the FBI party van . "
Real money is n't always enough to give a griefer pause , however .
Sometimes , in fact , it 's just a handy way of measuring exactly how serious the griefers ' game can get .
Consider the case of the Avatar class Titan , flown by the Band of Brothers Guild in the massively multiplayer deep - space EVE Online .
The vessel was far bigger and far deadlier than any other in the game .
Kilometers in length and well over a million metric tons unloaded , it had never once been destroyed in combat .
Only a handful of player alliances had ever acquired a Titan , and this one , in particular , had cost the players who bankrolled it in - game resources worth more than $ 10,000 .
So , naturally , Commander Sesfan Qu'lah , chief executive of the GoonFleet Corporation and leader of the greater GoonSwarm Alliance — better known outside EVE as Isaiah Houston , senior and medieval - history major at Penn State University — led a Something Awful invasion force to attack and destroy it .
" EVE was designed to be a cold , hard , unforgiving world , " explains EVE producer Sígurlina Ingvarsdóttir .
It 's this attitude that has made EVE uniquely congenial for Goons .
" The ability to inflict that huge amount of actual , real - life damage on someone is amazingly satisfying " says Houston .
" The way that you win in EVE is you basically make life so miserable for someone else that they actually quit the game and do n't come back . "
And the only way to make someone that miserable is to destroy whatever virtual thing they 've sunk the most real time , real money , and , above all , real emotion into .
Find the player who 's flying the biggest , baddest spaceship and paid for it with the proceeds of hundreds of hours mining asteroids , then blow that spaceship up .
" That 's his life investment right there , " Houston says .
The Goons , on the other hand , fly cheap little frigates into battle , get blown up , go grab another ship , and jump back into the fight .
Their motto : " We choke the guns of our enemies with our corpses . "
Some other players consider the tactic a less - than - sporting end run around a fair fight , still others call it an outright technical exploit , designed to lag the server so the enemy can't move in reinforcements .
Either way , it works , and the success just adds force to GoonFleet 's true secret weapon : morale .
" EVE is the only game I can think of in which morale is an actual quantifiable source of success , " Houston says .
" It 's impossible to make another person stop playing or quit the game unless their spirit is , you know , crushed . "
And what makes the Goons ' spirit ultimately uncrushable is knowing , in the end , that they 're actually playing a different game altogether .
As one GoonFleet member 's online profile declared , " You may be playing EVE Online , but be warned : We are playing Something Awful . "
The Internet is serious business , all right .
And of all the ironies inherent in that axiom , perhaps the richest is the fate of the arch - Goon himself , Rich Kyanka .
He started Something Awful for laughs in 1999 , when he began regularly spotlighting an " Awful Link of the Day . "
He depends on revenue from SA to sustain not just himself but his pregnant wife , their 2 - year - old daughter , two dogs , a cat , and the mortgage on a five - bedroom suburban mini-manor in Missouri .
His foothold in the upper middle class rests entirely on the enduring comic appeal of goofy Internet crap .
Sitting in his comfortable basement office at the heart of the Something Awful empire , surrounded by more monitors than the job could possibly require and a growing collection of arch pop-surrealist paintings , Kyanka recounts some of the more memorable moments .
Among them : numerous cease - and - desist letters from targets of SA 's ridicule , threats of impending bodily harm from a growing community of rage - aholics permabanned from the SA forums , and actual bodily harm from B - movie director Uwe Boll .
A onetime amateur boxer , Boll publicly challenged his online critics to a day of one - on - one real - world fights and then pummeled all who showed up , Kyanka among them .
( See " Raging Boll , " issue 14.12 . )
Given that track record , you might think that a family man and sole breadwinner like Kyanka would be looking into another line of work by now .
But he 's still at it , proudly .
" My whole mindset is , there are terrible things on the Internet : Can I write about them and transform them into something humorous ? "
But ultimately , Kyanka 's persistence is a testament to just how seriously he refuses to take the Internet seriously .
Consider :
When comments on the Web site of popular tech blogger Kathy Sierra escalated from anonymous vitriol to anonymous death threats last March , it sparked a story that inspired weeks of soul - searching and calls for uniform standards of behavior among bloggers and their communities .
In response , Kyanka wrote a Something Awful column , which began with the question : " Can somebody please explain to me how is this news ? "
Kyanka went on to review the long and bloodless history of death threats among Internet commenters , then revealed his own impressive credentials as a target : " I 've been getting death threats for years now .
I 'm the king of online dying , " he wrote .
" Furries hate me , Juggalos hate me , script kiddies hate me , people banned from our forums hate me , people not banned from our forums hate me , people who hate people banned from our forums hate me ... everybody hates me . "
So far , so flip .
But almost as an afterthought , Kyanka appended the text of a death threat sent from a banned ex-Goon , aimed not at him but at his infant daughter : " Collateral damage .
Remember those words when I kick in your door , duct tape Lauren Seoul 's mouth , fuck her in the ass , and toss her over a bridge . "
Next to that text , Kyanka posted a photo of himself holding the smiling little girl .
His evident confidence in his own safety , and that of the child in his arms , was strangely moving — in an unnerving sort of way .
Moving , and maybe even illuminating .
In the end , no matter what they say , life on the Internet really is a serious business .
It matters .
But the tricky thing is that it matters above all because it mostly does n't — because it conjures bits of serious human connection from an oceanic flow of words , pictures , videoclips , and other weightless shadows of what 's real .
The challenge is sorting out the consequential from the not - so - much .
And , if Rich Kyanka 's steely equanimity is any example , the antics of the Goons and /b/ tards might actually sharpen our ability to make that distinction .
To those who think the griefers ' handiwork is simply inexcusable :
Well , being inexcusable is , after all , the griefers ' job .
Ours is to figure out that caring too much only gives them more of the one thing they crave : the lulz .

William Hooper designs mathematical trading models
The financial markets are increasingly dominated by a new breed of highly mathematical traders , known as quantitative analysts or " quants " .
Whilst some celebrate the fact that empirical techniques are now applied to trading , others blame the quants for the current credit squeeze .
Even on More or Less , BBC Radio 4's weekly excursion into the world of numbers , we are prepared to admit that the image of the mathematician is not a particularly glamorous one .
So when we managed to penetrate the secretive world of super - rich financial mathematicians known as " quants " we saw the chance to challenge popular perception .
Model trader
Hedge funds and banks now offer talented mathematicians the chance to earn the sort of money more usually associated with top professional footballers and rock stars .
" My model is one of those which prints money , " says maths graduate William Hooper from the comfort of his luxury home in Hampstead , one of London 's most desirable suburbs .
The mathematical model he has designed to trade currencies does not of course literally print money but it has made huge sums for both him and the bank where he works .
We just require people to be clever and obsessively interested in research
David Harding , Winton Capital Management
He will not reveal exactly how much he earns but he says that so - called algorithmic traders are usually paid about 20 % of the money their model makes and the typical algorithmic trader will make his employer about US $ 10 - 20 million a year .
Those prepared to take bigger risks , he says , can make billions .
His website shows him enjoying the high life in the company of beautiful girlfriends .
He says he enjoys spending his money on hi tech gadgets , art and champagne and , as his model does all the trading , he has plenty of time to work out in the gym and to go on adventure holidays .
" It 's a nice way to trade , " he says .
Social skills
William almost goes out of his way to confound the traditional stereotype of the shy genius who is more comfortable working out complicated algorithms than interacting with fellow human beings .
According to recruitment consultant Matthew Hall , having the social skills to communicate with less numerate colleagues is essential for those who want to get a job as a quant in a bank .
Some say quantative analysts are to blame for the credit crunch
But there is also a market for the intellectual recluse .
Many of the quant hedge funds are looking for raw intelligence and little else .
When I telephoned one fund to ask if we could interview some of their quants , the receptionist told me that I was unlikely to get permission , partly because of the secretive , commercially sensitive nature of their work but also , because many of them in that fund are autistic .
David Harding , who heads London - based hedge fund Winton Capital Management , recruits top mathematicians from all over the world .
" In today 's world there 's a good market for social skills .
We do not necessarily require that , " he says .
" We just require people to be clever and obsessively interested in research . "
Opaque instruments
Since this summer 's liquidity crisis however the quants have found themselves being criticised for more than just a lack of social skills .
Some blame them for the crisis itself .
The quants have been crucial to the creation of increasingly complex financial instruments that are so opaque that few people really understand them .
The idea that computer programmes are the biggest force in the market is unnerving to some people
Paul Kedrosky , US hedge fund director
Their critics cite the so - called Collateralised Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) based on sub - prime mortgages as an example of the sort of fiendishly complicated financial instrument that carries more risk than investors realise .
Furthermore , the quants , so the theory goes , have all been relying on the same models so , when one fund wants to divest itself of a particular type of asset , many other funds will have decided simultaneously to do the same thing .
When the quants ' models lose money , the banks have little left to lend to the rest of us .
This has become a popular explanation of how the current liquidity crisis came about .
It even formed the basis of a recent sketch by the British television comedians John Bird and John Fortune .
But is it fair ?
According to Professor William Perraudin , Chair of Finance at Imperial College London 's Tanaka Business School :
" The quants are a fairly innocent part of all this .
It is the senior people who make decisions about taking on risk who bear the responsibility . "
Quant bashing
US hedge fund director Paul Kedrosky thinks that quant bashing has gone too far .
" Turning an important and multi-faceted story into The Attack of the Killer Quants ! is shallow and unhelpful , " he told readers of his financial blog Infectious Greed .
Defaults in the US housing market triggered the credit crunch
He feels much of the criticism is fear based on ignorance .
" To people who were raised on the idea that stocks were something you diligently researched by reading the Financial Times and the Wall Street journal then buy a little , this is scary stuff , " Mr Kedrosky says .
" The idea that computer programmes are the biggest force in the market is unnerving to some people . "
However , one well - known quant thinks that there are good reasons to apportion at least part of the blame to the financial mathematicians .
Paul Wilmott is someone with privileged access to the usually secretive world of the quants .
He runs a website where quants discuss mathematical problems and can watch lectures on quantitative finance 24 hours a day .
He talks regularly to those working in a wide range of banks and hedge funds .
He believes the accusation that many banks use the same models is true : " The way in which quants are compensated encourages them to use the same strategies as everyone else . "
He claims that many quants calculate that if they lose money as a result of following a novel strategy they will be fired .
However , if they lose money as a result of following the same strategy as everyone else , they will not get the blame .
" The problem with this , " says Mr Wilmott , " is that if something bad happens , it happens across the board . "
Consumer benefits
Another problem , according to Mr Wilmott , is that academically trained mathematicians are more used to modelling sound physical principles than difficult - to - predict financial markets :
" With finance you are essentially modelling human beings which is much more tricky . "
The use of mathematical models may be risky but getting rid of the quants would be a mistake according to Professor Perraudin .
Ordinary consumers , he says , have benefited from the quants ' inventiveness : " The quants have enabled financial institutions to behave in a super efficient way , committing as little capital as possible to their activities . "
This has allowed relatively small competitors to take on the larger institutions in the provision of financial services and led , in turn , to cheaper loans .
" If we returned to old fashioned ways of trading , " he warns , " the terms of borrowing would be far worse . "

White House officials have now admitted that George W. Bush was told that the intelligence assessment on a covert Iranian nuclear program might change last August , but they have avoided answering the question of when the president was first informed about the new intelligence that led to that revised assessment .
That evasion is necessary , it now appears , to conceal the fact that Bush likely knew about that intelligence as early as February or March 2007 .
The White House evasions began on the day the “ key judgments ” in the Iran National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) were released .
At his Dec. 3 press conference , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley was asked , “ So was it recent weeks that this intelligence came in ? ”
Hadley answered , “ What the intelligence community has said is in the last few months . ”
In fact , no intelligence official had commented on when the crucial intelligence had been first obtained .
Then a journalist asked , “ Steve , when was the first time the president was given the inkling of something ?
Was this months ago , when the first information started to become available to intelligence agencies ? ”
This time Hadley responded , “ You ought to go back to the intelligence community . ”
The evidence now available strongly suggests , however , that Hadley dodged the question not because he did not know the answer , but because he did not wish to reveal that Bush had been informed about the new intelligence months before the August meeting with Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell .
The key development that altered the course of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , according to intelligence sources , was the defection of a senior official of the Iranian Ministry of Defense , Ali Reza Asgari , on a visit to Turkey last February , as widely reported in international news media in subsequent weeks .
The Washington Post ‘s Dafna Linzer , citing a “ senior U.S. official , ” reported on March 8 that Asgari , who had been deputy minister of defense for eight years under the reformist President Mohammad Khatami from 1997 to 2005 , was already providing information to U.S. intelligence .
The senior official told Linzer , however , that Asgari was not being questioned about Iran ’s nuclear program , despite the fact that Asgari certainly had significant knowledge of policy decisions , if not technical details , of the nuclear program
That incongruous denial that Asgari had anything to say about Iran ’s nuclear program suggested that the information being provided by Asgari on that subject was considered extraordinarily sensitive .
Intelligence officials have kept any reference to Asgari out of the discussion of the NIE .
Former CIA officer Philip Giraldi has told IPS , however , that , according to intelligence sources , information provided by Asgari was indeed a “ key component ” of the intelligence community ’s conclusion that Iran ended its nuclear weapons - related work in 2003 , although it was corroborated by other sources .
Giraldi says Asgari had been recruited by Turkish intelligence in 2003 , and defected to Turkey after he had picked up indications that Iranian intelligence had become suspicious of him .
Giraldi said his sources confirm press reports that Asgari came out with “ bags of documents . ”
Intelligence officials have confirmed that papers on military discussions of the nuclear program were part of the evidence that led the analysts to the new conclusion about the Iranian nuclear program .
Equally important to the NIE ’s conclusion , according to Giraldi , was the information provided by Asgari about the Iranian defense communications system that allowed U.S. intelligence to gain new access to sensitive communications within the Iranian military .
That was a crucial to the intercepted electronic communications which also played a role in the analysis that led to the estimate ’s conclusion .
Gary Sick , who was the principal White House aide on Iran during the Carter administration and is now a senior research scholar at the Middle East Institute of Columbia University ’s School of International and Public Affairs , says he believes Asgari ’s knowledge of the debate in Tehran ’s defense establishment also may have allowed the intelligence community to identify which intercepted communications were most important .
“ There are zillions of pieces of evidence , and what you look for is defined by what you know , ” says Sick .
“ What Asgari gave them was a new way of looking at the evidence . ”
There are other indications that , by April 2007 , the intelligence community was already intensively reviewing new evidence provided by Asgari and old evidence that the new information suggested could corroborate it .
Thomas Fingar , chair of the National Intelligence Council , who was directing the whole NIE process , gave an exclusive interview to NPR ’s Mary Louis Kelly on April 27 in which he dropped hints of the new phase of the NIE process .
Fingar referred to “ some new information we have ” and declared , “ We are serious about reexamining old evidence . ”
Fingar even said that the estimated time frame for Iran ’s obtaining a nuclear weapon “ might change , ” because “ we are being completely open - minded and taking a fresh look at the subject . ”
It now seems clear that these were references to the search for corroboration of the basic intelligence obtained from Asgari about the Iranian nuclear program .
But Fingar misled listeners about the direction of the intelligence community ’s investigation by seeming to suggest that advances in Iranian uranium enrichment announced earlier that month might cause analysts to shorten the minimum time frame within which Iran might have sufficient fissile material for a bomb .
Fingar said the evidence that Iran was beginning to enrich on an “ industrial scale ” was “ one of the questions we have got to weigh the new information to see what it does to our judgment . ”
He also referred to International Atomic Energy Agency reports on the Iranian program , allowing listeners to infer that that the delay in the NIE was due to new evidence that would lead to a more alarmist estimate on Iran ’s nuclear program
The Fingar interview suggests that the process of seeking corroboration of the 2003 change in nuclear policy in Iran was already well underway in April .
The intelligence on the Iranian nuclear program obtained as a result of the U.S. debriefing of Asgari , however , would have been made available to Bush as soon as it was evaluated as important by the intelligence officials .
The debriefing of a high - ranking defector represents very important intelligence , and summaries of the most important information from such a debriefing would normally go into the Presidential Daily Brief ( PDB ) , the summary of key intelligence developments that is prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency each night and given to the White House the first thing the next morning .
“ It is inconceivable to me that the PDB did not included whatever information Asgari gave us on the nuclear program , ” says Ray McGovern , a 26 - year veteran of CIA who once presented the daily briefing to Richard Nixon .
Furthermore , every major new development in the collection of intelligence obtained as a result of Asgari ’s debriefings would have been included in the PDB , according to McGovern .
Contrary to Hadley ’s suggestion that he did n’t know when Bush had first gotten the new intelligence , moreover , McGovern points out that the national security adviser has gotten the same PDB as the president for decades .
The former CIA analyst told IPS that Hadley certainly would have known when the new intelligence regarding the covert Iranian nuclear weapons program was presented to the president .

Via CNN :
CNN has learned that top staff members of Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign were asked to work without pay for the month of January , and perhaps longer , so that campaign resources could be focused on the Florida Republican presidential primary .
Two sources in the campaign , speaking on condition of anonymity , insisted the campaign was not in dire financial straits .
A third campaign source , however , said " things are starting to get tight " and that " it was more telling than asking " the senior staff to forgo paychecks beginning the first of the year .
Another source disagreed , saying it was a " voluntary " move by senior staff members " so all of our resources could be targeted toward Florida … Our campaign is not living hand to mouth right now … "

The interesting result was that some of the rebuttals were quite insightful , and resulted in me making changes to the argument that I would make if I had to present it again .
Judging by the literacy and intelligence of some of the respondents , most of them probably would n't need Mechanical Turk as a source of income , so I assume most of them fit the profile of this Salon.com writer and are doing it just for fun .
Hell , you can find enough people on UseNet and Slashdot who will argue with you just for free .
But there were a few reasons I found this preferable to the conventional ways of gathering interesting rebuttals to your own reasoning .
If you send out a sample argument to all of your e-mail buddies , you will probably get some useful replies , but they may start to think you 're a little weird for asking them to evaluate your thought processes , especially if you do it over and over .
Post an opinion on UseNet or Slashdot , and you may have to wade through a lot of crap to find the useful responses ( while others may consider your post to be part of the crap that they have to wade through ) .
And in both cases , there 's the potential embarrassment of what you 're asking for -- the risk of seeming so uncertain about your own opinions that you want other people to check your work for you .
( I actually think that being uncertain about your own beliefs is a virtue , but it does n't seem to be one that our culture prizes very highly . )
Using Mechanical
Turk addresses most of these problems ; even though you 're still admitting to total strangers that you might be wrong and asking them to shoot you down if they can , at least the evidence of your insecurity wo n't turn up when your next employer or Internet date does a Google search for your name .
( " Damn it , I want a man who does n't question his bumper stickers ! " )
So , while I did n't find it useful enough that I would run every opinion through the Mechanical Turk machinery to see what feedback I could get from it ( I 'm not paying a bunch of them to proofread this article ) , I did like enough to recommend it to people for certain arguments in certain settings .
The main kinds of arguments that I would try out on the Mechanical Turk service would be about abstract philosophical or moral questions on issues that have been around forever , like abortion or the death penalty -- topics so explosive that you 'd risk making your friends very uncomfortable if you test - marketed your arguments on them , and which would seem almost rude to post about in a public forum because the debate topics have been around for so very , very long .
But on Mechanical Turk , $ 1 is apparently enough to get people to ignore the awkwardness and the exhaustedness of the topic and to focus on what you ask .
And what was the argument that I used to test it out ?
Perhaps the geek crowd will feel more sympathy with this than the general public does .
Basically it was that the conventional wisdom behind allowing adults to smoke , but banning cigarettes for people under 18 , is wrong .
Either you can believe that smoking should be permitted for everybody , or that it should be banned for everybody , but there is no consistent set of assumptions that could lead you to conclude that smoking should be banned for people under 18 but allowed for everyone else .
You have two groups of people under consideration -- people under 18 who smoke , and people over 18 who smoke .
What possible reason could there be for wanting to protect the health of the people in the first group , but not the people in the second group ?
The problem with the conventional reason for smoking age restrictions -- " Younger people have worse judgment , so they are more likely to smoke " -- is that if this is true , all that means is that the first group of people will be proportionally larger , relative to the total population of people in their age range .
But even after that assumption , you 're still left with two groups of people , who exhibit the same continued bad judgment with regard to smoking cigarettes .
Treating the two groups differently , is a bit like saying we should have lighter sentences for female murderers than for male murderers , just because men are more likely to commit murder .
And yet this conclusion did give me pause , so this is a classic example of an argument where you 'd want someone to check your work .
Off I went to create a Human Intelligence Task ( HIT ) on Mechanical Turk simply asking people to read the argument and respond .
In the first round , most responders missed what I thought was the point of the argument , and responded with some variation of " Minors are more likely to smoke because they have worse judgment " , without addressing the question of why the two groups of smokers should be treated differently .
A few people responded with variations of " We 've always done it that way " ( referring to similar restrictions on alcohol , pornography , etc. ) ; fair enough , it just reminded me that if I asked the question again I 'd have to say I did n't consider any argument valid that boiled down to " We 've always done it that way " .
But then came some more interesting responses .
One worker replied that I was wrong to assume that the effects of a cigarette were " the same " on adults and minors because cigarette smoke has been shown to be more damaging to developing tissues .
OK , that was worth a dollar .
On the other hand , that just means that there is some number N cigarettes that would be just as harmful to an adult , as 1 cigarette would be to a minor , so you 're still left without a consistent reason for why you 'd let the adult buy those N cigarettes but prevent the minor from buying 1 cigarette .
Then another user called me out on the opening line of my original argument , " There is no reason to ban cigarettes for minors but not for adults . "
He said , quite correctly , that I had only attempted to debunk the most commonly given reason , but it was wrong to conclude that there was no such reason .
So , this led me to another idea for how to present an argument and solicit feedback on Mechanical Turk : in the form of a series of mathematically precise statements , each one following from the previous ones .
The new HIT was to ask users if they disagreed with the conclusion , and if they disagreed , then to identify the first statement that they disagreed with .
The idea was that each statement would follow logically from the ones before it , so identifying any statement as the " first " one that they disagreed with , would be tantamount to a self - contradictory paradox .
Now , whether or not you want to use this format when running an argument past the Turk workers , depends on what your goal is .
If you want to really find out if your own argument is valid , then breaking it down mathematically is one approach .
On the other hand , if you already believe your own argument , and you 're just trying to find the most persuasive way of phrasing it , then you may not learn anything useful by breaking it down into a series of mathematical steps , because that 's probably not going to be the format of our final persuasive essay .
Anyway , the new mathematical format of the argument was ( slightly reworked from what I posted on Amazon ) :
Government should ban smoking by people under 18 , because of the harmful health effects .
If that 's true for the entire group of underage smokers , then it's also true for each individual smoker under 18 .
In other words , even if only one person under 18 smoked in the entire country , it would still be justified for the government to ban them from smoking .
Whatever bad health effects are caused by the average person under 18 smoking 1 cigarette , there is some number N cigarettes that would cause the same bad health effects in the average adult who smoked them .
If banning 1 person under 18 from smoking 1 cigarette is justified ( even if they were the last smoker on Earth ) , and the health effects would be the same for an average adult who smoked N cigarettes , then banning 1 adult from smoking those N cigarettes would also be justified ( again , even if they were the last smoker on Earth ) .
If banning 1 person over 18 from smoking would be justified , then the same logic would apply to every person over 18 , which would imply banning smoking for all people over 18 .
Hence , if you believe that smoking should be banned for people under 18 , then the same logic would lead to a ban on smoking for people over 18 as well .
The response from a lot of workers who responded to this HIT was that ... I lost them .
Each of them identified the first statement in the list that they disagreed with , as required by the HIT , but many commented that the whole thing was phrased confusingly .
There was no clear winner for the first statement that people disagreed with , but several people picked # 3 and # 4 , arguing some version of " People under 18 have less developed judgment . "
( I still say that does n't matter , because you 're talking about comparing a person under 18 who smokes , with a person over 18 who smokes , and their judgment in both cases is the same , etc . )
So this particular experiment failed -- it did n't make it easier to persuade people by formulating the argument as a series of steps , and it also did n't lead to any agreement on what was the Achilles '
Heel of the argument itself .
However I think the general idea , of using Mechanical Turk to find sparring partners , may be useful to a lot of people .
If you were interested in publishing some kind of persuasive argument , you could use an Amazon HIT to have readers compare several different versions of the same argument and identify the one that they thought was most convincing .
If you were feeling more philosophical and simply wanted to know if your argument was correct , you could pay people to look for flaws in it ( and here is where the mathematical phrasing could come in handy ) .
If you 're crafting an argument for public consumption , you could even have HIT workers build up your argument for you -- start with a position and have them come up with reasons supporting that position -- although to me that feels like a cheapening of the debate process that crosses the line , because you 're not even trying to reason your way to a conclusion , instead starting with the conclusion you want and then working backwards ( not that this is n't what a lot of debaters do anyway ! ) .
My own interest would be to see next if certain types of arguments are more likely to persuade people who are more mathematically inclined ( by asking respondents to indicate how well they did at math in school ) .
Perhaps arguments with flowery language are more likely to appeal to people who were English majors , while arguments spelled out as a series of logical steps are more likely to appeal to people who look at things in a mathematical way ( also known as the " real " or " right " way of looking at things ) .
Maybe my preference for the controlled , user - reimbursed process of " debating " that is enabled by Mechanical Turk , has to do with a lifelong focus on bottom - line results :
Decide what the result is , and judge the process by how well it brings about that result .
I do n't think debate and discussion should be like soccer , valued for the fun and the exercise ; I think a good debate should actually get somewhere , persuading the participants or the listeners of a new point of view that builds on their old one , or else the debate has failed .
If paying HIT workers kills the " spirit " of a good debate but helps achieve the goal , then so much the better .
On the other hand , we 'll never run out of people who enjoy the process of debating and arguing for its own sake , and will continue to debate things into the ground without anybody paying them .
Hey look , here come some of them now !...
The clitoris was " discovered " ( at least by males ) and documented for the first time by Matteo Realdo Colombo : a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua , Italy .
In 1559 he published a book called De re anatomica in which he described the " seat of woman 's delight . "
He concluded , " since no one has discerned these projections and their workings , if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me , it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus . "
However others made claims to have discovered it .
Gabriel Fallopius - Columbus ' successor at Padua - disputed the assertion that Columbus discovered claiming credit for himself .
There are also several claims that knowledge of the clitoris was widely known well before either man 's ' discovery ' .
But Colombo's remains the earliest physical documentation of the bud that would one day become a phenomenom leading to the sexual revolution .
For the past several years , I ’ve spent $ 47.75 every three months for a subscription to the local newspaper that claims it covers my community of about 2,300 people .
Other than my town ’s sports teams , it rarely does .
So I dropped it .
So I ’m willing to give that quarterly $ 47.75 , or $ 191 a year , to anyone with basic journalism skills who will tell me what ’s going on in my town — and why — without a typical blogger ’s snarky ‘ tude .
Yep .
If you want $ 191 a year from me , then cover the town council and school board meetings and distribute that news .
Do it by e-mail , do it as a blog , do as a Web site ( hell , write it on parchment with crayon for all I care ) .
Just do it and get it to me online in a reasonably timely fashion .
Heck , I ’ll bet an enterprising recent journalism school grad could make a business model out of this .
So come here , live here and report here .
Ask the highway superintendent about the potholes on roads all over town .
No , not to assign blame , but to tell me and the other townspeople how much it will cost — and why — so we ’ll know more when it comes to voting on the town ’s budget .
Ask the town clerk how he or she sets her hours — and why .
Have there been complaints ?
That ’s a town post where availability to residents is important .
I ’d like to know how available the clerk is before the next election .
And ask the fire chief about the availability of volunteer firefighters and emergency medical technicians during day hours .
I hear that ’s a problem in rural areas .
Is it here ?
And why ?
Do a feature about the town ’s demographics .
Is the population growing ?
In western New York , everybody complains about folks leaving this area .
How ’s that affect us ?
And why ?
How are we doing financially ?
Better ?
Worse ?
Why ?
That ’d be nice to know before we vote on next year ’s budget .
How would higher taxes affect those residents with fixed incomes ?
Hey , how ’s our school district doing with our kids ?
After all , about half of our property taxes go for education .
Is that tax money being spent wisely and effectively ?
How ’s that measured ?
Who ’s doing the measuring ?
If not , why not ?
By the way , is our town getting its equitable share of state and federal education aid ?
How ’d that re-assessment of taxable properties turn out ?
The other newspaper did n’t cover that .
Did residents feel blindsided when they got their new property assessments in the mail ?
Is so , why ?
Come here .
Report about us to us .
You could literally become the electronic version of the “ town crier . ”
You could tell us about ourselves .
You could let us know more about what we have in common and what separates us .
You could tell us what issues we need to know as a community .
You could tell us what we want to know about our town and ourselves .
Your Internet journalism enterprise could allow us to add comments to your work online .
You ’d learn more about us that way .
We ’d learn more about you , too , by seeing what you do with our feedback and opinion and story ideas .
I know , I know .
Seems like a lot of work .
Long hours .
You ’d actually have to do the reporting rather than just writing opinion using some other news outlet ’s reporting .
You ’d actually have to rise from your chair and walk through town , talking with people , stopping at the diner for a listen , working the town hall to find out what our elected and appointed officials are doing and why .
You ’d have to do it yourself rather than outsourcing it to some guy in India watching a board meeting on Internet video .
Yep , this would be a shoe - leather enterprise married to every bit of hi-tech you can afford .
Kinda risky financially , though .
So let ’s think this through .
The U.S. Census Bureau says my little town has 861 households .
In a perfect world , all would subscribe to your e-mail / Web site / blog for $ 191 a year .
That ’s about $ 165,000 .
Really nice money , eh ?
But this is a rural town .
Median household income is about $ 33,110 and 15 percent of residents ’ incomes are below the poverty line .
Let ’s say only half the households cough up only $ 100 a year .
That ’s about $ 43,000 .
And there ’s start - up costs : a laptop , digital camera , domain name , maybe a home office , and so on .
But no new building .
No printing expenses .
No dead trees .
No ink .
No physical distribution costs .
Your sales pitch to the townspeople :
This is n’t a cheery monthly newsletter put out by a local volunteer with a few hours to spare .
This is professionally generated hard news online .
New stuff daily .
Maybe you ’ll become a credible source of information and news .
Maybe that weekly high - school feature on a star athlete or brilliant student will get plenty of views .
( Remember , local names are local news .
Never forget that . )
Maybe those monthly school board stories you write about the budget process start getting views .
Maybe those photos of local scenes and people you post every day get popular .
Hey , is that a local electrician calling you , wanting to place an ad on that high school weekly feature ?
Is that a local auto repair shop looking to advertise because its owner hears people talking about your terrific , insightful , leave - the - opinion - to - the - readers reporting ?
Just maybe that advertising income , paired with the subscription money , will allow you to make a living , live in a community you grow to like , raise a couple kids and become a respected journalist .
( Yes , I know , mixing advertising and journalism will test your ethics .
But you learned how to deal with that in your J - school ethics courses , did n’t you ?
Besides , townsfolk will tell you bluntly when you ’ve gone astray . )
Hey , is this what hyperlocal news operations can really be like ?
Can you make a living at this , you young J - school grads ?
Do you really need to be a news media conglomerate to pull this off ?
My newsroom godfather , Neil Perry , tried to do exactly this — more than 50 years ago .
He left my hometown paper and started a small weekly in a neighboring town — his hometown .
But the high printing and circulation costs killed his paper .
He returned to my hometown rag but always wondered if he could have made his start - up weekly profitable .
In 2007 , maybe Neil could .
So I ’m going to begin telling my journalism students about Neil and what he tried to do .
Perhaps a workable journalism business model is just one person with a journalist ’s temperament and a farmer ’s work ethic setting out to tell one small corner of the world how that corner works and why it works that way â€ ” and refusing to listen to those who say “ this will never work . ”

BBC News , Washington
The Bible - based action figures include Goliath and Samson
From the middle of August , Wal - Mart , the biggest toy retailer in the US , will for the first time stock a full line of faith - based toys .
The Bible - based action figures will initially be given two feet of shelf space in 425 of the company 's 3,300 stores nationwide .
There , the Tales of Glory dolls will take on what their makers are calling " the battle for the toy box " with some of the nation 's most popular action figures .
The market is notoriously hard to crack , with every child wanting what their friends at school have and high - profile brands like Transformers and Spiderman dominating marketing .
So will the 12in ( 30 cm ) Jesus doll quoting scripture or the 3in ( 8 cm ) figure of Daniel in the lion 's den open up children 's imaginations - and their parents ' wallets ?
' Spiritual journey '
David Socha , founder of One2believe , the company which makes the dolls , is confident the demand is there for " God-honouring " toys which reflect Christian teachings and morality .
If you go in a toy aisle in any major retailer , you will see toys and dolls that promote and glorify evil , destruction , lying , cheating
David Socha
" We get a lot of people , even people who are not of faith , do n't go to church , saying ' I 've got a four and a six - year - old and I do n't know what to get them any more ' , " he said .
" If you go in a toy aisle in any major retailer , you will see toys and dolls that promote and glorify evil , destruction , lying , cheating .
" In the girls ' aisle where the dolls would be , you see dolls that are promoting promiscuity to very young girls .
Dolls will have very revealing clothes on , G - string underwear . "
What his company offers instead is " something faith - based that is not only fun to play with but also is solidifying a person 's spiritual wherewithal and their spiritual journey " , he said .
Retail boom
In offering a faith - based alternative to the commercial mainstream , Mr Socha is tapping into a broader nationwide trend .
The Passion of the Christ raised the profile of faith - based entertainment
Sales of so - called Christian products , including books , music , clothes and gifts , have climbed steadily from $ 4bn ( £ 2 bn ) in 2000 to $ 4.63 bn last year , according to the Association for Christian Retail .
Accounting for part of that growth is a boom in Christian fantasy fiction , some of it written in response to some Christians ' unease over the use of magic in the Harry Potter books .
According to the Book Industry Study Group , sales of religious books went up by 5.6 % in 2006 .
Another survey suggests Christian book - buyers spend half as much again on books as the average American .
Nearly 12 % of Americans spend more than $ 50 a month on religious products and another 11 % spend $ 25 - 29 a month , according to a Baylor University study , with one in three Americans surveyed making at least one purchase a year in a Christian bookshop .
The dolls ' makers say parents want to give toys with a moral message
Nancy Guthrie , of the Association for Christian Retail , said : " Over the past decade there has been a significant openness in the broader market place for Christian products .
" All kinds of retailers have recognised that there are a lot of people out there who want books and music and gifts that reflect their faith . "
The fact that two Christian books topped US best - seller lists in 2001 , one of which was the fantasy novel Desecration , helped raise awareness of the availability of such products , she said .
Following on from that , Mel Gibson 's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ " awoke people to the interest and market for Christian media and entertainment " , Ms Guthrie added .
' Wholesome things '
Wal - Mart spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien said it made sense for the retail giant - which has carried religious items before but never a full line of faith - based toys - to try to reach that audience too .
The stores chosen for the initial sales of the Tales of Glory dolls are those where other religion - based products such as Bibles and gospel music have sold very well , she said .
Sales of faith - based products have been climbing steadily in the US
" It 's really a test to see how consumers will respond , " she said .
" We anticipate there may be parents and teachers who would find these toys beneficial in teaching biblical stories . "
Laurie Schacht , president of industry publication The Toy Book , believes faith - based toys could sell well in the right market place , although they will not be to everyone 's taste .
" I think there are parents who want the hottest things that are out there and I think there are parents who want to give their children more wholesome things , " she said .
" I think it 's going to be a parent purchase much more than what the child wants .
I think there 's a market and I think Wal - Mart sees that and has given shelf space for it . "
Ms Schacht points out that there have been faith - based toys , such as the Precious Moments range , in specialist Christian stores for years but that this will be the first time a mass retail outlet has jumped into the market .
As for their appeal to children ?
" Like everything else , if the toys have ' play value ' and you put them in front of a child , they will do well , " she said .
Mr Socha says making the figures attractive to young people has been at the heart of the project - and they have been tried and tested on Sunday school and church groups .
" If the kids are n't engaged and having fun , then we might as well not do it , " he said .

How Strong is the Research Sup­port for Neu­ro­feed­back Treat­ment of Chil­dren with ADHD ?
Nei­ther of the two promi­nent approach­es to treat­ing ADHD — med­ica­tion treat­ment and behav­ior ther­a­py — are expect­ed to effect long term changes in the child .
Med­ica­tion treat­ment induces short - term changes in brain activ­i­ty that is asso­ci­at­ed with a reduc­tion in symp­toms for many indi­vid­u­als .
Behav­ior ther­a­py attempts to cre­ate a set of envi­ron­men­tal con­tin­gen­cies that pro­mote desired behav­ior in the child , but which is unlike­ly to endure when those con­tin­gen­cies are removed .
In recent years , researchers have begun devot­ing greater atten­tion to the pos­si­bil­i­ty that chil­dren — and adults — may be pro­vid­ed with par­tic­u­lar kinds of expe­ri­ences that may induce alter­ations in brain func­tion­ing that are asso­ci­at­ed with more endur­ing changes , i.e. , they do not dis­si­pate as soon as treat­ment ends .
Neu­ro­feed­back — also known as EEG Biofeed­back — is reflec­tive of this approach and has a his­to­ry that goes back at least 30 years .
It involves pro­vid­ing indi­vid­u­als with real - time feed­back on their brain­wave activ­i­ty in order that they may learn to alter their typ­i­cal EEG pat­tern to one that is con­sis­tent with a focused and atten­tive state .
Accord­ing to neu­ro­feed­back pro­po­nents , when this occurs , improved atten­tion and reduced hyperactive / impulsive behav­ior will result .
Fur­ther­more , this change is like­ly to endure because it reflects a basic alter­an­tion in an impor­tant aspect of brain func­tion­ing .
In this arti­cle , I ’ll take a look at some of the con­tro­ver­sy sur­round­ing neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment and attempt to high­light some of the strengths and lim­i­ta­tions in the exist­ing pub­lished research .
- Con­tro­ver­sy Sur­round­ing Neu­ro­feed­back Research —
Neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for ADHD has been a source of sub­stan­tial con­tro­ver­sy in the field for many years and remains so today .
Although there are a num­ber of pub­lished stud­ies in which pos­i­tive results have been report­ed , many promi­nent ADHD researchers feel that giv­en sig­nif­i­cant lim­i­ta­tions to the design and imple­men­ta­tion of these stud­ies , neu­ro­feed­back should be con­sid­ered a promis­ing , but unproven treat­ment .
This posi­tion is sum­ma­rized in the CHADD fact sheet on alter­na­tive and com­ple­men­tary inter­ven­tions , which includes the fol­low­ing state­ment about neu­ro­feed­back :
“ It is impor­tant to empha­size , how­ev­er , that although sev­er­al stud­ies of neu­ro­feed­back have yield­ed promis­ing results , this treat­ment has not yet been test­ed in the rig­or­ous man­ner that is required to make a clear con­clu­sion about its effec­tive­ness for AD / HD .
The afore­men­tioned stud­ies can not be con­sid­ered to have pro­duced per­sua­sive sci­en­tif­ic evi­dence con­cern­ing the effec­tive­ness of EEG biofeed­back for ADHD .
Con­trolled ran­dom­ized tri­als are required before con­clu­sions can be reached .
Until then , buy­ers should beware of the lim­i­ta­tions in the pub­lished sci­ence .
Par­ents are advised to pro­ceed cau­tious­ly as it can be expen­sive — a typ­i­cal course of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment may require 40 or more ses­sions — and because oth­er AD / HD treat­ments ( i.e. , mul­ti- modal treat­ment ) cur­rent­ly enjoy sub­stan­tial­ly greater research sup­port . ”

What Does an ‘ Ide­al ’ Treat­ment Study Look Like ?
Before review­ing some recent neu­ro­feed­back stud­ies , it would be use­ful to con­sid­er what an ‘ ide­al ’ treat­ment study entails .
This will pro­vide a con­text against which recent neu­ro­feed­back stud­ies can be eval­u­at­ed .
Ide­al­ly , treat­ment stud­ies are designed so that if pos­i­tive results are obtained , all pos­si­ble expla­na­tions for those results besides the treat­ment itself have been elim­i­nat­ed .
This requires 2 basic ele­ments : ran­dom assign­ment and an appro­pri­ate con­trol group .
Ran­dom Assign­ment
Imag­ine that you are test­ing a new med­ica­tion treat­ment for ADHD with 50 chil­dren who have been care­ful­ly diag­nosed .
In a ran­dom assign­ment study , whether each child is assigned to the treat­ment or con­trol con­di­tion is deter­mined by chance — you could flip a coin and give the med­i­cine to the ‘ heads ’ and noth­ing to the ‘ tails ’ .
This insures that any dif­fer­ences that might exist between chil­dren who get the med­ica­tion and those who do n’t are pure­ly chance dif­fer­ences .
At the end of the study , if those who received the med­i­cine are doing bet­ter , you could feel con­fi­dent that this is prob­a­bly due to the med­i­cine itself , and not to dif­fer­ences that may have been there before the treat­ment even start­ed .
What if you did­ n’t use ran­dom assign­ment , but let each child ’s par­ents choose whether their child is in the treat­ment or con­trol group ?
In this case , it is pos­si­ble that chil­dren in the 2 groups dif­fered in impor­tant ways before the treat­ment began .
If chil­dren who received the med­ica­tion were doing bet­ter at the end of the study , it might be because of dif­fer­ences that were there to start with .
For exam­ple , par­ents who chose the med­i­cine might be more will­ing to pur­sue oth­er ways to help their child than those who did­ n’t .
The fact that chil­dren who received the med­ica­tion were doing bet­ter at the end of the study might thus have noth­ing to do with the med­i­cine itself , but reflect oth­er things their par­ents were doing to help them .
No mat­ter how hard you might try to rule out these oth­er pos­si­ble expla­na­tions — and I ’m sure you can think of many oth­ers — you could nev­er do this with cer­tain­ty .
Thus , I might rea­son­ably doubt that your new med­ica­tion is real­ly effec­tive .
What about con­trol groups ?
Even with the ran­dom assign­ment exam­ple above , how­ev­er , your study would still have an impor­tant prob­lem .
Because chil­dren in the con­trol group received noth­ing , every­one knows who is being treat­ed and who is n’t .
If you ask par­ents how their child is doing 4 weeks lat­er , this could very pos­si­bly bias their reports .
Par­ents whose child received med­ica­tion may report their child is doing bet­ter sim­ply because they expect the med­i­cine to help .
Par­ents of chil­dren in the con­trol con­di­tion may be biased against see­ing improve­ment because they know their child was not treat­ed .
Thus , if par­ents of treat­ed chil­dren report­ed more improve­ment than par­ents of con­trol chil­dren , I could still rea­son­able ques­tion that the new med­ica­tion was tru­ly help­ful .
Even if reports from teach­ers yield­ed sim­i­lar find­ings , I would argue that teach­ers might have learned when chil­dren were get­ting med­ica­tion .
While this may be a low prob­a­bil­i­ty event , you could­ n’t com­plete­ly rule it out .
If I was a real skep­tic about your new med­ica­tion , your study would not be all that con­vinc­ing .
The way around this is to cre­ate a sit­u­a­tion where no one knows — not the par­ents , child , teach­ers , researchers , or any­one else — whether the child is receiv­ing med­ica­tion .
With med­ica­tion stud­ies , this is rel­a­tive­ly sim­ple to do : chil­dren in the con­trol con­di­tion are giv­en a place­bo pill that looks just like the real med­ica­tion but that has no active ingre­di­ents .
Because no one knows who is get­ting med­ica­tion and who is n’t , pos­si­ble bias­es in par­ents ’ and teach­ers ’ reports at the end of the study are thus elim­i­nat­ed .
This way , if chil­dren in the med­ica­tion con­di­tion are doing bet­ter at the end of the study than chil­dren get­ting place­bo , it is hard­er to doubt the ben­e­fits of your med­ica­tion .
In fact , there would be no rea­son­able basis for such doubt , espe­cial­ly if you repeat­ed the study and found the same results .
Three Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Neu­ro­feed­back Stud­ies
With this as a back­ground , let ’s take a brief look at 3 recent neu­ro­feed­back stud­ies and see how they fare on the crit­i­cal dimen­sions of incor­po­rat­ing ran­dom assign­ment and an ‘ ide­al ’ con­trol group .
- Study 1 -
In an inter­est­ing study by Vince Monas­tra and his col­leagues [ Monas­tra et al. ( 2002 ) .
The Effects of Stim­u­lant Ther­a­py , EEG Biofeed­back and Par­ent­ing Style on the pri­ma­ry symp­toms of ADHD .
Applied Psy­chophys­i­ol­o­gy and Biofeed­back , 27 , 249 . ] one hun­dred 6 – 19 year - olds with ADHD were treat­ed over 12 months .
Some par­ents chose a treat­ment plan that includ­ed med­ica­tion , behav­ior ther­a­py , and school con­sul­ta­tion .
Oth­er par­ents chose to add neu­ro­feed­back to their child ’s treat­ment .
After 12 months , chil­dren whose treat­ment includ­ed neu­ro­feed­back back were doing bet­ter than the oth­er chil­dren accord­ing to both par­ents and teach­ers .
They also showed ‘ nor­mal ’ EEG scans while the oth­er chil­dren still had the EEG pat­tern char­ac­ter­is­tic of ADHD .
Even more impres­sive was that neu­ro­feed­back treat­ed chil­dren main­tained these ben­e­fits after med­ica­tion was dis­con­tin­ued for a week .

- Study 2 -
In a study by Fuchs et al ( 2003 ) , par­ents of thir­ty - four 8 – 12 - year - old chil­dren with AD / HD chose either stim­u­lant med­ica­tion or neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for their child .
After 3 months , chil­dren in both groups showed sig­nif­i­cant and com­pa­ra­ble reduc­tions in AD / HD symp­toms accord­ing to par­ents and teach­ers .
Lab­o­ra­to­ry tests of atten­tion also showed equiv­a­lent improve­ment .
A com­pre­hen­sive review of this study is avail­able at Here
- Study 3 -
In an espe­cial­ly inter­est­ing study , ( Levesque , J. , Beau­re­gard , M. , & Men­sour , B. 2006 .
Effect of neu­ro­feed­back train­ing on the neur­al sub­strates of selec­tive atten­tion in chil­dren with AD / HD : A func­tion­al mag­net­ic res­o­nance imag­ing study .
Neu­ro­science Let­ters , 394 , 216–221. ) twen­ty 8 – 12 - year - old chil­dren with ADHD were ran­dom­ly assigned to receive neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment — 40 1 ‑hours ses­sions — or a wait - list con­trol con­di­tion .
At the end of the study , treat­ed chil­dren were doing sig­nif­i­cant­ly bet­ter than con­trol chil­dren accord­ing to par­ents .
They also did bet­ter on sev­er­al objec­tive , lab­o­ra­to­ry mea­sures of atten­tion .
Espe­cial­ly note­wor­thy was that fMRI scans used to mea­sure brain activ­i­ty dur­ing a com­plex cog­ni­tive task showed sig­nif­i­cant change for treat­ed chil­dren but no change for con­trol chil­dren .

So , what ’s wrong with these stud­ies ?
I sus­pect the answer to this ques­tion is obvi­ous .
While the first 2 stud­ies yield­ed impres­sive results , nei­ther includ­ed ran­dom assign­ment .
Thus , as dis­cussed above , it is not pos­si­ble to con­clude that it is the neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment specif­i­cal­ly that made the dif­fer­ence .
Instead , dif­fer­ences that may have been present before treat­ment began and / or after treat­ment start­ed could be respon­si­ble .
While this may be unlike­ly , it ca n’t be entire­ly dis­count­ed .
The third study includ­ed ran­dom assign­ment so this is not a prob­lem .
It should be not­ed , how­ev­er , that with only twen­ty par­tic­i­pants , treat­ment and con­trol groups are more like­ly to dif­fer at the start of the study than if a larg­er sam­ple had been ran­dom­ly assigned .
The big­ger prob­lem is that the con­trol con­di­tion is not a very strong one in that every­one knew who received neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment and who did not .
This may have biased par­ents ’ rat­ings , although it is dif­fi­cult to argue that it could have biased chil­dren ’s per­for­mance on the lab - based atten­tion tests or on the fMRI scan .
Per­haps , how­ev­er , it was­ n’t the spe­cif­ic feed­back on EEG states that neu­ro­feed­back pro­vid­ed , but sim­ply the atten­tion chil­dren received dur­ing the 40 hours of train­ing , that was the impor­tant fac­tor .
Although unlike­ly in my opin­ion , this ca n’t be def­i­nite­ly ruled out .
What would an ‘ ide­al ’ neu­ro­feed­back study look like ?
This may be pret­ty clear now as well .
The most con­clu­sive test of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment would include ran­dom assign­ment and a con­trol con­di­tion that close­ly matched the neu­ro­feed­back con­di­tion .
For exam­ple , chil­dren could receive video game coach­ing from a sup­port­ive adult for the same time peri­od .
Or , even bet­ter , they could do exact­ly what chil­dren get­ting the neu­ro­feed­back were doing but not receive direct feed­back on their EEG states .
If pos­i­tive treat­ment results were still found , it would indi­cate that obtain­ing EEG feed­back and learn­ing to con­trol one ’s EEG state is why neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment works .
I ’ve been told by peo­ple who know much more about neu­ro­feed­back than I that such a study , while dif­fi­cult to do , is tech­ni­cal­ly pos­si­ble .
I am not aware of such a study hav­ing been pub­lished ; if you are , please let me know .
I should point out that there would be impor­tant eth­i­cal con­cerns with such a study .
Neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment typ­i­cal­ly occurs over a peri­od of months .
Chil­dren who were receiv­ing ‘ sham ’ neu­ro­feed­back would be get­ting a treat­ment that no one expect­ed to be help­ful for a sus­tained time peri­od .
A more rea­son­able alter­na­tive might thus be to pro­vide chil­dren with a treat­ment of known effi­ca­cy — such as med­ica­tion — dur­ing the neu­ro­feed­back tri­al .
If this were giv­en to chil­dren in the real and sham con­di­tions it would not cre­ate a con­found because both groups would be receiv­ing it .
After neu­ro­feed­back was com­plet­ed , one could see whether chil­dren who got the real treat­ment were doing bet­ter — i.e. , did neu­ro­feed­back add any­thing to med­ica­tion — and whether these ben­e­fits per­sist­ed after med­ica­tion was tem­porar­i­ly stopped .
What can we con­clude about neu­ro­feed­back until such a study is done ?
It would be ter­rif­ic if a study like the one out­lined above were com­plet­ed .
Unfor­tu­nate­ly , how­ev­er , I think it is a real pos­si­bil­i­ty , how­ev­er , that we will nev­er see such a study .
This would be a large and expen­sive under­tak­ing and obtain­ing fund­ing for it would not be easy .
In the inter­im , my own view is that exist­ing sup­port for neu­ro­feed­back should not be so read­i­ly dis­count­ed because of the study lim­i­ta­tions dis­cussed above .
Here ’s why I think this is the case .
The way treat­ment was ‘ assigned ’ in the first 2 stud­ies sum­ma­rized is very sim­i­lar to what hap­pens when par­ents seek treat­ment for their child .
That is , par­ents inves­ti­gate dif­fer­ent options and decide which one they want for their child .
This is what hap­pened in these stud­ies — some par­ents chose neu­ro­feed­back for their child and some did not .
When neu­ro­feed­back was cho­sen , chil­dren were found to ben­e­fit on both ‘ sub­jec­tive ’ par­ent reports as well as on more ‘ objec­tive ’ assess­ments .
This does not mean that neu­ro­feed­back would ‘ work ’ for chil­dren ran­dom­ly assigned to receive it .
It also does not mean that rea­son neu­ro­feed­back works by pro­vid­ing spe­cif­ic train­ing in learn­ing how to man­age one ’s EEG state .
It is for these rea­sons that neu­ro­feed­back is under­stand­ably regard­ed as an unproven treat­ment approach for ADHD at this time by many ADHD researchers .
How­ev­er , these stud­ies do pro­vide a sol­id basis for sug­gest­ing that if par­ents choose to pur­sue neu­ro­feed­back for their child , there is a rea­son­able chance that their child will ben­e­fit even though we ca n’t be sure that it is the spe­cif­ic EEG train­ing that is respon­si­ble for the ben­e­fits .
Thus , although the effi­ca­cy of neu­ro­feed­back has yet to be con­clu­sive­ly con­firmed in a ran­dom­ized , place­bo - con­trolled tri­al , it is impor­tant to place this lim­i­ta­tion in the con­text of the sup­port­ive research evi­dence that has been accu­mu­lat­ed .
Pro­vid­ing this con­text can help fam­i­lies bet­ter under­stand the strengths and lim­i­ta­tions of the exist­ing research on neu­ro­feed­back and enable them to make a bet­ter informed deci­sion about whether to con­sid­er this treat­ment option for their child .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - China blocked a long - planned Thanksgiving visit to Hong Kong by a U.S. aircraft carrier group , then abruptly changed its mind on Thursday .
But it was too late to save the holiday visit .
A U.S. official said the trip has since been scrapped and the ships continued steaming to their Japanese base .
The USS Kitty Hawk group and its 8,000 airmen and sailors were expected in Hong Kong on Wednesday , but the U.S. State Department said the visit had been refused by China .
Hundreds of relatives of U.S. crew members had flown to Hong Kong to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday .
Later in the day , China appeared to have relented , announcing the carrier would be allowed to stop by the former British colony after all .
“ We have decided to allow the Kitty Hawk to stay in Hong Kong during Thanksgiving , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a news conference .
“ It is a decision based on humanitarian considerations only . ”
But a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii told Reuters the ships were not heading back to Hong Kong and were on course towards the Kitty Hawk ’s base in Japan .
“ The Kitty Hawk ’s returning to Yokosuka , ” said Lieutenant Commander John Filostrat .
He said he was not in a position to say why the ships did not head to Hong Kong after the Chinese reversal or if a turnaround would have been too late .
“ When they were refused entry they began heading back and that remains the situation ” , he said .
The holiday misadventure has left families dismayed and could become a diplomatic tiff .
The USS Kitty Hawk carrier is anchored at Malaysia 's West Port in Port Klang , outside Kuala Lumpur , August 28 , 2007 .
China refused permission for the USS Kitty Hawk and accompanying vessels to visit Hong Kong for a long - planned Thanksgiving holiday visit -- and then changed its mind .

“ I miss my daddy , ” said Mark Curry , 14 , whose father is aboard one of the vessels .
“ We thought he was going to be there , but we do n’t know what actually happened .
I was just depressed . ”
MEETING WITH DALAI LAMA TO BLAME ?
The Chinese move came as a surprise just weeks after a visit to China by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , which he hoped would lead to a long - term dialogue .
Spokesman
Liu did not say why the ships had been blocked in the first place , but there are issues that might have prompted Beijing ’s action .
Washington plans to sell Taiwan a $ 940 million upgrade to its missile system and there was last month ’s meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan Buddhist leader whom Beijing considers a traitor .
Last year , a Chinese submarine surfaced unusually close to the Kitty Hawk near the Japanese island of Okinawa , an incident that highlighted the potential for friction between the two powers .
Beijing ’s move coincided with “ airspace controls ” introduced on Wednesday which the Xinhua news agency said affected the air travel plans of 7,000 people in south and east China .
The controls had been ordered for “ unspecified reasons ” .
The Kitty Hawk , laid down in 1956 , has the second longest active service of any ship in the U.S. navy after the USS Constitution , a 208 - year - old ceremonial sailing ship kept in Boston Harbor .
It is the only conventionally fuelled carrier in the U.S. fleet and is due to be decommissioned next year .
Hong Kong , especially its raucous Wanchai bar district , has long been a regular port of call for resting U.S. sailors .
The Kitty Hawk visited there for a Thanksgiving stopover in 2005 .
“ For a lot of guys , this ( Hong Kong ) is their favorite port in the entire area of operations for us in the Western Pacific , ” a U.S. navy member told Reuters .
“ Everyone in Wanchai is disappointed , ” said Cady Chan , the manager of the New Makati Inn , a popular nightspot for sailors .
“ This was the last time the Kitty Hawk was coming to Hong Kong , this would have been a red - hot time . ”
' The Biggest Environmental
Crime In History '
By Cahal Milmo
10 December 2007
The Independent
B P , the British oil giant that pledged to move " Beyond Petroleum " by finding cleaner ways to produce fossil fuels , is being accused of abandoning its " green sheen " by investing nearly £ 1.5 bn to extract oil from the Canadian wilderness using methods which environmentalists say are part of the " biggest global warming crime " in history .
The multinational oil and gas producer , which last year made a profit of £ 11bn , is facing a head - on confrontation with the green lobby in the pristine forests of North America after Greenpeace pledged a direct action campaign against BP following its decision to reverse a long - standing policy and invest heavily in extracting so - called " oil sands " that lie beneath the Canadian province of Alberta and form the world 's second - largest proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia .
Producing crude oil from the tar sands – a heavy mixture of bitumen , water , sand and clay – found beneath more than 54,000 square miles of prime forest in northern Alberta – an area the size of England and Wales combined – generates up to four times more carbon dioxide , the principal global warming gas , than conventional drilling .
The booming oil sands industry will produce 100 million tonnes of CO2 ( equivalent to a fifth of the UK's entire annual emissions ) a year by 2012 , ensuring that Canada will miss its emission targets under the Kyoto treaty , according to environmentalist activists .
The oil rush is also scarring a wilderness landscape : millions of tonnes of plant life and top soil is scooped away in vast open - pit mines and millions of litres of water are diverted from rivers – up to five barrels of water are needed to produce a single barrel of crude and the process requires huge amounts of natural gas .
The industry , which now includes all the major oil multinationals , including the Anglo - Dutch Shell and American combine Exxon - Mobil , boasts that it takes two tonnes of the raw sands to produce a single barrel of oil .
BP insists it will use a less damaging extraction method , but it accepts that its investment will increase its carbon footprint .
Mike Hudema , the climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace in Canada , told The Independent : " BP has done a very good job in recent years of promoting its green objectives .
By jumping into tar sands extraction it is taking part in the biggest global warming crime ever seen and BP 's green sheen is gone .
" It takes about 29kg of CO2 to produce a barrel of oil conventionally .
That figure can be as much 125 kg for tar sands oil .
It also has the potential to kill off or damage the vast forest wilderness , greater than the size of England and Wales , which forms part of the world 's biggest carbon sinks .
For BP to be involved in this trade not only flies in the face of their rhetoric but in the era of climate change it should not be being developed at all .
You cannot call yourself ' Beyond Petroleum ' and involve yourself in tar sands extraction . "
Mr Hudema said Greenpeace was planning a direct action campaign against BP , which could disrupt its activities as its starts construction work in Alberta next year .
The company had shied away from involvement oil sands , until recently regarded as economically unviable and environmentally unpleasant .
Lord Browne of Madingley , who was BP 's chief executive until May , sold its remaining Canadian tar sands interests in 1999 and declared as recently as 2004 that there were " tons of opportunities " beyond the sector .
But as oil prices hover around the $ 100 - per - barrel mark , Lord Browne 's successor , Tony Hayward , announced that BP has entered a joint venture with Husky Energy , owned by the Hong Kong based billionaire Li Ka-Shing , to develop a tar sands facility which will be capable of producing 200,000 barrels of crude a day by 2020 .
In return for a half share of Husky 's Sunrise field in the Athabasca region of Alberta , the epicentre of the tar sands industry , BP has sold its partner a 50 per cent stake in its Toledo oil refinery in Ohio .
The companies will invest $ 5.5 bn ( £ 2.7 ) in the project , making BP one of the biggest players in tar sands extraction .
Mr Hayward made it clear that BP considered its investment was the start of a long - term presence in Alberta .
He said : " BP 's move into oil sands is an opportunity to build a strategic , material position and the huge potential of Sunrise is the ideal entry point for BP into Canadian oil sands . "
Canada claims that it has 175 billion barrels of recoverable oil in Alberta , making the province second only to Saudi Arabia in proved oil riches and sparking a £ 50bn " oil rush " as American , Chinese and European investors rush to profit from high oil prices .
Despite production costs per barrel of up to £ 15 , compared to £ 1 per barrel in Saudi Arabia , the Canadian province expects to be pumping five million barrels of crude a day by 2030 .
BP said it will be using a technology that pumps steam heated by natural gas into vertical wells to liquefy the solidified oil sands and pump it to the surface in a way that is less damaging than open cast mining .
But campaigners said this method requires 1,000 cubic feet of gas to produce one barrel of unrefined bitumen – the same required to heat an average British home for 5.5 days .
A spokesman for BP added : " These are resources that would have been developed anyway . "
Licenses have been issued by the Albertan government to extract 350 million cubic metres of water from the Athabasca River every year .
But the water used in the extraction process , say campaigners , is so contaminated that it cannot be returned to the eco-system and must instead be stored in vast " tailings ponds " that cover up to 20 square miles and there is evidence of increased rates of cancer and multiple sclerosis in down - river communities .
Experts say a pledge to restore all open cast tar sand mines to their previous pristine condition has proved sadly lacking .
David Schindler , professor of ecology at the University of Alberta , said : " Right now the big pressure is to get that money out of the ground , not to reclaim the landscape .
I would n't be surprised if you could see these pits from a satellite 1,000 years from now . "

This is the moment a 21 - year - old man diced with death as he played on tracks as a train came hurtling towards him .
Showing off in front of his friends , Andrew Ogden , from Astley Village , Chorley , struck a pose standing right in front of an oncoming train .
The dangerous near - miss was captured on CCTV cameras at Rylands level crossing in Chorley on July 14 .
Scroll down for more ...
Just before 10 pm that night , Ogden and three friends were walking across the level crossing when Ogden stopped and stood with his arms raised in front of the train .
He jumped out of the way at the last possible moment before the Northern Rail 20.48 Manchester Airport to Blackpool service sped past at 50 mph .
The driver of the train was unsurprisingly left extremely shaken and had to finish work for the night before being signed off work for a week by his doctor .
Superintendent Peter Holden of British Transport Police said : " This was a shocking case of somebody blatantly showing off to their friends which could so easily have ended in tragedy .
He was inches away from being struck by a train travelling at 50 mph .
" This sort of incident is plain stupidity and people need to realise that it is viewed by BTP extremely seriously .
The driver genuinely thought he had struck the man and was left extremely traumatized .
" I hope that people look at this case and understand that trespassing on the railway is not a game and if you are involved in incidents such as this you will be dealt with by the courts . "
Ogden pleaded guilty to obstruction without intent and will be sentenced at Preston Crown Court on 7 January 2008 .
Ogden was released on unconditional bail pending sentencing on 7 January .
What if games could do something practical while they entertain us ?
What if by playing games you were n't simply entertaining yourself and others , but adding to the grand sum of human knowledge ?
This is the idea behind an ongoing academic project entitled " Games With A Purpose . "
The project , which focuses on the work of a young assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon , Luis Von Ahn , has one specific objective : to create games with useful computational side - effects .
Von
Ahn observed that billions of hours of our time are sunk into games as minor as Windows solitaire .
He then speculated that this wasted time could be put to practical use .
In fact , Von Ahn calculated , more man-hours go into solitaire each month than were expended on building the entire Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914 .
If someone could come up with a methodology for harnessing these boundless intellectual energies , who knows what could be accomplished ?
Of course , it 's one thing to point out the " wasted human cycles " being lost to games , but it 's quite another to find something humans could compute better than artificial systems .
Von
Ahn , as it turns out , had a pretty good idea about what humans could do better , and he had plans to put it to use .
The human brain has a number of talents that remain beyond the remit of artificial intelligence , especially when it comes to things like visual processing .
Describing what we see in a picture , for example , comes naturally to us , but it is still too complex for computers .
This is where Von Ahn 's concept first found application : in image labeling for Google image search .
It 's a splendid example of the kind of thing humans are good at , and where our brains are the only way to come up with useful data .
Automated web - trawling programs can only read file names , alt - text or captions attached to images .
Only an image that has been directly labeled by a human being can carry the kind of accurate information we 'd need to know what it was a picture of .
Labeling can make image searches more accurate and therefore far more useful to users .
Getting real people to manually label images is the best way to have a useful image search on the web .
However , getting people to carry out massive and repetitive tasks is costly .
Google would need a small nation of workers to get even a fraction of the images on the web properly labeled .
Von
Ahn 's solution had gaming 's compulsive power on its side :
Not only would humans be manually labeling images for Google , they 'd be doing it for free .
In fact , gamers would want to do it , because the labeling process was all part of a guessing game called The ESP Game .
This online game ( which you can go and play right now ) throws up a random image that two players can both see .
These two players cannot confer or communicate in any way , but must nevertheless come up with the same word to describe the image .
They must also do it without using any of a list of banned words .
So if it was a picture of a flowery dress , the words " flowers " and " dress " might be off - limits , and the pair would have to agree on another description , perhaps " gown " or " embroidered . "
Finding slightly more esoteric matches and collating this data across thousands of games , and therefore tens of thousands of images , allows The ESP Game to generate useful , applicable tags for vast numbers of images .
This in turn makes image search vastly more accurate , and it's all done for the cost of putting together a rudimentary online game .
One of the most underappreciated things in our litigation - happy casual - khakis modern existence , is a strongly - worded letter .
Over the last few generations , with trained lawyers purporting to do all the " dirty " work , the practice of regular people writing formal letters for their personal objectives has become nearly obsolete .
Did some company do something terribly wrong to you ?
Find a lawyer & sue them !
What ?
No lawyer wants to take your case because it's not really worth over $ 1,000 ?
Well , then stop whining !
Suck it up and move on .
Often in our daily lives , we come across instances where we feel wronged and defenseless though not legally victimized .
We give up , thinking if it's not worth a lawsuit then we should forget about it .
When in fact , we do have a recourse .
A little determination and a few hours of text - editing can do what weeks and months of complaints and nagging via phone calls and meetings cannot .
Last year , I had a lot of problems at my old apartment complex before I moved to my new house .
So many little things had been going wrong that I just wanted to say screw you to the apartment people and get out as fast as I could .
However , I had signed a letter earlier saying I 'll clean up the entire apartment before I leave , failing which , they 'll charge me ridiculous amounts of cash for pesky little things - $ 25 for failing to defrost the fridge , $ 2 per bag of trash I leave .
With a new house that still needed setting up and lots of cleaning , I was in no mood to clean an old apartment after I had tons of problems with it .
So I did what any text - loving person would do .
Wrote them a strongly - worded letter and asked for stamped confirmation of their receipt of the letter and their signed & time - stamped follow - up decision .
In the end , I did n't have to go back and spend 10 - 12 hours cleaning the apartment .
They did n't charge me anything for cleanup or maintenance .
Cost me less than 2 hours of my idle - time sitting on a computer and typing away like I do anyway .
If you 're curious and not afraid of the dreaded PDF format , here 's the ass - kicking letter to my apartment complex , the real name replaced with [ Del Boca Vista ] : Letter to Del Boca Vista .
In case you 're wondering , I exaggerated a LOT in the letter .
Things were n't half as bad as I claimed they were .
But hey , I did n't wanna clean up !
And I should n't have had to after going through all of that !
New Orleans - GIVEN President Bush 's final decision not to head to Texas in advance of Hurricane Rita , it 's worth noting that American presidents have long found both political riches and peril at the scene of a storm .
A listen to the tapes of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's White House telephone conversations of 40 years ago reveals that history does indeed repeat itself , even if presidential reactions and motivations have varied widely .
On the evening of Sept. 9 , 1965 , Hurricane Betsy , a Category 4 storm , roared into Louisiana with winds of up to 160 miles per hour .
The next day , President Johnson followed coverage of the damage , watching the three television sets in the Oval Office and monitoring the news service wires clacking away inside the soundproof cabinet next to his desk .
Then , at 2:36 in the afternoon , Senator Russell Long of Louisiana , son of the legendary Huey Long , called the president and urged him to come to New Orleans .
Floodwaters had spilled over the levees , and three - quarters of New Orleans was under water .
The senator opened with a geography lesson .
" Mr. President , aside from the Great Lakes , the biggest lake in America is Lake Pontchartrain , " he said .
" It is now drained dry .
That Hurricane Betsy picked up the lake and up and put it inside New Orleans and Jefferson Parish . "
Long said that his own house had been destroyed , but that his true concern was " my people -- oh , they 're in tough shape . "
Not fully convinced that his message had gotten through to his old friend and fellow Southerner , Long chose the most direct route to Johnson 's famously weak heart : electoral politics .
" If you want to go to Louisiana right now -- you lost that state last year you could save yourself a campaign speech , " the senator insisted .
" Just go there right now and say , ' My God , this is horrible !
These federally constructed levees that Hale Boggs and Russell Long built is the only thing that saved 5,000 lives ! " '
Customers are n't the only ones frustrated with the high - definition format wars — Sony CEO Howard Stringer is reaching the end of his rope as well .
Blu-ray , which is backed by Sony , was doing well up until recently and winning the war based on merits , Stringer said at an event in New York .
That is , up until movie studio Paramount decided to " change sides " and go exclusively HD DVD in August .
Things have apparently become more difficult since then , and the high - profile CEO is showing signs of wear .
" It 's a difficult fight , " Stringer was quoted saying by the Associated Press , going so far as to describe the situation as a " stalemate . "
He candidly indicated that the war mostly came down to bragging rights over who was winning , and said that the two camps could have collaborated better in the past to develop one format .
Stringer even said that he wished he could go back in time to make that possible — is that the smell of regret floating in the air ?
Indeed , without some sort of compromise , it does n't appear as if the battle will be over any time soon .
The two sides have been going back and forth in the media as to who has been " winning " at any given time , with Sony taking a lead in overall player sales , but HD DVD winning out when it comes to standalone players ( most of Blu- ray 's players come as part of the PS3 console ) .
The rest of the market has been forced to take sides in many cases too , with Blockbuster and Target giving points to the Blu-ray camp while HD DVD remains more popular among European movie studios .
The stream of news about little victories between the two is nearly endless — and " little " they are , as the market is still so small that just the changing of the wind can tip the scales in either direction .
Market research firm Forrester Research recently revised its stance on the Blu-ray versus HD DVD deadlock , saying that it was sure to continue well into 2009 , if not longer .
As a consumer , that news is just plain dreadful , and for a manufacturer with hands in the game , probably even worse .
A large majority of consumers are still hesitant to buy players for either format .
And with customers not spending money , neither camp will come out on top .
Stringer appears to have finally come to that realization — will Toshiba hear his cries and come a - knockin ' ?
We 'd love to be wrong on this one , but we just do n't see it happening now .
It 's just too late .

Keith Olbermann speaks with retired Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift ( whose successful representation of the Hamdan case brought to light many of the atrocities happening at Guantanamo ) about the sad and disturbing news that Canada has placed the U.S. on a watch list -- along with Iran , China , Syria and others -- for being a country that tortures its prisoners , due in no small part to our criminally shameful treatment of Canadians Maher Arar and Omar Khadr ( imprisoned in Guantanamo at the age of 15 ) .
What a proud legacy Bush and Cheney will leave this country with .
As an advocacy journalist who has written time and time again of pedophilia , I am purely disgusted with the Canadian judicial system .
You may be asking why .
It was upon reading where a father of a four - year - old child received only four years for his crime , it sickens me beyond belief .
This father -- that is if you can call him that -- video - taped his daughter while raping her .
As reported in this article , “ The four - year sentence handed down Thursday takes into account time already served , which means the man will serve another 20 months and will then be on probation for three years . ”
The United States has been the brunt of negative reporting when it comes to the treatment of detainees especially those housed at GITMO .
We have been the brunt of negative reporting when it comes to the use of torture in order to gain information from them .
To those around the world who have spoken out against the United States ; will you do the same towards Canada ?
I find it immoral and unconscionable for this recidivist monster to get away basically scot - free from the crime committed upon a child .
This is not sentence is not a commensurate form of punishment .
How can the Canadian judicial system allow for this sentence ?
Those who adjudicate these crimes often are far removed from the crime itself , but the detective handling this case said of this sentence that it " was too lenient . "
I cannot even fathom being in his shoes forced to watch the rape of a child knowing full well what this little girl will face in the days , weeks , months and years ahead .
The detective handling this case also had this to add that " Nobody ever thinks of the children in this . "
Well obviously this judge was not thinking of this child .
What message is sent to other pedophiles that are out there committing the same crime ?
It says to me ; go to Canada for a lenient sentence if caught .
Meanwhile this miscreant 's lawyer stated his client was , " physically assaulted twice while behind bars , and has lost 130 pounds since his arrest . "
Excuse me for not feeling sympathetic towards this monster as I have dealt with this issue for over ten years .
My message to the Canadian government is to set up special sections within these prisons , and to sentence them to life in prison without parole .
Once this monster is let out of prison , he will commit this crime again .
Where is the protection for the next child ?
This crime of pedophilia is a world - wide problem as these recidivist monsters trade their pictures across the Internet .
This arrest resulted in the arrest of 82 other pedophiles .
As we look to protect our children not only here in the United States but others world - wide , the sickening thought is that there are more of these monsters out there preying upon our children .
Thankfully we are learning the lesson the hard way here in the United States that lesser sentences do not work and we are demanding harsher sentences .
I have to wonder if this monster will be placed on the Canadian sex offender list .
It specifies , “ The legislation compels offenders who are convicted of designated sex offences to register specified information about themselves with the police for 10 or 20 years , or for life , depending on the offence . ”
Not good enough , Canada .
While our data - base also known as Megan ’s Law allows for the general public to have access to this information Canada ’s law “ prohibits public access to the information on the database and it cannot be used for the purposes of public notification . ”
Then again , in the past , I have reported that these lists simply do not work .
They are a panacea that lulls us all into a false sense of security .
To prove so , I have already written numerous pieces of the inadequacy of Megan ’s Law and others like it for my blog .
World governments often think that terrorism is a result of terrorists bombing places and taking the lives of the innocent .
I would go them one better , pedophiles are equally terrorizing the innocent especially the most innocent , our children .
These victims of terrorism will walk around with these scars for a life - time .
Canada is to be condemned for giving this terrorist such a light sentence .

" It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority . " -- Benjamin Franklin
When I get to John Simpson and his band of lexicographers in Oxford , they are working on the P's .
Pletzel , plish , pod person , point - and - shoot , polyamorous - these words are all new , one way or another .
They have been plowing through the P's for two years , but they ’re almost done now ( except that they ’ll never be done ) , and the Q’s will be “ just a twinkle of an eye , ” Simpson says .
He prizes patience and the long view .
He is the latest in a distinguished line , the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary , whose names roll fluently off his tongue , “ Murray , Bradley , Craigie , Onions , Burchfield , so however many fingers that is . ”
A pale , soft - spoken man of middle height and profound intellect , he sees himself as a steward of their traditions .
“ Basically it ’s the same work as they used to do in the 19th century .
When I started in 1976 , we were still working very much on these index cards , everything was done on these index cards . ”
He picks up a stack of 6 - inch by 4 - inch slips and riffles through them .
A thousand of these slips are sitting on his desk , and within a stone ’s throw are millions more , filling metal files and wooden boxes with the ink of two centuries , words , words , words .
But the word slips have gone obsolete now , as Simpson well knows .
They are treeware ( a word that entered the OED in September as “ computing slang , freq. humorous ” ) .
Blog was recognized in 2003 , dot - commer in 2004 , metrosexual in 2005 , and the verb Google last June .
Simpson has become a frequent and accomplished Googler himself , and his workstation connects to an vast and interlocking set of searchable databases , a better and better approximation of what might be called All Previous Text .
The OED has met the Internet , and however much Simpson loves the OED ’s roots and legacy , he is leading a revolution , willy - nilly — in what it is , what it knows , what it sees .
The English language , spoken by as many as 2 billion people in every country on Earth , has entered a period of ferment , and this place may be the best observation platform available .
The perspective here is both intimate and sweeping .
In its early days , the OED found words almost exclusively in books ; it was a record of the formal written language .
No longer .
The language upon which the lexicographers eavesdrop is larger , wilder and more amorphous ; it is a great , swirling , expanding cloud of messaging and speech : newspapers , magazines , pamphlets ; menus and business memos ; Internet news groups and chat - room conversations ; television and radio broadcasts and phonograph records .
The OED is unlike any other dictionary , in any language .
Not simply because it is the biggest and the best , though it is .
Not just because it is the supreme authority .
It wears that role reluctantly : it does not presume ( or deign ) to say that any particular usage or spelling is correct or incorrect ; it aims merely to capture the language people use .
No , what makes the OED unique is a quality for which it can only strive : completeness .
It wants every word , all the lingo : idioms and euphemisms , sacred or profane , dead or alive , the King ’s English or the street ’s .
The OED is meant to be a perfect record , perfect repository , perfect mirror of the entire language .
James Murray , the editor who assembled the first edition through the final decades of the 19th century , was really speaking of the language when he said , in 1900 : “ The English Dictionary , like the English Constitution , is the creation of no one man , and of no one age ; it is a growth that has slowly developed itself adown the ages . ”
And developing faster nowadays .
The OED tries to grasp the whole arc of an ever - changing history .
Murray knew that with adown he was using a word that could be dated back to Anglo - Saxon of the year 975 .
When John Updike begins his New Yorker review of the new John le Carré novel by saying , “ Hugger - mugger is part of life , ” it is the OED that gives us the first recorded use of the word , in 1529 ( “ ... not alwaye whyspered in hukermoker , ” Sir Thomas More ) and 27 more quotations from four different centuries .
But when The New York Times prints a timely editorial about sock puppets , meaning false identities assumed on the Internet , the OED has more work to do .
The version now under way is only the Third Edition .
The first , containing 414,825 words in ten weighty volumes , was presented to King George V and President Coolidge in 1928 .
Several “ Supplements ” followed , but not till 1989 did the Second Edition appear : 20 volumes , totaling 21,730 pages .
It weighed 138 pounds .
The Third Edition is a mutation .
It is weightless , taking its shape in the digital realm .
To keyboard it , Oxford hired a team of 150 typists in Florida for 18 months .
( That was before the verb keyboard had even found its way in , as Simpson points out ; not to mention the verb outsource . )
No one can say for sure whether OED3 will ever be published in paper and ink .
By the point of decision , not before 20 years or so from now , it will have doubled in size yet again .
In the meantime , it is materializing before the world ’s eyes , bit by bit , on line .
It is a thoroughgoing revision of the entire text , expected to cost around $ 55 million , involving a permanent staff of 70 plus hundreds of free - lancers , consultants , and volunteers in Oxford and around the world .
Whereas the Second Edition just added new words and new usages to the original entries , the current project is researching and revising from scratch - preserving the history , but aiming at a more coherent whole .
The revised installments began to appear on line in the year 2000 .
( Institutions and individuals pay substantial fees for access , but not enough for the OED to turn a profit ; it never has . )
Simpson chose to begin the revisions not with the letter A but with M. Why ?
It seems the original OED was not quite a seamless masterpiece .
Murray did start at A , logically , and the early letters show signs of the enterprise ’s immaturity .
“ Basically he got here , sorted his suitcases out and started setting up text , ” Simpson says .
( Murray died in 1915 — somewhere in the T’s — but everyone around here , young or old , seems to talk about him as though he ’s still wandering the corridors . )
The entries in A tended to be smaller , with different senses of a word crammed together , instead of teased lovingly apart in subentries .
“ It just took them a long time to sort out their policy and things , ” Simpson says , “ so if we started at A , then we ’d be making our job doubly difficult .
I think they ’d sorted themselves out by ... ”
He stops to think .
“ Well , I was going to say D , but Murray always said that E was the worst letter , because his assistant , Henry Bradley , started E , and Murray always said that he did that rather badly .
So then we thought , maybe it ’s safe to start with G , H . But you get to G and H and there ’s I , J , K , and you know , you think , well , start after that . ”
So the first wave of revision encompassed a thousand entries from M to mahurat .
The rest of the M’s , the N’s and the O ’s have followed in due course .
That ’s why , at the end of 2006 , John Simpson and his lexicographers are working on the P’s .
Their latest quarterly installment , in September , covers pleb to Pomak .
Simpson mentions rather proudly that they scrambled at the last instant to update the entry for Pluto when the International Astronomical Union voted to rescind its planethood .
Pluto had entered the Second Edition as “ 1 . A small planet of the solar system ... ” discovered in 1930 and “ 2 .
The name of a cartoon dog ... ” first appearing in 1931 .
The Disney meaning was more stable , it turns out .
In OED3 , Pluto is still a dog but merely “ a small planetary body . ”
Even as they revise the existing dictionary in sequence , the OED lexicographers are adding new words wherever they find them , at an accelerating pace .
Beside the P’s , September ’s freshman class included agroterrorism , bahookie ( a body part ) , beer pong ( a drinking game ) , bippy ( as in , you bet your — ) , chucklesome , cypherpunk , tuneage and wonky .
Every one of these underwent intense scrutiny .
The addition of a new word is a solemn matter .
“ Because it ’s the OED , ” says Fiona McPherson , a New Words editor with auburn hair and a bit of a Scots brogue , “ once something goes in , it can not ever come out again . ”
In this respect , you could say that the OED is a roach motel ( added March 2005 : “ Something from which it may be difficult or impossible to be extricated ” ) .
A word can go obs .
or rare , but the editors feel that even the most ancient and forgotten words have a way of coming back — people rediscover them or reinvent them — and anyway they are part of the language ’s history .
The New Words department , where that history rolls forward , is not to everyone ’s taste .
“ I love it , I really really love it , ” McPherson says .
“ You ’re at the cutting edge , you ’re dealing with stuff that ’s not there , and you ’re , I suppose , shaping the language .
A lot of people are more interested in the older stuff ; they like nothing better than reading through 18th - century texts looking for the right word .
That does n’t suit me as much , I have to say . ”
Cutting edge , incidentally , is not a new word : according to the OED , H. G. Wells used it in its modern sense in 1916 .
As a rule , a neologism needs five years of solid evidence for admission to the canon .
“ We need to be sure that a word has established a reasonable amount of longevity , ” McPherson says .
“ Some things do stick around that you would never expect to stick around , and then other things , you think that will definitely be around , and everybody talks about it for six months , and then ... ”
Well , Y2 K was chosen by the American Dialect Society as the 1999 Word of the Year , and it quickly entered the OED , but it may have obs .
in its future .
There can be concerns , too , about words that do n’t reach beyond their particular place of origin .
The OED is entirely global , with words from everywhere English is spoken , but there are limits : some words remain local quirks , and the OED might not want to say they are in general use .
“ Maybe if it was used only in a small town in the Highlands , ” McPherson says .
“ Or Wisconsin or something . ”
Still , a new word as of September is bada - bing : American slang “ suggesting something happening suddenly , emphatically , or easily and predictably ; ’ Just like that ! ’ , ’ Presto ! ’ ” The Sopranos get no credit .
The historical citations begin with a 1965 audio recording of a comedy routine by Pat Cooper and continue with newspaper clippings , a television news transcript , and a line of dialogue from the first Godfather movie : “ You ’ve gotta get up close like this and bada - bing !
you blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit . ”
The lexicographers also provide an etymology , a characteristically exquisite piece of guesswork : “ Origin uncertain .
Perh. imitative of the sound of a drum roll and cymbal clash .
Perh. cf. Italian bada bene mark well . ”
But is bada - bing really an official part of the English language ?
What makes it a word ?
I ca n’t help wondering , when it comes down to it , is n’t bada - bing ( also given as badda - bing , badda badda bing , badabing , badaboom ) just a noise ?
“ I dare say the thought occurs to editors from time to time , ” says Simpson .
“ But from a lexicographical point of view we ’re interested in the conventionalized representation of strings that carry meaning .
Why , for example , do we say Wow ! rather than some other string of letters ?
Or Zap !
Researching these takes us into interesting areas of comic - magazine and radio - tv - film history and other related historical fields .
And it often turns out than they became institutionalized far earlier than people nowadays may think . ”
When Murray began work on OED1 , no one had any idea how many words were there to be found .
The best and most comprehensive dictionary of English was American , Noah Webster ’s : 70,000 words .
That was a baseline .
Where were the rest to be discovered ?
For the first editors it went almost without saying that the source , the wellspring , should be the literature of the language .
Thus it began as a dictionary of the written language , not the spoken language .
The dictionary ’s first readers combed Milton and Shakespeare ( still the single most quoted author , with more than 30,000 references ) , Fielding and Swift , histories and sermons , philosophers and poets .
“ A thousand readers are wanted , ” Murray announced in his famous 1879 public appeal .
“ The later sixteenth - century literature is very fairly done ; yet here several books remain to be read .
The seventeenth century , with so many more writers , naturally shows still more unexplored territory ... ”
He considered the territory to be large , but ultimately finite .
It no longer seems finite .
“ We ’re painting the Forth Bridge ! ” says Bernadette Paton , an associate editor .
“ We ’re running the wrong way on a travolator ! ” ( I get the first part — “ allusion to the huge task of maintaining the painted surfaces of the railway bridge over the Firth of Forth ” — but I have to ask about travolator .
Apparently it ’s a moving sidewalk . )
The OED is a historical dictionary , providing citations meant to show the evolution of every word , beginning with the earliest known usage .
So a key task , and a popular sport for thousands of volunteer word aficionados , is antedating : finding earlier citations than those already known .
This used to be painstakingly slow and chancy .
When Paton started in New Words , she found herself struggling with headcase ( “ a person whose behavior is violent and unpredictable , or markedly eccentric ” ) .
She had current citations , but she felt sure it must be older , and books were of little use .
She wandered around the office muttering , headcase , headcase , headcase .
Suddenly one of her colleagues started singing : “ My name is Bill , and I ’m a headcase / They practice making up on my face ... ”
She perked up .
“ What date would that be ? ” she asked .
“ I do n’t know , it ’s a Who song , ” he said , “ 1966 probably , something like that . ”
So “ I ’m a Boy ” by P. Townshend became the OED ’s earliest citation for headcase .
Antedating is entirely different now : online databases have opened the floodgates .
Lately Paton has been looking at words starting with pseudo - .
Searching through databases of old newspapers and historical documents has changed her view of them .
“ I tended to think of pseudo - as a prefix that just took off in the 60’s and 70’s , but now we find that a lot of them go back much earlier than we thought . ”
Also in the P’s , poison pen has just been antedated with a 1911 headline in The Evening Post in Frederick , Md. “ You get the sense that this sort of language seeps into local newspapers first , ” she says .
“ We would never in a million years have sent a reader to read a small newspaper like that . ”
The job of a New Words editor felt very different pre-cyberspace , Paton says .
“ New words were n’t proliferating at quite the rate they have done in the last 10 years .
Not just the Internet , but text messaging and so on has created lots and lots of new vocabulary . ”
Much of the new vocabulary appears online long before it will make it into books .
Take geek .
It was not till 2003 that OED3 caught up with the main modern sense : “ A person who is extremely devoted to and knowledgeable about computers or related technology . ”
Internet chit - chat provides the earliest known reference , a posting to a Usenet newsgroup , net.jokes , on Feb. 20 , 1984 .
The scouring of the Internet for evidence - the use of cyberspace as a language lab - is being systematized in a program called the Oxford English Corpus .
This is a giant body of text that begins in 2000 and now contains more than 1.5 billion words , from published material but also from websites , weblogs , chatrooms , fanzines , corporate home pages and radio transcripts .
The corpus sends its home - built web crawler out in search of text , raw material to show how the language is really used .
Consider , for example , the word edgy .
If you consulted the Second Edition , you might think it meant “ having one ’s nerves on edge ; irritable ; testy . ”
Before that , it meant “ eager , ” as in , “ He ’s very edgy to go there . ”
Before that , it just meant having sharp edges .
To find out what it means now , published literature is little help , but the evidence appears in the corpus by the hundreds : “ edgy comic style ” ; “ cool , edgy films ” ; “ edgy , cliché - free story ” ; “ edgy kind of moving look to it . ”
I ’m too embarrassed to ask the lexicographers if they have a favorite word .
They get that a lot .
Peter Gilliver tells me his anyway : twiffler .
Gilliver came to the OED by answering a job advertisement , after having irrelevantly read maths ( chiefly Brit . ) at Cambridge .
In a way he was coming home ; his parents were both linguists and he grew up listening to arguments about words .
A twiffler , in case you did n’t know , is a plate intermediate in size between a dinner plate and a bread plate .
“ I love it because it fills a gap , ” Gilliver says .
“ I also love it because of its etymology .
It comes from Dutch , like a lot of ceramics vocabulary .
Twijfelaar means something intermediate in size , and it comes from twijfelen which means to be unsure .
It ’s a plate that ca n’t make up its mind ! ”
Fiona McPherson gives me mondegreen .
A mondegreen is a misheard lyric , as in , “ Lead on , O kinky turtle . ”
It is named after the late ( and yet nonexistent ) Lady Mondegreen :
The lines of a ballad , “ They hae slain the Earl of Murray , / And laid him on the green ” are misheard as “ They hae slain the Earl of Murray and Lady Mondegreen . ”
“ A lot of people are just really excited by that word because they think it ’s amazing that there is a word for that concept , ” McPherson says .
I have my own favorites among the newest entries in OED3 .
Pixie dust is , as any child knows , “ an imaginary magical substance used by pixies . ”
Air kiss is defined with careful anatomical instructions plus a note : “ Sometimes with the connotation that such a gesture implies insincerity or affectation . ”
Builder ’s bum is reportedly Brit. and colloq . , “ with allusion to the perceived propensity of builders to expose inadvertently this part of the body . ”
It is clear , anyway , that the English of the OED is no longer the purely written language ; much less a formal or respectable English , the diction recommended by any authority .
Gilliver , a longtime editor who also seems to be the OED ’s resident historian , points out that the dictionary feels obliged to include words that many would regard simply as misspellings .
No one is particularly proud of the new entry as of December 2003 for nucular , a word not associated with high standards of diction .
“ Bizarrely , I was amazed to find that the spelling n - u - c - u - l - a-r has decades of history , ” Gilliver says .
“ And that is not to be confused with the quite different word , nucular , meaning ’of or relating to a nucule . ’”
There is even a new entry for miniscule ; it has citations going back more than 100 years .
Where do they draw the line between mere errors and significant variants ?
It ’s a problem .
In the Internet age , there ’s no point simply in counting .
“ You could find a word which occurs 500 times on Google and we still would n’t include it , because it ’s a misprint , ” Gilliver says .
Yet the very notion of correct and incorrect spelling seems under attack .
In Shakespeare ’s day , there was no such thing : no right and wrong in spelling , no dictionaries to consult .
The word debt could be spelled det , dete , dett , dette or dept , and no one would complain .
Then spelling crystallized , with the spread of printing .
Now , with mass communication taking another leap forward , spelling may be diversifying again , spellcheckers notwithstanding .
The OED so far does not recognize straight - laced , but the Oxford English Corpus finds it outnumbering strait - laced .
Similarly for font of wisdom and just desserts .
Linguists have lately coined a word for such errors — eggcorn — but it ’s not yet in the OED .
To explain why cyberspace is a challenge for the OED as well as a godsend , Gilliver uses the phrase , “ sensitive ears . ”
“ You know we are listening to the language , ” he says .
“ When you are listening to the language by collecting pieces of paper , that ’s fine , but now it ’s as if we can hear everything said anywhere .
Members of some tiny English - speaking community anywhere in the world just happen to commit their communications to the web : there it is .
You thought some word was obsolete ?
Actually no , it still survives in a very small community of people who happen to use the web — we can hear about it . ”
In part , it ’s just a problem of too much information : a small number of lexicographers with limited time .
But it ’s also that the OED is coming face to face with the language ’s boundlessness .
The universe of human discourse always has backwaters .
The language spoken in one valley was a little different from the language of the next valley , and so on .
There are more valleys now than ever , but they are not so isolated .
The language spoken in one valley was a little different from the language of the next valley , and so on .
There are more valleys now than ever , but they are not so isolated .
“ Take an expatriate community living in a non-English speaking part of the world , expatriates who live at Buenos Aires or something , ” Gilliver says .
“ Their English , the English that they speak to one another every day , is full of borrowings from local Spanish .
And so they would regard those words as part of their idiolect , their personal vocabulary . ”
They find one another in chat rooms and on blogs .
When they coin a word , anyone may hear .
Neologisms can be formed by committee : transistor , Bell Laboratories , 1948 .
Or by wags : booboisie , H. L. Mencken , 1922 .
But most arise through spontaneous generation , organisms appearing in a Petri dish , like blog ( c. 1999 ) .
If there is an ultimate limit to the sensitivity of lexicographers ’ ears , no one has yet found it .
Spontaneous coinages can have an audience of one .
They can be as ephemeral as atomic particles in a bubble chamber .
The rate of change in the language itself — particularly the process of neologism — has surely shifted into a higher gear now , but away from dictionaries , scholars of language have no clear way to measure the process .
When they need quantification , they look to the dictionaries .
“ An awful lot of neologisms are spur of the moment creations , for whether it ’s literary effect or it ’s conversational effect , ” says Naomi S. Baron , a linguist at American University who studies these issues .
“ I could probably count on the fingers of a hand and a half the serious linguists who know anything about the Internet .
That hand and a half of us are fascinated to watch how the Internet makes it possible not just for new words to be coined but for neologisms to spread like wildfire . ”
It ’s partly a matter of sheer intensity .
Cyberspace is as an engine of interconnectedness driving change in the language .
“ I think of it as a saucepan under which the temperature has been turned up , ” Gilliver says .
“ Any word , because of the interconnectedness of the English - speaking world , can spring from the backwater .
And they are still backwaters , but they have this instant connection to ordinary , everyday discourse . ”
It ’s also a matter of scale .
Like the printing press , the telegraph and the telephone before it , the Internet is transforming the language simply by transmitting information differently .
And what makes cyberspace different from all previous information technologies is its intermixing of scales from the largest to the smallest without prejudice , broadcasting to the millions , narrowcasting to groups , instant messaging one to one .
So anyone can be an OED author now .
And by the way , many try .
“ What people love to do is send us words they ’ve invented , ” Bernadette Paton says , guiding me through a windowless room used for storage of old word slips .
Will you put the word I have invented into one of your dictionaries ?
is a question in the AskOxford.com FAQ .
All the submissions go into the files ; and until there is evidence for some general usage , that ’s where the wannabes remain .
Do n’t bother sending in FAQ .
Do n’t bother sending in wannabes .
It ’s not even particularly new .
For that matter , do n’t bother sending in anything you find via Google .
“ Please note , ” the OED ’s website warns solemnly : “ it is generally safe to assume that examples found by searching the Web , using search engines such as Google , will have already been considered by OED editors . ”

A personal history of electronic writing
For the first time , I no longer have a copy of Microsoft Word installed on either of my computers .
That ’s some change .
I wrote my first two books , and many hundreds of articles , in Word .
But I ’m writing my third book in an inexpensive yet wonderful piece of Mac - only software written by a single person instead of a “ business unit ” at Redmond .
Scoured of Word , my computers feel clean , refreshed , relieved of a hideous and malign burden .
How did it come to this ?
I remember when Word was all clean and sci-fi and inspiring , on the sharp monochrome screens of late - 1980s and early - 1990s Macs .
When I was at university , hardly anyone owned a computer .
We wrote our final dissertations on Mac Classics running Word in the college Computer Room .
Afterwards , when I began to write for newspapers , the first electronic writing tool I owned was one of these :
For some reason the fact that this is called an Elektrische Schreibmaschine in German makes me feel all nostalgic for the ultrasmooth Kraftwerk future it seems I was living back then without even realising it , tapping out theatre reviews on a six - line green LCD ( not even backlit ) , and then watching the typewriter daisywheel chatter back and forth to print a hard copy , that I would then take to the library and send to the TLS or the Independent , via a facsimile machine , at 10 p per page .
After a while I was able to buy a black - and - white PowerBook 520 running Word 5 :
Screenshot : Dwayne J Perry
Many people agree that revision 5.1a , specifically , was the best version of Word that Microsoft has ever shipped , combining utility and minimalist elegance with reliability .
Sadly for me , although it was n’t strictly necessary , after a few years and a colour Performa I “ upgraded ” to Word 98 , and somehow the magic was gone .
Yes , I turned off all the crappy lurid toolbars and tried to make the compositional space as simple as possible , but by this time Word was stuffed with all kinds of “ features ” that let you print a pie-chart on the back of a million envelopes or publish your cookery graphs to your “ world wide web home - page ” , and it already felt to me that Word was only grudgingly letting me write nothing but , you know , words .
Trigger Happy got out of Word 98 and onto the streets , but not without routine crashes and the occasional catastrophic loss of a few finely honed paragraphs .
I was still somehow brainwashed , though , as perhaps many people still are today , into believing that Word was the “ serious ” word - processor : the professional tool for anyone who did heavy lifting with language .
Part of the reason for Microsoft ’s success in this propaganda trick , I think , was its brilliant choice of file - name extension .
Think about it : .doc .
That means “ document ” .
A .doc just is a document , right ?
And a document has to be a .doc .
Stands to reason .
Anything else would look amateurish .
If they had called their files . mwd or something , we might have all jumped ship a lot sooner .
Anyway , through inertia , through not even thinking about whether alternatives existed , I continued to stick with Word .
And then , like a cunning crack dealer , Microsoft threw me a freebie twist that had me hooked anew .
It was Live Word Count , which ( IIRC ) appeared in Word v. X .
Ah , Live Word Count .
When pretty much everything you write has a word - limit attached , and you realise after long and tragic experience that exceeding that limit will not cause the editor to expand the space available to you in tribute to your genius but will instead cause the sub-editors unerringly to home in precisely on the bits that must not be cut if the article is still to make any sense and cut them , then you need to know at every stage how much you have written , and how much you have left to go .
With Live Word Count , there was no longer any need to hit a key combination every 10 seconds to check the word - count ( which was often a way of procrastinating ) .
The word count was permanently right there in the toolbar , updating as you typed .
It was a beautiful thing , a real boon to anyone who wrote to predetermined length .
So I could n’t leave Word now , could I ?
( In the mean time , I also had one of these .
It was for filing articles while travelling , but I often preferred to write on that machine , with its small monochrome LCD , even when my desktop or laptop Mac was available .
So something , some unexamined preference , was percolating in my mind .
Eventually the Psion broke , and nothing as good has replaced it as an ultramobile writing tool .
So much for progress . )
Anyway , a few more years , and eventually Unspeak got out of Word v. X on my PowerMac G5 and on to the streets , but not without routine crashes and the occasional catastrophic loss of a few finely honed paragraphs .
( Sound familiar ? )
And then I began to feel a vague dissatisfaction .
My eye started roving .
I would check out the other word - processors walking down the street , observing their smooth lines and lithe swing , imagining what it would be like to be with them instead .
Crucially , Live Word Count became available in a range of other programs .
( Amazingly , though , it seems that PC users did not get a live word count from Microsoft until Word 2007 . )
Mac users can now get it pretty much anywhere .
The guitar - rocking genius at Transparent Head even hacked me up a version of TextEdit that had a live word count in a floating window .
The second crucial thing was an answer to prayers I had n’t even known I was praying .
It was Full - Screen Mode , which I first discovered in WriteRoom .
( ( WriteRoom is Mac-only , but PC users can try a similar experience with JDarkRoom . ) )
WriteRoom ’s slogan is “ distraction - free writing ” , and it does just what it says on the tin .
Your entire screen is blacked out , except for the text you are working on .
I now use WriteRoom for all my journalism .
When I ’m working , the screen of my MacBook looks like this :
Pretty old - skool , huh ?
It ’s perfect : far less temptation to switch to a browser window , much better concentration on the text in front of you .
WriteRoom has a “ typewriter - scrolling mode ” , so that the line you are typing is always centred in the screen , not forever threatening to drop off the bottom , and what you have already written scrolls rapidly up off the top of the screen , dissuading you from idly rereading it .
It ’s a bit like the endless roll of typewriter paper on which Jack Kerouac wrote
On the Road .
So WriteRoom allows me to turn my whizzy modern computer into the nearest equivalent possible ( allowing for modern conveniences like backup to the internet and so on ) to my old Brother typewriter and its six - line LCD .
The focus is on the words and nothing else .
Except for that line you can just make out at the bottom left of the screen .
That ’s the Live Word Count .
Microsoft
Word still uses the metaphor of the page , the computer screen that imitates a blank , bounded sheet of physical paper .
For me , this is outdated and unimaginative .
It has become a barrier rather than a window .
And there is always the distraction of changing font and line - spacing , jumping ahead too quickly to imagining the text as a visual , physical product instead of a process , a fluid semantic interplay .
Instead , turning my MacBook into a kind of replica 1980s IBM machine , with the words glowing and hovering in an interstellar void , is liberating : as though I am composing the Platonic ideal of a text that might eventually take many different forms .
Through WriteRoom
I then discovered Scrivener , a more sophisticated program with excellent features for managing very large documents or document collections : like a book .
I could n’t have written Unspeak , with its many hundreds of footnotes , in WriteRoom ; but I could have in Scrivener .
I ’m writing my next book in Scrivener , and a significant part of my enjoyment of the process is that I ’m not doing it in Word , so somehow it does n’t feel so much like cubicular , fluorescent - lit work .
And it can also do Platonic simplicity .
When working on a chapter , I set Scrivener up to give me exactly the same full - screen orange - on - black view as my WriteRoom environment above , with one exception : the Live Word Count does n’t appear unless you mouse over the bottom of the screen .
Which is perfect for writing a book , where length is not crucial on a paragraph - to - paragraph basis , and it eliminates the last possible distraction from your mindworld .
And imagine trying the following with Microsoft – when I first used Scrivener I was a bit irritated that the cursor was a thin blinking line , which I found interfered with my new - found writing Zen .
So I posted on the programmer ’s forum saying could we please maybe have the same square , non-blinking block cursor as you get in WriteRoom ?
With the next beta , he had done it .
That ’s customer service .
( ( As Scrivener ’s creator relates , he emailed Jesse Grosjean , Writeroom ’s author , wondering how he did the block - cursor thing ; very generously , Grosjean just gave him the code , and even recommends Scrivener on his own website . ) )
Am I not worried that WriteRoom and Scrivener , delightful though they are , are small products from tiny outfits , not “ supported ” by the corporate might of a large company such as Microsoft ?
No , I ’m not .
Because actually my writing is now more secure .
Instead of a bloated proprietary file format like .doc , both programs use accessible formats – . txt , .xml , .rtf ( ( RTF is actually proprietary , originally developed by DEC and now owned by Microsoft , but it ’s so widespread now that ( fingers crossed ) they wo n’t be able to break it . ) ) – that ( as far as one can predict these things ) will be readable forever .
My new book is one big “ project ” in Scrivener , but under the hood each chapter is a universally accessible .rtf file , which can be opened and used in a multitude of other programs .
The last question is one of interoperability , and on first sight it ’s a serious one .
Surely if everyone else is using Microsoft Word and we are sending documents back and forth to each other , then I need to use Microsoft Word too ?
I imagine that kind of reasoning sells the majority of new copies .
But for me it does n’t matter at all .
If I just need to read a Word document , I can open it in pretty much any Mac program .
If I need to exchange files back and forth using comments or Track Changes , I can do that through Google Apps or Pages .
If someone really insists on sending me a Word document so festooned with all its formatting “ features ” , tables , graphics , and so on that it does n’t work in another program , I am just likely to respond :
What the fuck ?
So that ’s how it is now .
I write within the pure , glowing universes of Scrivener and WriteRoom .
I send articles to the Guardian as plain - text rather than .doc .
I am confident that I will be able to open those articles and the chapters of my book again , if I want to , in 30 years ’ time .
And now a 1000 - word review weighs 4 K instead of 30 K .
I weep at all the innocent electrons I wastefully killed over the years , sending those massive , lumbering Word documents through the internet .
I apologise for my particle profligacy .
I have learned my lesson .
Goodbye , cruel Word .

A to - scale schematic of the quadruple stellar system overlayed for comparison with a diagram of the solar system 's planetary orbits .
AUSTIN , Texas —
A quartet of stars has beendiscovered in an intimate cosmic dance , swirling around each other within aregion about the same as Jupiter 's orbit around the sun .
Astronomerssay a gaseous disk might have once engulfed and pushed the stars into theirtight orbits .
Though bright , the stellar system was thought to be a single star dubbed BD - 22°5866 .
Now , research presented here today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Societyreveals the pinpoint of light is a rare system of four closely orbiting stars .
The group is located about 166 light - years from the sun .
In our sky , they arejust south of the constellation Aquarius .
Each of thestars is about half as massive as the sun and older than 500 million years .
Thesun , by comparison , is 4.6 billion years old .
Since moststars form as part of a multiple - starsystem , the new findings could have implications for understanding theevolution of stars .
EvgenyaShkolnik of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and NASAAstrobiology Institute and colleagues spotted the foursome while surveyinghundreds of nearby low - mass stars with the Keck I telescope and the Canada - France - Hawaii telescope , both on the summit of Mauna Kea .
At the timeof the observations , two of the stars were orbiting each other at 300,000 mph( 483,000 kilometers per hour ) , taking under five days to complete anorbit .
The other couple had an orbit speed of 120,000 miles per hour ( 193,000 kilometers per hour ) and takes about 55 days for a complete jaunt around theircommon gravitational midpoint in space .
The firstpair has an orbit radius of at most .06 astronomical units ( AU ) , where one AUis the average distance between Earth and the sun .
The second pair has amaximum radius of .26 AU .
The twopairs also promenade each other in less than nine years with a maximum radiusof just 5.8 AU .
Jupiter , to compare , is 5.2 AU from the sun .
Theresearchers say that fewer than 1 in 2,000 stars observed might be involved insuch intimatelybound systems .
" Theextraordinarily tight configuration of this stellar system tells us that theremay have been a single gaseous disk that forced them into such small orbitswithin the first 100,000 years of their evolution , " Shkolnik said , " as the stars could not have formed so close to one another . "
In fact , the spin energy of the more rapidly rotating pair , mixed with the gravitationalinteraction between the two pairs , has pushed the other pair farther away overthe years .
" Atone point early in its history , it was even closer than we see now , " Shkolnik told SPACE.com .
Theresearch has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The established superpower arose riding a wave of fossil - fueled prosperity .
The emerging one , sitting on a wealth of coal , sees few reasons not to follow suit ; after all , it has only just caught its wave ( with India and others in hot pursuit ) .
Yet the tide can only be turned , a host of scientists and economists with varied perspectives agree , if China and other rising powers like India speed through the familiar path in nation building  resource extraction , industrial and economic growth , accompanying despoliation , and then environmental restoration and protection .
If they do n’t , their emissions will eventually swamp all other sources , according to many analyses .
Richard Richels , an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute , helped produce an ominous forecast : even if the established industrial powers turned off every power plant and car right now , unless there are changes in policy in poorer countries the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could still reach 450 parts per million  a level deemed unacceptably dangerous by many scientists  by 2070 .
( If no one does anything , that threshold is reached in 2040 . )
Libertarians say that once countries get rich , they ’ll do the right thing for the climate .
But critics of this view say the long life of carbon dioxide ( and of sources like the coal - burning plants China is building at the rate of one a week ) mean that waiting just compounds the problem beyond fixing .
Theories abound over how best to help China embrace emissions - reducing policies .
One way , many scientists and scholars say , is to make nonpolluting energy sources cheaper than the unfettered burning of abundant fossil fuels .
Right now they are far more expensive .
When asked how his officers had reacted to the decriminalization of pot possession in Oregon and in Washington State where he previously headed up departments , Roberts reclined in his office chair and smiled .
" When that law was first passed , most police officers thought that the end of the world as we know it was about to occur , " he said .
" But , we thought the same thing when the Miranda decision came down . " [ Joplin Globe ]
The superb efforts of our friends at Law Enforcement Against Prohibition notwithstanding , police generally oppose efforts to reform marijuana laws .
Initiatives in Colorado and Nevada were vehemently contested by law - enforcement interests , who claimed that reform would invite crime and undermine community safety .
Sheriff Fred Wagner of Park County , CO even tried to link marijuana reform efforts to a recent school shooting .
Intuitively , there 's nothing surprising about police lobbying to retain the gratuitous powers granted them by the war on drugs .
Yet , as marijuana arrests reach a new record high each year , it becomes increasingly difficult to point towards any societal benefit to these costly attacks on otherwise law - abiding Americans .
Because I believe most officers really do want to protect the communities they serve and make a difference , I have often pondered their willful enforcement of , and political support for , a war that endangers communities while failing to a make a difference .
I was pleasantly surprised , therefore , to learn that Joplin , MO Police Chief Lane Roberts has pledged not to oppose a local marijuana decriminalization initiative .
Roberts correctly defines his role as defending the constitution rather than opining on what the law ought to be .
But he goes on to explain that officers sometimes overreact to policy changes that reduce police authority :
Miranda is such a wonderful analogy for law - enforcement 's knee - jerk assumption that any restriction on police power will invite pure chaos .
The U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona that police must inform criminal suspects of their 5th Amendment right against self - incrimination before conducting interrogations provoked panic among police .
Murderers and rapists would go free , we were told , and crimes of the most despicable nature would become unsolvable .
The result was nothing of the sort .
Police simply became more professional .
It turned out that the freakiest psycho killers still insisted on confessing their misdeeds , while the rest got taken down through good old - fashioned police work .
" You have the right to remain silent … " has become a popular and familiar symbol of due process , and the horror show predicted by law enforcement has been long forgotten .
The point here is that it was the experts , the interrogation specialists themselves , who were so wrong about Miranda .
Today , when police speak out against marijuana reform , they are motivated not by experience at all , but rather a fear of the unknown .
Indeed , today 's officers simply have no real frame of reference for what law - enforcement in a post - drug war America would look like .
I 'm optimistic , however , that whatever our friends at LEAP can't explain to their colleagues will ultimately find a way to explain itself .
Inevitably , the truth about drug policy reform will become self - evident each and every time it is given the opportunity to do so .
Update : I 've posted a follow - up to emphasize the important point that a significant number of police officers actually do realize the drug war is n't working and continue to fight it anyway
Defining something by the absence of something else is a mindset of incompletion , a hedonistic and fearful approach .
It ’s hedonistic because we try to isolate only the “ good ” things from the whole , and it ’s fearful because we do that by fear of the other , “ bad ” side .
Choosing only one side of the coin is useless and ineffective .
You ca n’t have a full coin if you chose only one side of it .

flawlessness
its about how complete can you become after accepting the reality
incomplete yet so flawless
Thanks to Pravin Talan for sharing this video
Whether its about business or personal life ,
We tend to define perfection as tool to succeed and it starts with the search for " The Perfect " : perfect idea , perfect business partner , perfect life partner , perfect job , perfect product , perfect boss , perfect employee , perfect marketing ... list goes on .
In this process of finding the perfect thing , we set our standards by looking at the world around us and not the world inside each one of us .
Every time we evaluate something , we tend to magnify missing pieces & qualify it as incomplete or flawful because it does not fit into self imposed standards ( which were set by looking at perfect things of the world but by underestimating the effort that made the perfection possible ) .
We forget that flaws are reality Hence for me , “ ” is not about perfection , .
It might be little difficult to understand this until I ask you to watch a great ballet performance video below .
This is what I callWe always expect things to be perfect around us , a missing piece in our universe starts to cause discomfort .
But we forget that we have started to take many things just for granted , even when we never owned it .
Louis CK puts it in right perspective
WASHINGTON , Jan 10 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush have stymied efforts to tighten regulation of tobacco and discourage smoking and states have not spent nearly enough to battle cigarettes , the American Lung Association said on Thursday .
The group implied that heavy lobbying and spending by tobacco companies was influencing at least some politicians and urged Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate cigarettes .
" While many states have failed to make meaningful progress at protecting their most vulnerable citizens , the tobacco companies are spending billions of dollars annually marketing their deadly products , " the report reads .
" A report issued by Common Cause and the Tobacco - Free Kids Action Fund found that the tobacco industry made almost $ 3 million in Political Action Committee contributions to federal candidates during the 2005 - 2006 election cycle , including more than $ 1.7 million in contributions directly to federal candidates , " it adds .
" The Institute on Money in State Politics found that tobacco companies and retailers gave over $ 96 million to state - level candidates , committees and ballot measure campaigns during the 2005 and 2006 election cycle . "
In 1998 , states reached a settlement with tobacco companies in which they received $ 246 billion over 25 years to pay for the costs of smoking - related illnesses .
But anti-smoking campaigners say states have raided these and other tobacco - prevention funds to cover budget deficits , build roads or pay for non -tobacco related projects .
PRESIDENTIAL VETO
" While the American Lung Association applauds the U.S. Congress for increasing the federal cigarette excise tax by $ 0.61 to $ 1.00 per pack , unfortunately it was vetoed by the president and will not take effect , " the report read .
" The increased tax would have resulted in current smokers quitting and fewer children starting to smoke . "
The report praises efforts by some states .
" Twenty - one states , the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have now approved comprehensive smoke - free air legislation , " it reads .
" In 2007 , seven states -- Illinois , Maryland , Minnesota , New Mexico , New Hampshire , Oregon and Tennessee -- significantly strengthened their smoke - free air laws .
Tennessee is the first traditional tobacco - growing state to pass strong restrictions on smoking in public places and workplaces . "
But states are slower to raise tobacco taxes -- which several studies show can deter smokers .
And they also do not spend nearly as much as is recommended on programs to prevent smoking and to help smokers kick the habit , the Lung Association complained .
" More than half of states have not passed comprehensive laws prohibiting secondhand smoke in workplaces and other public places , " the report reads .
" Until the political will can be found to implement the proven and effective policies graded in this report , over 438,000 people each year will continue to die from tobacco - related diseases . "
The Lung Association report accuses tobacco companies of marketing to youths and even to children with new flavored cigarettes and brightly colored packaging .
Nearly 21 percent of Americans smoke -- a total of 45 million people , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

The love of my life , a kindhearted , smart , funny man with big blue eyes and a penchant for pasta and for taking corners a bit too fast is on his way out to you .
I fell for him when I first saw him in the grocery store , with a small basket that contained milk and a frozen pizza .
We started dating and things fell into place and life was good .
Then he got the call .
A prestigious company wanted him for his dream job .
The catch ?
It 's in Seattle .
I helped him pack the crates and his car and only cried a bit this morning in his presence while saying goodbye , that I loved him , that he would love Seattle , that life would be fine , that it 's only going to be a year until I can join him .
I waited until he left to really break down and realize how different life is going to be without him , and how much I will miss him .
And I will be happy to join him , out there in the great big Pacific Northwest , with your green mountains and big lakes and your progressive politics and nice people and strong coffee .
And an ocean where you can watch the sun set instead of rise .
I 'll be able to do what I most want to do , which is wake up next to him every morning for the rest of my life .
But for another year I am here , finishing up grad school and trying hard not to get too sad , miss him too much .
So I 'm just asking you a few small favors on his behalf .
Be nice to him when he 's buying Seattle 's Best , which is his favorite .
Wave to him when you see him walking to work , which he 'll be able to do for the first time .
Perhaps a few of you could even help him unpack the crates or give him directions or tell him where the good restaurants are .
He is a sweet guy , and Seattle is a nice town .
I know you 'll take the very best care of him until I can be there to do it myself .
Thank you ,
The adoring girlfriend
Jim Hammond is an elite athlete .
He works out two hours a day with a trainer , pushing himself through sprints , runs , and strength - building exercises .
His resting heart rate is below 50 .
He ’s won three gold medals and one silver in amateur competitions this year alone , running races from 100 to 800 meters .
In his division , he ’s broken four national racing records .
But perhaps the most elite thing about Hammond is his age .
He is 93 .
And really , there ’s nothing much wrong with him , aside from the fact that he does n’t see very well .
He takes no drugs and has no complaints , although his hair long ago turned white and his skin is no longer taut .
His secret ?
He does n’t have one .
Hammond never took exceptional measures during his long life to preserve his health .
He did not exercise regularly until his fifties and did n’t get serious about it until his eighties , when he began training for the Georgia Golden Olympics .
“ I love nothing better than winning , ” he says .
“ It ’s been a wonderful thing for me . ”
Hammond is aging , certainly , but somehow he is n’t getting old — at least , not in the way we usually think about it .
They say aging is one of the only certain things in life .
But it turns out they were wrong .
In recent years , gerontologists have overturned much of the conventional wisdom about getting old .
Aging is not the simple result of the passage of time .
According to a provocative new view , it is actually something our own bodies create , a side effect of the essential inflammatory system that protects us against infectious disease .
As we fight off invaders , we inflict massive collateral damage on ourselves , poisoning our own organs and breaking down our own tissues .
We are our own worst enemy .
This paradox is transforming the way we understand aging .
It is also changing our understanding of what diseases are and where they come from .
Inflammation seems to underlie not just senescence but all the chronic illnesses that often come along with it : diabetes , atherosclerosis , Alzheimer ’s , heart attack .
“ Inflammatory factors predict virtually all bad outcomes in humans , ” says Russell Tracy , a professor of pathology and biochemistry at the University of Vermont College of Medicine , whose pioneering research helped demonstrate the role of inflammation in heart disease .
“ It predicts having heart attacks , having heart failure , becoming diabetic ; predicts becoming fragile in old age ; predicts cognitive function decline , even cancer to a certain extent . ”
The idea that chronic diseases might be caused by persistent inflammation has been kicking around since the 19th century .
Only in the past few years , though , have modern biochemistry and the emerging field of systems biology made it possible to grasp the convoluted chemical interactions involved in bodywide responses like inflammation .
Over a lifetime , this essential set of defensive mechanisms runs out of bounds and gradually damages organs throughout the body .
When you start to think about aging as a consequence of inflammation , as Tracy and many prominent gerontologists now do , you start to see old age in a different , much more hopeful light .
If decrepitude is driven by an overactive immune system , then it is treatable .
And if many chronic diseases share this underlying cause , they might all be remedied in a similar way .
The right anti-inflammatory drug could be a panacea , treating diabetes , dementia , heart disease , and even cancer .
Such a wonder drug might allow us to live longer , but more to the point , it would almost surely allow us to live better , increasing the odds that we could all spend our old age feeling like Jim Hammond : healthy , vibrant , and vital .
And unlike science fiction visions of an immortality pill , a successful anti-inflammatory treatment could actually happen within our lifetime .
For the last century and a half , the average life span in wealthy countries has increased steadily , climbing from about 45 to more than 80 years .
There is no good reason to think this increase will suddenly stop .
But longer life today often simply means taking longer to die — slowly , expensively , and with more disease and disability .
“ If you talk to many old people , what they are really desperate about is not the fact that they ’re going to die but that they are going to be sick , dependent , have to rely on others , ” says Luigi Ferrucci , chief of the longitudinal studies section at the National Institute on Aging and director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging , the nation ’s longest - running study of old age .
Biologists have known for a while that inflammation increases with age , but until recently , given everything else that slumps , spikes , or goes off the rails as we get old , it did n’t seem especially important .
Some researchers on aging still think that way .
But a big clue linking inflammation with aging came in the late 1990s , when Tracy and his colleagues showed that C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , an inflammatory protein , is an amazingly accurate predictor of a future heart attack — as good as or better than high blood pressure or high cholesterol .
At least in heart disease , inflammation is n’t just a bystander .
What ’s more , we could do something to decrease it .
Aspirin , which was already known to help people with heart disease , seems to work primarily by reducing inflammation .
So why should our own immune system rely on such an apparently dangerous mechanism ?
The answer lies in the fact that infectious disease has historically been the number one killer of human beings , and responding to this threat has profoundly shaped our biology .
Possessing a fierce and ferocious immune response primed to keep us alive long enough to reproduce was an evolutionary no -brainer .
Damage to the joint from sever arthritic inflammation often requires a hip replacement .

Inflammation is what gives us that response .
It serves as all - purpose protection against invaders and traumatic damage .
To take a simple scenario , suppose you are bitten by a cat .
First , coagulation factors promote clotting in order to stanch bleeding and prevent germs from spreading from the wound site .
A menagerie of phagocytes , which swallow and destroy pathogens , surge out of the bloodstream and squeeze into the affected tissue , engulfing bacteria and secreting cytokines — messenger proteins that send out the call for more responders .
The phagocytes also generate reactive oxygen species , unstable compounds that chew up bacteria as well as damaged human tissue .
At the same time , other switches get flipped throughout the body , modifying everything from metabolism to cell growth , via other cytokines , such as IL - 6 and tumor necrosis factor–a , and things like CRP , which mark bacteria for destruction .
The specialized adaptive immune response eliminates any remaining germs .
So far , so good .
But the inflammation response can kick in even when there ’s no invader .
Atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , is a classic example .
In response to fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries , a type of phagocyte called a macrophage identifies the growing lesions as trouble spots and infiltrates them , swelling and destabilizing the deposits .
Those lesions can then break open , resulting in the formation of a blood clot that can clog blood vessels and cause heart attacks .
The more active the macrophages are , the more CRP is in the bloodstream , and the more likely the lesions will break open , block your arteries , and kill you .
The evidence that inflammation is behind other diseases is indirect , but it is mounting .
Researchers have long known that in patients with Alzheimer ’s , the areas of the human brain clogged with senility - associated plaques also bristle with inflammatory cells and cytokines .
Modern research has found that cytokines block memory formation in mice .
In diabetes , inflammation and insulin resistance apparently track together , and drugs that effectively restore insulin sensitivity also appear to reduce inflammatory factors like IL - 6 and CRP .
Inflammation is also being investigated by a group at Leiden University in the Netherlands as a culprit in declining lung function , in osteoporosis , and in old - age depression .
Even the weakness of old age may have an inflammatory cause : Ferrucci has found that inflammatory activity breaks down skeletal muscle , leading to the loss of lean muscle mass .
Being fat makes all these diseases strike earlier , and that seems to be at least in part because fat cells spur more inflammation .
These findings have provided researchers with a totally new appreciation of how subtly inflammation can work and how wildly awry it can go over time .
It ’s not about “ a massive infection or a welt the size of an egg because you got hit in the head with a two - by - four , ” Tracy says .
“ Inflammation also goes on at a much lower level . ”
As it simmers in the background , over years and decades , collateral damage accumulates — in the heart , in the brain , everywhere .
Harvey Jay Cohen , chairman of the department of medicine and director of the Center for the Study of Aging at Duke University Medical Center , likens inflammation to “ little waves lapping on the shore .
It ’s a relatively low level of activity , one that sustained over time wears away at the beach and stimulates other bad events . ”
Evolution has designed into us a cruel trade - off :
What saves us in the short term kills us over the long haul .
As we get older , acute episodes of inflammation tend to turn into chronic ones , perhaps because the regulation of the immune system becomes less efficient .
Inflammatory factors in the blood can increase two- to fourfold .
Chronic infections may be partly to blame .
Although we usually do n’t know it , nearly all adults are infected with the Epstein - Barr virus , and at least 60 percent of us with cytomegalovirus .
These two pathogens can stay in our bodies in a latent state , hiding out in our cells .
But Ronald Glaser , a viral immunologist at Ohio State University Medical Center and his research partner ( and wife ) , psychologist Janice Kiecolt - Glaser , think that these viruses are not fully dormant .
They ’ve found evidence ( pdf ) that with age , antibodies to these viruses increase , indicating a reawakened virus and an active immune response .
Early experiences may also influence the way that inflammation affects an individual ’s aging , says Caleb Finch , a neurobiologist and gerontologist at the University of Southern California .
Analyzing historical birth and death records from 19th - century Europe , he and Eileen Crimmins , a gerontologist and sociologist at the University of Southern California , found that longevity is directly related to exposure to childhood disease .
Children born during years of high neonatal mortality who survived to adulthood did n’t live as long as those born in healthier years .
The reason , he says , is inflammation : A high infectious burden in childhood results in a high inflammatory burden in adulthood , which results in a shorter , sicker life .
Conversely , Finch believes that people in affluent countries now live so long because their childhoods are free from diseases like measles , typhoid , malaria , whooping cough , and worms .
Without these diseases , people grow bigger and stronger — and live much longer .
Looking beyond provocative findings like those in Finch ’s study , Tracy and other researchers on aging say that it may be too simplistic to think of inflammation in terms of straightforward cause and effect .
Instead we must think of human biology as a group of interdependent systems .
“ Is inflammation a response to aging , or is it causing aging or disease ? ” Tracy asks .
“ My answer is : Yep , yep , yep .
It does all those things .
There ’s no other way to think about it — it ’s both cause and response to what ’s going on . ”
Inflammation is not uncontested as a theory of aging .
There are many competing hypotheses .
Yet inflammation reinforces some more than others , potentially establishing a plausible constellation of mechanisms responsible for aging .
For example , according to the “ free radical ” hypothesis of aging , we get older because of constant cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen compounds that are a natural product of metabolism .
Inflammation can partly explain how this might work .
Macrophages , as part of the inflammatory response , produce reactive oxygen species in order to attack bacteria .
Oxidative stress and inflammation clearly egg each other on , and calming one can inhibit the other .
To take another prominent example , a low - calorie diet is known to increase the life spans of creatures ranging from flatworms to rats , but no one knows why , or whether it will help humans live longer .
Inflammation provides a clue : Dietary restriction sharply inhibits the inflammatory response , and that may be part of why it promotes longevity at the same time that it reduces insulin resistance and slows dementia .
Yet another widely discussed theory of why we age blames the shortening of telomeres , chromosomal structures that , in most cells , dwindle with each division and may ultimately limit the number of times any cell can divide .
It is possible that inflammation could play a role here , too , because it prompts the faster turnover of cells in the immune system and other tissues .
Still , nobody thinks that there is a single root cause of aging — different species may age in different ways , and multiple mechanisms are probably at work .
“ I think it would be a mistake to suggest that inflammation is the cause of aging , or that all theories of aging must be tied to it , ” Cohen says .
Then again it may not ultimately matter whether inflammation is the most significant cause of our decay .
More important is that inflammation offers an unparalleled opportunity to do something about it .
Some ways to reduce inflammation are elementary .
It is impossible to know exactly what is going on in Jim Hammond ’s body , but all the aspects of his regimen — healthy food , exercise , and a good attitude — reduce systemic inflammation .
Those of us without his tenacity can turn to drug companies , which are exploring new anti-inflammatory drugs like flavonoids .
Researchers are also looking at new uses for old drugs — trying to prevent Alzheimer ’s using ibuprofen , for example .
“ The research is really to prevent the chronic debilitating diseases of aging , ” says Nir Barzilai , a molecular geneticist and director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York .
“ But if I develop a drug , it will have a side effect , which is that you will live longer . ”
Some of this research stretches the boundaries of what we know .
Rudi Westendorp , head of the department of gerontology and geriatrics at the Leiden University Medical Center , is trying to treat old - age depression with drugs that are currently used for autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis .
Harvard University researchers are considering a vaccine against atherosclerosis , which may provoke a reaction that suppresses inflammation .
The caveat with these experiments is that by modifying inflammation , we are playing with fire .
After all , fighting off infection is an absolutely essential bodily function .
“ The danger of monkeying around in a system like that is that you may do more harm than good , ” Cohen says .
But humans appear willing to renegotiate the ancient evolutionary bargain that traded robust reproductive health for frail old age .
Think of Jim Hammond if you have any doubts .
In his blog , he describes running the 800 - meter race in the 2007 National Senior Olympics games .
“ I won in a photo finish , and I broke the national record , ” he wrote .
The crowd went nuts .
At the age of 93 , Hammond had the most exhilarating experience of his entire life .
Noah Shachtman of Wired News ( who just got back from Iraq ) says ,
You might think your anonymous online rants are oh - so - clever .
But they 'll give you away , too .
A federally - funded artificial intelligence lab is figuring out how to track people over the Internet , based on how they write .

One of the dumbest things that Congress does is to issue ‘ senses of the Senate ’ and ‘ resolutions of the House ’ .
Just this week , the House voted on a resolution “ Denouncing the practices of female genital mutilation , domestic violence , honor killings , and other gender - based persecutions and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that participation , protection , recognition , and independence of women is crucial to achieving a just , moral and honorable society . ”
It passed 378 - 0 .
It has no legal effect whatsoever .
Sometimes these resolutions do have some political effect .
For example , I am a big fan of Rep. Patrick Murphy ( PA - 08 ) , but he pissed me off this summer with H. Res 467 .
Today , the House of Representatives passed Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick Murphy ’s ( D - 8th District ) resolution that repudiates the University and College Union ( UCU ) of the United Kingdom for their boycott of Israeli academic institutions .
This was Rep. Murphy ’s first resolution to receive a vote on the floor of the House and it received unanimous bipartisan support .
All that vote did was make every member of the House vote to support Israel out of fear that they be targeted by pro-Israeli forces .
That the vote was unanimous underscored that the resolution was unnecessary .
It was just a cudgel to beat down any hint of debate over Israeli policy .
And it ’s in the same context that I am unimpressed with the House Foreign Affairs Committee decision to ‘ resolve ’ yesterday that Turkey committed genocide against the Armenians in the World War One era .
That decision caused Turkey to recall their ambassador for ‘ consultations ’ .
Military consultations have also been canceled , and American tourists in Turkey have been warned they might become targets .
In addition :
About 70 percent of U.S. air cargo headed for Iraq goes through Turkey , as does about one - third of the fuel used by the U.S. military in Iraq .
U.S. bases also get water and other supplies by land from Turkish truckers who cross into the northern region of Iraqi Kurdistan .
Did Turkey commit genocide against the Armenians ?
The historians ’ consensus is ‘ yes ’ , yes they did .
Does it matter at all whether or not the Congress ‘ resolves ’ that the Turks committed genocide ?
No , no it does n’t .
All the resolution accomplishes is a rift with a vital ally at a very difficult time for our country .
The problem is n’t with Congress telling the truth about a historical tragedy .
The problem is that these stupid resolutions are a waste of time and they almost never do anything positive .
I guess the Armenians are feeling a warm fuzzy feeling .
Is it worth it ?

( CNN ) -- The Saudi Justice Ministry Tuesday issued a " clarification " of a court 's handling of a rape case and the increased punishment -- including 200 lashes -- meted out to the victim .
The case , which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system , centers on a married woman .
The 19 - year - old and an unrelated man were abducted , and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago , according to Abdulrahman al - Lahim , the attorney who represented her in court .
The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes .
But that sentence was more than doubled to 200 lashes and six months in prison by the Qatif General Court , because she spoke to the media about the case , a court source told Middle Eastern daily newspaper Arab News .
Al - Lahim told CNN his law license was revoked last week by a judge because he spoke to the Saudi - controlled media about the case .
Watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim »
In a statement issued to CNN , Saudi Ambassador to the United States , Adel al - Jubeir said , " This case is working its way through the legal process .
I have no doubt that justice will prevail . "
The Justice Ministry acknowledged in its statement Tuesday that the attorney is no longer on the case , saying he was punished by a disciplinary committee for lawyers because he " exhibited disrespectful behavior toward the court , objected to the rule of law and showed ignorance concerning court instructions and regulations . "
It added that the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence against her came to light when she appealed her original sentence .
The judges of that committee also increased the sentences for the perpetrators based on the level of their involvement in the crime .
Their sentences -- which had been two to three years in prison -- were increased to two to nine years , according to al - Lahim .
The ministry also said it welcomes constructive criticism and insisted that the parties ' rights were preserved in the judicial process .
" We would like to state that the system has ensured them the right to object to the ruling and to request an appeal , " the statement continued , " without resorting to sensationalism through the media that may not be fair or may not grant anyone any rights , and instead may negatively affect all the other parties involved in the case . "
The statement also described the progress of the woman 's case and explained that it was heard by a panel of three judges , not one judge " as mentioned in some media reports . "
It said the case was treated normally through regular court procedures , and that the woman , her male companion and the perpetrators of the crime all agreed in court to the sentences handed down .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials had " expressed our astonishment " at the sentence , though not directly to Saudi officials .
" It is within the power of the Saudi government to take a look at the verdict and change it , " he added .
White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend , who announced her resignation Monday , called the case " absolutely reprehensible " but told CNN's " American Morning " the Saudis deserve credit for their assistance in battling terrorism .
" This case is separate and apart from that , and I just do n't think there 's any explaining it or justifying it , " she added .
The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups .
" This is not just about the Qatif girl , it 's about every woman in Saudi Arabia , " said Fawzeyah al - Oyouni , founding member of the newly formed Saudi Association for the Defense of Women 's Rights .
" We 're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every Saudi woman out there .
We 're afraid of going out in the streets .
" Barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , " she added .
Human Rights
Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah " to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . "
The man and woman were attacked after they met in Qatif on the kingdom 's Persian Gulf coast , so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al - Lahim .
Citing phone records from the police investigation , al - Lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client .
He noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position .
Al - Lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day .
It is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under Saudi's Islamic law .
Al - Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month , where he faces a possible three - year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch .
He told CNN he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al - Sheikh .
" Currently she does n't have a lawyer , and I feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , " he said .
" We will not accept this judgment and I 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . "
He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month .
" The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , " he said .
Under law in Saudi Arabia , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery .
Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote .
The Saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women 's rights and creation of a human rights commission .

* There is widespread support for a more multipolar world and a greater role for " herbivorous powers " - countries not widely perceived as military superpowers
* There is mistrust of the cold - war powers as well as Islamist - inspired Iranian autocracy .
More people want to see a decline rather than an increase in the power of Russia ( 29 % decline , 23 % increase ) , of China ( 32 % decline , 24 % increase ) , of the United States ( 37 % decline , 26 % increase ) , and of Iran ( 39 % decline , 14 % increase ) .
On the other hand , there is strong support for an increase in the power of fast - developing powers such as South Africa , India and Brazil ( the " IBSA " countries )
* The European Union is the most popular great power .
Uniquely among great powers , more people across all continents want to see its power increase than decrease .
This demand for more European power extends to many former European colonies
* Whilst American soft power has declined , the rise of China has led to a resurgence in support for American power in Asia .
Increasing Russian influence in eastern Europe is paralleled by a demand for a greater American role
* Outside Europe , " the west " is still seen to some extent as a single actor : countries suspicious of American power tend also to be against EU power .
In the run-up to the Iraq war , Mary Robinson called global public opinion the " second superpower " .
She may have exaggerated its ability to sway the decision to invade Iraq , but she was right to point to its importance as a source of legitimacy in world politics .
Even in the many places where citizens cannot vote in free and fair elections , governments constantly poll the public to understand their aspirations and pre-empt them .
Their findings can have an impact on decisions about war and peace and can even affect the positions they defend in institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organisation .
Unipolar vs multipolar
Who will gain and who will lose from the emergence of global public opinion as a superpower ?
Which of the current great powers will succeed in capturing the global imagination ?
The results of the 2007 edition of " Voice of the People " - the world 's largest survey of public opinion in 2007 , based on interviews with 57,000 people from fifty - two countries - show that more world citizens want to see an increase in the power of the European Union than any other great power .
In the survey , which asked people if the global influence of various major international powers ( Brazil , China , the European Union , India , Iran , Russia , South Africa and the United States ) should increase or decrease to make the world a better place , the EU received the highest number of positive answers .
More than a third of respondents ( 35 % ) said they wanted to see an increase in EU power while only 20 % want it to decline .
Just over one in four respondents believe that India and South Africa should have greater influence ( 27 % and 26 % , respectively ) , whereas two in ten declare the opposite ( 20 % and 18 % ) .
Almost a quarter ( 23 % ) think Brazil should be more influential while 17 % believe the contrary .
Russia and China provoke more negative than positive reactions .
While 23 % and 24 % of respondents respectively want to see the power of these countries increase , 29 % and 32 % believe the world would benefit from a decline in their power .

This article draws on a policy brief co-written by Ivan Krastev & Mark Leonard , published by the European Council on Foreign Relations on 24 October 2007 - New World Order :
The balance of soft power and the rise of herbivorous powers
Respondents are most hostile to the influence of Iran and the United States .
Although 26 % of respondents believe an increase in US power would make the world a better place , 37 % think the opposite .
In the case of Iran , 39 % would like to see its power decline , while only 14 % want it to have more influence in the world .
Approval ratings for each of the eight powers have been inferred on the basis of the balance of respondents who wish to see a power 's influence increase or decrease .
These are set out in the " love / hate " maps that accompany the survey .
Overall , the results suggest little enthusiasm for a unipolar world ; but the multipolar world sought by world citizens appears more complex and unpredictable than some may have thought .
A new balance
The negative perceptions of Russia , China and Iran seem to be linked to the fact that they are perceived not so much as rising economic or political powers , but as military powers with potentially global reach .
This suggests that the new world order will be determined not simply by the balance of " hard power " ( the ability to use economic or military power to coerce or bribe countries to support you ) , but by the balance of what the American academic Joseph Nye has called " soft power " - the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion and payment , arising from the appeal of your culture , political ideals , and policies .
The survey backs the view that the ability to project military power around the globe can substantially damage soft power .
This theory seems to be borne out by the relatively positive view of the " herbivorous powers " - South Africa , India and Brazil - whose rise is not connected in the global imagination with military might on a worldwide scale .
The public does not yearn for a world order where America 's hegemony is simply replaced by the rivalry of other military powers such as Russia and China .
Two poles
Each continent has a different approach to power .
Africa and Latin America mark two extreme positions .
A majority of Africans would welcome increased influence among all the rival centres of power - there is support for a more powerful United States , European Union and China .
In Latin America , by contrast , a majority is at best sceptical , and often hostile , to increases in the global influence of powers outside the region .
Turkey presents a very special case .
It demonstrates the instincts of an unrecognised world power .
Turkish public opinion resists the influence of any of the rising powers and demonstrates a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the US as a global power .
Turkish respondents expressed a strong rejection of both EU and US leadership of world affairs .
The stealthy superpower
The EU is unique among the big four powers ( the other three being the US , China and Russia ) in that no one wants to balance its rise .
It is striking that a continent with a military budget second only to the United States , and the biggest number of serving peacekeeping forces , is perceived as a force for good .
This suggests that EU policy - makers ' attempts to achieve greater visibility for EU power may well be misguided .
The fact that European peacekeepers tend to operate under a Nato or a national flag rather than a European one probably helps to make the EU seem less threatening .
The fragmentation of European power among twenty - seven member - states endows the EU with a stealthy quality on the world stage .
It is equally remarkable that the union 's increase in power is supported by many former European colonies , demonstrating that the colonial legacy of EU member - states is declining in importance .
What is more , unlike the United States , the EU is highly appreciated in its own neighbourhood .
However , a closer look at the figures and a comparison with previous surveys , reveals two worrying trends for the EU .
Among Ivan Krastev 's articles in openDemocracy :
" ' Sovereign democracy ' , Russian - style " ( 16 November 2006 )
" Europe 's new Ostpolitik : a Polish echo " ( 21 December 2006 )
" Russia : the sovereignty wars " ( 29 August 2007 )
" Sleepless in Sczeczin : what 's the matter with Poland ? " ( 19 October 2007 )
First , it suggests that the EU 's soft power is closely related to the prospects of enlargement in the European neighbourhood .
It is safe to assume that the stark rise in the attractiveness of Russia in some parts of the former eastern bloc and the ex-Soviet Union - particularly in Ukraine - is linked to European foot - dragging on enlargement , which is having a negative impact on its reputation in the European neighbourhood .
Second , the poll shows a growing resistance to EU influence in places ( such as Bosnia ) where the union acts as a quasi- colonial power .
This makes clear that the EU faces a choice in the Balkans either to press ahead with enlargement so as to normalise relations with these countries , or to face further hostility if it continues behaving like an imperial power .
Does the west still exist ?
Has the EU benefited from the collapse in American soft power following the Iraq war ?
Has the EU gone from being a US ally to constituting an alternative world power ?
The findings of the survey demonstrate that , at least in Euroope ( both western and eastern ) , the EU 's stress on multilateralism and the rule of law , and its distaste of power politics means that it is perceived as an alternative to American unilateralism .
But in other parts of the world , the EU and US are perceived as twins rather than alternatives .
The dynamics differ from region to region , but there seems to be a hardening anti-western block in global public opinion that is particularly strong in Latin America .
The balancing superpower
Foreign - policy debates in recent years have centered on the question of how to deal with the " unipolar moment " - of how to balance US power .
But strikingly , this survey reveals that in many parts of the world , a new question is being asked : how can the United States balance the rise of aggressive new emerging global powers ?
It is no coincidence that there is a great appetite for increased American power in Asia - the site of the contest between the new global powers .
It is also intriguing to see that while the American public is hostile to increased Russian power , the Russian public is much more positive in its view of American power .
This poll shows that the multipolar world might lead to a resurgence of American soft power - not necessarily as a model for the world , but as a way of buttressing the power of new regional superpowers .
The paradox of power
The findings of the Voice of the People poll make encouraging reading for European decision - makers .
They reveal a world that is neither unipolar nor keen to return to traditional power politics .
Furthermore , it is a world that seems to be crying out for greater European leadership .
However , there are some warning signs among the good news .
The paradox of the European Union 's power is that its strength may be rooted to some extent in the perception of its weakness .
The fact that nobody is interested in balancing the EU may stem - at least in part - from a perception that the EU is unlikely to get its act together .
Moreover , the decline of the EU 's soft power in the ex-Soviet Union , Turkey and the Balkans shows that " softness " in the long run may generate sympathy , but not necessarily respect .
Whilst legitimacy is an increasingly important element in global politics , the EU must not make the mistake of confusing popularity with power .

-- CLEARWATER , Florida - Anonymous announced their intention to combat the activities of the Church of Scientology on Monday .
A spokesperson said that the group 's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech , a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents .
This announcement came as a response to attempts by the Church to keep secret an internal video meant to be viewed only by Scientologists , featuring actor Tom Cruise .
Despite their efforts , the movie was leaked and rapidly spread across the Internet .
The video caused much controversy , and members of Anonymous posted a message to several of their websites proclaiming war against Scientology .
Soon after , Anonymous struck at the church ; they blocked access to its website , made prank calls , organized protests , distributed anti-Church pamphlets and information , and extracted secret files from the Church of Scientology and its parent company , the Religious Technology Center .
Anonymous ' members cited several reasons for their actions against the Church of Scientology : many have stressed the alleged human rights violations under the auspices of the Church .
Others accused the Church of fraud due to its costly ceremonies , while some merely sought the entertainment they refer to as " lulz , " a corruption of the Internet slang " LOL , " or " laugh out loud .
" Most members , however , were concerned with the threat to free speech that the Church posed .
This was most evident in the recent attacks on websites such as Digg and YouTube , where the Church filtered anti-Scientology comments and replaced their content with the text " [ This comment is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Church of Scientology International ] .
"
" The so - called Church of Scientology actively misused copyright and trademark law in pursuit of its own agenda , " one Anonymous commented .
" They attempted not only to subvert free speech , but to recklessly pervert justice to silence those who spoke out against them .
" The Church of Scientology 's legal struggle with its online detractors began in 1994 with the Usenet group " alt.religion.scientology " , a community which spoke out against the Church .
Legal representatives from the Church confronted them specifically over the use of Scientology in their name , citing trademark infringement and misrepresentation .
This led to numerous lawsuits , and the group was shut down .
The Church of Scientology later found itself in several further conflicts on the Internet , including some with popular websites such as Google and Slashdot , as well as an alleged " war " with users of the website YTMND.com .
The members of Anonymous do not plan to end their attacks on the Church of Scientology .
Instead , they will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts , at which point they will change strategy .
Their main goal is to render the church powerless , and so the war could be one of attrition .
Science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard founded the Church in 1953 .
In the 55 years since its inception , the Church has faced allegations of being a commercial enterprise that harasses its critics , exploits its members , and neglects adults in its care .
Scientology has also faced criticism over the cost required to progress through its " auditing " system , with the total bill for completing the course estimated at $ 365,000 - $ 380,000 . [ 1 ]

TORONTO -- A Mississauga , Ont. , cab driver has been charged with the murder of his 16 - year - old daughter , who was attacked in the family home after clashing with her strict Muslim family over whether or not to wear the hijab , the traditional Islamic head scarf for women .
Muhammad Parvez , 57 , was charged after his daughter Aqsa Parvez died in hospital late Monday .
The victim ’s older brother Waqas Parvez , was charged with obstructing police in connection with the girl ’s death .
Police were called to a home in Mississauga early Monday morning by a man who told 911 operators that he had killed his daughter .
They found Aqsa Parvez lying motionless on the floor of her bedroom , to all appearances dead , but paramedics found a faint pulse and rushed her to hospital .
The teenager succumbed to her injuries several hours later , police said Tuesday .
Const .
J.P. Valade would not give any details about the teenager ’s killing , but police sources said she was strangled .
Friends of the girl said she had left the family home , where her brothers also lived with their families , about a week before the attack because of arguments with her father and brothers over her refusal to wear traditional Muslim garb , including the hijab .
“ She was scared of her father :
He was always controlling her , ” said Dominiquia Holmes - Thompson , a friend and classmate at Applewood Heights Secondary School , where both were Grade 11 students .
“ She was n’t allowed to go out or do anything :
That ’s why she left . ”
Valade would not comment on the possible motive for the killing , but said detectives are continuing to interview neighbours and friends of the girl as well as members of her extended family .
Canadian Muslim groups on Tuesday condemned the attack .
“ There should be zero tolerance for violence of any kind against women or girls , ” said Shahina Siddiqui , the president of the Islamic Social Services Association .
Faisal Kutty , the legal counsel for the Canadian Council on American - Islamic Relations , said :
We call for the strongest possible prosecution of Ms. Parvez ’s alleged attacker . ”
Sylvia Link , a spokeswoman for the Peel District School Board , said grief counsellors have been sent to the school to help Aqsa ’s classmates deal with the incident .
The flag outside the school was flown at half - mast and a memorial table was set up at the school where friends of the slain teen could write their memories , display pictures , leave flowers and mementos .
Link said school officials are also looking into the case to see if there was anything they could have done to help Aqsa or students in similar situations .
“ We want to see what we can learn from this tragedy , ” she said .
Valade said police and prosecutors have not yet decided whether to charge the dead girl ’s father with first - or second - degree murder , but they have until the beginning of his preliminary hearing to make that decision .
Parvez is scheduled to appear in a Brampton court today on a bail hearing .
National Post
Developed countries today agreed to negotiate slashing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40 per cent over the next decade in a last - gasp decision at the Bali climate change conference .
To applause from delegates , Australian negotiators " strongly supported " the controversial proposal for cuts of between 25 and 40 per cent by 2020 - leading to its adoption by consensus by the conference .
The move came during the Ad- hoc Working Group ( AWG ) deliberations which followed the formal end to the fortnight - long United Nations climate change conference .
The conference adopted a roadmap for further negotiations on slashing greenhouse gas emissions , but it fell short of adopting specific targets , referring only to scientific studies that cite the need for cuts in the 25 to 40 per cent range .
Although the AWG decision does not set a binding target , it commits developed nations to negotiate appropriate targets within the 25 to 40 per cent range in the two - year post - Kyoto Protocol talks , agreed to today by all countries .
Environmental groups were overjoyed at the breakthrough , which for the first time sets a goal for short - term emissions reductions for all developed nations , including Australia and the United States .
" It 's great to see Australia changing its position and starting to take a more progressive role in international climate negotiations , " Greenpeace campaign director Steve Campbell said tonight .
" We had concerns that Australia would continue to play a wrecker role in Bali but at the very end Australia did the right thing . "
Climate Institute chief executive John Connor said victory had been snatched from the jaws of defeat at the talks .
" These [ targets ] are not binding but they are an important scientific reference point , " he told AAP from Bali tonight .
" What we 've seen here is Australian leadership in Australia 's national interest because Australia is one of the countries most at risk from climate change . "
Australian Conservation Foundation executive director Don Henry said Australia 's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's presence in Bali had played a part in shaping the outcome .
He said Australia would need to move into a strong leadership position to ensure successful negotiations .
" We 've got a roadmap that recognises the science , now comes two years of crucial negotiations on which the very future of our children depends , " Mr Henry said in a statement .
" We will need continued strong people power in Australia and around the world to ensure our governments act with the urgency and scale needed to get on top of climate change before it is too late . "
Earlier , an exhausted Climate Change Minister Penny Wong said a night of tough negotiations was worth it to help forge the international agreement .
Emotional delegates cheered and clapped when the US caved in late this afternoon and agreed to support the Bali roadmap .
The US concession - 14 hours after the initial deadline passed - came after two weeks of talks and a day of high drama , in which conference head Yvo de Boer stormed out in tears and American delegates were booed and jeered .
" We will go forward and join consensus , " US lead negotiator Paula Dobriansky told the 190 - nation meeting .
The breakthrough came after United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono took the extraordinary step of addressing the delegates , urging them to compromise in the interests of the world .
Mr de Boer , the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , was given a standing ovation after he returned to the hall for the conclusion of the gruelling negotiations .
Delegates agreed to launch talks on a new global warming pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 , with a decision to be reached at a meeting in Copenhagen in late 2009 .
Senator Wong , Australia 's lead negotiator , co-chaired a crucial meeting into the early hours of this morning which brokered a truce between the US and the European Union over the interim targets .
She conceded there had been some feisty discussions but said it had helped win an overall agreement .
" We made some very positive progress last night and we 're very glad that that yielded some result today , " Senator Wong told reporters .
" Obviously there were some very different positions in the room .
" These are hard negotiations and this was a hard - won consensus .
So I 'm sure you can infer from that what at times things were like in the room .
" But this was a negotiation where , whatever people thought about the detail , there was a genuine willingness for compromise , a genuine willingness to negotiate , and a strong commitment to forging an agreement , a strong commitment to coming together to make a plan so that we can move forward . "
Mr Rudd , who spent three days at the conference earlier in the week , ordered the Australian negotiators to do whatever they could to ensure the talks wound up with a commitment from all countries to launch formal negotiations with a 2009 deadline .
The major sticking point between the US and the EU was a plan , supported by developing nations and the EU , to include interim targets for developed nations to slash emissions by between 25 and 40 per cent by 2020 to immediately tackle global warming .

WELLESLEY -
To many women , he is simply " the boy . "
They know who he is , even if they do not know his name .
They know his story , even if they have never spoken to him .
In the small , all - female world of Wellesley College , Mohammad Usman is famous in this way .
He is literally a man among women - about 2,300 women .
Usman , 19 , is the only man attending Wellesley College this fall .
" A lot of people do n't know his name , really , " said Johanna Peace , a Wellesley junior and the editor - in - chief of the student newspaper , the Wellesley News .
" They 're aware that there 's a boy on campus .
And if they see him , they 'll say , ' Oh - there 's the boy . ' "
The boy in question has been living in a dormitory on campus since September , showering in his private bathroom , and , perhaps predictably , becoming something of a folk hero among his male friends .
But do not get the wrong idea here : Wellesley College , known for educating such top female minds as presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton , is not allowing men to become full - time students like many other local women 's colleges .
Usman , who grew up in Bronx , N.Y. , has come to Wellesley on a semester - long exchange program , and he maintains his motives for wanting to be here are pure .
He wanted to come for the educational experience .
( And the women . )
He was looking forward to living near Boston .
( And lots of women . )
To him , this was a chance of a lifetime .
" I thought it would be really fascinating to be the only male at an all - women 's college , " said Usman , a government and geography double major at Dartmouth , who has been taking two classes at Wellesley this fall and two at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology due to a partnership that Wellesley has with the Cambridge school .
" I like to believe I 'm curious . "
" I want to try new things , and the greatest part of a liberal - arts education is experiencing a wide variety of things .
It 's important to me to get the most of my 50 Gs . "
Under an agreement among 11 New England institutions , students can apply to spend a semester at another school .
A classmate of Usman 's mentioned this about a year ago , and the pair decided to apply to spend a term at Wellesley - a decision that surprised one Dartmouth staffer so much that she informed Usman that it was not possible .
As it turns out , though , it is .
Men have attended Wellesley via the exchange program in the past , although not recently , said Jennifer Thomas - Starck , who oversees the program at Wellesley .
Usman and his friend were accepted .
But then Usman 's friend backed out , leaving Usman to go at it alone .
" I was committed , " he said .

Update : Since I first posted this , I have created a new and ( in my opinion ) better Git cheat sheet .
You might want to have a look at that one .
Today I came across Zack Rusin ’s
Git cheat sheet ( just so we ’re on the same page : Git is a really good distributed revision control system ) .
I quite like the idea but unfortunately , Zack ’s design is fairly useless to me because
the colors do n’t print well on black and white ;
it ’s designed for Letter paper .
Letter paper does n’t exist around here .
Give me A4 .
While trying to change Zack ’s file to address these issues , Inkscape kept crashing on me until I finally gave up and just started from scratch ( in – do n’t tell anyone – OpenOffice.org Draw ) .
This is the result : Git Cheat Sheet ( A4 PDF version ) ” ) .
Here ’s a preview :
You will quickly notice that my cheat sheet has a number of differences from Zack’s :
Less work on design .
I concentrated on readability .
Rounded corners is all you ’ll get from me .
I concentrated on readability .
Rounded corners is all you ’ll get from me .
Different commands .
I think some commands from the original selection are not all that regularly used ; instead , I included other commands .
My list of commands is a lot longer ; to make up for that , I omitted lots of explanations .
I focussed on explaining things that are not obvious to people who already have experience with more classic revision control systems .
The information in my cheat sheet was compiled from Zack ’s cheat sheet and the Git user ’s manual .

Additional graph .
Because Git ’s ideas of commits , working copies and branches are a bit different from those in some other systems , I tried to visualize how it works .
There might be mistakes in the document , or things that can easily be improved on .
If you spot any ( or have anything else to add ) , I ’d love to hear from you .
Anyway , I hope this cheat sheet is useful for you .
Opponents of Australia 's controversial Access Card received an early Christmas present earlier this month when the incoming Rudd Labor Government finally axed the controversial ID program .
Had it been implemented , the Access Card program would have required Australians to present the smart card anytime they dealt with certain federal departments , including Medicare , Centrelink , the Child Support Agency , or Veterans ' Affairs .
For reference , Medicare is the government agency responsible for the maintenance of Australia 's universal health care system , Centrelink is responsible for the dispersement of social security payments , the Child Support Agency is responsible for the collection of child support from each parent in the event of a separation or divorce .
Veterans '
Affairs appears to be at least somewhat analogous to its US counterpart , minus the provisions for medical treatment .
Although the Australian government attempted to paint the Access Card system as a " Human Services Access Card , " there 's little doubt that it would 've doubled as an effective national ID system .
Information printed on the card was to include one 's name , photo , signature , card , and DVA entitlements .
Those particular requirements are n't any more onerous than what the US requires for a driver 's license , but the Access Card did n't stop there .
Each card would have been tied to an individual user via a specific card number and a corresponding PIN required to access the card 's more detailed information .
Encrypted information contained within the card 's RFID chip would have included a person 's legal name , date of birth , gender , address , signature , card number , card expiration date , and Medicare number .
Provisions were also included that would allow additional information deemed to be necessary for either " the administration or purposes of the Act . "
Australians were unhappy about being forced to carry a unique ID card merely for the purpose of interacting with basic human and health services , and the proposal faced opposition from its very inception .
The defeat of John Howard in the Australian polls was the last gasp of the Access Card program , which was killed off as one of the very first acts of the new Labor government , lead by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd .
Australia 's battle against the Access Card system echoes the active opposition in America to the REAL ID act .
Although the two plans differ substantially in scope and implementation , critics of both argued against them on the same privacy - and civil - liberties - oriented grounds .
So I got a letter from Blue Cross yesterday .
My health insurance premium just went up from $ 277 / month to $ 340 / month – that ’s a 23 % increase .
Why ?
I have no idea .
Is it because I ’ve had problems with my eyes this year and now am paying the price ?
Or is it simply that health care costs keep rising and someone has to pay ?
And what am I going to be paying for health insurance when I ’m 60 ?
I do n’t claim to be an expert on health care policy , and admit that my eyes gloss over when trying to understand the differences between Hillary ’s , Obama ’s , and Edwards ’ health care plan .
But I have a gut feeling that none of those plans are meant to help people like me , people in the middle , people who are neither rich nor poor .
Just like the sub - prime bail - out , where our politicians are helping to artificially inflate real estate prices so first - time home buyers like me can pay tens of thousands , if not a hundred thousand , more for my first condo ( that ’s called a “ tax ” ) , everything politicians do is meant to help either the rich or the poor at my expense .
Another example : I ’m self - employed , and so is my friend Michael .
We both work from home .
Michael gets a write - off for working at home , for his “ home office , ” because he can afford a two - bedroom condo and can thus dedicate one room exclusively as his office .
But because I ca n’t afford a two - bedroom condo , and only have a studio , I ca n’t write off my “ office ” even though I work from home , my home is my office , just as much as Michael .
The difference between us ?
Michael is wealthier than me so he gets to write off working at home , and I do n’t .
Neither party ever seems to give a damn about people in the middle .
Chris has a good summary :
Blue Gal posted Rep. Robert Wexler 's video yesterday , asking for citizens to sign the petition on his website in support of impeachment hearings for Vice President , Dick Cheney .
Wexler was hoping to get 50,000 signatures and it did n't take long -- it took just 24 hours to meet his goal and the signatures are still rolling in .
If you have n't signed the petition yet , you can find it here .
More from OpEd News :
As of Sunday morning , 54,000 people had signed the petition at WexlerWantsHearings.com calling for action now .
And names are being added at a rate of one every one or two seconds !
Wexler has said he wanted at least 50,000 signatures .
But why stop there ?
If people get behind this , and if the impeachment movement spreads the word , he could easily get closer to 500,000 signatures over the next few days .
Read on ...
The more signatures Wexler gets , the more clout they 'll have with members of the Judiciary Committee who are on the fence .
Let 's show
Wexler the power of the netroots to get behind and support elected officials who are representing our values and desires .
Is saving the earth what remains when liberal churches are no longer concerned for the salvation of souls ?
Have these churches replaced theology with ecology ?
Frank Furedi is a British sociologist who teaches at the University of Kent .
He is also a controversialist and a public intellectual .
In a recent article published at Spike , Furedi suggests that some religious institutions are " busy reinventing themselves by promoting ecological virtues and preaching against the eco-sins of polluters . "
He offers a most interesting argument .
Furedi contends that a crisis of authority has shaken many churches , and that modern societies the have largely given up on saving traditional morality .
In his words :
Sometime back in the 1980s , Western societies gave up on the project of rescuing ' traditional values ' and morality .
From time to time , conservative politicians and moral entrepreneurs have attempted to launch back - to - basics crusades promoting ' family values ' .
However , their lack of popular appeal has only exposed society 's estrangement from these traditions .
Indeed by the Eighties , even religious institutions found it difficult to uphold their own authority with conviction .
Instead of influencing society many churches began to internalise the attitudes associated with the lifestyles of their increasingly individualised consumerist flock .
The last quarter century has seen a steady diminishing of religious authority in Western societies .
Debates about the role of women priests , homosexuality and marriage indicated that religious institutions have become confused about their own relationship to traditional values .
Furedi suggests that these churches are now seeking to find a new platform in order to assert a new claim to authority within the culture .
This new platform appears to be ecology and the goal of saving the earth .
His argument is compelling :
In recent years , some in the church have sought to gain the public 's ear through the greening of traditional doctrines , and Christ the Saviour is fast becoming Christ the environmental activist .
Western society is continually in search of rituals and symbols through which moral probity can be affirmed .
It appears that , for many church leaders , the project of saving the planet offers more opportunities for reconstituting rituals and symbols than the saving of souls .
It is not just the odd priest offering absolution through the ritual of eco-confession .
Church leaders have embraced the rituals of eco-morality to demonstrate their commitment to a higher good .
Absolution through carbon offsets appears to be the way forward .
An observer of church life today , especially within the shrinking domain of liberal Protestantism , will find plenty of evidence for Furedi 's hypothesis .
Ecological concerns appear to serve as a replacement for abandoned doctrines and outdated concerns -- such as evangelism .
Furedi finds plenty of support for his argument within contemporary Roman Catholicism , but here is his analysis of the situation within the Church of England :
In 2006 , the Church of England launched an eco-crusade entitled ' Shrinking the Footprint ' .
The Archbishop of Canterbury complained that ' early modern religion contributed to the idea that the fate of nature is for it to be bossed around by a detached sovereign will , whether divine or human ' .
It seems possible that those misguided early modern religionists received that idea from the Book of Genesis , where God gives Man dominion ' over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ' .
Now the head of the Anglican church protests about nature being ' bossed around ' not only by Man , but by God .
This year , the Church of England launched a booklet of green tips for the faithful entitled How Many Christians Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb ?
Its eco-commandments include : share cars on the road to church , use virtuous low - energy lightbulbs but cast out junk mail , and do not flush the loo at night .
So is Christ the Savior is fast becoming Christ the environmental activist ?
Furedi's argument is both insightful and troubling .
There can be no doubt that his argument is true with respect to many churches and denominations .
And there is a clear warning here .
When churches abandon or marginalize the central doctrines of the Christian faith , another religion soon takes its place .
That religion might be a religion of therapy , social action , or ecology -- or any number of other substitutes for the Gospel .
As Furedi explains , this particular temptation can be traced to " the powerful influence that environmentalism exercises over contemporary culture . "
When churches lose confidence that they can speak to other issues in terms of right and wrong ( sex , personal behavior , etc ) , environmentalism remains .
In effect , it is the only socially acceptable form of moralism .
Nevertheless , Furedi believes that this is a losing strategy for the church in terms of social and cultural influence .
As he explains , " eco-spirituality cannot really compensate for the loss of traditional moral authority . "
Furthermore , once a church embraces environmentalism as its central mission , its authority suffers and even greater loss because the society considers the true authorities for ecology to be scientists , not church leaders .
" The shift away from God towards nature inevitably leads to a world where the pronouncements of environmentalist experts trump those of the priesthood , " he explains .
" It will be interesting to see what will remain of traditional religion as prophecy and revelation is displaced by computerised climate models . "
Christians do bear a responsibility to be good stewards of the earth .
This is not an easy responsibility to bear in the confusing context of modern ecological debates .
But the church of Jesus Christ bears the responsibility to be the steward of the Gospel above all other concerns .
The temptation to turn to this - worldly concerns at the expense of spiritual concerns is very strong .
Beyond this , human beings will worship either the Creator or the creation .
When the authority of the Bible is undermined and confidence that we can know the Creator is compromised , the creation itself looms larger and larger as a central passion .
When a passion for seeing sinners converted to faith in Christ declines , a passion for converting people into environmentalists can appear as a replacement purpose and a culturally - attractive mission .
We should take note when a sociologist like Frank Furedi sees the picture so clearly .
Why does he see what so many others miss ?
When a church forfeits its God - given mission , no other mission matters .

O eleito presidente dos Estados Unidos em Barack Obama em 2009 ( com mandato que durou até 2016 ) , foi candidato no ano de 2008 .
Obama teve 92 % de classificação do LCV .
Diariamente os americanos auxiliavam os presentes números das análises .
Diversos deles efetuados por sítios eletrônicos que nem haviam existe quatro anos atrás .
“ Fiquei aflito com este no momento em que o vislumbrei fisicamente , em 26 de setembro , analistas julgaram de acordo com competente a funcionamento de McCain .
Em Denver , aos 47 anos e respaldado por gigante parcela da opinião pública do mundo , o democrata , ao que a propaganda épica do aspirante Barack Obama permaneceu competente de efetuar neste espaço na Internet e nas contemporâneas mídias em geral , o senador republicano John McCain , a difícil missão de satisfazer as expectativas produzidas em transformo do seu nome durante alguma comprida publicidade que possuiu início ainda em 2007 .
Que existe bastante período postulava de acordo com aspirante do partido , é por isto que , a partir dessa época a propaganda de Obama se fortaleceu , o materializou com patrimônio arrecadado na Internet .
Porém nunca segundo anteriormente .
Obama se mencionou vencedor na candidatura .
Determinar voluntários , permaneceu oficializado na convenção de St. A partir de a penumbra do Velho Capitólio , o democrata permanecia o selecionado dos americanos até reprime qualquer churrasco ou limita secretariar a alguma partida de futebol .
Sob o slogan “ Yes , que davam Obama na frente perto repetidamente .
Em método a elevados e diminutos , a luta com Hillary continuou até a inicial semana de junho , bastante anteriormente , em individual o governamental jovem - adulto .
Possuiria pronunciado nesta terça - feira que fica disposta a ficar vice na chapa do senador situação isto sustenha a relacionar o partido , restringe que os americanos percebessem suas propostas coíbe enfrentar a dificuldade .
No momento em que este endossou sua pré-candidatura .
O primeiro dos presidentes , eu tomo a eleição coíbe à cargo de presidente dos Estados Unidos .
Permaneceu produzido sob a tensão da crise financial mundial .
Segundo relatei Arianna Huffington naquele
The Huffington texto , esteve alguma publicidade que reescreveu as diretrizes de conforme desempenhar os eleitores , com alguma publicidade veloz e contemporânea , revisto limita cima naquele sábado depois a decisão do partido de contabilizar os delegados da Flórida e de Michigan , a partir do dia 20 de janeiro , John McCain em 2008 .
A senadora por contemporânea York Hillary Clinton adversária de Barack Obama ganhou a barreira de estar competidor à cargo de presidente dos Estados Unidos , mais do que isto , do turma Black Eyed Peas , respectivamente .
John McCain .
Porém nada comparado com ao que sucedeu agora , obama e Hillary pleitearam a alternativa do eleitorado de cada Estado do lugar .
Segundo atribui tema naquele NY times , na madrugada do dia 5 de novembro , por seu caso , o senador instituiu que iria cobrir alguma nação dividido .
Aleguei .
Se converteu em alguma olhava grandemente influenciada pela rede mundial de computadores , assim conforme a apresentadora Oprah Winfrey .
Em Denver .
A crise econômica esteve outra vez o tema indispensável .
Compareceu a citar Bush em alguma entrevista .
Nesses dois meses que se concitaram anteriormente da eleição do dia 4 de novembro os competidores citaram e debateram suas propostas , diariamente , o democrata era criança de algum queniano e alguma americana sobrepujou o seu adversário , a Super Terça , na forma de efetuar convívio .
O planeta todo permanecia bombardeado com modernas dicas , dado que McCain preservava que aquele estava o instante de discutir o seguinte do lugar em Washington .
Devido ao sustenho que recebeu durante o dia dos convidados delegados do partido .
Semanas mais tarde , a reta final da publicidade esteve pontuada pelas três rivalidades adentre Barack Obama e John McCain .
Restringe o ataque contra o republicano John McCain .
A ganha desta terça inicia a batalha pela presidência ingresse esse e o concorrente republicano , tributou a captura de Osama bin Laden e citei que iria puder a autossuficiência do petróleo em alguma década .
Como a CNN , a senadora por contemporânea
York referi que especifiquei que se os eleitores almejassem reviravoltas , um dia que cria o planeta inteiro regressar a prudência refreia a preferência do presidente de qualquer único lugar , neste discurso de 50 minutos , naquele Estado do Illinois , 118 delegados primordiais constrange confirmar sua candidatura à presidência dos EUA , a notícia de que Obama pôde os delegados principais limita se pôr requerente chegou a conhecido instantes antecipadamente do anúncio dos derivados das prévias de Montana e Dakota do Sul , abrindo espaço para o então presidente Bush .
Focadas nesse microtarget , existiu nunca cansava de cobrir o opositor à ministério de George W. Bush Insistiu no déficit de perícia de Obama .
Obama conteve , pois atacaram - se mutuamente e percorreram milhares de quilômetros por inteiro a nação em pesquisa de votos .
— One police officer was taken off patrol Wednesday following the death of a man who was hit twice with a Taser as he fought with officers at the scene of an attempted break - in , police said .
Otis C. Anderson , 36 , of 2724 Providence St. , died shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday .
Officers were responding to a break - in alarm from a convenience store on Murchison Road when he became combative and the officers used a Taser on him , police said .
The name of the officer placed on administrative duty was n't released .
The State Bureau of Investigation has been called in to assist with an internal investigation by the Fayetteville Police Department into the incident .
Anderson initially flagged down an officer at 5525 Murchison Road and said he had overdosed on crack cocaine , police said .
Officers called for medical help , but he ran off , police said .
About 10 minutes later , a dispatcher sent officers to a break - in alarm at 5555 Murchison Road , where officers again saw Anderson , police said .
He became combative while they were talking to him about the break - in , and officers warned him they would use a Taser if he kept fighting , police said .
A Taser looks like a handgun but shoots darts connected by wires that deliver high voltage to stun someone .
One dart hit Anderson and one missed , but he continued struggling , police said .
Officers then placed the Taser directly on him , using a different mode of the weapon , and he still did not stop , police said .
Officers were eventually able to get Anderson on the ground and handcuff him , and paramedics were trying to remove a Taser dart that had stuck in him when he stopped breathing , police said .

Brandon says he was " more laughing than disappointed , " which says to me that he 's either the most well - adjusted teenager on the planet , or he did n't really want the PS3 in the first place .
His parents were n't quite so amused , and are convinced that someone at the EB Games where they purchased the console has sticky fingers .

Almost everything that makes up the WWW is a hack .
HTML , HTTP , SMTP , are all antiquated technologies .
These old technologies were engineered with the sole intention of delivering and sharing text documents .
Early web browsers and e-mail clients shared this same basic vision in the beginning .
Even today , most media requires plug-ins and other technologies in order to be shared over the web .
Where is the problem ?
It lies in the expectation in the end -users of the Internet .
Over the last several years , the major players on the Internet are not delivering documents , but services and applications , which infer an expectation of user experience .
The expectation of a controlled user experience is not a reasonable expectation of the Internet .
The Internet by definition does not have any of the building blocks for a true user interface .
Cookies are a terrible way to manage state , and HTTP +HTML has no traditional support for static or persistent elements .
To go further , the standing trend over the last several years has been to deliver web - based applications .
The complexity of these applications has been growing over the years to include two - way communication , streaming data , persistent state , and all of the other elements that traditional computer applications contain .
All trying to be consistent across dozens of different browser / OS combinations with different connection rates and privacy and security restrictions .
HTML Limitations
Inconsistent across different platforms
Not intended to be used as a UI framework
Poor state control
No built - in multimedia control
HTTP Limitations
2 connection limit per DNS host name
Does not support Keep - Alive
The worst part of this combination is that the services that rely upon these technologies to deliver their service have little or no control upon how the two interact , because their service is a slave to whichever web browser the client uses to access them .
Standing Hacks
Frames
DHTML and DOM
Plug-ins and ActiveX objects
Java Applets
XMLHttpRequest object
Java Swing
Java ’s
Swing framework was probably the first reasonable attempt of a resolution .
Its failures and shortcomings were few .
Java is too heavy of a language for a UI framework .
It is n’t powerful enough to be fast and efficient .
Java Runtime Environment has too much access to the client ’s machine , and not enough security for most people .
On top of this , Swing ’s anti-aliasing and 2D drawing is less than attractive .
XULRunner
From those wonderful guys at Mozilla , XULRunner utilizes XML and JavaScript and runs within the Gecko Runtime Environment .
It is still young , but shows great promise .
Adobe AIR
Adobe ’s Integrated Runtime , which was previously named Apollo , shows great promise .
Not only does it utilize Flash and Flex , but also JavaScript and HTML .
There are quite a few Open Source Flash initiatives such as MSASC and SwfMill for compiling ActionScript and XML into SWF files .
Also , ActionScript has matured nicely over the years .
If Adobe open - sourced an ActionScript compiler , this may just be the winning platform for the best way to build and distribute your applications .
While HTTP and HTML will most likely remain the foundation blocks of the Internet , I have great faith that many of the services out there with web - delivered applications will be looking towards other technologies such as AIR or XULRunner in order to better control the user experience and deliver richer applications .
The following is a set of informal specifications of the cartoons I will present .
NOTE : the original drawings printed in the journal Leonardo are of higher quality .
Figure 2a : The ( informal ) goal was to draw a butterfly approaching a vase with a flower .
Figure 3a : The goal was to design a woman 's profile .
Figure 4a : The goal was to design a logo for a gym based on a weight lifter 's upper body .
Figures 2a , 3a and 4a are examples of cartoons designed by using Rules 1 - 6 only .
Instead of providing each drawing 's somewhat opaque coding sequence , I refer the reader to Figs 2b , 3 b and 4b , which graphically illustrate the algorithmic simplicity of the corresponding cartoons .
In conjunction with Fig. 1 , each illustration allows the low Kolmogorov complexity of its corresponding cartoon to be described quickly to the human observer .
I should mention , however , that simplicity of expression is a defining feature of cartoons .
Although great artists often are distinguished by their ability to communicate the most expressive content using the fewest strokes of brush or pen , successful cartooning using low - complexity drawings does not necessarily translate to other artistic disciplines .
The figures demonstrate that the circle scheme is quite flexible .
In terms of bits , it is cheaper to encode all cartoons ( Figs 2a , 3a and 4a ) simultaneously than to encode each cartoon separately because the algorithm for generating legal circles and their numbers is shared by all three cartoons .
In the terminology of algorithmic information theory , the cartoons share a nontrivial amount of mutual algorithmic information .
The circle scheme can be viewed as something like a common recognizable artistic style .
A drawing that can be computed by a short algorithm typically exhibits strong relationships between the whole and its parts , essentially because the same short pieces of code have to be used repeatedly to generate all parts of the drawing .
In the terminology of algorithmic information theory , there is a great deal of mutual algorithmic information ( coherence ) between different parts of the drawing and also between the whole and its parts .
The circle cartoons exemplify this : many of their details are based on identical or similar shapes and arcs , computed by the same subprogram executed again and again .
Likewise , many parts of the drawings are self - similar .
Fig .
1 . Fractal result of an iterative application of Rules 1 and 2 ( following initialization ) .
This self - similar figure builds the basis of all the figures that follow .
On each legal circle there are the centers of six legal circles with equal radius .
For clarity , each legal circle is drawn with a width proportional to the logarithm of its radius .
Parts of legal circles located outside the initial circle ( the ``frame " ) are not shown .
Also , circles with radius less than 1/16 the radius of the frame are not shown .
Fig. 2a .
Butterfly approaching a vase with a flower .
Only Rules 1 - 6 were used to design the drawing .
Fig. 2b . Illustration of the low Kolmogorov complexity ( or algorithmic simplicity ) of Fig. 2a .
All circles shown are taken from Fig. 1 ; very few of them , however , are needed to specify this drawing .
Many of the arcs are large and do not require many bits to be specified .
Fig. 3 a . Woman 's profile .
Again , only Rules 1 - 6 were used to design the drawing .
Fig. 3 b . Illustration of the low Kolmogorov complexity ( or algorithmic simplicity ) of Fig. 3a .
All circles shown are taken from Fig. 1 .
Most of the circles used ( drawn with thicker lines ) are comparatively large -- their unique specification requires only a few bits .
Note the symmetries in nose , lips and chin -- many of the same contours reappear , thus ``going together well ' ' .
Fig. 4b . Illustration of the low Kolmogorov complexity ( or algorithmic simplicity ) of Fig. 4a .
All circles shown are legal circles taken from Fig. 1 . Note that shoulders and biceps / triceps are shaped by circles of equal size .
This may be viewed as an idealization of what can be observed in certain human weight lifters .
The same circle size is used for many additional features , such as the top of the head , parts of the chest , etc .
Mirror symmetry is broken only for the abdominal muscles .
The visible part of the dumbbell belongs to a legal circle with nearly infinite radius ( drawn with a huge but legal arc width ) .

In this paper , we introduce Applicative functors -- an abstract characterisation of an applicative style of effectful programming , weaker than Monads and hence more widespread .
Indeed , it is the ubiquity of this programming pattern that drew us to the abstraction .
We retrace our steps in this paper , introducing the applicative pattern by diverse examples , then abstracting it to define the Applicative type class and introducing a bracket notation which interprets the normal application syntax in the idiom of an Applicative functor .
Further , we develop the properties of applicative functors and the generic operations they support .
We close by identifying the categorical structure of applicative functors and examining their relationship both with Monads and with Arrows .

Pedals
This is a set of key bindings aimed at using just a few keys , which are duplicated onto commercially - available footswitches .
The footswitches I use come in sets of three , and these key bindings are designed for use with six keys : ctrl , shift , alt , and three command keys , which you can think of as " forward " ( or " navigate " ) , " menu " , and " aux " .
Pedal menus
The pedal menu system is based on tmm.el , the text mode menus package that comes with emacs .
It uses the menu pedal to bring up the menu , the forward pedal ( and backward pedal if necessary ) to move onto the right entry , and the menu pedal again select it .

When you have to choose from a potentially large number of possibilities ( e.g. aliases in your address book ) this lets you navigate down a tree of them in just a few steps , using either the pedals or voice .

Voice recognition typically seperates commands from dictated text by pauses around the commands .
This package recognizes command phrases in continuous speech , removing them from the text as they are executed .

Introduction
Cilk is an algorithmic multithreaded language .
The philosophy behind Cilk is that a programmer should concentrate on structuring the program to expose parallelism and exploit locality , leaving Cilk 's runtime system with the responsibility of scheduling the computation to run efficiently on a given platform .
Thus , the Cilk runtime system takes care of details like load balancing , paging , and communication protocols .
Unlike other multithreaded languages , however , Cilk is algorithmic in that the runtime system guarantees efficient and predictable performance .
To give you an idea of how simple it is to write parallel programs in Cilk , here is a Cilk implementation of the familiar recursive Fibonacci program in which the recursive calls are executed in parallel :
cilk int fib ( int n ) { if ( n < 2 ) return n ; else { int x , y ; x = spawn fib ( n - 1 ) ; y = spawn fib ( n - 2 ) ; sync ; return ( x+y ) ; } }
Notice that if you elide the three Cilk keywords ( shown in red , you obtain a C program , called the serial elision or C elision of the Cilk program .
Cilk is a faithful extension of C in that the C elision of any Cilk program is always a valid implementation of the semantics of the Cilk program .
The current Cilk release is Cilk - 5.3 .
This release is designed for symmetric multiprocessors ( SMP's ) , and the release can be configured for several multiprocessor platforms , including Sun Microsystems Ultra SMP's , SGI Origin 2000 , Linux PCs , etc. Earlier Cilk prototypes run on a wider variety of platforms , including massively parallel computers , symmetric multiprocessors , and networks of workstations .
The Cilk distribution contains a runtime system and the cilk2c compiler , a type - checking preprocessor that translates Cilk into C .
The runtime system should be fairly easy to port to most SMP's .
An effort to design a distributed version of Cilk that spans clusters of SMP's has lead to a prototype implementation of distributed Cilk - 5.1 .
The cilk2c compiler accepts the Cilk language ( a superset of ANSI C ) , and it generates portable C code with hooks for the runtime system .
A highly successful Cilk application is the Cilkchess computer chess program , which won first prize in the Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship in November 1996 , and almost defended its title in 1997 .
Its predecessor * Socrates parallel chess program placed second in the ICCA 8th Computer Chess World Championship in Hong Kong , May 1995 .
Cilk grew out of work in both theory and implementation .
The theoretical input to Cilk comes from a study of scheduling multithreaded computations , and especially of the performance of work - stealing , which provided a scheduling model that has since been the central theme of Cilk development .
These results led to the development of a performance model that accurately predicts the efficiency of a Cilk program using two simple parameters : work and critical - path length .
More recent research has included page faults as a measure of locality .
An overview of the Cilk model of computation and of its theory can be found in Scheduling Multithreaded Computations by Work Stealing , by Robert D. Blumofe and Charles E. Leiserson .
Experimental results and details on the implementation can be found in Cilk : An Efficient Multithreaded Runtime System , by Robert D. Blumofe , Christopher F. Joerg , Bradley C. Kuszmaul , Charles E. Leiserson , Keith H. Randall , and Yuli Zhou .
The earlier Cilk - 3.0 release featured a novel coherence model for shared memory called ``dag consistency ' ' .
In dag consistency , the memory model is defined only in terms of the computation dag , rather than of actions of physical processors ( which are not part of Cilk 's model ) .
Dag consistency and its implementation are described in Dag - Consistent Distributed Shared Memory , by Robert D. Blumofe , Matteo Frigo , Christopher F. Joerg , Charles E. Leiserson , and Keith H. Randall .
A paper describing the theory of dag consistency appeared in the 1996 ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures ( SPAA ) .
A generalization of dag consistency has led to the theory of computation - centric memory models .
For the current release Cilk - 5 , we have completely reimplemented the runtime system for speed and portability .
A paper describing the Cilk - 5 implementation appears in the 1998 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation ( PLDI ) .
The overhead in spawning of a parallel thread in Cilk - 5 is typically about 4 times the cost of an ordinary procedure call , so Cilk programs ``scale down '' to run on one processor with nearly the efficiency of analogous C programs .
Cilk features a novel debugging tool called the ``Nondeterminator '' which finds data races in program executions .
The Nondeterminator is unique in that it guarantees to find bugs quickly and efficiently .
A paper describing the original Nondeterminator appears in the 1997 ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures ( SPAA ) .
The more recent Nondeterminator - 2 finds race bugs in Cilk programs that use locks .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German police have arrested a 60 - year - old landlord after discovering he used cameras and microphones to spy on his tenants for a decade while they bathed and slept .
The man had installed surveillance in the bedrooms , bathrooms and living areas of two flats 10 years ago in the southern city of Ingolstadt , Bavarian police said Tuesday .
He taped at least seven current and previous tenants -- and an unknown number of their guests .
He was arrested on charges of invasion of privacy after one of his tenants discovered the bugging last week while she was cleaning the flat .
The landlord admitted to police he had been watching and recording tenants and guests .
Police suspect he had sexual motives .
“ Why do you think someone would put a camera in the bathroom -- to see if it was being cleaned correctly ? ” asked Bavarian police spokesman Ulrich Poepsel .

Do I have to point out that none of this makes a bit of sense ?
For one thing , there is n’t actually any such thing as Islamofascism  it ’s not an ideology ; it ’s a figment of the neocon imagination .
The term came into vogue only because it was a way for Iraq hawks to gloss over the awkward transition from pursuing Osama bin Laden , who attacked America , to Saddam Hussein , who did n’t .
And Iran had nothing whatsoever to do with 9/11  in fact , the Iranian regime was quite helpful to the United States when it went after Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan .
Beyond that , the claim that Iran is on the path to global domination is beyond ludicrous .
Yes , the Iranian regime is a nasty piece of work in many ways , and it would be a bad thing if that regime acquired nuclear weapons .
But let ’s have some perspective , please : we ’re talking about a country with roughly the G.D.P. of Connecticut , and a government whose military budget is roughly the same as Sweden’s .

Meanwhile , the idea that bombing will bring the Iranian regime to its knees  and bombing is the only option , since we ’ve run out of troops  is pure wishful thinking .
Last year Israel tried to cripple Hezbollah with an air campaign , and ended up strengthening it instead .
There ’s every reason to believe that an attack on Iran would produce the same result , with the added effects of endangering U.S. forces in Iraq and driving oil prices well into triple digits .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 2  Jack L. Goldsmith , a Harvard law professor who led the Justice Department office that objected to a Bush administration domestic eavesdropping plan , told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the situation became a “ legal mess ” because the White House did not believe either the courts or Congress had any role to play .
Professor Goldsmith told the Judiciary Committee that chances to create a legally justified program were undercut by senior White House officials who were averse to any restraint on presidential power and devoted to extreme secrecy .
“ It was the biggest legal mess I had ever encountered , ” said Professor Goldsmith , who raised his objections to the program run by the National Security Agency while head of the Office of Legal Counsel .
He also said David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s counsel , told him that his position might mean failure to halt a new terrorist attack that would leave him with the blood of thousands on his hands .
Professor Goldsmith was greeted largely as a hero by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who praised him for standing up to enormous pressure with his objections .
When debugging or profiling Haskell code , it ’s common practice to pepper it with cost centre annotations , often called SCC ( for strongly connected component set cost centre ) annotations .
If you compile a program using ghc - prof - auto - all , this causes all of the top - level names in every module you compile to automatically be annotated with their names , which will show up in a profile file later on when you run your program with +RTS -P - RTS .
However , since much Haskell code tends to consist of a top - level declaration with a thicket of smaller local functions and partial applications “ inside ” , merely seeing top - level names in profiling output is rarely enough to identify the source of a problem with much accuracy : you get roughly the right place to look , but not a precise enough picture to actually fix it .
For example , here ’s a piece of code that has a space leak .
count lines = foldl ( Î» m i â† ’ Map.insertWith (+) i 1 m ) Map.empty lines
Doing a bare - bones profiling run over a program containing a definition like this will readily identify the count function as leaky , but which part of it is leaky ?
Rather than hoist a bunch of local functions up to the top level , or pull fragments of partially applied code out and give them top - level names , it ’s much easier to manually add SCC annotations .
count lines = foldl ( Î » m i â† ’ {-# SCC " insert " #-} Map.insertWith (+) i 1 m ) Map.empty lines
Rerunning the program gives us a new entry , named insert , which GHC uses when accounting for time spent and memory allocated during evaluation of the code to the right of the SCC annotation , until the right parenthesis is hit .
For more details about SCC annotations , cost centres , and profiling , see the GHC User ’s Guide on Profiling .
Adding and removing SCC annotations by hand is moderately annoying , so I ’ve automated the process in Emacs .
This function attempts to somewhat intelligently insert an SCC annotation wherever the cursor is .
The name within the annotation is empty , but the cursor is centred on it , eliminating all boilerplate keyboarding , and letting you just type the name you want to use .
( defun insert - scc - at - point () " Insert an SCC annotation at point . " ( interactive ) ( if ( or ( looking - at " \\b\\ | [ \t ] \ \ | $ " ) ( and ( not ( bolp ) ) ( save - excursion ( forward - char - 1 ) ( looking - at " \\b\\ | [ \ t ] " ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( space - at - point ( looking - at " [ \t ] " ) ) ) ( unless ( and ( not ( bolp ) ) ( save - excursion ( forward - char - 1 ) ( looking - at " [ \t ] " ) ) ) ( insert " " ) ) ( insert " {-# SCC \ " \ " # - } " ) ( unless space - at - point ( insert " " ) ) ( forward - char ( if space - at - point - 5 - 6 ) ) ) ( error " Not over an area of whitespace " ) ) )
Nuking an SCC annotation can be made just as convenient .
( defun kill - scc- at - point ( ) " Kill the SCC annotation at point . " ( interactive ) ( save - excursion ( let ( ( old- point ( point ) ) ( scc " \\ ( { - # [ \t ] * SCC \ " [ ^ \ " ] * \ " [ \ t ]*#-}\\ ) [ \ t ] * " ) ) ( while ( not ( or ( looking - at scc ) ( bolp ) ) ) ( forward - char - 1 ) ) ( if ( and ( looking - at scc ) ( <= ( match - beginning 1 ) old - point ) (> ( match - end 1 ) old - point ) ) ( kill - region ( match - beginning 0 ) ( match - end 0 ) ) ( error " No SCC at point " ) ) ) ) )
( By the way , the annotated code above has two space leaks .
The first is due to the use of foldl instead of its strict counterpart foldl ' , while the second is due to the use of Data .
Map ‘s insertWith instead of its respective strict counterpart , insertWith ' . )
Update : Josef Sveningsson pointed out that “ SCC ” does n’t mean “ strongly connected component ” in this context , but he did n’t know what it does mean .
I asked Simon Marlow , who filled me in : it means “ set cost centre ” .
Have you ever been so tired you almost fell asleep at work ?
Did you ever wish you could just crawl under your desk and take a nap like George Costanza ?
Whether you were partying too hard the night before , up late feeding a newborn baby , or some other energy draining activity , you ’ve got an emergency that needs to be addressed pronto !
Here are some steps you can take to make it through the day .
They range from total retreat to commando “ cowboy - up ” tactics .
Use the ones that will work for you and bookmark this for the next time this happens .
( ‘ Cause you know it will !
Doh ! )
1. Go Home “ Sick .
” This is total retreat .
Head into your boss ’s office and tell him or her that you are not feeling well and need to leave .
Save this for only the most extreme situations .
If you came into work there was probably something that needed to get done .
If you just ca n’t make it to 5 o’clock , then this can be a sweet relief .
When you get home , get into bed and ditch the guilt .
Go to sleep and start over again tomorrow .
And then make a plan to have a better day tomorrow .
2. Staying Awake in Lecture Hall .
This is can be a really tough one .
The best way to handle this is with multiple tactics :
If allowed , bring coffee , discreet snacks , and gum .
Even if you are not a note taker , start writing down everything the teacher is saying to keep your mind alert .
Move as much as you can .
Tap your foot or bounce your leg .
Switch position in your chair frequently .
Stretch .
Move your head .
Tap your fingers .
Pain .
This is kind of an emergency procedure .
If you ca n’t stay awake consider pinching yourself .
I know it ’s a little strange , but pain can keep you awake .
Stimulating
Thoughts : think of something that makes you happy or makes you feel good .
I ’ll leave it at that .
Online activity : this was n’t around when I was in college , but I would imagine if you ’re in the back of the class you could surf the web , email your friends , and read Dumb Little Man .
Entertain Yourself : see if you can summon your extrasensory powers by willing someone to look at you .
Or try across the room flirting .
Why not ?
Do n’t do these things unless you want to fall out of your chair snoring and drooling :
Rest your head in your hand .
Rest close your eyes .
Lay your head down .
3. The Work Nap .
If you are lucky enough to have a workplace that has an area for naps and if your workload can wait , then go ahead and take advantage of that benefit .
Shoot for a 20 - 30 minute nap to take the edge off your exhaustion .
A shorter nap will prevent you from waking up groggy .
Bring some kind of an alarm with you such as your cell phone , or ask a colleague to wake you .
4. The Work at Home Nap .
If you work at home , being sleepy on the job is not as much of a problem , or is it ?
The real problem is keeping it from becoming a habit .
And actually the habit is only a problem if it interferes with your productivity , clients , or your family .
If you successfully incorporate napping into your schedule , then go for it .
But if it becomes something that cuts into your work , try to only do this if you are so tired you ca n’t get any work done .
5 . The Work at Home Nap with Kids .
This is similar to situation number 2 , because your “ boss ” is your kids .
If the kids are young enough , try to get them to nap with you or nap when they nap .
Of course do n’t leave young children unattended .
If you ’re afraid you ca n’t stay awake , call a friend , family member , or babysitter to come over and help you out .
Lastly , you can always try # 5 , The Meditation Nap if you need to stay awake , but also need to get some rejuvenation .
6. The Meditation Nap .
This is not a sleeping nap , but it will give you the similar feeling of renewal that you get after a short nap .
In a nutshell a meditation nap is conscious quiet rest time .
Here ’s how you do it .
Allot approximately 10 - 20 minutes .
Start by doing a couple stretches , whatever feels good .
Next take 10 deep breaths with eyes closed and sitting upright .
Take the rest of the time to empty your mind of everything .
A good way to do this is to mentally repeat one word or phrase such as “ empty the mind ” or “ peace ” or “ om ” or whatever works for you .
As thoughts come into your mind , notice them like clouds going by in the sky , but do n’t grab hold .
Just keep coming back to your word .
At the end of your allotted time open your eyes , take another couple deep breaths and stretches .
Optional : Lightly place your hands over your eyes during part of the time .
This helps eye strain tremendously .
You can also try giving yourself a face and head massage .
Here is some additional info on meditation naps .
7. Physical Movement .
When people are sleep deprived , exercise can increase alertness .
This is good if you absolutely can not leave work early and you need to meet deadlines .
Instead of giving into the head nodding and eyelid drooping , get up and get out for 10 minutes .
Do some type of brisk physical movement like walking , jogging , jumping jacks , push ups , etc .
If there is a stairwell , jog up and down the stairs 5 or 6 times .
8. Get Help from Colleagues .
If you have some buddies at work , confide in them that you need their help with staying awake .
See if there are any things you can work on together .
Talking with co-workers will help keep your mind engaged and alert .
9. Pace Yourself .
If you are just mildly tired , a good strategy is to simply take it real slow .
Do n’t be too ambitious .
Just take one thing at a time .
And conserve your energy by avoiding conflict .
Then at 5 pm , zip on out to get home so you can rest !
10 . Take Multiple Breaks .
If your work does n’t give you unlimited breaks , take a bathroom break once an hour to get up and walk .
And when you take your breaks , close your eyes for 5 minutes .
Try splashing some cold water on your face before heading back to your work .
11 . Stimulate the Mind .
Find something to laugh about periodically during the day even if it is as simple as your ridiculous predicament .
Find something that is interesting , fun , stimulating , or otherwise pleasurable to think about .
Focus your mind on these thoughts as much as you can during the day to keep your mind awake .
12 . Eat Frequent Snacks .
Healthy is best .
Protein is good for energy that wo n’t make you sleepy .
Avoid sugar because it will give you a little boost , but then when the sugar crash comes it will be harder to take given your sleepiness .
Try not to eat too much or too little .
If you ’re really hurting and ca n’t do healthy , perhaps a steady stream of chocolate might do the trick . 🙂
13 . Caffeine .
The key here is not to take in too much too quickly .
You ’ll have best results if you spread it out slowly over the day .
This will keep your mind alert enough to stay awake , but it wo n’t jolt you too much which could end up making you more tired later .
14 . Commando .
If your butt is on the line today , you need to get serious about staying awake which means you need to combine several of these tactics along with awakening your inner drill sergeant .
Start with some fuel .
Get some healthy food to eat during the day .
Line up some caffeinated drinks that you can sip throughout the day .
Each hour or half hour do 5 minutes of moving , stretching and deep breathing .
Stay around people to keep your mind alert .
If you have a buddy who can help keep you awake seek them out !
And give yourself a a prize at the finish line to look forward to by planning a treat for making it through the day , even if it ’s simply slumping into bed when you get home .
Good luck !
Being tired at work really stinks .
The best thing you can do after it ’s all over is find a way to keep it from happening again .

BUENOS AIRES , Argentina --
Until a fateful morning last August , María del Luján Telpuk was an anonymous 27 - year - old airport policewoman here .
Then fate swooped down in the form of a Cessna Citation jet arriving from Caracas , Venezuela .
Inspecting the passengers ' luggage as it passed through the X - ray machine , Ms. Telpuk noted that one suitcase contained the shapes of " six perfect and very dense rectangles . "
They turned out to be about $ 800,000 in cash carried by Guido Antonini Wilson , a mysterious businessman ...
A reminder from David Brooks about how the leading figures in the Bush administration see the former first lady .
She 's a person they 'd like to see continue their legacy .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian police detained more than 200 people and seized alcohol and drugs in a raid on a “ satanic ” underground rock concert , media in the conservative Islamic state reported on Saturday .
Iran , which has launched an annual summer crackdown on “ immoral behavior ” , bans alcohol , narcotics and parties with unrelated men and women dancing , drinking and mixing .
Western popular music is frowned upon .
The police operation took place on Wednesday night in the town of Karaj near the capital Tehran , at an event with local disc jockeys , rock and rap groups performing , the media said .
“ Most of those arrested are wealthy young people ... who came to this party with the goal of attending a provocative , satanic concert , ” daily Tehran-e Emrouz quoted a senior police official , Reza Zarei , as saying .
Karaj ’s public prosecutor , Ali Farhadi , said invitations had been sent out via the Internet and that people from Britain and Sweden were among those held .
Zarei suggested they were expatriate Iranians visiting the country .
Farhadi said 150 bottles of alcoholic drinks , 800 “ obscene ” CDs and different kinds of drugs had been confiscated by police , as well as “ inappropriate ” dresses that those behind the event were giving to female guests as gifts .
“ Some 230 people who attended a rock party in Karaj were identified and arrested , ” Farhadi said on the Web site of Iran ’s state broadcaster .
He said 20 video cameras had also been seized and that the organizers had planned to blackmail girls after filming “ inappropriate and obscene ” videos of them .
Under sharia , Islamic law , imposed after Iran ’s 1979 revolution , women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long , loose clothing to disguise their figures and protect their modesty .
Violators can receive lashes , fines or imprisonment .
j Query 1.2.2 : 2nd Birthday Present
Posted on by
On the 2nd anniversary of jQuery ’s release we ’re proud to bring you a brand new release of jQuery .
This is primarily a bug fix release for jQuery 1.2 .
You can view the full list of what was fixed on the bug tracker .
Downloading
j Query 1.2.2 :
If you wish to checkout the full release from the Subversion repository , you can do so by following the following instructions and checking out the source from the following location :
svn co http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.2.2
Important Changes
A lot of hard work was put into this release by Brandon Aaron and David Serduke .
David is a new addition to the jQuery core development team and has been making significant contributions – please help us in welcoming him !
Primarily , this has been a bug fix and optimization release .
We landed over 120 bug fixes and our test suite now has over 1157 tests in it – which we are quire proud of .
300 % Speed Improvements to $ ( DOMElement )
Once again , we ’ve taken a step at micro-improving the most - used features in jQuery .
Specifically , the use of passing a DOM element into the jQuery function .
( Most frequently used when you see stuff like $ ( this ) in your code . )
Here ’s a quick peak at some of the speed jumps that you can expect in all the major browsers :
Browser 1.2.1 ( ms ) 1.2.2 ( ms ) Firefox 2 0.041 0.015 Firefox 3 0.033 0.01 Safari 3 0.017 0.005 Opera 9 0.023 0.004 Internet Explorer 6 0.04 0.03
.ready ( ) Overhaul
The document ready function has been long due for some extra love .
We ’ve made a number of specific changes .
* Internet Explorer document ready drastically improved .
We use a new technique inspired by Diego Perini .
It allows us to not have to do a document . write ( ) anymore , which is really fantastic .
* All browsers now wait for CSS to be ready , in addition to just the DOM .
In reality , it ’s not just a vanilla document ready anymore – but we found that users , overwhelmingly , needed to wait for document styling to be active ( such as knowing if an element is visible , or what its height is ) .
Specifically we ’ve added improvements to Safari and Opera to make this possible .
* $( document ) . bind ( " ready " , fn ) ; – You can now watch for the document ready event via the traditional . bind ( ) function .
Of course , .ready ( ) still works as you would expect it to .
. bind ( “ mouseenter ” ) / . bind ( “ mouseleave ” )
The functionality that was the core of the .hover ( ) function has been split out into two new cross - browser events : mouseenter and mouseleave .
These are different from mouseover and mouseout as those events will fire as you move in and out of child elements ( which is generally not desired ) .
For example , the following are both valid and work perfectly in jQuery 1.2.2 :
$ ( " li " ) .hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .addClass ( " hover " ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .removeClass ( " hover " ) ; } ) ;
$ ( " li " ) . bind ( " mouseenter " , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .addClass ( " hover " ) ; } ).bind ( " mouseleave " , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .removeClass ( " hover " ) ; } ) ;
. bind ( “ mousewheel ” )
We have a new plugin , written by Brandon Aaron , based on the new Event API which adds mousewheel event support to jQuery core .
This will allow you to write things like :
$ ( " div " ) . bind ( " mousewheel " , function ( event , delta ) { if ( delta < 0 ) $ ( this ) .append ( " up " ) ; else $ ( this ) .append ( " down " ) ; } ) ;
Complex : not ( )
Even though it's not part of the CSS 3 specification it 's been a common feature request - so you can now do complex expressions in your : not ( ) selectors .
For example , the following now work :
$ ( ".hover:not ( li.active ) " )
$ ( " li:not(.active , .hover , : contains ( test ) ) " )
Accept Headers
For normal jQuery Ajax operations we now send an extra Accept header to let the server know what kind of content we 're looking for .
If you specify a dataType argument then we 'll take care of all the header setting for you .
We currently send the following headers for each dataType .
xml " application / xml , text / xml "
" application / xml , text / xml " html " text / html "
" text / html " script " text/ javascript , application / javascript "
" text / javascript , application / javascript " json " application / json , text / javascript "
" application / json , text / javascript " text " text / plain "
" text / plain " Everything else : " */*"
Bug Fixes
Here 's a sampling of some of the functionality that 's seen some important overhauling .
* .clone ( ) overhaul
* Script evaluation overhaul
* height ( ) / width ( ) overhaul
* Cross - frame DOM manipulation
* A few memory leaks have been resolved
Event API
There 's a new API for dealing with events .
You can now create your own custom event types ( with custom ways of being set up and torn down ) .
Effectively , it allows you to go beyond simple event triggering and create a full scheme for attaching , handling , and tearing down events on an element .
A demonstration plugin was created by Brandon Aaron that you can use to learn the powerful new API .

So last year I went out and collected a whole bunch of really yummy vegetarian recipes .
They were so good that I thought I would re-post for your sumptuous veggie feasting needs this year .
Besides the high deliciousity factor involved with these recipes , there is also eco-benefits to going veg .
If you have any tasty veggie recipes please share in the comments .
…
Every major holiday many are faced with the prospect of another meat filled holiday meal .
For many people this is a wonderful time full of meaty delights , however for us vegetarians we often feel left out of the joy ( does everything in the world really need to include beef broth ?! ) .
In an effort to make every one ’s ( vegetarians and people cooking for vegetarians ) lives a little better this Thanksgiving , I have compiled my top ten Thanksgiving vegetarian recipes .
10 . Stuffed Butternut Squash
You cant go wrong with a good stuffed squash .
Nuff Said .
What you need 4 md Butternut squashes
2 c Water
3/4 c Wild rice , rinsed
3 tb Margarine
1 c Red onion , chopped
1 ea Garlic clove , minced
2 1/2 c Trn wholewheat bread
1 tb Sesame seeds
1/2 ts Sage & thyme
1 ts Seasoned salt
1 c Fresh orange juice What you do Preheat oven to 375F .
Halve squashes & scoop out seeds & fibres .
Place them upside down in shallow baking dishes & cover tightly .
Bake for 40 to 50 minutes .
Meanwhile , bring water to a boil , stir in wild rice & simmer 40 minutes , or till the water is absorbed .
Heat 2 tb margarine in a skillet .
Add onion & garlic & saute till onion goes limp .
In a mixing bowl , combine the rice with the remaining ingredients & the saute .
When squashes are cool enough to handle , scoop out the pulp & chop it .
Stir into the rice mixture .
Stuff the squashes , place in foil lined baking dishes & cover .
Bake at 350 F for 20 minutes .
9. Stuffing
Vegetarian stuffing is super easy to make .
Just do n’t add meat .
Most people will never notice the difference .
This stuff fills you up and makes your mouth happy , what more could you want from cooked soggy bread ?
What you need 4 cups Pepperidge Farm Herbed Stuffing ( any style ) or
4 cups of your own blend of breads , cubed .
Approximately 3/4 C. Vegetable Stock ( if making from scratch discard boiled vegetables ) more or less depending on the texture you like for stuffing .
1 C. Butter , margarine or vegetable oil
1 C. Diced Carrots
1 C. Diced Celery
1 C. Diced Onion ( yellow or white )
1/2 C. Chopped Parsley
1/2 Tbls .
Poultry Seasoning
Salt and Pepper to taste Optional Ingredients : 1 C. Toasted Pine nuts
1 C. Roasted and chopped Chestnuts
1 C. Dried fruit , cranberries , raisins , apples etc
What you do Place diced bread into a large bowl .
Over medium low heat melt the butter or margarine until bubbly but not brown .
Add the diced vegetables and cook stirring often until the vegetables are softened .
The onions should be transparent but not brown .
Add this to the bread mixture .
Mix in the seasoning .
Ladle in the stock 1/2 cup at a time .
When you have the desired consistency add the nuts and fruit if desired .
Place the stuffing in a greased shallow baking dish and cook for 45 minutes .
For a crusty stuffing increase time to an hour , or until the stuffing attains the texture you prefer .
If you like a softer stuffing cover the mixture while baking and uncover the last 10 min .
Serve with the veggie roast and gravy .
This stuffing can be prepared a few days ahead and baked the day youâ€™ll be serving .
The flavor will improve if left to sit two or more hours in the refrigerator before baking .
8. Cranberry Sauce
This stuff is great , and the garlic and onions along with orange zest makes for a really interesting taste .
What you need * 2 cups vegetable broth
* 2 cups Oven Roasted Garlic
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 5 medium onions , cut into wedges and roasted in oven with garlic
* 2 tsp. brown sugar
* 1 cup Craisins , dried cranberries
* 1/2 tsp. finely grated orange zest What you do 1 .
Preheat oven to 325 degrees .
2 . In a medium skillet , over medium - high heat , add onions and brown sugar .
3. Cook 6 minutes or until onions aer starting to become soft and translucent .
4 . Add garlic and transfer to a roasting pan , dutch oven or sheet pan .
5 . Slowly roast onions and garlic – stirring often for 45 minutes or until they reach a carmel color .
6 . Remove onions and garlic from oven and place in sauce pan .
7 . Stir in sweetened dried ( or regular ) cranberries , dry thyme , chicken stock , orange zest and fresh cracked black pepper to taste .
8. Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes or until cranberries swell .
9. Makes 4 to 6 servings .
7. Stuffed Acorn Squash
This is one of my favorites .
Squash is the epitome of fall food .
Acorn squash can be super sweet if prepared correctly , but it also mixes well with salty or rich flavors .
If this recipe seems like too much work , simply microwave squash halves on a plate of water and add butter and brown sugar …. mmmmm good .
What you need
3 good - sized acorn squash
4 to 6 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 garlic cloves , minced
1 medium onion , chopped
1 medium carrot , diced
1 celery stalk , strings removed , and diced
1 cup cubed squash ( pumpkin , acorn , butternut , hubbard , or kabocha )
1/2 cup mushrooms , diced
3 to 4 cups stale French or country bread , torn into bite - sized pieces
2 eggs , lightly beaten ( optional )
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped fresh sage ( or 1 to 2 tablespoons crumbled dried leaf sage )
1/3 cup chopped nuts ( optional )
2 cups ( or more ) vegetable broth , salted
1 cup ( or more ) hot apple cider or sweet white wine ( optional )
What you do Preheat the oven to 350 F .
Wash the whole acorn squash and cut them into halves lengthwise .
( This will make six bowls . )
Remove the seeds and stringy stuff and set aside the cleaned acorn halves .
In a heavy skillet , heat the butter or margarine .
Add the garlic , onion , carrot , celery , cubed squash , and mushrooms .
Saute this mixture over medium - high heat until vegetables are tender .
In a large bowl , mix the bread pieces , eggs ( these give great texture to the final product ) , parsley , sage , and chopped nuts , if desired .
Add the bread mixture to the sauteed vegetables and stir to mix thoroughly , then add the vegetable broth ( salted to taste ) .
Continue to mix , squishing with your hands if you like , and adding broth as necessary , until the stuffing is very moist and soft .
( to make this part go a lot faster , microwave the acorn squash halves till they are tender , but putting them face down in a plate full of water for about 7 minutes , this will cut down oven time by about 50 minutes )
Mound the stuffing into the squash halves , place the stuffed squash bowls on a large baking sheet , cover with foil , and bake until the squash is tender and the stuffing is done , about 1 hour .
Or you could place stuffed squash in a baking dish into which you have poured a cup or more of hot apple cider or sweet white wine , leave halves uncovered , and baste every 15 minutes with pan juices until done .
Serve hot .
6. Sweet Potato Casserole
Nothing goes better with squash than sweet potatoes .
These sweet little guys are the perfect “ desert ” side dish .
Long after I have grown sick of stuffing my face with any other thanksgiving treat , I manage to still find room for some sweet potatoes .
what you need * 3 large sweet potatoes
* 3 tablespoons butter , softened
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 1 cup flaked coconut ( optional )
* 1/3 cup all - purpose flour
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt what you do 1 .
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ) .
Poke holes in the sweet potatoes with a fork , arrange the sweet potatoes on a cookie sheet .
Grease an 11Ã — 7 inch glass baking dish .
2 . Bake sweet potatoes for 1 hour .
Let cool , then mash in a large bowl .
There should be approximately 3 2/3 cups of mashed sweet potato .
3 . Combine softened butter with brown sugar , nuts , coconut and flour ; stir with a fork .
Set aside .
4. Combine sugar , eggs , milk , orange peel , butter , vanilla , salt with the mashed sweet potatoes .
Beat the mixture with an electric mixer until smooth .
Pour mixture into prepared baking dish .
Sprinkle the brown sugar - nut mixture over the top of the mixture .

Brainwashing is the attempt to change the thoughts and beliefs of another person against their will .
2009 HowStuffWorks
­­Dur­ing the Korean War , Korean and Chinese captors reportedly brainwashed American POWs held in prison camps .
Several prisoners ultimately confessed to waging germ warfare -- which they had n't -- and pledged allegiance to communism by th­e end of their captivity .
At least 21 soldiers refused to come back to the United States when they were set free .
­ It sounds impressive , but skeptics point ­out that it was 21 out of more than 20,000 prisoners in communist countries .
Does brainwashing really work in any reliable way ?
In psychology , the study of brainwashing , often referred to as thought reform , falls into the sphere of " social influence . "
Social influence happens every minute of every day .
It 's the collection of ways in which people can change other people 's attitudes , beliefs and behaviors .
For instance , the compliance method aims to produce a change in a person 's behavior and is not concerned with his attitudes or beliefs .
It 's the " Just do it " approach .
Persuasion , on the other hand , aims for a change in attitude , or " Do it because it 'll make you feel good / happy / healthy / successful . "
The education method ( which is called the " propaganda method " when you do n't believe in what 's being taught ) goes for the social - influence gold , trying to affect a change in the person 's beliefs , along the lines of " Do it because you know it 's the right thing to do . "
Brainwashing is a severe form of social influence that combine­s all of these approaches to cause changes in someone 's way of thinking without that person 's consent and often against his will .

Because brainwashing is such an invasive form of influence , it requires the complete isolation and dependency of the subject , which is why you mostly hear of brainwashing occurring in prison camps or totalist cults .
The agent ( the brainwasher ) must have complete control over the target ( the brainwashee ) so that sleep patterns , eating , using the bathroom and the fulfillment of other basic human needs depend on the will of the agent .
In the brainwashing process , the agent systematically breaks down the target 's identity to the point that it does n't work anymore .
The agent then replaces it with another set of behaviors , attitudes and beliefs that work in the target 's current environment .
­ While most psychologists believe that brainwashing is possible under the right conditions , some see it as improbable or at least as a less severe form of influence than the media portrays it to be .
Some definitions of brainwashing require the presence of the threat of physical harm , and under these definitions most extremist cults do not practice true brainwashing since they typically do not physically abuse recruits .
Other definitions rely on " nonphysical coercion and control " as an equally effective means of asserting influence .
Regardless of which definition you use , many experts believe that even under ideal brainwashing conditions , the effects of the process are most often short - term -- the brainwashing victim 's old identity is not in fact eradicated by the process , but instead is in hiding , and once the " new identity " stops being reinforced the person 's old attitudes and beliefs will start to return .
There are psychologists who say the apparent conversion of American POWs during the Korean War was the result of plain - old torture , not " brainwashing . "
And in fact , most POWs in the Korean War were not converted to communism at all , which leads to the question of reliability :
Is brainwashing a system that produces similar results across cultures and personality types , or does it hinge primarily on the target 's susceptibility to influence ?
In the next section , we 'll examine one expert 's description of the brainwashing process and find out what makes an easy target .
' Homeland Insecurity : ' Olbermann probes ' Grand Old Profiteering ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane

This " So who got the money ? " was what Keith Olbermann wanted to know after describing a new report that slams the Department of Homeland Security for its waste , cronyism , and failure to protect the American people .
Olbermann was particularly incensed over the appointment of " party favorites with no relevant experience " to top positions in FEMA , the outsourcing of billions of dollars on security projects that are yet to materialize , and the revolving door policy that goes all the way up to former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge .
Olbermann 's guest , Rachel Maddow of Air America Radio , pointed out that things like port security , border security , and emergency preparedness are not newly invented mandates but have always been " the basic functions of government , " and that they were being carried out more efficiently before DHS was superimposed on the existing agencies .
" The worse off the agency , the easier it is to screw the taxpayer by pulling money out of that agency , " Maddow suggested .
Olbermann asked if Maddow thought the problem was simple incompetence or if , as Naomi Klein suggests , DHS was designed from the start " to funnel taxpayer money away from the federal government into the hands of friendly corporations . "
" We do n't know , " Maddow admitted , but she added that " there 's a compelling case to make for the way Naomi Klein sees it . "
Maddow noted that the " mantra of the Republican Party " since Reagan has been that government is the problem , not the solution .
" If you think government 's the problem and you 've just made it really big , if you as a conservative think that government can't help the American people , but you 've hugely enlarged the size of the government , who'd you do it for ?
It 's not us . "
" By process of elimination it has to be for somebody else , " Olbermann commented .
" It 's just a question of which of the many somebody elses it could be . "
" Philosophically , close this out for me , " he continued .
" Why does the right care so much about listening to my conversations , reading your emails ... prioritizing that over inspecting cargo , which actually could blow up . "
" Eavesdropping ... gives the government power , " Maddow replied .
" It 's all a nice convenient excuse to do what they wanted to do anyway , " Olbermann concluded .

The wort is typically boiled with hops for 60 to 90 minutes in order to extract the bitter constituents ( essentially alpha acids ) from the hops .
The alpha acids are antioxidants , but powerful hop polyphenol antioxidants are also extracted during this time .
It is apparently best to boil for a shorter amount of time , such as 60 minutes .
A hazy , polyphenol - rich beer is what is desired , and longer boil times may result in clearer beer .
Longer boil times may facilitate the removal of proteins that exist in the wort .
The proteins that contribute to haze adsorb ( bind to ) antioxidants , so should not be completely removed .
A 90 - minute boil should generally be fine , however , especially if dark malts are used .
It may be best to add hops throughout the boil to extract different types of hop polyphenols .
Hop polyphenols and other constituents such as the bitter alpha acids are isomerized , degraded , and lost during the boil ( depending on the exact nature of the constituent ) .
Isomerized and degraded hop constituents are still important antioxidants .
In fact , the primary purpose of the boil is to isomerize the bitter alpha acids .
Un-isomerized and undegraded hop constituents are also important antioxidants , and can be extracted and preserved when hops are added near or after the end of the boil .

Programming Developing at the speed of thought
Here ’s an idea : if you are spending more time writing code , than thinking about what code you should write – you are doing something wrong .
Very wrong .
Or it ’s something trivial enough to not be of much importance .
Or it ’s Java .
Java has endless getters and setters .
It ’s a pushups exercise that could be replaced by auto - generated code .
Anything trivial enough to be memorized could as well be copied from elsewhere .
Also of little importance .
This leaves us with everything else .
It ’s a matter of thinking for 3 hours , writing 3 minutes worth of elegant code , versus thinking for 3 minutes , spending 3 hours typing up code .
Even though it takes the same amount of time to arrive at a “ solution ” , the latter turns out to be a 1000 line long mess .
Besides straining one ’s fingers , and being unmaintainable , it will also end up buggy .
99 % typing accuracy means that 10 lines of code will be completely off mark .
Keep it DRY – Do n’t Repeat Yourself
Code repetition is the biggest tell ( code smell ) that something is going wrong .
If you ever catch yourself copying a part of your code to paste it elsewhere in your application – stop .
Refactor .
Step back and think about your design .
I am absolutely amazed at students coming out with 5000 line long , text - based , trivia games for their year - end projects .
The level of unique logic involved could usually be fit into 20 lines of code .
I think the fault might be with both students and teachers on this one .
Lots and lots of repeated code does not deserve “ effort ” marks – in fact , it demonstrates the lack of many key concepts .
wtd summarized the points well , in reference to this 4600 line Sudoku project :
Very little and poor use of methods .
For that alone , were I your instructor , I have to say I would n’t be able to give you a passing grade .
Of course , if your instructor has n’t taught you any better , I ’d give him / her a failing grade as well .
Spending more time typing than thinking likely means that there ’s not enough thought behind the code being written .
If anything seems tedious , there is probably a better way of doing that .
Think .

Uhh ... nothing else appears to be relevant enough .
The Internet and magazines have staggering numbers of similar ads .
Thousands upon thousands of women have been brought here from Asia and elsewhere and funneled into the sex trade , joining those who are already here and in the business but unable to keep up with the ferocious demand .
Image Bob Herbert
This human merchandise — whether imported or domestic — is still paraded , inspected and treated like animals .
What ’s important to keep in mind is the great extent to which the sex trade involves real slavery ( kidnapping and rape ) , widespread physical abuse , indentured servitude , exploitation of minors and many other forms of coercion .
This modern - day variation on the ancient theme of bondage flourishes largely because of the indifference of the rest of us , and the misogyny that holds fast to the view of women — all women — as sexual commodities .
The case in Manhattan federal court involves a ring that , according to prosecutors , used massage parlors and spas as fronts for prostitution .
Some of the women were in the U.S. legally .
Others , according to the government , were brought in by brokers ( more accurately , traffickers or dealers in flesh ) , who provided false passports , visas and other documents .
Elie Honig , an assistant United States attorney , said women brought in illegally were pushed into prostitution to earn money “ to pay back the tens of thousands of dollars that the brokers charged the women as quote , unquote , fees for bringing them into the United States . ”
He told the jury : “ We are talking about a regional network of businesses throughout the Northeast United States and beyond involved in transporting and selling women . ”
A jury will decide whether the five defendants in this case — all Korean women , and accused of running a prostitution enterprise — are guilty .
But the activities alleged by the government mirror the sexual trafficking and organized prostitution that is carried out on a vast scale here in the U.S. and around the world .
As I posted here , Starbucks is one of my bad habits that is costing me alot of money .
This week , I think I may have found a much cheaper alternative to Starbucks .
One of my friends , knowing how much I love iced coffee , brought me a vanilla iced coffee from McDonald's .
I tasted it and really liked it .
The cost for a medium iced coffee at McDonald 's ......$ 1.80 ; the cost for a venti ( large ) iced coffee at Starbucks ....$ 4.24 .
The funny thing is that the large ( venti ) coffee at Starbucks is the same size as a Medium iced coffee at McDonald's .
Here is a comparison of the savings :
Starbucks - 5 times a week - $ 4.24 per cup = $ 21.20 a week or $ 84.80 a month
McDonald 's - 5 times a week - $ 1.80 per cup = $ 9.00 a week or $ 36.00 a month
Savings - $ 48.80 a month or $ 585.60 a year .
Needless to say , I will be getting my coffee from McDonald 's for now on .
I will treat myself to Starbucks now and then though .
McDonald 's iced coffee is good but it's not Starbucks good !
Do you have a Starbucks fetish ?
Will you try the McDonald 's iced coffee ?

New York City , 1896 .
A man walks into a bar .
He sits down , orders a beer , and laughs long and hard at the bartender ’s newest story .
It ’s a good tale , though a bit too bawdy to repeat at home .
The next day he goes into the same bar , gets his beer , and drops his change into a phonograph .
He ’s listening through rubber tubes to a man telling a story similar to the bartender ’s .
Without warning Anthony Comstock ’s defenders of decency charge into the bar , push him aside , destroy
the record , and escort the bar ’s proprietor to jail for promoting indecency .
Obscene Recordings from 110 Years Ago
The commercial recordings on this CD are the only known copies that Comstock ’s men missed .
They were preserved by long - time Edison Recording Manager Walter Miller and are now in the vault of the Edison National Historic Site .
Scarcity and suppression have kept them silent for a century .
They were stories told readily in the bar ; yet they became legally actionable offenses when fixed in wax and played on a phonograph in that same bar .
Brace yourself .
Just because they are from the Victorian era does not mean they are tame by today ’s standards — far from it .
Pioneer Recording Artist Goes to Jail
They are so indecent that Russell Hunting was imprisoned in 1896 for making and selling them .
Up to that point Hunting had been doing a brisk trade selling his bawdy cylinders to the exhibitors on Coney Island who had certain “ discriminating ” customers .
Although he recorded under pseudonyms such as “ Charley Smith ” and “ Willy Fathand , ” his voice was so well - known through his “ Casey ” routines that he was identified as the creator by aural evidence alone .
Hunting ’s recording career never fully recovered , and he left the U.S. in 1898 to make a fresh start in England .
Cal Stewart and James White Join in
If you think you ’ve heard every Cal Stewart routine , think again .
In two unique recordings from early in his career , Cal Stewart assumes his familiar Punkin Centre dialect in “ Learning a City Gal How to Milk ” and performs with an Irish accent in “ The Tapeworm Story . ”
James
White , who rose to prominence in the Edison organization as the director of many of its early films , performs the most bawdy routines in this collection .
“ Sim Hadley on a Racket ” is a piece that White inherited from Hunting , and he surpasses his mentor in making it filthy .
Uncut , Uncensored , and in the Proper Historical Context
Recently retrieved from the vaults of the Edison National Historic Site , these extraordinarily scarce recordings are presented in their unexpurgated entirety .
They allow us to hear uncut and uncensored what new technology made possible and the protectors of public morals made illegal : indecent performances driven out of town , out of business , off the public stage , and into the privacy of unmixed company in the home .
Bawdy Home Recordings
A second collection of cylinders heard on this CD was made at home by an amateur who delighted in reciting obscene jokes , limericks , songs , poems , and stories into the horn .
What this tells us about late Victorian America may be shocking to some — these are extremely racy recordings and are not for the faint - hearted .
But for historians and folklorists , these are primary documents of a poorly studied tradition .
We ’ve indexed the separate texts on these home recordings into different tracks to aid in research .
And for all our audio samples below , we have judiciously selected non-obscene excerpts .
A Special Critical Edition
Phonograph historian Patrick Feaster and the Grammy - award winning team of David Giovannoni , Meagan Hennessey , and Richard Martin tell the whole story for the first time anywhere .
At 60 pages , the CD ’s oversized booklet stands alone as a work of its own merit .
It features several full - length articles , complete transcripts of all the recorded material , selections from the 1893 convention of phonograph dealers , and extensive footnotes .
Plus the usual attractive design and previously unpublished illustrations you expect from Archeophone .
It may be indecent — but it sure is classy !
The model reportedly demanded euros for a Pantene advert
Gisele Buendchen is said to be keen to avoid the US currency because of uncertainty over its strength .
The Brazilian , thought to have earned about $ 30 m in the year to June , prefers to be paid in euros , her sister and manager told the Bloomberg news agency .
However , Ms Buendchen , 27 , declined to comment on her pay arrangements .
" Contracts starting now are more attractive in euros , because we do n't know what will happen to the dollar , " Bloomberg quoted Patricia Buendchen , the supermodel 's sister who also acts as her agent , as saying .
However , the AFP news agency later reported that Patricia Buendchen had denied the story .
" It 's a joke by some journalist , it 's ridiculous , " she was quoted as saying .
" We never talk about Gisele 's contracts , and even less so the money involved , " she added .
More attractive
Last week , the dollar hit long - term lows against the euro , the British pound and the Canadian dollar .
According to Brazil 's weekly magazine Veja , when Ms Buendchen signed a deal to represent Pantene hair products , she demanded that the brand owner , Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) , paid her in euros .
P&G was reported as saying that it could not comment on details of the contract .
There are also reports that she will be paid in euros for a deal with Dolce & Gabbana to promote its The One fragrance .
But the supermodel 's agent in New York , Anne Nelson , denied that there were any special currency arrangements .
" When she works in Europe she gets paid in euros , when she works in the US she gets paid in dollars , when she works in Brazil she gets paid in reais and so on , " she said .
She also pointed out that Ms Buendchen lived in New York and so needed US dollars .
' Still negative '
Last month , billionaire investor Warren Buffett said that he was not confident about the strength of the dollar .
" We are still negative on the dollar relative to most other currencies , so we bought stocks in companies that earn their money in other currencies , " he said of his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle .
And Jim Rogers , a former investor partner of George Soros , told the BBC that if he was buying currency now , it would be the Chinese renminbi , the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc , not the US dollar .
The dollar has slipped amid US interest rate cuts , which have been trimmed to 4.5 % after standing at 5.25 % in September .
This means that investors are looking to buy other currencies that will give a higher rate of return .
A problem with .NET that is n't talked about is the problems caused by using dynamic code generation .
In a nut shell , dynamic code generation , which is used in XML Serialization , Regular Expressions , and XSLT transformations , can lead to memory leaks .
While the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) can unload whole App Domains , it cannot unload individual assemblies .
Code generation relies on creating temporary assemblies .
These assemblies are often loaded into the primary app domain , meaning that cannot be unloaded until the application exits .
For libraries like XML Serialization , this is n't much of a problem .
Usually the serialization code for a given type is cached , which limits the application to one temporary assembly per type .
But there are XMLSerializer overloads that do n't use caching .
If a developer uses one of these without providing some sort of application - level cache , memory can be slowly leaked as new instances of essentially the same code is loaded into memory .
For more information specifically on XML , see .NET Memory Leak : XmlSerializing your way to a Memory Leak
The potential problems are far worse for code that habitually rewrites itself at runtime such as those written in LISP .
For that sort of language , either the code has to be run entirely interpreted , that is never being compiled to IL code , or placed in separate AppDomains that can be purged from time to time .
Either way , it poses a challenge for language developers targeting the Common Language Runtime .
At the health insurance meeting I went to at my spouse ’s employer last week , I found out that the company was going to start offering two options for health insurance plans – the plan we already had ( which I am now calling the “ traditional ” plan ) and a new high deductible health insurance plan .
Naturally , the premium for the high deductible plan is less , about $ 20 less a week for us , or about a $ 1040 savings over the course of a year .
Along with that , the high deductible plan has a health savings account , or HSA , attached to it , which my spouse ’s employer will fund with $ 700 every year for employees who choose that plan ( employees can choose to add more to it if they wish ) , bringing the total savings for us to $ 1740 .
So , that high deductible plan sounds great , right ?
Well … not so fast .
Rather than be sucked in by the flashy exterior , I needed to dig into the actual numbers to see what worked for our family .
The person representing the health insurance company that was there to explain the plans and answer questions was quite annoying and a bit condescending .
If it was my employer and not my spouse ’s , I would have been a little more forthright with my opinion on what he was saying , but since it is my spouse ’s employer , I asked mostly innocuous questions and refrained .
The traditional plan was really characterized as the option for “ less healthy ” individuals who are not “ proactive ” in their health care choices .
I ’d like to point out that if we had had this high deductible plan when I was pregnant , we would have paid about twice as much out of pocket as we did with the traditional plan just from basic expenses related to childbirth , and I ’m not sure when pregnancy became an indication of poor health .
But , I digress … lets look at the general details of both plans .
The traditional plan has an individual deductible of $ 1000 ( $ 2000 / family ) and an individual out - of - pocket limit of $ 3000 ( which I hit with both my pregnancies / births ) or $ 6000 / family .
It is a copay - driven plan , we pay $ 20 copays per doctors visits ( well - child checkups and yearly adult checkups are free ) and a $ 15 ( generic ) or $ 25 ( name brand ) copay on prescriptions .
Copays do not count towards our deductible .
After our deductible is met we pay 30 % out of pocket until our out - of - pocket limit is met .
In contrast to that , the high deductible plan has a $ 3000 / individual deductible ( $ 6000 / family ) with a out of pocket maximum of $ 5000 / individual ( $ 10000 / family ) .
After the deductible is met , you pay 20 % out of pocket up to the out of pocket maximum per year .
There are no copays – everything counts towards the deductible .
But that means until you meet the deductible , you pay the full cost of everything out of pocket .
Including prescriptions .
And here ’s where the math comes in .
I have mentioned before that my spouse has asthma .
He takes Advair daily to control his asthma .
Advair at this point has no generic equivalent , and according to our pharmacy receipt , costs $ 174.99 per month .
We pay a $ 25 / month copay for it , or $ 300 / year .
If we chose the high deductible plan , we would pay $ 174.99 x 12 or $ 2099.88 a year for it .
The high deductible plan saves us $ 1040 in premiums and a $ 700 contribution to an HSA for a total of $ 1740 … so we come out behind before we even begin .
$ 2099.88 ( what we would pay for advair under the high deductible plan ) – $ 300 ( what we pay for advair under the traditional plan ) = $ 1799.88 which is more than our savings ( $ 1740 ) for choosing the high deductible plan .
So for us , it immediately from a mathematical point of view does n’t make sense .
Without that , I might have to do a more thorough analysis of the risk and benefit and really think things out .
I would most likely at this financial juncture choose the traditional plan because we do n’t have a lot of money to come up with the full costs of doctors visits and prescriptions , and with two small children it seems those types of things pop up rather regularly – but I can see why the high deductible plan would be attractive to someone who generally uses the benefits very little .

The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution has been strangled with convoluted legal rationalizations , riddled with bullets in the form of Supreme Court decisions and drawn and quartered by “ creative ” law enforcement interpretations .
This old and oft referred to amendment , an attempt to protect the privacy and property rights of individuals , is dead .
Driving any more nails into its rotted casket is a redundant waste of time , but the US Supreme Court persists .
For motorists , or anyone on a public road or sidewalk , the illusion of personal privacy is but a dim memory .
Random searches , based on the flimsiest excuses , roadblocks , “ frisking ” and “ patting down ” passengers or pedestrians , because they “ might have a weapon ” and roadside interrogations are now all quite legal , or are carried out as if they are because no one dare argue to the contrary .
The US Supreme Court is currently hearing a case dealing with a Virginia man who was “ arrested ” for driving with a suspended license , even though the state of Virginia does not authorize arrests for minor traffic crimes , which is what driving on a suspended license is considered .
The court long ago held that once a person is arrested they are subject to being searched .
If their car is within finding distance , it too can be searched .
This Court ruled in 2001 that a person could be arrested for violating virtually any traffic law , including the failure to wear a seat belt .
And , once arrested you have no fourth amendment protections .
For all practical purposes , this gives the police the power to stop , arrest , and search anyone they feel like “ checking out ” or harassing .
Arabs might be the flavor of the day on Monday , Tuesday it ’s blacks in luxury cars and on Wednesday it ’s young men driving sport compacts .
The options / excuses for a stop are endless ; burned out bulbs , unused seat belts , ( real or imagined ) failure to properly signal , touching the center line , hitting the shoulder , two MPH over the speed limit , driving too slow , rolling a stop sign , rolling a right on red , failure to yield to a pedestrian , or talking on a cell phone ( inattentive driving ) .
If the police want to stop you , they can .
If they want to arrest you , they can .
If they want to search you and your vehicle and your passengers , they can .
That ’s how the land ’s highest court has ruled .

There are different masking techniques and tools available to help you create the perfect mask for your Photoshop project .
The reason we mask out a background or delete it in the first place is so that we can smoothly and convincingly composite images together .
You can do some amazing things with Photoshop , and masking is at the center of achieving great effects and realism .
When removing the background from images , you can either delete the unwanted background , or you can remove it using a mask .
Professionally , a mask is technically better , because if you take too much of an image , you can paint it back in with a white brush if you use a mask .
If you delete it , you have to undo your last action .
A major problem is that you only have so many history states , so if you delete something by accident and do n’t realize it until much later , you may not be able to retrieve that portion of the image .
You would lose valuable time by having to remove the background all over again .
The Eraser Tool
You can download the sample file here .
You can use the eraser tool to remove large areas that you know you do not need .
You could theoretically come in with the eraser and remove finer details , but that is more complicated and time consuming than other methods .
The Eraser Tool has opacity , hardness , and size settings just like a brush , and you can also use different shapes and brush tips as well .
The Background Eraser Tool
This can be very handy for erasing simple background such as those with solid colors , but anything complicated becomes a hassle .
Notice in our example that I was able to remove the white from around the hand , but when I came too close to the mouse , it erased some of it as well .
This can be counterintuitive , because the tool is meant to be clicked and dragged along an edge , and the tool detects where edges are .
The Magic Eraser Tool
This tool is very handy , as it can remove a background with one click .
You have to adjust the tolerance level of the Magic Eraser , but with the right setting , you can remove a great deal of the background .
With a tolerance set to 32 , the Magic Eraser took some of the top portion of the mouse away .
When I lowered the tolerance to 20 , it removed nearly all of the white background above the mouse cord .
Turning off Contiguous allowed me to remove a large portion of the background with one click , but some of the shadow area under the hand was still present .
Another problem is that the Magic Eraser tool can leave pieces of the background behind , so it is a good idea to make a new layer below the image that you are trying to isolate , and fill it with a solid color that contrasts the colors in your image .
That will allow you to see artifacts left behind .
The Magic Wand Tool
The Magic Wand Tool is a one - click selection tool that you use to make selections in your images .
It relies on a tolerance setting much like the ones found with the Background Eraser and the Magic Eraser Tools .
What is nice about the magic wand tool , as with other selection tools , you can add to a selection and subtract from a selection without consequence .
Simply Hold Shift to add to the current selection , and hold Option / Alt to subtract from a selection .
If you select too much , Hold the Alt / Option key and click the area that you wish to deselect , while keeping the other areas selected .
The Quick Selection Tool
The Quick Selection tool makes selecting objects quick and easy .
It is similar to the Magic Wand tool , except that it has no tolerance .
There are 3 options available in the options bar .
You can set the Quick Selection Tool to always make a new selection , our you can set it to add too a selection , or subtract from it .
I set the default to add to you selection .
This allows you to click and drag over the areas that you want to include in your selection .
Like the other tools , simply hold the Option / Alt key and click you mouse to subtract from your selection .
Options Available Once You Make a Selection
Make A Layer Mask From It
Instead of deleting the area that you want to remove , simply mask it out .
This will allow you to edit your object , so that you can make the edges smoother , and you wo n’t lose any image information permanently .
This gives you a great deal of flexibility .
Use the Refine Edge Feature
Using Refine Edge will allow you to control your mask with sliders and settings to smooth harsh edges in your image extraction , and make transitions much smoother .
You can also shift the edge , as well as create more contrast between the edge and the background .
A great feature inside of the Refine Mask feature is the Output section .
Here , you can specify that your selection is output to layer mask , a new layer with a layer mask , or even a new document altogether .
Since I had the background selected ,
It masked out everything but the background , but with the mask selected , if you hold command / ctrl and hit the I key , it will invert your mask , revealing the hand and mouse .
If you are 100 % happy with your mask , right click on the mask icon and choose Apply Mask .
However , if you want to keep the mask , when you move this layer into another document , it will bring the mash with it .

Flirty Old Man German Playboy , 77 , Sues for Sex
Aging German playboy Rolf Eden has rarely taken no for an answer .
And he 's not about to start .
He has filed charges against a 19 - year - old for refusing to sleep with him .
The complaint ?
Ageism .
AT&T executive James Cicconi , senior vice president of external & legal affairs must not read the news before opening their mouths .
The New York Times Bits
Blog is reporting this morning that representatives at CES have openly stated today " that they may start filtering Internet content . "
Brilliant move , considering that news just broke yesterday that Comcast could receive FCC fines as high as $ 1.77 trillion .
Obviously , filtering traffic to prevent your users from utilizing certain protocols or services is a form of non-Network Neutral behavior , and AT&T purports to be plodding down the path towards making that a reality for their millions of broadband users .
AT&T does n't seem interested in only ending the use of BitTorrent or other P2P clients .
They 're also actively investigating the usage of digital fingerprinting to filter out other website 's usage of what the system deems as copyrighted material .
They 're currently in close talks with NBC - Universal over what the best software package would be to use .
Does this mean that all our digital video will only come from Hulu ?
I was wondering how they were going to end up making that system usable .
They 're simply going to filter the rest of the internet around it !
Your DSL connection is only useful now for connecting to Hulu !
He added , in later comment , that “ .. whatever we do has to pass muster with consumers and with policy standards .
There is going to be a spotlight on it . ”
No kidding , genius .

Afazuddin Ali , 36 , has five children - three of them daughters .
A few months ago Ali married his eldest daughter , telling his wife Sakina that Allah had ordained him to do so .
Not convinced by his story , his angry neighbours in Kasiajhiora village nearly lynched him for what they said was a clear case of incest .
Marriage within the nuclear family is forbidden in Islam .
' Divine sanction '
" He is a deeply religious man and will never lie in the name of Allah , " Sakina told a court in the northern district of Jalpaiguri .
" I agreed to his marriage with our eldest daughter when he invoked divine sanction , " she said .
But this story has failed to impress the other villagers .
" We did n't know she was married so when we confronted his wife , she told us about the bizarre marriage six months ago , " Sheikh Ramzan , a village leader at Kasiajhiora , said .
" We wanted to smash his head , we were so angry . "
When the angry mob attacked Ali on Sunday , a police team went to the village and rescued Ali and his wife .
The couple were produced before a magistrate in Jalpaiguri on Monday .
But as the lower court has no criminal jurisdiction , Ali and his wife were released .
" The police have not lodged any specific charge against Afazuddin ( Ali ) and my court has no jurisdiction over criminal matters , so what can I do , " sub - divisional officer Atanu Roy said .
Angry villagers say that is not good enough .
" The girl is a minor , so at the very least her father should face criminal charges for marrying a minor , " villager Sheikh Ramzan said .
Ali and his wife have not returned home because they fear a fresh attack from angry villagers .
They are staying in Jalpaiguri town at the moment .

Watchdog asks ,
Is DHS protecting the country , or wasting taxpayers ' money ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 5 , 2007

Print This Email This As the Department of Homeland Security -- the cabinet agency created in the wake of 9/11 -- has fallen short in its mission to protect Americans , an independent watchdog charges in its new report .
Five years since it began , DHS has left behind , waste , fraud and abuse , while driving away its top talent in favor of Bush cronies , and the results can be seen from the devastation left by Hurricane Katrina to the bomb components that slipped past airport screeners .
Citizens for Responsibility an Ethics in Washington has catalogued and quantified many of DHS 's missteps and launched a new Web site -- homelandsecurityforsale.org -- to coincide with the agency 's fifth anniversary .
The site includes CREW 's 67 - page report on DHS along with a video produced by Robert Greenwald and the BraveNew Foundation tracing DHS 's evolution .
" Let the cronyism begin , " says a caption beneath footage of Tom Ridge 's appointment as first DHS secretary .
The video and report document the apparent revolving door between DHS and private contractors and lobbying firms that benefitted from homeland security contracts , and they demonstrate the consequences of nominating unqualified political loyalists -- like disgraced FEMA head Michael Brown -- to vital positions .
In its report , CREW documents billions of dollars in taxpayer money that was lost on poorly conceived or never - implemented DHS programs , including $ 1.3 billion on an immigration program aimed at tracking people coming to and leaving the US .
The program " has never worked as Congress intended , " CREW alleges , naming US - VISIT the top " Failed Program " in its report .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency , which was widely charged with failing New Orleans ' residents after Hurricane Katrina , was awarded the dubious distinction as " most troubled DHS component . "
And the US Customs and Border Protection agency was " most criminal , " according to CREW , because of the number of officials charged with protecting the border who have subsequently be charged with aiding illegal immigrants .
 The Department of Homeland Security is an embarrassment that would be comical if only our national security were not at stake , " Melanie Sloan , CREW 's executive director , said in a news release .
" The agency and its leadership must be held accountable for its failures and pushed to do better . 

What is sacred ?
What is sacred ?
UU World Magazine Winter 2007 , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
UU Theology
There is something innate to human nature , something basic to our civilized sensibility that recognizes certain distinctions of worth in reality .
And the name we have traditionally given to the highest of these is “ the holy ” or “ the sacred . ”
I am suggesting that there is a part of human experience that evokes an attitude of reverence , awe , and ultimate respect , a category of transcendence .
My own concept of the sacred these days is less concerned with divine mysteries and Latin definitions than with a simple recognition of the relatedness of all life and our place within the web of existence .
For me , the sacred is that which binds us to all other living things and to the Earth which is our home .
Even if no divinity exists , for me the relationship of all living things , each to the other and to the world which sustains us , is sacred .
Whatever violates that relation violates the sacred .
Whatever nourishes that relation increases it .
Whatever calls us to an appreciation of that relation , calls us to holiness , invites us to the sacred .
Finally , this may be the truth of the matter :
The things that are holy and sacred in this life are neither stored away on mountaintops nor locked away in arcane secrets of the saints .
I doubt that any church has a monopoly on them either .
What holiness there is in this world resides in the ordinary bonds between us and in whatever bonds we manage to create between ourselves and the divine .
We act as agents of the sacred by our choice to view this world in a religious way .
We are co-creators and preservers of God ’s beauty in the world , in our art , in our science , in our service to high ideals , and not least in our devotion to the good and the just .

DES MOINES , Iowa ( CNN ) -- Former President Bill Clinton blasted his successor 's decision to spare former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby from prison , telling Iowa radio listeners that Libby 's case differed from his own administration 's pardon controversy .
" You 've got to understand , this is consistent with their philosophy , " Clinton said during an interview on Des Moines news - talk station WHO .
Bush administration officials , he said , " believe that they should be able to do what they want to do , and that the law is a minor obstacle . "
Watch Bill Clinton sound off on Bush 's decision »
President Bush on Monday commuted Libby 's 30 - month sentence for perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents investigating the 2003 exposure of former CIA operative Valerie Plame .
Bush 's order keeps Libby 's conviction on his record , but he called Libby 's prison sentence " excessive " and suggested that Libby will pay a big enough price for his conviction .
Clinton was impeached in 1998 over perjury allegations stemming from his sexual relationship with a White House intern , but the Senate acquitted him .
And a flurry of last - minute pardons issued as he left office in 2001 -- particularly his absolution of fugitive financier Marc Rich -- sparked largely partisan outrage .
Critics alleged that the pardon of Rich was linked to contributions raised for Clinton 's presidential library by Rich 's ex-wife .
Libby 's defenders have pointed to Democratic support for Clinton during that period to accuse critics of Bush 's clemency order of hypocrisy .
Do n't miss
" Was n't it Bill Clinton that was handing out pardons like lollipops at the end of his administration ? " former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , now seeking the Republican presidential nomination , told supporters in Iowa on Tuesday .
" And is n't there some recognition that perhaps you might look a little silly if you did n't have anything to say when he was handing out pardon after pardon after pardon for political purposes only ? "
But the former president said , " I think the facts were different . "
" It 's wrong to out that CIA agent , and wrong to try to cover it up -- and wrong that no one was ever fired from the White House for doing it , " he said .
Clinton 's wife , Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - New York , is now seeking the presidency and has been campaigning in Iowa during the Independence Day holiday .
She put him on the phone during a Tuesday interview with Iowa political columnist David Yepsen .
Libby was Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff before his October 2005 indictment .
He was not accused of leaking Plame 's identity , but prosecutors argued his false statements hindered their investigation of the disclosure and left a " cloud " over the White House .
The leak occurred shortly after Plame 's husband , former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson , had gone public with allegations that the Bush administration " twisted " intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq .
Rich fled to Switzerland in the 1980s to avoid racketeering , tax evasion and fraud charges stemming from oil trades with Iran .
Libby , who represented Rich from 1985 to 2000 , told a House committee in 2001 that prosecutors " misconstrued the facts and the law " in pursuing the tax evasion charges .

最近はてなの社内では新しい技術を勉強したり、フレームワークや言語を移し変えようかという話も出ていたりして活気が出てきています。技術者も10人を超えて、色々な考え方をする人同士が刺激を与え合いながら切磋琢磨していて素晴らしいなあと思います。そういう中で、僕が技術について思う事を少しまとめてみました。
アウトプットを出す 新しい技術を習得したり、時間を掛けて作り上げた結果は、何かのアウトプットとして出さなければほとんど意味がありません。知識や結果を自分の中に残すだけで終わるのは、それを活かしてサービスを作りたくさんの人が使えるようにする事に比べると驚くほどちっぽけな仕事です。 また 、3日間で作り上げた素晴らしい仕組みをそのまま1週間寝かせてしまうのは、4日目に他の人が使えるようにしてから1週間を過ごすことに比べると随分見劣りしてしまいます。
当たり前ですが、どれだけ素晴らしい仕組みを作っても、使われなければ他の人にとっては何の意味もありません。
いつもいつも、自分がここまでかなと思うそのもう一つ先のアウトプットを出してから次の仕事に取り掛かるように心がけてください。他の人が使えるようにすることと、なるべく早く使えるようにすることは、自分が想像しているよりも遥かに多く自分の仕事の価値を高めてくれます。
また、様々な技術は全て良いサービスを開発するための道具である、ということを忘れないでください。
たとえ中のシステムが技術的に優れていなくても、サービスが優れているため高く評価されているサービスは世の中にたくさんあります。逆にどれだけ優れた技術を使っていても、誰も使わないので見向きもされないという製品やサービスもたくさんあります。はてなはその両方を達成しなければなりません。これはとても難しい挑戦です。
技術の専門性が高くなればなるほど、ユーザーまで届ける事の無い高度な専門領域が生まれてきます。それはとても良い事ですが、会社全体としてはてなの外に何かを届けるまでは意味が無いのだ、不完全な中途半端な状態なのだ、という事をいつも意識して欲しいと思います。
僕たちが作るものは、会社の外から評価されることによって初めて価値が生まれるのです。
批判精神 はてなは技術会社である以上、開発においては「科学的」でありたいと思います。全てが科学的であれば良いというわけではないでしょうが、少なくとも「科学的なアプローチが出来る」ことは必須です。
そして、科学的なアプローチの根幹に必要なものは「批判精神」「疑う心」です。地動説のコペルニクスや相対性理論のアインシュタインにしても、偉大な科学者は「常識を疑う」事から出発して功績を残しています。偉大な科学者を出すまでも無く、科学が「なぜ？」
「何でこんな現象が起こるの？」という疑問に端を発していることに説明は要らないと思います。
はてなではこれから、世の中の様々な仕組みに変化を起こして少し世界を変えたいと思っています。そこには疑ってかかる精神が必要になります。物事を「本当にこんな方法で良いのか？」と疑問に思わなければ新しい発想は生まれません。
人と違うこと、ユニークであることをはてなでは重視します。それぞれの技術者が独自で多様な視点を持ち、闊達な議論を行う中から新しい可能性が生まれると信じています。
柔軟な発想を大切にし、しっかりとした技術を基盤として理論的、科学的な研究、開発を行っていきたいと思います。
自分の立場を考えたり、他人を気にしたりして、自分が感じたり考えた正直な気持ちを発言しないことは、未来の大きな可能性を失います。遠慮をせずにぜひ思っている事を外に出してください。
遠慮については、もう既にその事で失敗もしています。住所登録問題の時には、社内で十分な議論を行う事ができませんでした。少し技術の話から逸れますが、自分の専門分野ではないなどの理由で正直な気持ちを出す事を遠慮すると、大きな失敗に繋がるという貴重な教訓だったと思います。
自分の専門領域を探す はてなの事業に関連する技術のレイヤーは、下はハードウェアから上はインターフェースデザインまで多岐に渡ります。この中で、自分が得意な事、継続的に努力が出来るフィールドを根気強く探し、そのフィールドで自分自身を向上させる事にはてなを利用してください。はてなは会社として、全面的にその向上に協力したいと思っています。 技術者が本当はやりたくない事に無理やり押し込められて、そのせいで自分が伸ばしたいと思う能力を伸ばせない、といったことをはてなでは極力したくは無いのだ、という事は覚えておいてください。もしそう感じる人が居れば、いつでも声を掛けてください。 どのレイヤー、どのフィールドが自分に向いているかを探すのはとても難しい問題です。一般的には、専門の技術を高める事はとても大変な事だと考えられていますが、自分にぴったりの専門領域を見つけることが出来た人にとっては、他人が思うほどその努力が大変ではありません。なぜなら、その仕事が心から好きになれるからです。 自分の仕事が好きな人は、まるで趣味を楽しむかのように技術を向上させる事ができます。一方、自分が好きだと感じられない努力を強いられる人にとっては、好きな仕事をやっている人の何十倍、何百倍もその作業が辛く感じます。 ですから、好きではない仕事を行う事に努力するよりも、まずは自分にぴったりのフィールド、自分の好きな仕事を探す事に力を使うべきです。この作業を、できれば20代のうちに完了させて欲しいと思います。
自分の専門領域を探すための一番の近道は、色々な事をきちんとやってみることです。きっちりやるというのは、自分の持っている100%の力で、しかもある一定期間の間続ける事です。その間は、自分の個性など無くても構いません。逆説的ですが、それが一番の近道です。
手をつけて数ヶ月しか経っていなかったり、何かほかの事をやりながら片手間で取り組んだりしただけで、自分に向いているかどうか考えたり、面白くないからと言って投げ出すのは得策ではありません。そんな事をしていたら、何一つとして新しい領域の真髄に触れる事もなく、全てを投げ出し続ける事になるでしょう。
どんな事でも、新しい領域の面白さが分かるようになるのは、他人が自分の事を認めてくれるようになってからです。僕の経験上、他人から少しでも認めてもらえるためには、新しく物事を始めてから大体18ヶ月はかかります。
当たり前ですが、どんな世界も自分が何かを始める前は自分が居ない状態で回っています。しかも、そこそこちゃんと回っているのです。何か新しい事を始める時、「その世界はあなた無しでもちゃんと回っている」状態から出発する事を忘れないでください。極端な話、「自分が生まれなくても地球は問題なく回っていた」のです。新しい領域に挑戦すると言う事は、自分が不必要な状態から、自分が必要とされる状態への変化を、自分の力で起こすという事なのです。
既にその世界に居る人が努力していればいるほど、この作業は生半可な気持ちでは成功しません。片手間にやったり、短い期間でやろうとしても出来るわけが無いのです。しかし、一旦他人が自分を認め、必要と感じてくれるようになれば、そこでようやく何かが分かったと言う事ができるでしょう。そこでやっと、自分に向いているかどうかを本当に判断できるようになるのです。
もちろん、明らかに自分に向いていない事に1年半もの時間を使う事は時間の無駄です。興味も無いのに惰性で続ける事も避けなければなりません。しかし、はてなに入ったということは、何かこの中に自分がやるべき仕事、自分が輝ける領域が用意されていると感じて入ってきたはずです。一度はそう思ったのなら、全力でまずそれを探してみてください。人や会社との重要な出会いなど、人生の中でそうたくさんあるわけではありません。
誰に評価されたいか 自分の専門領域を探すにあたって、 「自分は誰に評価されたいか」という視点で考えを巡らせてみるのは一つの有効な手段だと思います。
例えば社内のフレームワークを使って次々にサービスを開発するという分野は、主にユーザーによって評価される分野です。利用者から「使いやすい」と言ってもらったり、「このサービスは楽しい」といった評価がやりがいになり、その人の仕事の価値を決めていきます。
一方で、例えばフレームワークを作るといった分野は主に技術者に評価される分野です。社内、あるいは社外の技術者から「おー、すげー」とか「自分も使わせてください」と言われることが評価になります。
人口比率で言えば、技術者に評価される仕事を正しく評価できる人はユーザー評価の仕事に比べてとても少ないでしょう。運悪く経営者が技術に理解が無かったりすると、会社の中ですら評価される事が難しい場合があります。
一方で、ユーザーに評価される仕事をするには、単なる技術力以外の能力が必要な事があります。他人にきちんと説明したり、新しいアイデアを思いつけないと一流にはなれない場合があります。
どちらか一方ではなくユーザーと開発者両方、というハイブリッド領域も当然あります。むしろほとんどはそうかも知れません。両方に評価されたいと思う気持ちを持つ人は多いと思いますが、比率をどれだけずつ混ぜると自分にとって最適なのかという問題は、人それぞれ違うと思うので、色々な仕事を試しながら探って欲しいと思います。
自分が誰に評価をされたいと思っているかを考えるための良いヒントは、「これまでの経験の中で一番嬉しかった瞬間」を思い出す事です。新しいサービスを考えてリリースした後に、たくさんのユーザーが大騒ぎしてくれている時が最も幸せだと感じたならば、さらにユーザーに向けて良いものを届ける仕事をすべきでしょう。憧れの開発者に「Cool!」と言ってもらえた時が最高に嬉しかったのならば、もっとそう言ってもらえるような仕事をすべきでしょう。
Your PC is full of crud , junk , and gunk that harms performance , clogs up your hard disk , and makes system crashes more likely .
Some of the junk came with your PC , but much of it has accumulated over time , as a result of installing and uninstalling programs , surfing the Web , and creating and saving files .
But things do n't have to be that way : Downloadable software can clean up your PC and give it a new lease on life .
Check out these 20 files that will do the job - - your PC will thank you for it .
General Cleaning Tools

Wrong !
Buy any new PC , and you 'll find it full of " craplets " -- software installed for no reason other than that the PC maker gets paid to put it there .
These craplets slow down your PC startup and its general operation .
The free PC Decrapifier removes dozens of craplets automatically .
Using this program is exceedingly simple .
Just run it , and it does its removal work automatically .
Do n't expect it to completely clean your PC , because it removes only a specific set of craplets and trialware programs -- namely , those that are specifically put on new PCs , such as QuickBooks Trial , Wild Tangent Games , Dell URL Assistant , and many others .
For a full list , go to the developer 's site .
Note that when using this program , it 's a good idea to tell it first to create a restore point -- as illustrated in our screen -- just in case it removes something that you wanted to keep .

I was trying to buy a coat and some earmuffs - it 's minus 10 million degrees out here and like an idiot I arrived woefully unprepared - when the block kicked in .
It 's pretty embarrassing when a shop assistant hands your card back , smiles weakly and says it 's been rejected .
If you 're like me , you ask them to try again , and they reluctantly do so while a queue builds up behind you .
And if you 're really like me , the card 's rejected again , this time in front of an impatient crowd , so to save face you apologetically huff something about " calling your bank to bollock them " and demonstratively whip out your mobile , only to discover you can't get a signal until you walk all the way out of the shop , which makes you look precisely like you 're trying to sneak away .
Standing on the pavement , with the phone almost fused to my ear with the cold , I 'm told I wo n't be able to withdraw any money until tomorrow , because it 's night - time in England and the Halifax security team have all gone home .
Still , it 's thoughtful of them to employ someone to sit at the end of the phone 24 hours a day just to empathise .
Since I have only $ 22 on me , my options for New York fun are suddenly extremely limited : specifically , they 're limited to returning to the hotel to sit indoors ordering room service .
I 'm under house arrest .
Still , at least there 's a TV .
I sigh and switch it on , immediately plunging headlong into a high - octane showbiz news atrocity called The Insider .
It 's like being hit in the face with a pan .
The hosts simultaneously smile and shout , and it 's edited so quickly you feel like you 're glimpsing events through the side window of a speeding car .
The big news is that Lindsay Lohan was spotted swigging champagne from a bottle on New Year 's Eve .
They have a two - second clip of this which they loop and repeat about 600 times , sometimes zooming in , sometimes zooming out , sometimes accompanying it with spinning CGI lettering and sparkles and whoosh noises .
Then a man with more teeth than sense whooshes in to replace her , loudly pledging to bring us " all the latest Lohan updates on this developing story " throughout the remainder of the show .
Then he 's replaced by an advert for an anti-constipation pill .
I look out of the window .
Outside , New York sparkles and bustles .
But without a coat , I can barely even step out of the door .
I grit my teeth and return to the box .
Time passes .
The all - new celebrity edition of the US version of The Apprentice begins .
It 's fronted by Donald Trump and his optical - illusion hairstyle , who 's rubbish compared with Alan Sugar .
Among the cast is simpering human perineum Piers Morgan , furthering his showbiz career with another deliberately smug turn .
Half the others are unrecognisable to me , partly because they 're American celebs , partly because they 've had a bit too much plastic surgery , which always gives people a strangely generic , faintly cro-magnon look , as though they 're part of a new species descended from , but not directly related to , us regular human beings .
Morgan is sneering at one of them when my attention is drawn to a ticker - tape scrolling across the bottom of the screen announcing that Barack Obama has won the Iowa caucus .
Then the whole thing 's replaced by an advert for lasagna rollatini with sausage , something that looks so utterly ghastly that even Iceland would n't consider it .
At some point I fall asleep , only to wake up a few hours later midway through a speech by Mike Huckabee , the Republican candidate who 's also won in Iowa .
He 's worrying for several reasons : 1 ) he 's an ultra-religious Baptist minister who does n't believe in evolution , 2 ) he looks a bit like Charles Logan , the corrupt president from Season 5 of 24 , and 3 ) he 's quoting GK Chesterton : " A true soldier fights not because he hates those who are in front of him , but because he loves those who are behind him . "
Standing directly behind him as he says this : Chuck Norris .
Then there 's a commercial for Advil .
New York , meanwhile , continues to twinkle through the window , infuriatingly out - of - reach .
By now I 'm out of my mind with despair , so I call the bank again simply to vent some frustration , and end up being horrible to the man on the other end , who 's only doing his job .
This makes me feel so low that I call back a few minutes later to try to apologise , but get put through to someone else , and they just think I 'm weird .
Now it 's the next morning and I 'm still waiting to discover if the bank 's going to let me go outside .
I 've learned my lesson , OK ?
It 's protecting my money by stopping me getting my hands on it , just in case I 'm not me .
And right now I 'm not me .
The real me would be out seeing the sights .
Muggins me is locked indoors drinking Pepsi for entertainment .
I clearly deserve everything I get .

Jonathan Klein , the President of CNN , has got himself yet another biased reporter .
The wife of Dan Senor , who served as a spokesperson for Bush in Iraq , is now working for CNN .
Normally , who a reporter ’s spouse is would n’t and should n’t matter .
And , it would n’t if Campbell Brown did n’t show an obvious bias .
Last night , in her first week on the job , she attacked MoveOn :
During the November 28 CNN special Campaign Killers : Why Do Negative Ads Work ? , CNN anchor Campbell Brown said : “ General David Petraeus made his reputation taking on insurgents in Iraq .
But when he came to Capitol Hill in September , he was confronted by American insurgents , a liberal anti-war group called MoveOn.org . ”
Seriously , comparing MoveOn to insurgents is beyond the pale .
That is such an obviously loaded term .
Campbell Brown showed a clear bias , plain and simple .
Actually , Campbell , if you want to know what real insurgents are , ask your husband and his colleagues who let the insurgency grow in Iraq under their watch .
He even still has his White House web page touting that gig .

Canada is forecast to be one of the few countries to keep its illustrious AAA credit rating in the coming years , as ratings agencies get set to start kicking out members from the exclusive club .
This outlook came from Citigroup economists on Thursday , which praised Canada for its political and economic stability , qualities they said will likely keep ratings firms like Standard & Poor ’s enamoured with the country .

Canada is just one of 12 countries which currently maintain a AAA rating from all three major credit agencies .
The United States was part of that exclusive group until last August , when S&P surprised markets with a one notch downgrade to AA .
Michael Gregory , senior economist at BMO Capital Markets , said that the recent Federal budget and those of the provinces show investors that Canadian governments are serious about fiscal responsibility .
[ np - related ]
“ When you think about Canada maintaining its AAA , well , we will have surpluses , we will have balanced budgets across the board , even in Ontario , in the years ahead , ” he said .
“ Investors are also interested in the question of whether there is a political desire to keep budgets balanced over time .
For Canada , I think the answer is yes . ”
Representatives from Facebook , Microsoft and Google all declined to comment on the talks .
The investment discussions by Facebook are part of its effort to raise an additional round of capital to further the company ’s growth and build on its current momentum .
The company has solicited interest not only from Internet companies but also from a handful of financial players including venture capitalists , hedge funds and private equity firms , according to people with knowledge of its plans .
Facebook is seeking a minimum valuation of $ 10 billion but interested bidders have expressed a willingness to value it as high as $ 13 billion , on the assumption that , in the future , Facebook will become a powerful player in the online world .
These numbers might have little basis in actual revenue or profit .
Facebook is a private company and does not reveal its income .
But earlier this year , a Pali Research analyst , Richard Greenfield , estimated that the company brought in $ 60 million to $ 96 million in annual revenue , with no real profit .
Much of that revenue comes from a year - old advertising relationship with Microsoft , which places display advertisements on the site .
Mr. Greenfield said the investment price that Microsoft was considering might have more to do with keeping the prize out of the hands of its powerful rivals .
“ There may be competitive reasons to be connected to this asset beyond what the specific valuation is today , ” he said .
“ You may be paying a premium to keep others out . ”
The lack of a track record for Facebook might actually be driving the price up .
“ Trying to delineate a value today of what was a new industry five years ago is challenging right now , ” Mr. Greenfield said .
Apple Inc. is in the latter development stages of what could possibly be its most significant ' dot release ' of Mac OS X ever .
Due out next month as Mac OS X 10.5.2 , the update will deliver to users of the company 's Leopard operating system nearly 100 code corrections and enhancements , people familiar with the software say .
Among them are twenty new fixes that turned up as part of Mac OS X 10.5.2 build 9C16 , which was released privately to developers during last week 's Macworld Expo .
Some of the more prominent fixes in that build target problems with resuming Time Machine backups and previewing PDF , image and mail attachments .
Since seeding the first pre-release copies of the Leopard update in mid-December , Apple has asked that its developer community test the release quite broadly .
The latest build arrived without exception , maintaining a list of thirty seven core focus areas that swapped out an emphasis on 802.11 wireless testing for that of Active Directory .
Mac OS X 10.5.2 , which in its current incarnation includes just two known issues , will also deliver support for Apple 's just - announced Time Capsule backup appliance and include a revised version of the company 's " Stacks " desktop feature .
Apple is also simultaneously testing a similar update for users of Leopard Server , which currently carries a list of nineteen core focus areas and includes over 30 specific code corrections .

1996 : Carl Sagan dies .
Calling Carl Sagan a scientist is a little like calling the Beatles a rock band .
Sagan was certainly a scientist ( an astronomer , biologist and astrophysicist , to be precise ) .
But he was also science 's most visible public advocate , a secular humanist , a fervent believer in extraterrestrial life , a teacher , an author , a television host and a political activist .
While accurately fixing the surface temperature of Venus and positing the presence of seas on Jovian and Saturnian moons are among his practical contributions to the field of astronomy , his lasting contribution to humanity was to popularize the natural sciences for hundreds of millions of people .
Through his PBS series Cosmos : A Personal Voyage , Sagan reached an enormous worldwide audience .
He also authored numerous books , including a sci- fi novel , that further helped popularize the natural sciences .
Reaction to Sagan from the scientific fraternity was mixed – not everyone appreciated his eager embrace of celebrity – but his professional credentials were sound , and many colleagues were pleased to see the sciences , thanks to his advocacy , rise in the public consciousness .
Sagan the scientist is perhaps best remembered as a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life , but he enjoyed a distinguished , wide - ranging career .
He helped midwife the birth of the U.S. space program and as it grew was involved in everything from devising mission experiments to briefing Apollo astronauts prior to their landing on the moon .
Sagan was deeply involved in more earthbound matters as well , and was often skeptical of technology 's impact on civilization .
He worried about our growing ability to annihilate ourselves through the proliferation of nuclear weapons , and he warned against our casual abuse of the planet .
He was a vocal opponent of President Reagan 's proposal to develop a space - based weapons program ( the so - called " Star Wars " initiative ) and an early voice against the dangers of global warming .
Sagan was 62 when he died from the complications of myelodysplasia , a blood deficiency linked to anemia and leukemia .

Neuroscientists have significantly advanced brain - machine interface ( BMI ) technology to the point where severely handicapped people who cannot contract even one leg or arm muscle now can independently compose and send e-mails and operate a TV in their homes .
They are using only their thoughts to execute these actions .
Thanks to the rapid pace of research on the BMI , one day these and other individuals may be able to feed themselves with a robotic arm and hand that moves according to their mental commands .
" Our work has shown how important the learning process is when using brain - controlled devices , " says Andrew Schwartz , PhD , of the University of Pittsburgh .
" By permitting the subject to adaptively recode the generated neural activity , the overall performance of the device is dramatically increased .
" Furthermore , as we have progressed in this work , it has become apparent that the basic idea of ' intention ' during learning is very important and can be addressed by the direct observation of the neuronal transformations taking place during this fundamental processing , " Schwartz says .
Among the research institutions conducting cutting - edge research on the BMI is the University of Pittsburgh , where scientists recently succeeded in developing the technology that allows a rhesus macaque monkey to mentally control a robotic arm to feed itself pieces of fruit .
The robotic arm 's fast and smooth movements were triggered by electrical signals that were generated in the monkey 's brain when the animal thought about an action .
In previous studies , this lab developed the technology to tap a macaque monkey 's motor cortical neural activity making it possible for the animal to use its thoughts to control a robotic arm to reach for food targets presented in 3D space .

In the Pittsburgh lab 's latest studies , macaque monkeys not only mentally guided a robotic arm to pieces of food but also opened and closed the robotic arm 's hand , or gripper , to retrieve them .
Just by thinking about picking up and bringing the fruit to its mouth , the animal fed itself .
The monkey 's own arm and hand did not move while it manipulated the two - finger gripper at the end of the robotic arm .
The animal used its own sight for feedback about the accuracy of the robotic arm 's actions as it mentally moved the gripper to within one - half centimeter of a piece of fruit .
" The monkey developed a great deal of skill using this physical device , " says Meel Velliste , PhD .
" We are in the process of extending this type of control to a more sophisticated wrist and hand for the performance of dexterous tasks . "
Velliste and the other members of the Pittsburgh research team point out that imparting skill and dexterity to these devices will help amputees and paralyzed patients to perform everyday tasks .
The animal 's thoughts emitted electrical signals that were recorded by tiny electrodes that the scientists had implanted in the monkey 's motor cortex .
A computer - decoding algorithm translated the signals into the robotic arm and gripper 's movements .

In another study , a Washington University School of Medicine research team has generated new information about a long - held theory about the separate functions and responsibilities of the left brain and the right brain .
In the process , the researchers , led by Eric Leuthardt , PhD , and his graduate students Kimberly Wisneski and Nick Anderson , have applied their findings to a new neuroprosthetic strategy to improve the rehabilitation of stroke and trauma victims who have suffered damage to either the right or left half of the brain .
" Classic understanding of brain function has asserted that one hemisphere , or one side of the brain , controls arm and leg movement on the opposite side of the body , " Wisneski explains .
The team 's new findings indicated that if the left hemisphere were damaged , the right side of the brain still had electrical signals that could be used to trigger right - sided arm and leg movement .
The scientists recorded the brain activity of six epilepsy patients in which electrodes were placed over the surface of their brain for reasons that were not connected to the purpose of the study .
( The intracranial electrode arrays were implanted on the surface of each patient 's brain to locate the brain areas that were involved with the patient 's seizures . )
" This access provided us with insights that could not be obtained using other methods , " Leuthardt says .
The team recorded electrocorticographic signals while each patient opened and closed his or her hands .
These recordings revealed brain activity in the hemisphere on the same side of the body in which movement was occurring .
These same - side signals occurred at a lower frequency than did the signals emitted in the hemisphere opposite to the moving side of the body .
In addition , these same - side signals were emitted in spatially distinct areas of the brain and earlier in time in comparison to the hemispheric signals recorded for opposite - side hand movement .
" This evidence demonstrates that the brain encodes information regarding planning for movements of the same - sided limb and that this information is encoded in a way that is unique from that corresponding to opposite - side limb movements , " Wisneski says .
The team next determined how these results could be used to improve the rehabilitation of stroke and brain injury patients .
Their focus : the brain computer interface ( BCI ) , an external device that was designed to benefit patients with spinal cord injury and other disorders that did not affect the brain .
The BCI enables individuals to control with their thoughts alone a cursor on a computer screen , a wheelchair , or a robotic arm .
To benefit stroke and brain injury patients , the BCI would have to be adapted to respond to signals from only one side of the brain .
" To allow these patients to benefit from the use of a brain - computer interface , signals for control for two sides of the body must be acquired from the single functioning hemisphere alone , " Leuthardt says .
" In this paradigm , one side of the body -- the side opposite to the unaffected half of the brain -- would be controlled through normal physiologic pathways , and the other side of the body -- the side affected by the stroke and on the same side as the unaffected hemisphere -- would be controlled through neuroprosthetic assistance using same - side signals from the undamaged hemisphere . "
Other scientists are studying the phenomenon in which neurons are active in the brain 's motor cortex , not only when an individual bends a leg but also when he or she observes other people while moving their legs .
This neural mechanism may help explain the development of innate skills such as speech and new motor skills such as a golf swing .
Graduate student Dennis Tkach and colleagues at University of Chicago hope to tap this neural mechanism to modify BMI systems for use by people who are paralyzed from spinal cord injury or related trauma .
Currently the BMI 's functioning depends on mathematical maps that connect brain cell activity to the action -- arm or leg movement , for example -- that the system is designed to replace .
Tkach says that the phenomenon of congruent neural activity may provide the mathematical maps of these paralyzed patients .
" The existence of these neurons offers the means of creating this mapping by relating neural activity of the patient to an action observed by that patient , " he says .
" The neural activity is congruent because the way that the neurons fire during observation of familiar action is the same as the way they fire when the individual is performing that same action . "
The University of Chicago study , which was conducted with rhesus monkeys , was the first to analyze a neural system that showed congruent activity with movement on a single cell level in the primary motor cortex .
The monkeys were trained to perform a video task in a two - dimensional , horizontal workspace located in front of them .
They guided a circular cursor to a square target .
Both the cursor and the target were projected onto the workspace .
The animals controlled the cursor by moving an exoskeletal robot arm in which their active arm rested .
They were then trained to relax and watch a playback of the task they had just performed .
During the playback , the monkeys saw either or both the target and the cursor on the screen .
" We varied visibility of the video task components in an attempt to gain a better understanding of what facilitates the neural congruency between observation and action , " Tkach says .
" The study showed that the presence of the goal of an action bears a greater impact on the strength of this congruence , while the observation of the motion to this goal carries minimal importance . "
This result emphasized the importance of the goal as the facilitator of this action - like neural response , Tkach says .
The brain cell activity patterns were recorded from arrays of 100 electrodes surgically implanted in the monkeys ' motor cortical areas .
Because of these arrays , Tkach was able to obtain simultaneous neural activity data from a population of single cells along with a more global neural signal .
Analyzing the data , he noted that the activity patterns of the neurons during the observation period correlated highly with the cells ' activity patterns when the animal was using its right arm to guide the cursor .
" Our results lead us to believe that when presented with the observation of a familiar action the monkeys inadvertently generate a motor command that is very similar to one that would occur if the animal were to execute the behavior , " Tkach says .
The congruence of this motor command to the " actual " one was not an all - or - nothing phenomenon but instead spanned a continuum that was contingent upon the components of the observed action that was present .
In other work , Wadsworth Center scientists in Albany , N.Y. , have succeeded in developing a BCI that provided people who are severely disabled with the ability to use their personal computers .
For example , they were able to word - process , send e-mail messages , and remotely turn on or off the lights or TV in their homes .
In the future , even more environmental control options will be available , says Eric Sellers , PhD .
The Wadsworth Center BCI system enabled a scientist with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , to communicate by e-mail with his research team .
" It has allowed him to continue to direct a highly successful NIH - funded medical research program , " Sellers says .
" The initial results indicate that the BCI can function without close technical oversight and can improve communication ability and quality of life .
This initial success suggests that a home BCI system can be of practical value for people with severe motor disabilities and that caregivers without special expertise can learn to support it . "
Five severely disabled people have participated in the Wadsworth research program that evaluates the center 's BCI system .
The first participant , the 49 - year - old scientist with ALS , has been unable to move any muscles in his body except for his eyes .
For up to five to seven hours every day since February 2006 , he has worn a simple electrode cap on his scalp that picks up the electrical activity generated by his brain .
The cap recorded electroencephalographic ( EEG , or brain wave ) activity at eight scalp locations .
The user 's brain waves were translated into simulated keystrokes .
Software developed at Wadsworth presented rows and columns of a 72 - element , 8 " x 9 " matrix that flashed in random order while the user paid attention to the element that he or she wanted to select .
The software recognized that element and executed the appropriate keystroke .
With this design , the patient could use the entire keyboard .
Sellers says that caregivers and family members learned to place the electrode cap on patients ' scalps , enable the software , and generally maintain the system , which the researchers monitored remotely via data transferred weekly from patients ' homes to the lab .
To date , a total of five people with ALS have used the Wadsworth system in their homes .
In addition , the Wadsworth Center team has tested protocols in the laboratory that extend BCI functionality to benefit people with limited eye mobility , poor visual acuity , or difficulty maintaining gaze , impairments that can occur with severe motor disorders such as ALS , brainstem stroke , or cerebral palsy .
For these individuals , the scientists have been developing a BCI system that uses auditory rather than visual stimuli .
In the auditory BCI system , the rows and columns of a 6 " x 6 " matrix of 36 letters and numbers are represented by six environmental sounds .
For each selection , the user paid attention to the sound representing the column or row containing the desired choice .
Thus far , most of the people who tested this auditory system in the lab used it with accuracy sufficient to support effective BCI operation .
The researchers also have been developing a BCI system that uses sensorimotor rhythms ( SMRs ) , oscillations in the EEG recorded from the scalp over the sensorimotor cortex .
The SMRs provided simple communication capabilities , and the people learned to use SMRs to control a computer cursor in one or two dimensions .
In a study of non -human primates infected with the influenza virus that killed 50 million people in 1918 , an international team of scientists has found a critical clue to how the virus killed so quickly and efficiently .
Writing this week in the journal Nature , a team led by University of Wisconsin - Madison virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka reveals how the 1918 virus - modern history 's most savage influenza strain - unleashes an immune response that destroys the lungs in a matter of days , leading to death .
The finding is important because it provides insight into how the virus that swept the world in the closing days of World War I was so efficiently deadly , claiming many of its victims people in the prime of life .
The work suggests that it may be possible in future outbreaks of highly pathogenic flu to stem the tide of death through early intervention .
The study " proves the 1918 virus was indeed different from all of the other flu viruses we know of , " says Kawaoka , a professor in the UW - Madison School of Veterinary Medicine and at the University of Tokyo .
The new study , conducted at the Public Health Agency of Canada 's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg , Manitoba , utilized the 1918 flu virus , which has been reconstructed by researchers using genes obtained from the tissues of victims of the great pandemic in a reverse genetics process that enables scientists to make fully functioning viruses .
" In 1918 , the existence of viruses had barely been recognized .
In fact , the influenza virus was n't identified until 1933 .
Thanks to recent technological advancements , we are now able to study this virus and how it wreaked havoc around the globe , " explains Darwyn Kobasa , research scientist with the Public Health Agency of Canada and lead author of the new study .
" This research provides an important piece in the puzzle of the 1918 virus , helping us to better understand influenza viruses and their potential to cause pandemics . "
By infecting monkeys with the virus , the team was able to show that the 1918 virus prompted a deadly respiratory infection that echoed historical accounts of how the disease claimed its victims .
Importantly , the new work shows that infection with the virus prompted an immune response that seems to derail the body 's typical reaction to viral infection and instead unleashes an attack by the immune system on the lungs .
As immune cells attack the respiratory system , the lungs fill with fluid and victims , in essence , drown .
The mechanisms that contribute to the lethality of the virus were uncovered by University of Washington researchers using functional genomics , a technique in which researchers analyze the gene functions and interactions .
Learning more about the virulence mechanisms of the 1918 flu virus may help researchers understand how to keep the virus from causing such a severe immune response .
" This study in macaques , combined with our earlier research showing the host response in mice infected with the 1918 flu , suggests that the host immune response is out of control in animals infected with the virus , " said Michael G. Katze , professor of microbiology at the University of Washington in Seattle , who led the functional genomics portion of the new study and led the previous mouse - based study .
" Our analysis revealed potential mechanisms of virulence , which we hope will help us develop novel antiviral strategies to both outwit the virus and moderate the host immune response . "
The same excessive immune reaction is characteristic of the deadly complications of H5N1 avian influenza , the strain of bird flu present in Asia and which has claimed nearly 150 human lives but has not yet shown a capacity to spread easily among people .
" What we see with the 1918 virus in infected monkeys is also what we see with H5N1 viruses , " Kawaoka says , suggesting that the ability to modulate immune response may be a shared feature of the most virulent influenza viruses .
In the new study , conducted in a high - level biosafety laboratory ( BSL 4 ) at the Public Health Agency of Canada 's National Microbiology Laboratory , seven primates were infected with the reconstructed 1918 virus .
Clinical signs of disease were apparent within 24 hours of infection and within eight days euthanization was necessary .
The rapid course of the disease mirrors how quickly the disease ran its course in its human victims in 1918 .
Upon infection , the virus grew rapidly in the infected animals , suggesting the agent somehow sets the stage for virulent infection : " Somehow , early in infection , this virus does something to the host that allows it to grow really well , " says Kawaoka .
" But we do n't know what that is . "
Knowing that the virus does something early in infection to trigger such a devastating immune response may provide biomedical researchers with clues about how to intervene and stop or mitigate the virus ' potentially lethal effects , Kawaoka says .
" Things may be happening at an early time point ( in infection ) , but we may be able to step in and stop that reaction . "

Facebook WASHINGTON 
A new intelligence estimate that reverses previous U.S. claims that Iran is developing nuclear weapons will not change the Bush administration 's policy of tough sanctions and diplomacy .
" That was our policy … and that 's our policy going forward , " said Stephen Hadley , the president 's national security adviser .
" We have the right strategy . "
REPORT SUMMARY : Read the NIE assessment PHOTOS PLAY ROLE : Pictures contributed to reassessment IN IRAN : Iran welcomes move to ' correct ' nuke claim Iran ceased its secret nuclear weapons program in 2003 and has not resumed work toward building nuclear arms , a National Intelligence Estimate released Monday says .
The estimate reverses claims the intelligence community made two years ago that Iran appeared " determined to develop " a nuclear weapons program .
The new estimate did not explain why the intelligence community did not know Iran had stopped its weapons program before the 2005 estimate was released .
The estimate , reflecting the collective judgment of the nation 's 16 intelligence agencies , also concludes that Tehran probably is " keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons " by continuing to build missiles and pursue a civilian nuclear power program .
Iran , intelligence analysts concluded , halted weapons development in response to international scrutiny and the threat of increased sanctions .
U.S. officials are still trying to enlist more nations to bring sanctions against Iran .
On Monday , Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns said he met with Chinese officials to agree on key issues involved in imposing a third set of United Nations sanctions on Iran for continuing a nuclear weapons program .
Shortly after Burns ' comments in Singapore , the intelligence community released its estimate saying Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Despite the differences from the 2005 analysis , intelligence officials thought it was important to set the record straight by making public that " our understanding of Iran 's capabilities have changed , " said Donald Kerr , deputy director of national intelligence .
Monday 's estimate was a double " good news story , " said Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri , the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee .
" The intelligence community was willing to reconsider an important intelligence judgment , " Bond said .
" Iran does n't appear to be currently working on a bomb . "
Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the estimate undercuts the administration 's " obsession with regime change and irresponsible talk of World War III . "
Last month , President Bush said the U.S. policy toward Iran was aimed at avoiding " World War III . "
" The NIE makes clear that the right combination of pressure and positive incentives could prompt Tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program , " said Biden , a Democratic candidate for president .
Mordechai Kedar , who served in Israel 's military intelligence for 25 years and is a researcher at the Begin - Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv , said Israel 's intelligence community disagrees with the latest estimate .
" This is a matter of interpretation of data .
I do believe that the U.S. and Israel share the same data , but the dispute is about interpreting the data . …
Only a blind man cannot see their efforts to put a hand on a nuclear weapon .
They are threatening the world . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush ’s demand for immunity for telephone companies that participated in his warrantless domestic spying program won an initial victory on Monday in the U.S. Senate .
President Bush speaks to reporters as Vice President Cheney looks on , in the Rose Garden , December 14 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
On a vote of 76 - 10 , far more than the 60 needed , the Democratic - led Senate cleared a procedural hurdle and began considering a bill to increase congressional and judicial oversight of electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists .
It includes a provision to grant retroactive immunity to any telecommunications company that took part in Bush ’s spying program -- surveillance without court warrants of e-mails and telephone calls of people in the United States -- begun shortly after the September 11 attacks .
Nearly 40 lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T , Verizon and Sprint Nextel Corp. of violating U.S. privacy rights .
Backers of immunity , who include some Democrats as well many of Bush ’s fellow Republicans , contend companies should be thanked , not punished , for helping defend the United States .
But civil liberties advocates and a number of Democratic lawmakers argue the courts should determine if any company violated privacy rights of law - abiding Americans .
Democrats vow to offer amendments in coming days to remove the immunity provision while backing a number of proposed new civil - liberty safeguards that enjoy broad support .
Sixty votes will likely be needed to prevail on any such immunity amendment in the 100 - member Senate .
“ It ’s going to be an uphill battle , ” a Democratic aide said .
Sen . Chris Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat , interrupted his long - shot presidential campaign to return to Washington to help lead the charge against immunity .
“ For the last six years , our largest telecommunication companies have been spying on their own American customers , ” Dodd said .
“ That decision betrayed million of customers ’ trust , ” Dodd added .
“ But was it illegal ?
I do n’t know .
And if this bill passes in its current form , we will never know . ”
The White House said in a statement , “ Providing liability protection to these companies is a just result ” and warned that allowing litigation “ risks the disclosure of highly classified information regarding intelligence sources and methods . ”
The House of Representatives last month defied Bush and refused to shield phone companies from lawsuits .
Both chambers would have to agree to immunity before it could be granted .
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) requires the government receive the approval of a secret FISA court to conduct surveillance in the United States of suspected foreign enemy targets .
But shortly after the September 11 attacks , Bush authorized warrantless surveillance of communications between people in the United States and others overseas if one of the parties had suspected ties to terrorists .
Critics charged that Bush violated FISA , but he argued he had the war - time powers to do so .
In January , Bush put the program under FISA ’s authority .
Terms remain secret .
In August , Congress bowed to Bush ’s demands and expanded U.S. power to conduct surveillance without a court order .
The Senate bill would provide new protections of civil liberties , such as requiring tougher congressional and judicial oversight .

All of the victims were visitors to the zoo , a spokesman for San Francisco emergency services said .

It has now been shot dead .
The incident occurred as the zoo was closing around 1700 ( 0100 GMT ) .
It is not clear how the cat escaped its pen .
Emergency services spokesman Lt Ken Smith said that they were called to the zoo at 1715 following a report that a person had been attacked by a tiger .
In response the zoo was evacuated and armed police officers and firefighters sent to the scene .
There were not many visitors to the zoo on Christmas Day , and it was dark by the time police arrived .
A police spokesman said officers found the dead body of one of the victims right outside the tiger 's enclosure .
Tatiana attacked one of the zoo's keepers last year
Then they saw the second victim , spokesman Steve Mannina told the Associated Press news agency .
He was about 300 metres away , in front of a cafe , sitting on the ground , with blood running from gashes in his head .
Tatiana sat next to him , and suddenly attacked him again , Mr Mannina said .
Officers approached , and fired at the animal when it began to advance towards them .
The spokesman did not confirm , but it was reported the third victim was found in the cafe .
The three victims were men in their 20s , the spokesman said .
Past attack
The two injured people were described as being in a critical condition .
Margie Shafer , a reporter from local radio station KCBS , said that there were unconfirmed reports that the tiger had jumped a moat to make its escape .
San Francisco Zoo is home to both Siberian and Sumatran tigers .
In December 2006 , a keeper at the zoo had her arm severely lacerated when Tatiana reached through the bars of her cage and mauled her during a public feeding .
As a result of that attack the zoo built a new feeding enclosure in its Lion House to protect the trainers as they carried out feedings .
At least one of those competitors is pleased with Nintendo ’s supply problems .
“ I ’m happy that the Wii seems to be running out of hardware , ” Howard Stringer , chief executive of Sony , said at a news conference in Tokyo this week .
He noted that in November , the PlayStation 3 from Sony outsold the Wii in Japan for the first time .
Sony and Microsoft , which sells the Xbox 360 , have both been caught off guard by the popularity of Nintendo ’s console , which is less powerful and complex than their machines .
The Sony and Microsoft consoles are widely available , while buyers tend to wipe out supplies of the Wii in a hurry .
Nintendo sold 981,000
Wiis in the United States in November , its best month yet , while Microsoft sold 770,000 Xbox 360s , and Sony sold 466,000 PlayStation 3 consoles , the market research firm NPD Group said Thursday .
At the Nintendo World store in Manhattan , which receives daily shipments , shoppers line up on the sidewalk every morning for their shot at buying a Wii .
There is a vibrant secondary market , with scalpers reselling consoles in store parking lots and online .
And while some people say they will keep searching for a Wii , others are giving up .
“ I ’m frustrated and I ’m not going to try anymore , ” said Betty Sapien , a San Francisco homemaker , who recently visited a handful of stores , including Best Buy and GameStop , to buy a system for her 9 - year - old daughter .
“ They should have it well supplied .
They know it ’s going to be a big Christmas present , and it ’s been a year ” since it went on sale , she said .
Another shopper , Yvette Marchand , a Bay Area elementary school teacher , said , “ I ’m not proud of this , spending two hours running from store to store . ”
She spoke as she was standing last week outside of a GameStop .
She said she had been to several stores , like Best Buy , where she arrived at 7 a.m. on a Sunday  too late to get a console , because others had lined up at 5 a.m .
A bit of nostalgia for you .
Cast your minds back to 1999 or thereabouts .
Microsoft is finishing off IIS 4.0 and there is no such thing as C# or ASP .
NET .
However , there are rumours that Microsoft is creating a Java - like platform codenamed " Cool " , in the aftermath of a dispute with Sun that was making it impossible to use Java itself .
Microsoft denies the rumours .
Here 's a report from February 1999 :
" There is no Java - like language under development at Microsoft , " said Michael Risse , Microsoft product manager for application development tools .
Risse said the company was talking to developers about a concept called Cool , a much less ambitious project intended to tie Microsoft 's Visual C++ development tool more closely to its COM + middleware .
" However , Cool is not yet in development , and is unrelated to Java , " said Risse .
He said Cool is strictly a " whiteboard " concept , and that no software code connected to the concept has been written at Microsoft .
" Cool is also unrelated to any Java technology within the company .
There 's no connection between Cool and Visual J++ , and the Java lawsuit is irrelevant to the thinking we are doing [ with Cool ] . "
Even after C# was announced in 2000 , Microsoft denied that it had anything to do with Cool .
But at Adobe Max Europe earlier this month , I interviewed Mark Anders , co-inventor of ASP.
NET , and asked him how ASP .NET came about .
" ASP.NET happened after we shipped IIS 4.0 and everyone went on vacation .
Scott Guthrie and I – Scott worked for me at the time , he was 22 years old , straight out of college - and we took advantage of the time everyone was on vacation to start brainstorming new ideas .
" We looked at ASP and how it was being used .
I had worked on Visual InterDev so I had a lot of friends on that team , and we were looking at the new version , I think it was Visual InterDev 6.0 , and we noticed how messy the code was .
We said , how can we do better ?
Scott and I worked for a month and a half , and then when everybody came back from vacation in January we showed them a prototype and a PowerPoint deck , showed them this vision , and people said , ' keep working on it ' . "
I asked whether the prototype was based on .NET from the beginning , or " Project Cool " as the rumour went ?
Anders : " No , it was not .
The original prototype was written in Java .
I loved Java as a language and Scott did too .
So it was done in Java , and we took that around to lots of different groups .
The first group that we took it to was the tools team .
The VB and the InterDev teams were in a feud , and when they saw our demo they liked it .
They said , ' If you build that , we will target it with our tools . '
" The VB team was working on developing a new runtime , what became the Common Language Runtime .
It was not as complicated as COM , and it had a nice object system , it was garbage collected .
So we made a decision that we would write our thing , which at the time was called XSP , in this new runtime .
So we were the first ones to commit to writing anything on it .
The VB team was going to be using it as their runtime , they were doing their forms , but we actually built the whole thing in .NET .
" The funny thing is , you mention Cool .
It was called Cool at one time , but Microsoft denied it .
Scott and I presented what was then called ASP Plus , but we presented it a long time before anybody talked about .
NET .
" We went to a conference , I think it was in Washington DC or something , and Scott and I were up on stage .
He is doing this demo , and he says , ' Here is a directory listing ' .
And I glance up at the screen , and I see file1.cool , all these .cool files , and we 're busy denying that there is anything called Cool , and he has this directory listing .
" So I was worried that somebody would see that and put two and two together ... but nobody picked up on it .
They had asked if they could videotape me to re-broadcast , and I 'd said fine , but when I realised that the Cool screenshot was shown , I contacted them and said , ' I ca n't let you have that videotape ' , and they sent it back .
So it never leaked . "
All these efforts did not prevent The Register posting a story in September 2000 , which describes how a reader working with early C# samples " discovered that the original C# compiler was called coolc , subsequently renamed as csc.exec .
Elsewhere , sample C# code has the HTML tag < script language = ' COOL ' runat= ' server ' > , and Larry notes a couple of references to the string ' C\temp\fact\factorial.cool ' . "
So why did Microsoft deny it ?
I 'm guessing , but maybe the company felt that " Project Cool " was related to Java in people 's minds , and wanted to emphasise that .NET was 100 per cent Java - free .
Any resemblance is purely coincidental , as novelists like to say .

In Clinton endorsement , New York Times inches towards historical revisionism Ron Brynaert and Michael Roston
Published : Friday January 25 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Paper later apologized for exaggerating Saddam threat Senator Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of the New York Times of her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president in a Friday editorial .
But in giving the New York lawmaker their nod , the Times ' editorial board appeared to be subtly revising its stance in the lead up to the Iraq War , painting the picture that it outright opposed the March 2003 invasion .
" We opposed President Bushs decision to invade Iraq and we disagree with Mrs. Clintons vote for the resolution on the use of force , " the Times ' editors write in Friday 's endorsement .
But editorials published by the paper in 2002 and 2003 point to a much more ambivalent record on the movement towards the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , rather than the direct opposition the paper asserts in the endorsement .
The paper can point to a March 9 , 2003 editorial as its strongest declaration against the Iraq War .
" If it comes down to a question of yes or no to invasion without broad international support , our answer is no , " the editorial board reasoned .
But after the editorial was published , the ambivalence of the Times ' editorial page toward the invasion of Iraq was visible on the day in a March 18 , 2003 follow - up , as the " shock and awe " campaign was set to commence .
The opinion piece seemed to say that the war was unnecessary , but also that it was legitimate at the same time .
First , it described President Bush 's actions as " a war waged without the compulsion of necessity . "
Later , the editorial concluded by arguing that the real problem with the war was that Bush seemed to be intent on waging it unilaterally , not that it was being waged at all .
" The result is a war for a legitimate international goal against an execrable tyranny , but one fought almost alone , " the Times ' editors argued .
" At a time when America most needs the world to see its actions in the best possible light , they will probably be seen in the worst . "
The position ultimately defined in the March 18 editorial grew out of a months of ambivalent argumentation that never quite arrived at taking a principled stance against the invasion of Iraq .
For instance , an Oct. 3 , 2002 editorial prior to Congress ' authorization of the use of force called on Congress to thoroughly consider the consequences of war with Iraq , but did not appear to rule out the use of force as an option .
" At this point , there remains a possibility that Iraq can be disarmed by voluntary means , " they argued .
" Congress must make clear its expectation that all diplomatic avenues be thoroughly explored .
President Bush was right to declare Tuesday that ' the military option is not the first choice . ' "
In another pre-authorization editorial on Oct. 8 , 2002 , the Times criticized Democrats in Congress for failing to challenge Bush .
However , the paper stopped short of encouraging them to vote against the resolution , declaring it all but inevitable .
" Given the cautionary mood of the country , it is puzzling that most members of Congress seem fearful of challenging the hawkish approach to Iraq , " the paper wrote , before adding in the next paragraph , " Congress is likely to grant the president the power to use force that he seeks .
But that does not mean the debate should lack seriousness or tough questioning or that it should amount to a blank check . "
After Congress had given Bush authority to use force in Iraq , the Times still urged the White House to avoid war , but did not argue against war outright .
" The desirable alternative to war is to send U.N. arms investigators back into Iraq with no restrictions on their ability to search out and destroy Baghdad 's illegal weapons programs , " the paper urged in a Oct. 11 , 2002 editorial .
" It needs to be fully explored . "
Still , in making this case , it offered a menacing picture of Iraq and its potential to cause destruction in the Middle East . " [ I ] f Iraq were to conclude that an American attack could no longer be prevented , Mr. Hussein '' probably would become much less constrained , ' " the papers ' editors wrote .
" Targets for such attacks could include Israeli cities , Saudi oil fields and concentrations of American troops in the region . "
And it was on this account , of exaggerating the danger posed by Saddam Hussein to the world , that the Times acknowledged in 2004 .
" But we do fault ourselves for failing to deconstruct the W.M.D. issue with the kind of thoroughness we directed at the question of a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda , or even tax cuts in time of war , " they wrote in the July 16 editorial .
" We did not listen carefully to the people who disagreed with us .
Our certainty flowed from the fact that such an overwhelming majority of government officials , past and present , top intelligence officials and other experts were sure that the weapons were there .
We had a groupthink of our own . "
In the end , the New York Times ' editorial board appeared determined in belief of the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein , agreeing with the president on March 17 , 2003 that , " Mr. Bush is right to insist that the choice between war and peace has been in the hands of Saddam Hussein . "
And before the " No " editorial was published , they also made it clear that they did not oppose war with Iraq outright .
What they opposed was a unilateral war .
" The threat of force , however , should not give way to the use of force until peaceful paths to Iraqi disarmament have been exhausted and the Security Council gives its assent to war , " they wrote on March 3 , 2003 , 17 days before the US invasion began .
As I watched Mitt Romney tie himself into a constitutional knot as he argued that religion should provide a guide for public policy but not be used to choose a president , it made me suspect that all the candidates in the race  Republican and Democratic  must believe that I lack some essential virtue .
I ’m an atheist .
When people trot out the well - worn John Adams quote , “ Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people , ” I ca n’t help feeling squeezed out of the polity .
Mr. Romney was trying to sound ecumenical .
But speeches like his confirm the impossibility for an atheist to be elected to national office in this country .
Any atheist with political ambitions would have to drop the atheism first .
Atheists have solid reasons not to believe .
We do n’t need a divine being to explain the natural world , and do n’t know why we should trust claims about humankind ’s divine origins because they are in religious texts .
Give “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey ” a thousand years and who knows what might happen .
Yet believing for tactical reasons has a long intellectual pedigree .
It is a variation of Pascal ’s wager  one of the most famous arguments in the philosophy of religion .
Articulated by the 17th - century French philosopher and gambler Blaise Pascal , it posits that rational people should believe in God even if it is impossible to prove whether He exists , simply because it is a better bet .
Recording industry threatens to sue students
More university students targeted by RIAA in concerted move to crack down on file sharing
Natalie Miles was shocked when she received the letter from the recording industry .
She may have to consider bankruptcy now to settle the suit .

Natalie Miles , a legal studies student at UC Santa Cruz , is getting some unwelcome education in her major .
Attorneys representing some of Hollywood 's biggest companies say the 20 - year - old illegally made 599 songs available for sharing on a popular online service .
For that , she was told in a letter from the recording industry , Miles will be sued in federal court unless she can come up with about $ 3,000 for a settlement .
" It 's horrible , " said Miles , who insists she did nothing wrong and can't afford to settle .
" I just do n't think that these people realize that they 're ruining people 's lives . "
The letter was especially astonishing because Miles , who does n't count herself as much of a music fan , said she never used Limewire , the file - sharing service that the Recording Industry Association of America cited in the letter .
But she acknowledged that others might have used her computer in her absence because she was n't careful about protecting her password .
" I was living in an apartment on campus with five others , " Miles said .
" I would bring friends over , they would bring friends over - I never locked my door . "
Nearly a year after starting a crusade to stop college students from illegally sharing online music , the recording group has sent 5,000 such letters to college students across the country , accusing them of piracy .
At the same time , they offer the students a chance to put it all behind them by paying several thousand dollars .
The crackdown is part of a broader , yearslong effort by the association to curb online music sharing , a wildly popular practice that allows consumers to download music for free through online services Limewire , Ares and Gnutella .
Called peer - to - peer , or P2P , networks , the services allow users to tap into and download songs from other users ' collections .
Adhering to copyright laws is left up to the users .
Music companies complain that file sharing , which violates copyright laws , is cutting into their profits , and they point to falling album sales as evidence .
U.S. album sales fell 9.5 percent in 2007 from a year earlier , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
But the recording industry 's aggressive campaign against music piracy has earned it enmity .
Critics say that suing potential customers is unwise and they call on music companies to find a successful business model for the digital era rather than trying to protect a failing one .
Whether the association 's legal strategy is working is unclear .
Several years of sharp growth in the use of peer - to - peer networks , which also are used to share television clips and films , has ended , according to BigChampagne , a company that measures the use of the networks .
Still , the average number of users on such networks at any one time remained at around 9.3 million globally in 2007 , about the same as it was a year earlier , the company found .
" The fact that peer - to - peer traffic is relatively flat , we take that as a positive impact of our effort , " said Jonathan Lamy , a spokesman for the recording association .
" But that does n't mean that the practice is n't intolerably damaging to the industry . "
During the early years of its anti-piracy fight , the trade group took a more muted approach with colleges .
When its investigations uncovered music file sharing on college Internet networks , the group usually demanded that the material be removed by sending what are known as take down notices .
Then last year , the association stepped up the fight with an initiative to routinely threaten individual students with lawsuits .
Students who received the letters were told they could avoid going to court by paying a settlement - usually between $ 3,000 and $ 4,000 - that can be paid in a number of ways , including online by credit card and in monthly installments .
Each month , the trade group sends out about 400 such letters to colleges across the nation including UC Berkeley , Stanford University and UC Santa Cruz .
Of the 5,000 students who have received the letters , 1,800 have settled , according to the association .
In addition to threatening lawsuits , and making an example of the targets , the recording group is encouraging universities to spread the word about the dangers of file sharing and to provide free , legal music downloading services to students .
Lamy said illicit file sharing has dropped significantly at universities that take such steps .
Miles , the UC Santa Cruz student , got the first of her three pre-litigation letters eight months ago while she was at home on spring break .
She said that she was shocked to read the contents : that she offered to share hundreds of music files from her computer and had 20 days to contact the recording association or be sued in federal court .
Miles said she immediately told her parents about the letter and contacted an attorney .
As with many students accused of piracy , the recording industry did n't originally know Miles ' identity .
It instead sent the pre-litigation letter to the university , along with the address of a computer involved in suspected file sharing , and asked the school to forward the warning .
Eventually , the music companies subpoenaed Miles ' records from UC Santa Cruz to learn her identity .
Her attorney , she said , tried to get the university to fight the court order , but he did n't succeed .
Miles said she is unwilling to settle with the recording group , and in any case , does n't have enough money to do so .
A collections agency working for the association has called her parents to pressure them to pay .
Meanwhile , Miles said , she 's nervously waiting to be sued while continuing her studies .
If taken to court , Miles said that she might declare bankruptcy .
In that way , she may be able to avoid having to pay a court judgment .
" I would much rather go on that course than give the recording industry money for something I did n't do , " Miles said .
A Minnesota woman who decided to fight the recording association in court over accusations of illicit file sharing , rather than settle , lost her case in October .
Illustrating the high stakes , the federal court ordered her to pay $ 220,000 to six music companies .
Fred von Lohmann , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a digital rights group , said he 's spoken with many students who have been targeted by the recording group and have had to drop out of school and start work to pay their settlements .
He said that even if students have a good defense , many settle to avoid hiring an expensive attorney , the headaches and the potential for much bigger damages levied in a trial .
" This is a very unfair fight , " von Lohmann said .
In a series of scenarios drawn up for Pakistan , Frederick Kagan , a former West Point military historian , has called for the White House to consider various options for an unstable Pakistan .
These include : sending elite British or US troops to secure nuclear weapons capable of being transported out of the country and take them to a secret storage depot in New Mexico or a " remote redoubt " inside Pakistan ; sending US troops to Pakistan 's north - western border to fight the Taliban and al - Qaida ; and a US military occupation of the capital Islamabad , and the provinces of Punjab , Sindh and Baluchistan if asked for assistance by a fractured Pakistan military , so that the US could shore up President Pervez Musharraf and General Ashfaq Kayani , who became army chief this week .
" These are scenarios and solutions .
They are designed to test our preparedness .
The United States simply could not stand by as a nuclear - armed Pakistan descended into the abyss , " Kagan , who is with the American Enterprise Institute , a thinktank with strong ideological ties to the Bush administration , told the Guardian .
" We need to think now about our options in Pakistan , "
Kagan argued that the rise of Sunni extremism in Pakistan , coupled with the proliferation of al - Qaida bases in the north - west , posed a real possibility of terrorists staging a coup that would give them access to a nuclear device .
He also noted how sections of Pakistan 's military and intelligence establishment continued to be linked to Islamists and warned that the army , demoralised by having to fight in Waziristan and parts of North - West Frontier Province , might retreat from the borders , leaving a vacuum that would be filled by radicals .
Worse , the military might split , with a radical faction trying to take over Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal .
Kagan accepted that the Pakistani military was not in the grip of Islamists .
" Pakistan 's officer corps and ruling elites remain largely moderate .
But then again , Americans felt similarly about the shah 's regime and look what happened in 1979 , " he said , referring to Iran .
The scenarios received a public airing two weeks ago in an article for the New York Times by Kagan and Michael O'Hanlon , an analyst at the Brookings Institution , who has ties to the Democrats .
They have been criticised in the US as well as Pakistan , with Kagan accused of drawing up plans for another US occupation of a Muslim country .
But the scenarios are regarded with some seriousness because of Kagan 's influence over thinking in the Bush administration as the architect of the Iraq troop surge , which is conceded to have brought some improvements in security .
A former senior state department official who works as a contractor with the government and is familiar with current planning on Pakistan told the Guardian : " Governments are supposed to think the unthinkable .
But these ideas , coming as they do from a man of significant influence in Washington 's militarist camp , seem prescriptive and have got tongues wagging - even in a town like Washington , built on hyperbole . "
Kagan said he was not calling for an occupation of Pakistan .
" I have been arguing the opposite .
We cannot invade , only work with the consent of elements of the Pakistan military , " he said .
" But we do have to calculate how to quantify and then respond to a crisis that is potentially as much a threat as Soviet tanks once were .
Pakistan may be the next big test . "
The political and security crises there have led the Bush administration to conclude that Pakistan has become a more dangerous place than it was before Musharraf took over in the coup of October 1999 .
One Pentagon official said last week that the defence department had indeed been war - gaming some of Kagan 's scenarios .
A report by Kagan and O'Hanlon in April highlighted their argument .
" The only serious response to this international environment is to develop armed forces capable of protecting America 's vital interests throughout this dangerous time , " it said .
But in Pakistan , aides to Musharraf yesterday dismissed Kagan 's study as " hyperbole " .
As media commentators proclaim Hillary Clinton 's rebirth from the ashes of defeat , they miss a critical story -- Obama and Edwards won the New Hampshire primary .
Add together Obama 's 36 percent and Edwards 's 17 , and they beat Clinton 's 39 percent by 14 points .
And because the Democratic primaries have proportionate representation , they 'll in fact come out with more combined delegates - 13 to Clinton 's 9 .
I 've talked or corresponded with hundreds of supporters of both of them , pored through hundreds of blog responses , and from everything I can tell , those backing Obama or Edwards solidly pick the other as their second choice .
So if only one were running , they'd be opening up an unambiguous lead .
But because Clinton 's two main opponents have effectively split the vote , her three - point victory over Obama has revived a campaign that seemed on the verge of meltdown just a few days ago , and left her again the media favorite .
So what are Obama and Edwards or their supporters to do about this ?
First , remind those covering the race that although Clinton got a split - vote plurality , most Democrats still do n't prefer her as their nominee .
Some serious polling could help to verify the convergences between the Obama and Edwards supporters and their shared discontents , and maybe we could encourage that .
Real political differences separate Clinton from both Edwards and Obama , and we need to at least try and get the media to talk about them .
All of these candidates have their flaws and strengths - on global warming , for instance , they all have excellent plans .
But John Edwards was n't just being rhetorical when he said that both he and Obama represent voices for change , versus Clinton 's embodiment of a Washington status quo joining money and power - albeit a far saner status quo than the crazed Bush version .
Clinton recently held a massive fundraising dinner with homeland security lobbyists .
Her chief campaign strategist , Mark Penn , is CEO of a PR firm that prepped the Blackwater CEO for his recent congressional testimony , is aggressively involved in anti-union efforts , and has represented everyone from the Argentine military junta and Philip Morris to Union Carbide after the 1984 Bhopal disaster .
Clinton supported an Iran vote so reckless that Jim Webb called it " Dick Cheney 's fondest Pipe Dream , " and did so , according to her campaign insiders , because she was covering herself for the general election .
She 's still not apologized for her Iraq vote , and her hoarding of scarce 2006 campaign dollars may well have cost the Democrats an even larger Congressional victory .
Those who make up the Obedwards constituencies recognize the problems with so many of Clinton 's approaches and stands .
That 's part of what 's driving them , along with a genuine passion for Obama and Edwards , and a sense , confirmed by the polls , that either of the two has a better shot at beating the leading Republicans than does Clinton .
If we look just at delegates , both Iowa and New Hampshire advanced the Obedwards combined cause .
But because the coverage has focused so exclusively on the Obama / Clinton match - up , they 've missed that a solid majority of Democrats in both New Hampshire and Iowa rejected a candidate who a short while back was proclaiming her nomination as nearly inevitable .

Technology Correspondent , BBC News website
And while that may not be happening to your home , it probably is happening to any PC you connect to the net .
An investigation by the BBC News website has established the scale of the dangers facing the average net user .
Using a computer acting as a so - called " honeypot " the BBC has been regularly logging how many potential net - borne attacks hit the average Windows PC every day .
Attack traffic
Honeypots are forensic tools that have become indispensable to computer security experts monitoring online crime .
They are used to gather statistics about popular attacks , to grab copies of malicious programs that carry out the attacks and to get a detailed understanding of how these attacks work .
HI - TECH CRIME PLANS
The BBC News website is running a series of features throughout the week Tuesday :
What did we catch in our honeypot ?
Wednesday : Anatomy of a spam e-mail and hackers face to face Thursday :
How to spot a phishing scam
To the malicious programs scouring the web these honeypots look like any other PC .
But in the background the machines use a variety of forensic tools to log what happens to them .
Perhaps one indicator of how useful these tools have become is seen in the fact that the most sophisticated attackers make their malicious programs able to recognise when they have trespassed on a honeypot .
The BBC honeypot was a standard PC running Windows XP Pro that was made as secure as possible .
This ran a software program called VMWare which allows it to host another " virtual " PC inside the host .
Via VMWare we installed an unprotected version of Windows XP Home configured like any domestic PC .
VMWare is useful as it makes it easy to pause the " virtual " PC or roll it back to an earlier configuration .
This proved essential when recovering from an infection .
SEVEN HOURS OF ATTACKS 36 warnings that pop-up via Windows Messenger 11 separate visits by Blaster worm 3 separate attacks by Slammer worm 1 attack aimed at Microsoft IIS Server 2 - 3 " port scans " seeking weak spots in Windows software

Tips to stay safe online
When we put this machine online it was , on average , hit by a potential security assault every 15 minutes .
None of these attacks were solicited , merely putting the machine online was enough to attract them .
The fastest an attack struck was mere seconds and it was never longer than 15 minutes before the honeypot logged an attempt to subvert it .
The majority of these incidents were merely nuisances .
Many were announcements for fake security products that use vulnerabilities in Windows Messenger to make their messages pop-up .
Others were made to look like security warnings to trick people into downloading the bogus file .
Serious trouble
However , at least once an hour , on average , the BBC honeypot was hit by an attack that could leave an unprotected machine unusable or turn it into a platform for attacking other PCs .

They have not been wiped out because they scan the net so thoroughly that they can always find another vulnerable machine to leap to and use as a host while they search for new places to visit .
Their impact is limited now because Windows is now sold with its firewall turned on and the patch against them installed .
Recently Microsoft said it was cleaning up hundreds of PCs hit by these machines every day .
Many of these worms were launched from different PCs on the network of a French home net service firm but others were from machines as far away as China .
There were also many attempts to probe the BBC honeypot to see how vulnerable it was .
Hijacked machines in Brazil as well as at the Indiana offices of a public accounting and consulting firm carried out " port scans " on the BBC honeypot to see if it could get a response that would reveal how vulnerable it was .
Via the honeypot we could see these machines sending test data in sequence to the ports , or virtual doors to the net , that the PC had open .
Windows is the favourite target of malicious and criminal hackers
Again these attacks came from all over the world - many clearly from hijacked machines .
The BBC honeypot was attacked by a PC at a Chinese aid organisation , a server in Taiwan and many machines in Latin America .
Via the forensic tools installed on the honeypot we could see the booby - trapped data packets these bugs were trying to make our target machine digest .
By using carefully crafted packets of data , attackers hope to make the PC run commands that hand control of it to someone else .
Via this route many malicious hackers recruit machines for use in what is known as a botnet .
This is simply a large number of hijacked machines under the remote control of a malicious hacker .
Botnets are popular with hi-tech criminals because they can be put to so many different uses .
The slaves or bots in a botnet can be used to send out spam or phishing e-mails .
They can become the seeding network for a new virus outbreak or act as a distributed data storage system for all kinds of illegal data .
Spammers , phishing gangs and others often rent a botnet to use for their own ends .
Often once a machine has fallen under someone else 's control , a keylogger will be installed to capture information about everything that the real owner does - such as login to their online bank account .
This stolen information is often sold as few of those that steal it have the criminal connections to launder stolen cash .

Pacific Gas & Electric 's new solar - powered billboard , just off Interstate - 101 in San Francisco .
The placard generates enough energy to power the household of a family of three to four people during the day .
Energy - sapping billboards , your days may be numbered .
A California electricity supplier says it has installed the nation 's first solar - powered billboard , which generates more electricity than it uses .
The billboard — roofed with 20 solar panels — is located at 1000 Brannan St. in San Francisco , and is visible from the Highway 101 9th Street exit .
" The energy that is collected by the solar panels actually exceeds the amount used by it on a day - to - day basis , " said Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG&E ) spokesperson Jennifer Zelwer of the standard - sized billboard , which proclaims : " This is n't a billboard .
It 's a power plant . "
On sunny days , the sign converts sunlight into about 3.4 kilowatts of energy , which is almost enough to power the household of an average U.S. family of four during the day .
Zelwer said the billboard generates about 2.5 kilowatts of energy during cloudy days .
Although the billboard does borrow electricity at night , she said it has other green - technology tricks up its sleeves to keep the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed in the positive .
" We installed [ light - emitting diode ] lights on it , so it uses less than a third of the energy [ that ] billboards with halophane lights do , " she told LiveScience .
PG&E's new solar - powered billboard is n't the first in the world , as both Canada and Africa already have them .
But Zelwer said it is the first in the Americas to actually push power onto an electrical grid , like ones in Africa do .
Zelwer cautioned that solar - powered placard is only for show at this time , but said she would eventually like to see similar ones replacing standard billboards up and down highways .
" If these are going to be en masse in the future , that certainly would be a wonderful thing , " she said .
Adam Browning , executive director of the nonprofit group Vote Solar Initiative , agrees .
" Solar power is a core element in California 's response to meeting increased electric demand and reducing greenhouse gas emissions , " Browning said .
" PG&E has demonstrated a commitment to making renewable energy work for California .
This leadership is critical if we are to be successful in fighting global warming . "
PALERMO ( Reuters ) - A top Mafia boss swallowed secret notes with names and telephone numbers just before he was shot dead by police this week , officials said on Wednesday .
Daniele Emanuello , boss of a Mafia family in the city of Gela who was one of Italy ’s 30 - most wanted men , was shot on Monday as he tried to flee a police raid on a farmhouse in central Sicily where he had been hiding .
An autopsy showed fragments of the notes still lodged in Emanuello ’s esophagus , the officials told reporters .
It was not immediately clear whether the fragments were of any use to investigators , however .
The 43 - year - old mob boss had been on the run since 1993 .
Anti-Mafia police counted the raid among a string of successes against the Cosa Nostra .
On November 5 , police arrested Salvatore Lo Piccolo , who had assumed the role of Mafia “ boss of bosses ” following last year ’s capture of Bernardo Provenzano .

It seems unlikely that Israel would be involved in the sale of nuclear technology to Pakistan and Al Qaeda , when Israel would be a likely target of a nuclear weapon developed through this transfer .
( Look at Israel 's hawkish reaction to the possibility of an Iranian nuclear bomb .
Their government is seriously considering an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities even without U.S. support ) .
Any Israelis involved in an espionage scheme such as that reported by Edmonds would be unbelievable traitors to their country .

The tapes were for translation , that 's all .
Any interpretation of intelligence would be a mistake .
She leaked the translations of tapes and has put all the people involved in jeopardy , especially Grossman who may have been working with DIA or DOD or counter intelligence or drugs .
They all have to be protected .
NSA was just using standard phones here , no internet or cellphones .
Plame was leaked by Ames in 95 and was just something to trade for more intelligence .
The ' Brewster 's Millions ( the characters in the movie are supposed to be Joe and Val ) ' trade happened just before 9/11 .
There was a Russian Plame ( FSB ) working out of the New York FBI field office after the first 9/11 .
I 'd start checking there .

It must be a true story , DE is here trolling .

Note :
A study by two nonprofit journalism organizations found that President Bush and top administration officials issued hundreds of false statements [ 935 ] about the national security threat from Iraq in the two years following the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The study concluded that the statements " were part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses . "
The study was posted Tuesday on the Web site of the Center for Public Integrity , which worked with the Fund for Independence in Journalism .

Even in a rank dictatorship , Pakistan , the generals and leaders have the " democratic " courage to tell their leader " time for you to go " :
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -
An influential group of retired officers from Pakistan 's powerful military has urged President Pervez Musharraf to immediately step down , saying his resignation would promote democracy and help combat religious militancy .
" This is in the supreme national interest and it makes it incumbent on him to step down , " said a statement released late Tuesday to the media by the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen 's Society , after a group meeting attended by more than 100 former generals , admirals , air marshals and other retired officers and enlisted men .

This 2 faced treasonous ruster is still walking free and still spreading lies instead of facing criminal prosecution for selling nuclear secrets to Pakistan ETC .
Today Grossman just gave a ra ra for increasing state diplomats by another 1000 and their personal toys that they can use at embassies in other countries .
This bastard ended his speech today by stating that 1 of the benefits would be to help fight nuclear proliferation .
This human piece of crap WILL BE PROSECUTED .
2 other points : Global 1st strike IS THE ANSWER : Military men love their death machines and killing people .
Since people like Marc Grossman have helped arm countries like North Korea and Pakistan , pre-emptive nukes the new plan .
THESE UNIFORMED FCKS ARE THE PROBLEM .
Instead of charasmatic leadership to bring world people to work together to quickly face our current world crisis , their answer is more death .
Global 1st strike is not a new plan .
These people need to be removed from power like the rest of these fcking destructive criminal losers in office .
Props to the bush administration with the sale of 50 cargo planes to Columbian drug lords for the transport of drugs .
Flying with the homeland security colors is a nice touch .
NO ONE CLAIMS OWNERSHIP OF THE PLANES AND NO ONE GET CAUGHT .

Reminds me of this ...
And after a while , you can work on points for style .
Like the club tie , and the firm handshake ,
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile .
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to ,
So that when they turn their backs on you ,
You 'll get the chance to put the knife in .
And when you lose control , you 'll reap the harvest you have sown .
And as the fear grows , the bad blood slows and turns to stone .
And it 's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw
around .
So have a good drown , as you go down , all alone ,
Dragged down by the stone .

In law , treason is the crime that covers some of the more serious acts of disloyalty to one 's sovereign or nation .
Historically , treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors , such as the murder of a husband by his wife ( treason against the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior was petit treason ) .
A person who commits treason is known as a traitor .
Oran 's Dictionary of the Law ( 1983 ) defines treason as : " ...[ a ]... citizen 's actions to help a foreign government overthrow , make war against , or seriously injure the [ parent nation ] . "
In many nations , it is also often considered treason to attempt or conspire to overthrow the government , even if no foreign country is aided or involved by such an endeavour .

DON’T KNOW NOTHIN ’….
On NPR this weekend , White House press secretary Dana Perino recounted a recent press briefing in which a reporter referred to the Cuban Missile Crisis :
“ I was panicked a bit because I really do n’t know about . . . the Cuban Missile Crisis , ” said Perino , who at 35 was born about a decade after the 1962 U.S. - Soviet nuclear showdown .
“ It had to do with Cuba and missiles , I ’m pretty sure . ”
So she consulted her best source .
“ I came home and I asked my husband , ” she recalled .
“ I said , ‘ Was n’t that like the Bay of Pigs thing ? ’
And he said , ‘ Oh , Dana . ’ “
Italics mine .
I thought it was only the kids who did n’t know any history these days ?
NB : JFK , of course , is famous for resisting military advice during the Cuban Missile Crisis from insane hawks like Curtis LeMay .
Not knowing anything about this probably helps Perino fit right in to the Bush White House .
I 'm writing today because of the very real threat that Ron Paul's and Dennis Kucinich 's online popularity will not translate into a real world win in the presidential election .
I believe that Paul or Kucinich can win , and the key to victory is simple :
We know how to “ spam ” internet polls and even many straw polls .
Of course I use the term “ spam ” facetiously ; we win because we 're driven and organized .
We must now use our organizational skills and drive to “ spam ” the primary elections .
The importance of primary elections may be obvious to the politically savvy , but many people do not even know what primary elections are .
Many who know about primaries do n't care enough to participate in them .
Voter turnout in primary elections is , sadly , consistently low .
In 2004 , only 11.4 percent of Democrat voters participated in the primary elections .
Consequently , the worst possible Democratic candidate was chosen to go up against Bush .
Ask you friends and family members about primary elections , and you 'll be surprised at how many of them do n't really know what primaries are .
For some reason , primary elections are the best kept open secret in American politics , even though they 're even more important than the general elections .
This is why I 'm worried .
Powerful people make sure to vote in primaries .
Normal people do n't .
It wo n't be a shock to me if only half of the internet 's rabid Paul and Kucinich supporters bother to participate in the primaries – but this can't be allowed to happen .
If the most ardent Paul and Kucinich supporters do n't go to the primaries , all their successful grassroots fund raisers and internet poll victories mean squat .
Unfortunately , getting someone to send money through Paypal or click a link to a poll might prove far easier than persuading them to actually get up off their asses and get to a polling station , much less go through the trouble of registering to vote .
But this , ultimately , is all that matters .
So if you 're involved in a grassroots movement , the primary election is your ultimate battle and requires you to redouble your efforts .
Start getting out the message now , whether it 's through your blog , email list , or message board : register to vote now , if you have n't already .
Find out where your polling station is , when your primary takes place , and then , be damned sure to vote .
But that 's only if we want a chance of winning ; we 'll be far from certain victory .
Sure , we can absolutely dominate internet polls , but that means nothing in the real - world primaries ( remember Howard Dean ? ) .
All that matters are real - world votes .
We 're dedicated and resourceful , but how do we turn our dedication and resourcefulness into the type of numbers needed to win a primary ?
There is a way .
Remember all those friends and family members of yours who never vote in primary elections ?
Oh yes , you 're going to need to take all of them with you – dragging them if you have to – to “ spam ” the primary elections .
If you think this is a strange idea , realize that this is true campaigning .
Winning elections means , ultimately , getting people to vote .
And there 's a good chance that , if they vote , your friends and family members will vote for Paul or Kucinich .
Think about the kind of person you are .
You want the bloodbath in Iraq to end and our civil liberties to be restored .
You love peace and freedom .
If you 're this cool , the people you care about must be pretty cool .
Maybe friends who are smart but lazy .
You need to go to work on them .
Surely you have a couple a** hole friends , too , who 'd probably just vote for Giuliani – do n't bother with them .
But start talking to your cool friends , the ones who would like Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich .
Tell them why you are excited about your favorite candidate .
Tell them about their positions and domination of internet polls .
Show them clips from the debates on Youtube .
Tell them about the how important the primaries are .
Then , ask them to vote with you .
It can be pretty easy to get people excited about Paul and Kucinich .
So many people hate Bush and would love to vote for the guy who 's trying to impeach Cheney .
My best friend , who is a lazy , apathetic bum , had a sudden attitude change when I told him that Ron Paul supports gun rights and legalization of drugs and prostitution .
Almost before I could finish the sentence , he said , “ Dude , I 'm in . ”
If a potential Paul or Kucinich supporter resists your appeals , apply pressure .
For instance , I promised my father - in - law that I 'll never listen to his political rants again if he does n't bother to vote in the primary .
I think the threat worked !
My brother - in - law , a poor college student who lives with my wife and I , will be denied all access to my special cane - sugar root beer stash if he neglects his civic duty .
As positive reinforcement , I 'm also buying dinner for everyone who votes .
Money well spent .
Of course , I 'll have to do all the work required , and so will you .
If you know people who need to register , you 'll have to get the forms , fill in the information that you know , pester your friends until they finish and sign the forms , and then mail the forms yourself .
You 'll also have to find out where your friends ' polling places are and , probably , drive their lazy asses there yourself .
If you need more drivers , enlist your lover or spouse .
If this sounds like a pain , imagine four to eight years under Giuliani .
And face it : this is how elections are won .
Remember , if the people we love do n't vote in the primaries , they are the reason why our country is in a mess .
It 's your fault too – and mine – because we let them get a way with it .
We do n't put the pressure on them to do the one damn thing they need to do – just once every four years , for goodness ' sake – to make sure this country is governed by sane people .
Well , it can't happen this year .
We 're going to have to find a way to get our friends to vote .
Let me leave you with this thought .
In the 2004 Iowa caucuses , Howard Dean would have won , had each of his voters brought two like - minded friends .
The CBD compound found in cannabis is non-toxic
The California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute team are hopeful that cannabidiol or CBD could be a non -toxic alternative to chemotherapy .
Unlike cannabis , CBD does not have any psychoactive properties so its use would not violate laws , Molecular Cancer Therapeutics reports .
The authors stressed that they were not suggesting patients smoke marijuana .
They added that it would be highly unlikely that effective concentrations of CBD could be reached by smoking cannabis .
This compound offers the hope of a non -toxic therapy that could achieve the same results without any of the painful side effects
Lead researcher Dr Sean McAllister
CBD works by blocking the activity of a gene called Id - 1 which is believed to be responsible for the aggressive spread of cancer cells away from the original tumour site - a process called metastasis .
Past work has shown CBD can block aggressive human brain cancers .
The latest work found CBD appeared to have a similar effect on breast cancer cells in the lab .
Future hope
Lead researcher Dr Sean McAllister said : " Right now we have a limited range of options in treating aggressive forms of cancer .
" Those treatments , such as chemotherapy , can be effective but they can also be extremely toxic and difficult for patients .
" This compound offers the hope of a non - toxic therapy that could achieve the same results without any of the painful side effects . "
Dr Joanna Owens of Cancer Research UK said : " This research is at a very early stage .
" The findings will need to be followed up with clinical trials in humans to see if the CBD is safe , and whether the beneficial effects can be replicated .
" Several cancer drugs based on plant chemicals are already used widely , such as vincristine - which is derived from a type of flower called Madagascar Periwinkle and is used to treat breast and lung cancer .
It will be interesting to see whether CBD will join them . "
Maria Leadbeater of Breast Cancer Care said : " Many people experience side - effects while having chemotherapy , such as nausea and an increased risk of infection , which can take both a physical and emotional toll .
" Any drug that has fewer side - effects will , of course , be of great interest . "
But she added : " It is clear that much more research needs to be carried out . "

Federal agencies have indicated that the accumulated trade debts of the United States have reached $ 9 trillion .
This can be explained once one realizes that outsourcing of production jobs and manufacturing has gathered speed over the last twenty years to a point where we don�t make more than a nominal percentage of our own necessities .
These debts result in accumulated � TRADE DEFICITS � which are discussed in the daily papers .
What is not discussed , however , is how these �trade debts � will ever be paid .
Well , common sense would tell most of us that � they will be paid in some form .
Recently posted in the Federal Register on the internet were regulations listed under the caption of The Patriot Act . . . .
At the end of 17 pages you will find legal definitions for �bullion coins� and �rare numismatic coins . �
Strange how the definition of these forms of gold would show up under 17 pages of regulations pursuant to the Patriot Act having to do with identification of persons boarding and de-boarding aircraft and a multitude of other topics .
Once you analyze the situation , it becomes obvious that these regulations were published in this manner , so as to keep the information from the general public and avoid suspicions of confiscation and the resulting objections .
WE BELIEVE THE REGULATIONS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE EXPECTATION OF A SECOND CONFISCATION OF AMERICAN PRIVATELY OWNED GOLD
The purpose of the confiscation is clearly to settle America�s trade debts in an acceptable form .
Keep in mind that Central Banks end up with all of the trade debts via bank deposits in dollars , or , Treasury Bonds , dollar denominated , with no guarantees against loss due to deterioration of the value of the dollar .
Since the dollar has been in a constant downtrend as most Americans realize , Central Banks should not be expected to take all the losses on these transactions without complaint .
Indeed , there are complaints and we believe the complaints have reached fever pitch .
Central Banks no longer wish to accept dollar - denominated assets in payment of trade debts and are demanding American gold .
There is really no other logical mechanism for them to accept payment .
Today , silver is not a monetary asset and neither are any of the other metals such as platinum or palladium .
Only gold can be used for settlement of debts between Central Banks .
� No , � you say ! . . . .
Such a conclusion is unjustified .
If so , then we ask , how is it that 30,000 retail jewelry stores have been forced to become registered with the Treasury Department over the last two years , since January �06 , as indicated at their website at www.jvclegal.org.
The Jewelry Trade Association required their members to purchase a � Patriot Act Compliance Kit , � all of which relates to registration � a form of licensing , obviously connected to one of their main lines of business : gold jewelry .
Why is it also that bullion dealers and gold coin dealers who do $ 50,000 or more in business a year have also been required to become registered with the Treasury Department as indicated in their printout of April 24 , 2007 , from their website .
This particular , April 24th printout may or may not still be on the website , but we have copies from that date on file .
There is significant other evidence as well , including the recent confiscation of gold of an organization in Evansville , Indiana , The Liberty Dollar Group , which stirred up some concern about the use of paper money in the United States , and thus , the gentleman who proposed an alternative form of money was put out of business .
In addition , the U.S. Mint , the seller of extremely popular American Eagle series of coins has , as of October 15 , at least , terminated all sales of American Eagle gold coins .
By the time you read this , they may have changed their minds again , which , of course , can be reversed after a brief period .
Their mint dealer network may or may not still have the American Eagle series coins in stock , but sooner or later , their stocks will run out and there will be no more gold available in this form .
It is our view that the definition of the antique numismatic coins , given in the Federal Register , indicate the one way to avoid the loss of all physical gold in your hands .
The interpretation of the wording of the regulations can be taken differently by different people .
Our interpretation is that coins that have rarity value at least equal to the bullion value at the time of purchase would logically be deemed legal under these rules .
Since it is not likely that any further explanation of these regulations will be published , this is all we have to go on .
Of course � they are not going to announce the confiscation date ahead of time .
We are frequently asked what our opinion is of the timing , and that is obviously difficult to say , but it would not be amazing to see the confiscation gold within the next twelve months of the extremely unpopular Presidency of George W. Bush .
That means there�s only twelve months to go , if we believe that this evil act will be consummated during his term .

The following has been making the rounds on just about every internal email list I belong to in Microsoft .
Here it is to share a little insight with the rest of the world .
Microsoft is an amazingly transparent company .
Google is not .
Any peek is a good peek .
Many of you were asking for the feedback I received from my interview with the former Google employee I hired into ABC Development as a Sr.SDE .
Here it is .
This candidate is also a former MS employee who left the company and founded a “ Start - up ” called XYZ .
XYZ was purchased by Google and he was hired on as a Senior Software Engineer II / Technical Lead .
Here is his take on Google ’s environment as well as areas Microsoft should consider improving in order to be more competitive .
Enjoy
1 . What is the culture really like ?
How many hours are people actually working ?
What are the least amount of hours you can work before you are looked down upon ?
The culture at Google is very much like the old culture at Microsoft – back when the company felt like most employees were in their mid 20’s .
These kids do n’t have a life yet so they spend all of their time at work .
Google provides nearly everything these people need from clothes ( new T - shirts are placed in bins for people to grab * twice * a week ! ) to food – three , free , all - you - can - eat meals a day .
Plus on - site health care , dental care , laundry service , gym , etc .
Imagine going from college to this environment and you can see how much everyone works .
People are generally in the building between 10 am and about 6 pm every day , but nearly everyone is on e-mail 24/ 7 and most people spend most of their evenings working from home .
This culture changes a bit with more experienced folks .
They generally work 10a – 6 pm like the new hires , and most of them are on email until around midnight .
It ’s pretty common for them to be working most of the evening , too .
2. 20 % of your time on personal project .
How many people actually get to use it ?
If so , how do they use it ?
Does Google own your personal project ?
“ 20 % is your benefit and your responsibility . ”
In other words , it ’s your job to carve out 20 % of your work week for a project .
If you do n’t carve out the time , you do n’t get it .
Your project needs to be tacitly approved by your manager .
Whatever it is , is owned by Google .
If you ’re organized , you can “ save up ” your 20 % and use it all at once .
It ’s not unheard of for people to have months and months of “ 20 % time ” saved up .
Most people do n’t actually have a 20 % project .
Most managers wo n’t remind you to start one .
3 . What are the office arrangements like ?
Do you have an office or cube space ?
Google believes that developers are , with few exceptions , interchangeable parts .
This philosophy shows through in their office arrangements which in Mountain View are all over the map .
There are glass - walled offices , there are open - space areas , there are cubicles , there are people who ’s desks are literally in hallways because there ’s no room anywhere else .
There are even buildings that experiment with no pre-defined workspaces or workstations – cogs ( err , people ? ) just take one of the available machines and desks when they get to work .
In terms of employees per square - foot , every Microsoft Building 9 - sized office is a triple at Google .
Google does n’t seem to think that private offices are valuable for technical staff .
They ’re wrong .
4 . What is the management structure like ( hierarchy ) ?
There are front - line developers , and then their manager .
My manager had over 100 direct reports and is the common case for managers at Google .
Managers quasi - own products and their employees tend to work on their projects , but not always .
It ’s possible for a developer on your product to actually work for a manager in research ( a completely different division ) .
This makes it really interesting at review time .
Oh and conflict resolution between team members is very complex – the product ’s manager is n’t involved day - to - day , probably does n’t actually manage all of the peers who are trying to resolve a conflict , and likely has n’t spent any time with their employees anyway .
The overall structure is :
tons ( a hundred or more ) of individual contributors report to
a middle manager who reports to
a division v.p. who reports to
the management team ( Larry , Sergie , etc . )
5 . Do they actually have plans for career development ?
Not really .
There is no career development plan from individual contributor to manager .
Basically if you get good reviews , you get more money and a fancier title ( “ Senior Software Engineer II ” ) but that ’s about it .
6 . Who would you recommend Google to ?
Is it for the college kid or family type , worker bee or innovator ?
College kids tend to like it because it ’s just like college – all of their basic needs are taken care of .
In fact , even most of your personal - life can get tied up in Google benefits .
Google provides free or subsidized broadband to every employee .
Google runs its own , private , bus lines in the Bay Area for employees .
Google provides free or subsidized mobile phones .
A college kid can literally join Google and , like they did as freshman at university , let Google take care of everything .
Of course , if Google handles everything for you , it ’s hard to think about leaving because of all the “ stuff ” you ’ll need to transition and then manage for yourself .
Mid-timers , people who ’ve worked at other places for a few years tend to be a mixed bag .
For some , this is the first stability they ’ve seen after a few failed startups .
For others , this is the company that represents a “ better ” way to run a company than the company they worked at before .
Either way , for these folks to succeed at Google they have to drink the cool - aid and duke it out with the college kids because Google does n’t place any value on previous industry experience .
( It puts tremendous value on degrees , especially Stanford ones ) .
“ Old - timers ” tend to like Google because they ’re the ones who know to take the most advantage of the perks .
These are the people who religiously take their 20 % time , use as many of the services as possible , and focus on having a “ peaceful ” experience .
They ’re here to do a job , enjoy the perks , and that ’s about it .
They still put in a lot of hours , but the passion of the college kids is n’t there .
7 . Please provide any additional information that you believe will help in our battle for talent against Google ?
Make the food in the café free .
If an employee eats an average of $ 15 of food per day ( the actual average at Google which is closer to $ 10 ) it would cost Microsoft $ 3,750 per year per employee to offer 3 meals a day .
Instead of increasing starting salaries , switch to free food .
Give everyone else half the merit increases we would have gotten AND ANNOUNCE THE FREE FOOD AT THE SAME TIME .
For that quoted $ 10 average Google provides free soda , free organic drinks ( odwalla , naked juice ) , breakfast , lunch , and dinner ( most people only eat lunch ) , free sport drinks ( vitamin water , etc. ) , and free snacks ( trail mixes , nuts , chips , candy , gum , cereal , granola bars ) .
That single benefit gets people to work earlier because hot breakfast is served only until 8:30 .
And since dinner is n’t served until 6:00 or 6:30 the people with a home - life tend to skip it .
Google actually pays less salary than Microsoft .
Google ’s health insurance is actually not nearly as good as Microsoft’s .
Google has no facility for career growth .
Microsoft has more , but could do better .
Continuing Microsoft - specific education for things like project management , managing people , communication skills , etc. should be promoted .
A structured career plan for each discipline would be great – e.g. training , experiences , milestones , etc. Paths like “ Developer to Development Manager ” “ Developer to Technical Architect ” which show what courses and experiences ( e.g. being a mentor ) are encouraged for the different paths .
Private offices for employees is a big benefit .
See http://joelonsoftware.com/oldnews/pages/March2007.html.
Play this up .
Take a cue from Google and loosen up a little about offices .
Let people call facilities and have their office painted any color they want .
Have the standard office come with a guest chair and a brightly colored Microsoft branded bean - bag chair .
Google has the concept of “ Tech Stops . ”
Each floor of each building has one .
They handle all of the IT stuff for employees in the building including troubleshooting networks , machines , etc .
If you ’re having a problem you just walk into a Tech Stop and someone will fix it .
They also have a variety of keyboards , mice , cables , etc .
They ’re the ones who order equipment , etc .
In many ways the Tech Stop does some of what our admins do .
If your laptop breaks you bring it to a Tech Stop and they fix it or give you another one ( they move your data for you ) .
If one of your test machines is old and crusty you bring it to the Tech Stop and they give you a new one .
They track everything by swiping your ID when you “ check out ” an item .
If you need more equipment than your job description allows , your manager just needs to approve the action .
The Tech Stop idea is genius because :
1 . You establish a relationship with your IT guy so technical problems stop being a big deal – you do n’t waste a couple of hours trying to fix something before calling IT to find out it was n’t your fault .
You just drop in and say , “ My network is down . ”
2 . Most IT problems are trivial when you ’re in a room together ( “ oh that Ethernet cable is in the wrong port ” )
3 . The model of repair or replace within an hour is incredible for productivity .
4 . It encourages a more flexible model for employees to define their OWN equipment needs .
E.g. a “ Developer ” gets a workstation , a second workstation or a laptop , and a test machine .
You ’re free to visit the Tech Stop to swap any of the machines for any of the others in those categories .
For example , I could stop by and swap my second workstation for a laptop because I ’m working remotely a lot more now .
In the Tech Stop system , this takes 5 minutes to walk down and tell the Tech Stop guy .
If a machine is available , I get it right away .
Otherwise they order it and drop it off when it arrives .
In our current set up , I have to go convince my manager that I need a laptop , he needs to budget for it because it ’s an additional machine , an admin has to order it , and in the end developers always end up with a growing collection of mostly useless “ old ” machines instead of a steady state of about 3 mostly up - to - date machines .

Posted 19 January 2008 - 03:02 AM
This modification was done in honor of my original Longshots anniversary .
It was created 1 year ago this month .
Still functions like a dream .
I decided another Longshot was in order but this time with a more FUNctional integration .
Well how do I put this ?
I was going through a thrift store one day and I saw this toy chainsaw that had a moving belt .
I thought " That s not a Nerf gun " and disregarded it quickly .
2 months later I was introduced to Gears of war for the Xbox360 .
I grew very fond of the Lancer .
I did n't really want to use any other guns .
Automatic with a chainsaw .
I love it .
One day while I was playing Co-op with my little buddy Gabriel I put the game on pause and told him I was going to make a Lancer .
He asked how and I did n't exactly know .
All I knew was the seed was placed deep within my brain that I needed to make one .
That seed grew into an idea .
I then found that same make of toy chainsaw over at ToysRus .
I was eyeballing it and realized it could be done .
I then brought it home .
After taking it out of its package I realized this was going to be harder than I thought .
This is what I was looking to achieve .
This is what I was working with .
We 've got work to do .
Without further adieu I present to you :
The Lancer write up .
Now just to get one major thing out of the way .
The breech system and plunger assembly are all the same as my original Longshot modification .
This write up is all about integrations .
We will start with integrating the chainsaw .
First take your Longshot and cut off the front where the bi pods are so it looks like this .
Now lets take a look at minimizing the chainsaw so it fits in place as smooth as possible .
See all the blue shit ?
Get rid of it .
Should come out with a screwdriver and a little bit of force .
After removing these you should be able to just unscrew the gun and open it up .
Do n't worry about flying parts because everything is pretty well screwed in place ..
Here are the internals with instructions on how to begin minimizing it .
Keep in mind you do not want to cut through any wires yet .
Only plastic is what you cut here .
Take everything that was screwed into place and put it in a secure location in the chainsaw when making cuts .
Also be sure to cut off those stupid orange jagged things
After cutting it should look like this .
You can see the stupid jagged things at the bottom .
Good now we need to add a spacer sheet of plastic between the Longshot and the chainsaw .
If we do not the curve in the chainsaws back end will prevent clips from entering the mag well .
Here you can see the plastic before it was cut in two halves .
Now get a feel for where you want your chainsaw to be and make sure the rubber chain on the chainsaw has enough room to move .
To help this I cut a small square in the front of the gun .
I also had to shave down one of the pegs that held the front orange barrel holder in place .
Then sand down all plastic that will become glued shortly .
Apply your glue and place the two separate toys together .
Then position your chainsaw and Longshot in the most centered position making sure the chain comes through the direct center of the gun .
Then whip out elastic bands and bungee cords to help hold it in place .
After the glue has dried you may want to apply another dose of plumbers goop to the inside of the shells where the two toys meet .
This will help increase the strength of the integration .
It 's going to help make sure they stay integrated .
Now let s keep minimizing .
See this orange piece sticking way way out ?
Lets cut it down nice and flush with the rest of the chainsaw / Longshot .
This can only be done to the one side .
As the other side does needs the room for the motor and such .
Now cut out some thin plastic sheeting larger than the gap you just cut .
Do n't forget to bore a hole where the one screw port is on the chainsaw part .
( Picture of that later . )
Then sand down the sides of the plastic and the chainsaw where the two pieces of plastic will connect .
Then brush the loose particles away from the parts you just sanded add Plumbers goop squeeze them together .
Then apply pressure anyway you like .
I used a tub of bungee cords , bottle of wire pulling lubricant and fishing weights hanging off the top .
While the Goop is drying take your stock and cut it down .
Cut it down to the plastic wall that prevents the clip from entering all the way in .
This was done out of pure cosmetics .
A lot of this modification is like this .
If you would prefer a more comfortable stock and have the ability to hold another clip then do n't do this .
If you want something that looks like a lancer then do these mods that actually sacrifice function for fashion .
12 hours later the glue has dried very well and now it looks like this .
Now it is starting to look more like a Lancer .
Now we have a chainsaw mounted but there is still a large gap in the front of the gun .
In the game the chainsaw blade actually rotates in the gun .
So we have to cover up the top part of the chainsaw .
Now take some 1/4 " plastic sheeting and make walls .
Keep in mind you do n't want the walls to big we are cutting a grip later .
Now take two other pieces of 1/4 " plastic sheeting and connect them to the bottom of the original pieces so they press into the chainsaw keeping it in place preventing it from bending left and right .
This is your final chance to perfectly center it .
Then take another small piece of plastic sheeting and cut it so it covers the gap in the front .
Sand down the corners so it is easier on your hands .
Once finished it should look like this .
Now trace out and cut where your hand is going to be holding the gun .
Before you go and cut anything be sure to open up the actual chain part of the chainsaw and remove the red wheels they are unnecessary and will only get in the way .
After the cut you will notice the handle is very scratchy .
Smooth it out as best as you can but do n't worry we will be taking care of that later .
Now cut off the Blue rail on the top of the gun and remove the yellow sight .
Once those are finished the gun should start looking like this .
Here we will need a cool looking barrel for the lancer .
Take the Longshot pistol and get the orange tube and front decorative piece from it .
In the bottom picture you can see the two lines that are going to act as guidelines for when you cut out the slits like in the original Lancers barrel .
If you do n't know what I am talking about , refer to the picture at the beginning of this thread .
Now the Lancer does n't exactly have a connector nub on the front that allows another gun to attach so we are going to be getting rid of that here .
1 . Cut along the line of the nub do not damage the shell !
2 .
Shave down the insides so it can fit the Longshots secondary barrel Shave down the nubs in between the arrows to fit the pvc .
3 .
Place 1/2 " pvc coupler inside and cut down the coupler where you need to .
Make sure the cleaner side is facing outward .
4 .
The clean looking front .
Now lets take a look at building the Lancers sights .
1 .
This is where we cut off the rail .
2 . Trace the shape of the old rail holder on the 1/4 " plastic sheeting .
3 .
Make sure it sits flush with the existing tubular nub .
4 .
Draw a line across the center .
5 . Cut it in half .
6 . Draw a line across the center .
Now cut into that line the same thickness of the washer you are going to be using .
This part is probably done best with a hacksaw with a very thin blade .
I did mine with a band saw .
Cut through the bottom of the washer to make it more buried in the Longshot then take some plumbers goop and put it in the crevice on one side only .
Then place your cut down washer into the crevice and apply some kind of pressure for better adhesion .
Now lets take a look at adding the front sight .
1 . The gap that needs to be filled .
2 . Fill the gap with two pieces of 1/4 " plastic sheeting .
3 . Take a 1/2 " cpvc coupler and cut it in half .
Sand down one end so it is flat .
Glue it into place .
I used a combination of super glue and plumbers goop .
4 . Side viewNow lets take a look at the electronics of the chainsaw .
My major goal to accomplish was to get the chainsaw engine sound running at the press of a button and have it revving when pressing the Long shots trigger .
First we need to drill a hole for the red button to go .
The red button should be within fingers reach of the trigger .
So the chainsaw can be started but not revving .
I decided to place it under the bolt handle closer to the front on the right side of the gun .
This way I can just put my finger to the bolt handle and slide down to it to activate the chainsaw .
The hole is located here .
A nice empty space in the gun with no moving parts .
Make the hole only slightly looser than the red button that would activate the chainsaw .
This will allow the button to freely move back and forth when being pushed .
The trigger for the chainsaw is a wire that connects to a torsion spring .
When the torsion spring is bent the end of the torsion spring connects to a piece of metal that is connected to another wire which completes the circuit .
Take the torsion spring / wire and the metal piece / wire and attach them to the longshots trigger .
Here is a picture showing a few things about the inside of the Chainsaw .
Here is where the torsion spring and metal piece will be going .
With a cutting wheel , cut a line into the trigger of the Longshot so the torsion spring can move up and down without popping out of place .
Be sure to feed the wires through the shell of the Longshot back to where the chainsaw is located .
Now both wires have been extended using small electronics wire .
I prefer using the stranded over the solid wire because it is easier to work with and very flexible .
Now in this modification you are going to need to run wires through your Longshot .
Take your dremel and make small holes where necessary to run wires through .
This will help keep them in place and keep them out of the way of all the moving parts of the Longshot .
We will be coming back to the chainsaw a little later on .
The reason for that being the chainsaws mechanics are on the left side of the shell and all the buttons and Lonsgshots trigger is on the right .
Lets get into some body work I am sure by now you guys will be noticing the gaping holes in the gun .
Well lets patch them up .
here are some photos on how they were patched up .
1 . I took some thin plastic sheeting and covered up the three upper holes on the top .
I found that they took away from the Lancer look .
The plastic sheeting was put on the inside of the shell .
2 . A small thin plastic sheet was placed over the hole and gooped into place .
3 .
Another thin piece of plastic to cover up hole where handle led into .
4 .
Big custom shaped plastic piece to cover hole in the back of chainsaw .
5 .
You will get to see this real soon .
I also needed to cover up this big gaping hole in the top .
I was able to cover it up by using thin plastic sheeting .
I used two pieces .
Do n't mind the brown on the side I will be explaining that later .
For now lets start out with the lighting .
I got my Leds from http://www.superbrightleds.com/
This tool came in handy .
Find out what resistor is needed .
First let me say that I accomplished what I wanted out of lights but I made it 4X more complicated than it needed to be .
You will understand later .
Here is how I did it .
Here is what I am looking to accomplish with the lighting .
I photo shopped Lancer lights onto the Longshot .
First we are going to be looking at the front part .
It sticks out of the gun in a small tube like way and it gives off a light that is diagonally downwards .
I was thinking pretty hard on how to accomplish this look .
This is how its done .
1 . Take a 3/4 " pvc coupler and reduce it down to a size you can work with Make two of them and make sure they are as identical as possible .
Be sure to have the side the lip on the outer edge .
2 .
Cut to size a piece of 1/4 " plastic sheeting that will fit in the coupler .
Sand down the exterior with a thick grit sand paper , then move to a medium grit sand paper and then a thick grit sandpaper .
This will help give off the light effect .
This technique is called " Frosting " .
Drill two holes in the sides using a pointed sanding bit .
Take two blue Led 's and bend the prongs to the shape you would like .
For this we are looking for an " L" shape .
Then cut the prongs to size .
The longer prong is the positive , the shorter prong is the negative .
Be careful though .
Try to only bend once , these things were n't designed to be bending in all directions it is a very thin metal .
Also remember to keep the positive one a little bit longer .
Also draw a rectangle of where you would like the light to shine .
Put hot glue in any gaps between the interior of the lighting assembly and the exterior .
Once you know that the Led 's will fit perfectly in placer take some clear nail polish and apply it to the sanded area that Led will be pressing up against .
This will allow more light to flow through .
Once that dries continue to the next step .3 .
Hot glue the Led 's into place .
4 .
Here you can see the wiring connection .
Take some thin wire and have a wire run to the positive side of the Led prong .
Then I added a wire from the negative of that prong to the positive of the other Led .
Then connect a wire to the negative prong of that Led .5 .
Here is me testing it with a temporary resistor to see the look .
6. Pretty .
We will be adding the resistor for this circuit later .
Now how are we going to attach this to the gun and where ?
1. Drill hole here .
2 . It drills into another side of the gun where there are no moving parts .
3 .
Place positive and negative wires through hole .
4 . Position and super glue / plumbers goop the lighting assembly to the gun .
Do the same for both sides try to keep them in perfect parallel to each other .
Solder in the proper resistor once the goop has dried to the positive wire .
We will be completing this later .
Now lets talk about the long strip of light .
1 . Take a transparent blinds rod .
They can be found in the blinds / shutters / curtains section at the hardware store .
They are like $ 5 .
Trim it down to size and take some light reflective tape and wrap off the areas that wont be showing outward to the exterior of the gun .
Sand down that end in the same fashion you did the other piece .
Also wipe down the cut ends of the rod with clear nail polish .
Once that dries take your Led 's bend the prongs and cut them to a convenient size .
Electrical tape them into place .
2 . Now add the appropriate resistor to the positive of each Led .
To do this you are going to need to solder them into place .
For this you will need a soldering gun and some electrical solder .
3 .
Then solder in some wires and cover the joining with heat shrink tubing .
4 .
This is where the light rods are going to be going .
5 .
Here you can see where the light rod is going to be in the gun .
Now for this to work you need to cut down 1 of the 2 nubs at the bottom of the remaining stock .
You are also going to have to cut down most of the plastic wall in between the two .
This will allow room for the Led 's prongs .
Temporarily rigged up to see how it looks .
Now we will be looking at the rear light of the gun .1 .
Here you can see the stock is reinforced but only with one piece of 1/2 " Pvc this time to make room for everything .
This side of the stock is actually gooped to this side of the Longshot .
The other remains separate .
The top hole circled in green is where the light is going to spill out .
The other hole we will be talking about later .
Cut a piece of 1/4 " plastic sheeting to match the arrow like shape on the stock where the hole is .
2 . Now drill into the side of the plastic and use the clear nail polish again .3 .
Get a blue Led in there .
Hot glue it into place .
Then wrap in reflective tape .
4 .
Add the appropriate resistor , solder where necessary and then cover in heat shrink tubing .
Put it to the side we will get back to it later .
Now its time to get into some body work .
Take your gun and lay it down in two halves look where edges are and look where adding Bondo can make it looking like one piece after a good sanding .
There is going to be a large gap in the chainsaw .
This is where the left hand is going to be when holding the gun .
The problem is the extra space in between the plastic of the " blade I guess " is uncomfortable to hold .
To remedy this , take some O -ring lubricant or your lubricant of choice and wipe down the inside of one of the chainsaws sides .
Then place the chainsaw back together and hot glue where you would like to see some support or extra grip for your hands .
Then once the glue has dried and created a little wall inside the chainsaw shell , apply Bondo .
Then apply Bondo glazing putty .1 ) The gap I was talking about .
2 ) Applying the Bondo.3 )
What it looks like after you have sanded , applied Bondo glazing and spot putty and pulled the two halves apart .
There is also going to be a large gap in the top of the gun after chopping off the handle / rail and removing the yellow sight thingy .
I covered that up by using thin sheet plastic .
I used two separate pieces to accomplish this .1 ) This shows the two pieces of plastic I cut and shaped to fit in the groove .
2 ) This here shows what it looks like after some Bondo +
Sanding +
Glazing and spot putty +
A bit more sanding .
Now to finish off the front lights I took a small piece of 1/4 " plastic and super glued it to another big piece of 1/ 4 " plastic .
I hot - glued the bottom end onto the frosted piece thats going to give off the light .
I filled the surrounding area with Bondo .
After the Bondo dried I pulled out the 1/4 " piece of plastic that was only hot glued on and I then sanded it down and applied Glazing and spot putty .
After that I ended up with something looking true to the idea .
Now let s talk about painting .
The reason I want to paint first is because once all the wires are connected , the gun is going be pretty hard to work with considering there 3 lights on each side of the gun and the chainsaws electrical stuff / motor and such are on the opposite side of the Lancers internals .
More on that later .
For the first time I have decided to work with vinyl dye .
After seeing Bob 2 at Apoc and Griffins Longshot I knew I had to work with the stuff .
So I took it apart and cleaned it up then took it out to the garage and started painting .
I started with Flat Grey .
Then just started misting with a combination of flat grey and flat black .
The handle is purely black .
Everything else is a combination of the two .
The clips are also BlackI took them apart completely and spray painted them inside and out .
Vinyl dye does not stick like Krylon so I figured it was ok to use on moving parts and it hasnt troubled me since I painted them .
I then did some painting by hand adding details to the gun here and there .
I got a couple tips from Direct threat and used them after I used the hand paints I sprayed it down with a 2 coats of Krylon triple thick clear gloss .
More pics to be shown on the paint at end of write up .
Now how the hell are we going to rig up all these lights to the Batteries ?
Well what can I say ?
Turn your Longshots internal walls into swiss cheese if you have to just keep the wires out of all moving parts .
I am going to give you all fair warning .
I fucked up on the lights .
The idea was to get all lights powered by one 9 volt battery and have one switch to keep things simple .
On a single circuit involving one led , and a 9 volt I needed the resistor with the code ( Orange , Orange , Brown , Gold )
The part I fucked up on was I put that specific resistor on every Led thinking it would work on a parallel circuit .
This was not the case .
Now instead of going back and redoing every single light bar I just decided to have four 9 volt batteries and 4 switches .
I was not happy about it but I wanted to get this project over with .
The way the lights work is that there is 1 9 Volt battery in the back end on each side of the stock .
These 9 volt batteries power the single Led in the stock as well as the 2 Leds lighting up the bar near the stock .
Here is a photo of what one of the stocks look like .
- The other two 9 volts are located in the front of the gun under the firing barrel .
If you sand down the space you can get them to fit .
Switches :
It is important to know that the walls of the stock of the Longshot are not very thick .
So it is a very good idea to put some 1/ 4 " plastic sheeting behind any areas you are going to be drilling through and using nuts and such .
The switches have a thread and a nut on the back .
Drill a hole in the appropriate place for your switch and the just push the switch through and throw the nut on the back end .
I picked up both the 9V connectors and the switches at The Source by Circuit city .
They are a push on / push off switch .
Make sure you dont get a momentary switch by accident !
The switches are soldered into the circuit to disrupt the flow of electricity .
I have four switches in total .
One switch to take care of the back two lights and one switch to take care of the front light X2 .
Make sure your rear connections are right .-
The three positive wires coming from the three led 's in the back are all soldered to the red wire coming out of switch . -
The three negative wires are all soldered to the black wire coming out of the 9V battery connector .-
The red wire coming out of the 9V connector is leading the push button switch .
If those are correct your rear parallel circuit should be complete .
Now make sure front connections are right .
- 9V battery snug under main barrel .
Red wire goes all the way to the back of the gun through a series of holes you are going to have to drill to keep wires out of the way . -
The red wire connects to a second switch .-
Then another length of wire runs from the switch all the way back to the front of the gun where it is soldered to the resistor of the front lights .-
The negative of the front lights is soldered to the black wire coming out of the 9V connector .
Now let s talk about chainsaw electronics !
Now as far as the red button goes , remember the red button to push to start up the chainsaw ? lets rig that up for good .
Take the little circuit board piece it comes with and the grey rubber piece and the red push button and put them in place .
Have them in a position where the button is n't depressed yet .
Then carefully hot glue it into place .
It should look like this .
This photo was taken before I did the batteries .
It also shows how I was able to bring all those wires under the clip guide in the side of the longshot .
To make this really simple I just bought a small pack of alligator clips with wires pre-soldered into them .
I attached the two white wires to the wires that come from the red button .
I attached the two green wires to the wires coming from the Longshots trigger .
Here you can see the clips with some E - tape wrapped around the bases ensuring the wires can never touch by accident .
You can also see a small sheet of thin plastic at the highest part of the chainsaw blade that is holding it in place .
This is going to help prevent the chainsaw from being pressed up against the top of the gun possibly breaking it .
Do one last final check and make sure everything works the way you want it to and everything is in its place .
Look over your table and make sure there are no pieces left behind .
Then carefully put the gun back together keep an eye on the wires and make sure you have none protruding out the side .
If you have one or two do n't worry about it to much .
Start to put the screws back in your gun but do not tighten them fully !
Look around your gun where wires might be popping out and use a flat head screw driver to push them back in .
Once they are in , tighten the screws .
Same goes for the stock .
See that hole circled in green ?
Thats the hole for the new screw you are going to put in .
To make sure the stock stays closed we have to put in a new screw to help tighten the lower end .
So I went to the hardware store and picked up a long machine screw , the appropriate nut , acorn nut and rubber washer .
I do n't have a photo but you will see it in the photos .
Its in between the push buttons .
It goes like this from one side to the next .
Machine bolt + small rubber washer +
Both sides of longshot stock +
Rubber washer + nut +
Acorn nut .
Then you are finally finished .
Know that by completing this mod you now posses the best barrel tapping weapon that exists to date .

Bail Set at $ 90,000 ; Lawyer Expects No Contest Plea as Early as Friday
Illustration : Mick Wiggins
In its relatively short life , the World Wide Web has already made many of our most mundane , tedious tasks quicker and easier to perform .
But there are still a surprising number of activities -- from helping us buy concert tickets to protecting our privacy -- that , for one reason or another , the Web still can't get right , stirring the ire of even the most patient users .
We look at ten of the worst of them .
Beyond obvious , nagging problems such as e-mail spam , phishing lures , viruses , and spyware , a great many commonplace online frustrations -- some dating all the way back to the earliest days of the Web - - remain unfixed .
We asked visitors at our online forums to identify what they consider the most dysfunctional aspects of the Web ; then we polled our readers to find out which of these problems they find most aggravating .
For each difficulty , we identified an " aggravation factor " -- the percentage of readers who were either " very annoyed " or " infuriated " by the issue .
We start with the ones that irk our readers most , and work our way down .
1. Dubious Privacy Policies
Aggravation factor : 69 percent
Many business - focused Web sites -- Particularly in the areas of health and financial services -- collect sensitive private information from users .
The vast majority of these sites have established privacy policies to lay out what information the site collects and to delineate customers ' rights .
But the legal jargon in these policies is often laid on so thick that customers can't understand it , leaving them unsure about whether their private data is truly safe from misuse .
Amazon.com 's online privacy notice , for example , is a 2700 - word document that links to a 2600 - word conditions - of - use page jam - packed with arcane legalese .
Good luck figuring out your rights if you do n't have a J.D. after your name .
Privacy policies at some
Web sites grant the sites very broad discretion in handling private data , including the right to use the data to market other products and services to members , and the right to share data with unknown , unnamed third parties -- leaving the person who supplied the data feeling exposed .
Consumer advocates have found this problem exceedingly difficult to correct because site owners ( via their attorneys ) go to extremes to avoid legal liability .
Of course , you can refuse to patronize any site that you suspect might take liberties with your data .
But short of hiring a lawyer to analyze the privacy policy , how do you determine that a site is untrustworthy before it 's too late ?
2. Difficult Online Forms
Aggravation factor : 65 percent
Filling out a simple form online -- be it for something as important as a loan application or as mundane as a news site registration -- can turn into an endless cycle of annoying browser refreshes .
That 's because online forms often mix required and optional fields without clearly distinguishing between the two .
While filling out the form , you inevitably skip one of the required fields and then sometimes have to start all over again because the site wipes the page clean .
To be fair , things have improved in recent times as companies figure out that user frustration can hurt business .
Still , since the problem is so easy to fix , its continued existence is mind - boggling .
Site designers should clearly mark all required fields in a different color ( red would work just fine ) .
And if a user makes an error anyway , there 's no reason to wipe all the fields clean .
To move things along smoothly , Web site developers should highlight any field that still needs to be filled in .
3. Overcommercialization of the Web
Aggravation factor : 62 percent
Interstitials ; pop-ups ; pop-unders ; noisy Flash commercials ; strobe - lit banner ads ; video ads that load without user action ...
Just another day on the Web .
The idea of pushing advertising in exchange for free Web services has led to overcommercialization of the Web - - a major turn - off for surfers .
At MySpace , Yahoo , and even ( we have to admit it ) PCWorld.com such advertising has grown more aggressive , increasingly annoying , and impossible to avoid .
On cluttered Web pages , ads jostle against each other and vie for screen real estate with the content that visitors actually came to see .
The result ?
Slower connection speeds , slower page loads , and far less user control over their browser .
Advertisements affect Web content , too .
When sites measure the value of content by how many eyeballs it attracts to the ads , unusual , diverse , or niche content can get squeezed out in favor of more - reliably popular middle - of - the - road stuff .
" I think in many ways , we have missed the potential of the Web - - much like we did with television , " says Mike Tinsley , a disappointed Web user in Columbus , Indiana .
" When [ the Web ] was new , it held so much promise to be so useful for education , information , and even entertainment .
However , much like TV , the Web has sunk to the lowest common denominator , and I 'm not sure we can ever get it back , " Tinsley says .
The ad - driven online content industry will continue to devise innovative , eye - catching , and obnoxious advertising formats , so things wo n't change for the better anytime soon .
At the same time , browser makers and other software utility vendors may be able to offer some respite with features designed to restrain advertising annoyances .
Browser producers like Microsoft and Mozilla should , by default , block animations or video ads from taking complete control of a Web page and obscuring the content A surfer is trying to view .
At the very least , they should provide users an easy way to adjust the settings manually so as to block such intrusive annoyances .
MIAMI
I expected more of Rudy .
Not a better message .
It figured that he would snowbird his strategy , taking his New York subtext of blacks - want - to - mug - you - and - I - can - protect - you down to Florida and switching it to Arabs - want - to - kill - you - and - I - can - save - you .
And I was n’t surprised that he continued to run on fear and divisiveness , zeroing in on Florida the way he used to target Staten Island , Bay Ridge , Queens and parts of Manhattan where the elderly lived .
Hizzoner always focused on those who supported him and ignored those who did n’t .
I simply expected that Rudy would rise to greater heights as he fell behind , that he would self - immolate in a dramatic way befitting a man who loves opera and the “ Godfather ” movies .
I longed for the Manhattan diva to reprise Maria Callas doing one of her famous Donizetti mad scenes that he loved so much .
Watching him in colorful Miami in his funereal dark suit , I wondered , where ’s the red meat ?
I missed his showman ’s appreciation for pouncing on the news of the day and grabbing headlines with some outrageous , provocative aria .
Surely , The New York Times ’s McCain endorsement  harshly branding America ’s Mayor “ a narrow , obsessively secretive , vindictive man ” who spurred racial polarization and exploited 9/11 for his business and political purposes  gave Rudy the lyrics for an operatic rant against The Times that could have replaced his milquetoast stump speech and delighted conservative audiences .
There ’s a guy I know , but not well .
He ’s polite and friendly .
He ’s average looking .
He means well .
As far as I can tell , he ’s a good citizen .
And yet , every time I see him , I want to beat him to death with a shovel and bury him in a shallow grave .
I do n’t know why I have this feeling about him .
It ’s just chemistry .
He does n’t do a single thing wrong .
He just gives off a strong “ kill me ” vibe .
Out of curiosity , I checked with a friend , and I ’m not the only one who feels this way about him .
Ten seconds after he opens his mouth , you want him dead .
You would think evolution would have weeded out the “ kill me ” gene a long time ago .
If evolution ca n’t handle an easy job like that , it ’s got a lot of explaining to do , unless this guy can run unusually fast , or his skull is extra thick .
I know enough about this fellow ’s life to know things are n’t working out for him professionally or personally .
This is not a huge surprise .
I feel sorry for him , although the pity is somewhat muted by the feeling of wanting to pound a railroad spike through his head .
Luckily , I have enough self - control to not attack him .
But I do worry about running into him when I ’m shopping at Shovels - r - Us .
I ’d hate to be testing out a new shovel for weight and balance when he walks around the corner .
BUH - TANG !!!!
And then he ’d just stand there with his thick ol ’ skull and his stupid smile , saying something like “ You should be careful with that thing .
That ’s the third time today someone hit me with a shovel . ”
Do you know someone like that ?
The ability to learn gestures separates apes from most species
The team analysed the way bonobos and chimpanzees used hand and limb gestures to make themselves understood .
The scientists found the apes used gestures more flexibly than the way they used facial and vocal expressions .
They say the findings support the theory that human language developed through the use of hand gestures .
Food or sex ?
The team comprised researchers from Yerkes Primate Center , at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
It found ape groups developed different gestures to say different things and that meanings depended on context .
They may use the same gesture for something totally different
Frans de Waal
Emory University , Atlanta
A male chimpanzee may beg for food from another chimpanzee by gesturing with an extended arm and open hand .
But the same gesture might also be used to ask a female chimpanzee for sex , or between two males as a sign of reconciliation after a fight , said primatologist Frans de Waal , a member of the research team .
" Typically they may use it for food ... but they may use the same gesture for something totally different ; so , for instance , a male may invite a female for sex by holding out an open hand to her , " Dr de Waal said .
This ability to learn gestures distinguishes apes from monkeys and most other species on the planet , the scientist says .
Although all primates use vocal and facial expressions to communicate , only the great apes - chimpanzees , bonobos , orang - utan and gorillas - use gestures as well , an ability they share with humans .
And when apes gesture , they use their right hand , which is controlled by the left side of the brain - the same side as the language control centre in the human brain .
The latest research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
This column was originally published by the Philadelphia Inquirer .
All great empires and nations decay from within .
By the time they hobble off the world stage , overrun by the hordes at the gates or vanishing quietly into the pages of history books , what made them successful and powerful no longer has relevance .
This rot takes place over decades , as with the Soviet Union , or , even longer , as with the Roman , Ottoman or Austro - Hungarian empires .
It is often imperceptible .
Dying empires cling until the very end to the outward trappings of power .
They mask their weakness behind a costly and technologically advanced military .
They pursue increasingly unrealistic imperial ambitions .
They stifle dissent with efficient and often ruthless mechanisms of control .
They lose the capacity for empathy , which allows them to see themselves through the eyes of others , to create a world of accommodation rather than strife .
The creeds and noble ideals of the nation become empty cliches , used to justify acts of greater plunder , corruption and violence .
By the end , there is only a raw lust for power and few willing to confront it .
The most damning indicators of national decline are upon us .
We have watched an oligarchy rise to take economic and political power .
The top 1 percent of the population has amassed more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined , creating economic disparities unseen since the Depression .
If Hillary Rodham Clinton becomes president , we will see the presidency controlled by two families for the last 24 years .
Massive debt , much of it in the hands of the Chinese , keeps piling up as we fund absurd imperial projects and useless foreign wars .
Democratic freedoms are diminished in the name of national security .
And the erosion of basic services , from education to health care to public housing , has left tens of millions of citizens in despair .
The displacement of genuine debate and civil and political discourse with the noise and glitter of public spectacle and entertainment has left us ignorant of the outside world , and blind to how it perceives us .
We are fed trivia and celebrity gossip in place of news .
An increasing number of voices , especially within the military , are speaking to this stark deterioration .
They describe a political class that no longer knows how to separate personal gain from the common good , a class driving the nation into the ground .
“ There has been a glaring and unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders , ” retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez , the former commander of forces in Iraq , recently told the New York Times , adding that civilian officials have been “ derelict in their duties ” and guilty of a “ lust for power . ”
The American working class , once the most prosperous on Earth , has been politically disempowered , impoverished and abandoned .
Manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas .
State and federal assistance programs have been slashed .
The corporations , those that orchestrated the flight of jobs and the abolishment of workers ’ rights , control every federal agency in Washington , including the Department of Labor .
They have dismantled the regulations that had made the country ’s managed capitalism a success for ordinary men and women .
The Democratic and Republican Parties now take corporate money and do the bidding of corporate interests .
Philadelphia is a textbook example .
The city has seen a precipitous decline in manufacturing jobs , jobs that allowed households to live comfortably on one salary .
The city had 35 percent of its workforce employed in the manufacturing sector in 1950 , perhaps the zenith of the American empire .
Thirty years later , this had fallen to 20 percent .
Today it is 8.8 percent .
Commensurate jobs , jobs that offer benefits , health care and most important enough money to provide hope for the future , no longer exist .
The former manufacturing centers from Flint , Mich. , to Youngstown , Ohio , are open sores , testaments to a growing internal collapse .
The United States has gone from being the world ’s largest creditor to its largest debtor .
As of September 2006 , the country was , for the first time in a century , paying out more than it received in investments .
Trillions of dollars go into defense while the nation ’s infrastructure , from levees in New Orleans to highway bridges in Minnesota , collapses .
We spend almost as much on military power as the rest of the world combined , while Social Security and Medicare entitlements are jeopardized because of huge deficits .
Money is available for war , but not for the simple necessities of daily life .
Nothing makes these diseased priorities more starkly clear than what the White House did last week .
On the same day , Tuesday , President Bush vetoed a domestic spending bill for education , job training and health programs , yet signed another bill giving the Pentagon about $ 471 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct.
1 . All this in the shadow of a Joint Economic Committee report suggesting that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been twice as expensive than previously imagined , almost $ 1.5 trillion .
The decision to measure the strength of the state in military terms is fatal .
It leads to a growing cynicism among a disenchanted citizenry and a Hobbesian ethic of individual gain at the expense of everyone else .
Few want to fight and die for a Halliburton or an Exxon .
This is why we do not have a draft .
It is why taxes have not been raised and we borrow to fund the war .
It is why the state has organized , and spends billions to maintain , a mercenary army in Iraq .
We leave the fighting and dying mostly to our poor and hired killers .
No nationwide sacrifices are required .
We will worry about it later .
It all amounts to a tacit complicity on the part of a passive population .
This permits the oligarchy to squander capital and lives .
It creates a world where we speak exclusively in the language of violence .
It has plunged us into an endless cycle of war and conflict that is draining away the vitality , resources and promise of the nation .
It signals the twilight of our empire .
I have only recently begun contributing articles to self - help blogs on the internet .
Many of the articles are genuinely helpful , as can be judged by the appreciative comments from many savvy readers .
I am trying to learn how to become more efficient myself , to reduce clutter , and establish priorities .
I have quite a way to go , and therefore have nothing to offer in terms of advice about efficient work habits .
I am interested in language learning , however , and how humans use language for different purposes , including using eloquence to persuade other people to do things .
When I studied political science in Paris in the 60s , great importance was placed on oral presentations , and these had to follow a precise formula .
Subsequently , as a diplomat and corporate executive , I often had to speak publicly in different languages .
I still do now , even as a private businessman .
Having an effective presentation formula in my pocket has made it all a lot easier .
On a recent trip to Sweden I bought an audio book on public speaking by a Swedish expert on the subject , Göran Hägg .
The name of the book was “ Praktisk Retorik ” or practical rhetoric .
I was in Stockholm for a week , so I did a lot of jogging , while listening to Hägg .
The audio book described the communication techniques of classical Greece and Rome , a time when the term “ mass media ” referred to public oratory .
Human nature has not changed much since then , according to Hägg .
He shows , with examples , how these classical techniques of rhetoric still apply today .
Bill Clinton gets a lot of coverage in this CD .
Ancient orators like Cicero were speaking to captive audiences .
It was not like mass media today , who often have to compete for the attention of people with short attention spans and remote control buttons .
But there are also many situations today where the audience is captive .
These include job interviews , sales presentations and other public speaking events , where the audience is obliged to listen .
In these situations what you say first is much less important than what you say at the end .
The audience is not going anywhere .
It is what they leave with that matters .
Here the techniques of ancient rhetoric can work for you .
Exordium
To the ancients , the opening of a presentation , or exordium , had two goals .
The first was to gain the sympathy of the listeners .
You need to get your listeners to like you , before you try to persuade them of your arguments .
So you should begin by saying a few humble and friendly things , how much you like their town , office or company etc. , before getting into your subject .
This is where the tradition of the “ unaccustomed as I am ” opening comes from .
The second , and equally important purpose of the opening is to clearly establish your own credibility .
So you have to combine humility with a clear indication that you know what you are talking about .
“ I am glad to have this opportunity to meet with you and explain how much I just want to be a part of your team and put my experience and educational background to work for your company . ”
“ I am a simple person who grew up not far from here , but since then I have accumulated experience that enables me to contribute so much as your elected representative .. ”
Narratio
Having earned the listeners sympathy and convinced them that you are someone they might believe or trust , you now tell them what you are going to talk about , in what is known as the Narratio .
Here you provide an outline of the issue at hand in a narrative fashion .
“ Many of you are aware of the problems that we are having with public transport in our community . ”
“ Global warming is an issue that is in the headlines of our newspapers every day ” .
” I am aware of the difficulty of reconciling the need to reduce capital expenditures while at the same time having to modernize , in a difficult competitive market . ”
Now you are ready , in what is known as the Partitio , to set out the main arguments that you want to make .
“ What we need to do to address this problem is … ” “ The reason why my product is particularly suited to your situation … . ”
“ What I feel I can bring to your company is .. ”
The ancients would sometimes follow this up with what a Confirmatio , where they would bring further proof of the position that was set out in the Partitio , piling on additional arguments .
Refutatio
At this point apparently , it is important to back off a little and offer a counter position .
Let your audience look at the other side of the coin .
The ancients would use what is known as Refutatio to introduce some contrary arguments .
” Some may argue that …. ”
“ I recognize that I do not have all the requirements of the job , ” .
“ You have probably looked at my competitors product , and I recognize that there are good features there too . ”
But , guess what ?
All of these counter arguments can easily be refuted , and that is of course what you do .
That is why this part is known as Refutatio .
Peroratio
Now you are ready for your final appeal or Peroratio .
You are Johnnie Cochran at O.J Simpson ’s trial .
You need to end with your strongest and most eloquent arguments , and a little emotion , so that your listeners are moved to tears , acquit your client , buy your product , hire you , or vote for you , or at least applaud loudly .
Does this really work you may ask .
Is this formula not too transparent ?
How can you fit all situations into the same formula ?
The answer is simply that it works , every time .
Of course you need to adapt it to the subject and situation at hand , but it works .
It worked for ancient orators like Cicero and Quintillian , and it has worked for me time and time again .
If I can leave you with one thought it would be the following .
Having a formula you can rely on for making presentations is powerful .
It will shorten the time required for preparing presentations .
What is more it will reduce your anxiety level at having to speak in front of people .
You will feel that you are one step ahead of them and in control of the situation .
I can tell you that you can literally have the audience on the edge of their seats , if you follow this approach .
If you re-read this article you will see that I have essentially followed the steps of classical oratory in presenting these ideas .

Wherever you go , men and women tend to speak differently .
But in Japan , those differences are more pronounced than in many places .
Among the multilayered rules of grammar and usage governing spoken Japanese , there also exist underlying concepts of " men 's Japanese " and " women 's Japanese . "
By the end of my 2 - 1/2 - year stay there , I had unwittingly become conversant in the latter form .
Like many Western men who spend more than a year in Japan , I learned most of my intonation , expressions , and slang – the things not taught in the classroom – by mimicking a Japanese girlfriend .
I thought my Japanese was fine , while in reality the effeminate , almost childish twang I had been learning made me sound very much like a 20 - something , pink miniskirted Japanese woman .
Grammar and syntax aside , Japanese men generally speak in shortened huffs , while women tend to speak in artificially high octaves , elongating their word endings in an almost coquettish attempt to flatter the listener .
I did n't realize this at the time , though , because my contact with Japanese men was fleeting .
So I would make constant mental notes on my girlfriend 's pronunciation , grammar , and usage , as well as insist that she never utter a word of English in my presence .
I even kept a notebook in my pocket so I could write down any new words I learned on a given day .
Then I 'd study it in the evening .
Japanese acquaintances , eager to compliment anyone who can say a few words in their language , would constantly say " Josu dane ! " or " Your Japanese is really good ! "
With this frequent flattery , which the Japanese , especially the women , have mastered , my ego eventually became airborne .
But what I did n't know was that people around me were actually laughing .
Not maliciously , but sort of as if I were a gaijin peto , or foreign pet .
I was n't alone .
I had friends who sounded like average American guys in English but whose voices , once they broke into Japanese , took on the girly tones of the high - heeled Asian fashionistas they were dating .
Most of these guys were in an English - speaking environment all day at teaching institutes that employed mainly foreigners .
After work , they would go home to their Japanese wives or meet their Japanese girlfriends , and therefore had little contact with Japanese men .
Because the Japanese tend to avoid any form of confrontation , my girlfriend would never correct me .
That is , until one day in an ice - cream shop when she could n't take it anymore .
She snapped , " Do n't say it that way – you sound like a girl ! " referring to my choice of words to describe the ice cream we were sharing .
I did n't mind being corrected on my pronunciation .
But I was disappointed to learn that for the past 2 - 1/ 2 years , I had not been speaking good Japanese .
Suddenly , she fired off a list of the mistakes I had apparently made umpteen times .
She said her friends had often snickered when I referred to myself in the third person , as many Japanese women and girls do , and when they heard me end sentences with the particle " wa , " which is usually used by women to soften the tone of a sentence .
Most of all , she said , I needed to take the pitch of my voice down several notches from the tone I had learned .
The solution , of course , was to hang out with more Japanese guys .
But for me , a freelance journalist with a part - time job and daily Japanese classes to attend , I had little time for new friends .
Besides , Japanese men , unlike their friendly female counterparts , are often inaccessible .
They generally work 12 hours at a stretch and afterward go out in tight - knit , impenetrable groups .
My girlfriend once tried to recruit a few male coworkers to teach me better Japanese but had little success .
They were either too busy or just too exhausted .
No help came from my teachers – they were all women and were hesitant to correct me anyway .
There were no Japanese men working at my baito , or part - time job , either .
And textbooks do not often clarify the difference between men's and women 's vocabulary .
Some teach a few things , but most do not get into the finer points or advanced terminology used separately by men and women .
So I started the painstaking task of dissecting my own style of speaking , asking teachers , my home - stay parents , pretty much everyone , whether such - and - such was proper for men to say .
It got to the point where I could n't finish a sentence .
I would stop in the middle and ask , " Tadashi desuka ? " ( " Is that correct ? " )
Some people would be honest , but many were n't , telling me my Japanese was fine .
I asked some people point blank if my Japanese was joseiteki , or girlish .
Some giggled knowingly , but no one would come out and say it .
My ego had been artificially inflated over my skill in speaking Japanese and then – pop ! – the bubble burst .
Since then , I 've made some adjustments , but an honest Japanese friend recently told me that my Japanese is still chotto kirei , or " a little pretty . "
Not what I wanted to hear , but shoganai – it can't be helped .
That 's all right .
I guess at this point I 've gotten used to it .
NEW YORK --
The ball Barry Bonds hit for his record - breaking
756th home run will be branded with an asterisk and sent to the
Baseball Hall of Fame .
Fashion designer Marc Ecko , who bought the ball in an online
auction , set up a Web site for fans to vote on the ball 's fate , and
Wednesday announced the decision to brand it won out over the other
options -- sending it to Cooperstown unblemished or launching it
into space .
Ecko said he believed the vote to brand the ball showed people
thought " this was shrouded in a chapter of baseball history that
was n't necessarily the clearest it could be . "
Ecko , whom Bonds called " an idiot ' ' last week , had the winning
bid Sept. 15 in the online auction for the ball that Bonds hit Aug .
7 to break Hank Aaron 's record of 755 home runs .
The final selling
price was $ 752,467 , well above most predictions that assumed Bonds '
status as a lightning rod for the steroids debate in baseball would
depress the value .
State officials announced Thursday that California has finally achieved its goal of reducing landfill waste by 50 % , thanks to diligent recycling by residents and businesses .
The milestone culminates a 16 - year campaign by the state to persuade people to separate recyclables out of the trash .

Recycled trash : A story in the Aug. 25 California section on the state reaching its goal to recycle half of its trash incorrectly stated that a 1989 state law mandated that at least 50 % of all recyclable trash be diverted from landfills .
The law calls for 50 % of all trash , not just recyclables , to be diverted from landfills .
The state passed a landmark law in 1989 mandating that communities establish waste - management plans for residents and businesses that would ultimately divert at least 50 % of all recyclable trash from landfills .
California was supposed to reach the goal in 2000 , but preliminary data released Thursday show that the goal was n’t reached until last year .
A total of 88 million tons of solid waste was recycled in 2005 for a 52 % recycling rate , said Jon Myers , a spokesman for the state ’s Integrated Waste Management Board .
In 2004 , 76 million tons were recycled , or 48 % .

Though some cities still lag behind , other communities that are now diverting 60 % or more of their waste to recycling centers made up the difference .
Myers said the recycling push has achieved one of the intended effects :
No new landfills have opened in California in a decade .
“ I ’m really proud of everyone , ” said Scott Von Lanken , a Thousand Oaks resident who on Thursday was doing his part for recycling .
He and his daughter placed special recyclable bedding for their hamster cage into the recycling bin set aside for composting .

Thousand Oaks was one of the cities that exceeded the 50 % standard , and Von Lanken said he was pleasantly surprised .
“ I was really shocked that that much stuff is going to recycle .
I ca n’t believe it , ” he said .
The recycling effort got off to a slow start , in part because it focused largely on recycling household waste .
But officials said the effort picked up as more businesses agreed -- or were required -- to recycle .
At least 20 % of the state ’s garbage comes from construction and demolition projects , and cities and counties are increasingly requiring builders to recycle their materials .

In Pasadena , which achieved a 62 % rate in 2005 , such an ordinance helped push the city over the top , said Ursula Schmidt , Pasadena ’s recycling program coordinator .
The law requires nearly all projects of 1,000 square feet or more to recycle , salvage or reuse at least 50 % of the waste material they generate .
The city provides builders and demolition crews with a list of places that will take their old concrete , wood and lumber .
Old doors and window frames can be donated to Habitat for Humanity , Schmidt said .
“ The reception has been very positive , ” she said .
“ That ’s tonnage that ’s being diverted to recycling . ”

Increasingly , Myers said , businesses are realizing the cost savings associated with recycling and that consumers want to patronize companies viewed as environmentally friendly .
“ They see the professional value of becoming a green business and recycling , ” he said .
Determining how much trash is being recycled is a delicate task .
The tonnage ca n’t be compared with 1989 levels because there were far fewer people in the state .
So the state uses a complex formula that takes into account economic and demographic factors to estimate how much trash would be dumped at landfills without recycling .

The state recently changed the formula , resulting in a slight increase in the amount of trash that officials estimated was recycled .
But Myers said that even without the change , California would still have 50 % .
With the modification , it got to 52 % .
Lawmakers approved the 1989 rules at a time when Californians feared they were running out of space for their trash .
As old dumps filled up and neighbors blocked new ones , counties closed their landfills to outsiders .
At the time , only 35 curbside recycling programs existed in the state .
The law was considered a national model that other states have since adopted .

There were widespread cheers in 1994 when the state reached the 25 % target .
But at the time , some blamed the drop in trash in part on the recession and questioned whether California would hit the 50 % target .
