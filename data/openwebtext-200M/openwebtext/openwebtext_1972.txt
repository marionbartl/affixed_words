Van der Waerden 's problem
In this series of articles I 'm going to analyze four versions of a program that I wrote around 1988 , and then another program that does the same thing that I wrote last month without referring to the 1988 code .
First I 'll explain what the programs are about .
Van der Waerden 's problem Color each of a row of dots red or blue , so that no three evenly - spaced dots are the same color .
( That is , if dots n and n+i are the same color , dot n+2i must be a different color . )
How many dots can you do ?
Well , clearly you can do four : R R B B .
And then you can add another red one on the end : R R B B R .
And then another that could be either red or blue : R R B B R B .
And then the next can be either color , say blue : R R B B R B B .
But now you are at the end , because if you make the next dot red , then dots 2 , 5 , and 8 will all be red ( R R B B R B B R ) , and if you make the next dot blue then dots 6 , 7 , and 8 will be blue ( R R B B R B B B ) .
But maybe we made a mistake somewhere earlier , and if the first seven dots were colored differently , we could have made a row of more than 7 that obeyed the no- three - evenly - spaced - dots requirement .
In fact , this is so : R R B B R R B B is an example .
But this is the end of the line .
Any coloring of a row of 9 dots contains three evenly - spaced dots of the same color .
( I do n't know a good way to prove this , short of an enumeration of all 512 possible arrangements of dots .
Well , of course it is sufficient to enumerate the 256 that begin with R , but that is pretty much the same thing . )
[ Addendum 20141208 :
In this post I give a simple argument that !!
V( 3,2 ) \le 9 !!.]
Van der Waerden 's theorem says that for any number of colors , say C , a sufficiently - long row of colored dots will contain n evenly - spaced same - color dots for any n .
Or , put another way , if you partition the integers into C disjoint classes , at least one class will contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions .
The proof of van der Waerden 's theorem works by taking C and n and producing a number V such that a row of V dots , colored with C colors , is guaranteed to contain n evenly - spaced dots of a single color .
The smallest such V is denoted V ( n , C ) .
For example V ( 3 , 2 ) is 9 , because any row of 9 dots of 2 colors is guaranteed to contain 3 evenly - spaced dots of the same color , but this is not true of such row of only 8 dots .
Van der Waerden 's theorem does not tell you what V( n , C ) actually is ; it provides only an upper bound .
And here 's the funny thing about van der Waerden 's theorem : the upper bound is incredibly bad .
For V ( 3 , 2 ) , the theorem tells you only that V ( 3 , 2 ) ≤ 325 .
That is , it tells you that any row of 325 red and blue dots must contain three evenly spaced dots of the same color .
This is true , but oh , so sloppy , since the same is true of any row of 9 dots .
For V ( 3 , 3 ) , the question is how many red , yellow , and blue dots do you need to guarantee three evenly - spaced same - colored dots .
The theorem helpfully suggests that : $ $ V ( 3,3 ) \leq 7 ( 2\cdot3^7+1 ) ( 2\cdot3 ^{7(2\cdot3^7+1 ) }+1 ) $ $ This is approximately 5.79·1014613 .
But what is the actual value of V ( 3 , 3 ) ?
It 's 27 .
Urgggh .
In fact , there is a rather large cash prize available to be won by the first person who comes up with a general upper bound for V ( n , C ) that is smaller than a tower of 2's of height n.
( That 's 222 ... with n 2's . )
In the rest of this series , a string which does not contain three evenly - spaced equal symbols will be called good , and one which does contain three such symbols will be called bad .
Then a special case of Van der Waerden 's theorem , with n=3 , says that , for any fixed number of symbols , all sufficiently long strings are bad .
In college I wanted to investigate this a little more .
In particular , I wanted to calculate V( 3 , 3 ) .
These days you can just look it up on Wikipedia , but in those benighted times such information was hard to come by .
I also wanted to construct the longest possible good strings , witnesses of length V ( 3 , 3 ) - 1 .
Although I did not know it at the time , V ( 3 , 3 ) = 27 , so a witness should have length 26 .
It turns out that there are exactly 48 witnesses of length 26 .
Here are the 1/6 of them that begin with RB or RRB : R R B B R R B Y B Y Y R Y R R B R B B Y R Y Y B Y B R R B B Y R R Y R Y B B Y Y B B Y R Y R R Y B B R R R R B Y B R R Y R Y B B Y Y B B Y R Y R R B Y B R R R B R R B R B Y Y B B Y Y B R B R R B Y Y R R Y R Y R B R B B R R Y B B Y B Y R R Y Y R R Y B Y B B Y R R B R B B R R Y B B Y B Y R R Y Y R R Y B Y B B Y B R B R B B Y B R R Y R Y Y B Y B B R B R Y Y R R Y Y R B Y Y B Y B R R B B R R B Y B Y Y B R R Y Y R Y R
The rest of the witnesses may be obtained by permuting the colors in these eight .
I wrote a series of C programs around 1988 to exhaustively search for good strings .
Last month I was in a meeting and I decided to write the program again for some reason .
I wrote a much better program .
This series of articles will compare the five programs .
I will post the first one tomorrow .
[ Addendum 20071003 : Here is part 1 . ] [ Addendum 20071005 : Here is part 2 . ] [ Addendum 20071005 : I made a mistake in the expression I gave for the upper bound on V ( 3,3 ) and left out a factor of 7 in the exponent on the last 3 .
I had said that the upper bound was around 102092 , but actually it is more like the seventh power of this .

Would you like to rip people off on eBay , with no risk ?
It 's easy !
Check it out !
There are some hardy perennials in the eBay scam department , some more complex than others , and then there 's the whole subsection of buyers who are trying to rip sellers off , but you 're looking for the Perfect Crime .
One that wo n't get you busted by eBay , or by PayPal , or by the cops or the Feds .
One that leaves a lot of people far away mildly angry at you , but none of them angry enough to catch a plane to your town and come after you with implements .
Excessive shipping fees are an old , and very popular , way of Making Money Fast on eBay .
You list some $ 100 item at $ 1 with $ 110 shipping , and you win two ways .
One : Idiots do n't notice the shipping fee and bid the item up to $ 75 anyway .
That 's all nice and legal - like , since the fee is right there on the page - let the buyer beware , and all that .
Two : eBay charges fees based on the final price of the item , not on the total amount owing including shipping , so your outrageous " handling " fee whistles right past the revenooers .
Personally , I do n't mind that very much .
I 've bought little computer bits from Hong Kong for 99 cents plus $ 15 postage ; heck , as far as I know , the unit wholesale price in China is under a buck .
There 's another simple way to pump up your eBay profits , though .
Even experienced eBay shoppers wo n't spot it until it's too late , and there ai n't nothin ' they can do about it , either .
Open a store that sells things to international buyers .
Now , offer for sale , say , a little box full of batteries and such , which weighs a couple of pounds including packaging material .
Then , when an international bidder wins such an auction , say that the box weighs , say , eight pounds .
They can't prove that it does n't , since they 're on the other side of the world .
They have to pay up , or get slammed as a deadbeat bidder .
And since the vast majority of sellers on eBay are honest about this stuff , maybe the buyer will just figure you use some kind of amazing triple - boxed aerogel - padded wooden crate packaging or something .
If the buyer asks for fancy superfast courier delivery , then you can really make out like a bandit with the weight overspecification scam .
But even if they only want plain USPS air mail , you can make , oh , $ US28.05 ( I 'm just guessing here , you understand ) by saying that a two pound 1.5 ounce box weighs eight pounds .
That 's not going to buy you an Escalade full of hos in the first week , of course , but it all adds up .
The reason this works so well is that eBay and PayPal provide no way to complain about it .
Their attitude is simple .
" You got the box ?
It contains what it 's meant to ?
Well , because the Complaint Policy applies only to the delivery of goods and does not apply to complaints about the attributes or quality of goods received , we are unable to reverse this transaction or issue a refund .
See ya ! "
The complaint , of course , is about the delivery of the goods - they were n't as described , in that they were six pounds lighter , and the delivery was thus too expensive - but there 's no way to complain about that .
The buyer can leave negative feedback , but so what - you can leave a response of your own saying " buyer never paid me , and he paid me with fake money , and anyway he does n't exist and is probably French , so there " .
So you can soak people for international postage , and walk away whistling .
As more astute readers may by now have figured out , someone pulled this scam on me the other week .
He 's currently running the usual routine - say you 'll have to " look into it " , ignore the next e-mail , then reply and say you do n't remember the dispute at all , and lather , rinse and repeat until the buyer loses all hope .
Actually , he just sent me another e-mail thanking me for a payment I did n't send for a Buy It Now item I did n't buy ; I do n't know what the heck 's up with that .
Do feel free to drop him a line and ask him for his side of the story .
All I want is my $ 28.05 back .
No more , no less .
It does n't really matter to me whether I get it or not ( if I could file an eBay / PayPal dispute , their resolution fee would eat almost all of it - but I 'd rather they had it than he did ) , but if those of us with a bit of leverage do n't use it on sellers like this , they 're just going to keep on making the world a less pleasant place for everyone .
And , after all , it 's your donated money we 're talking about here ( well , those of you who 've donated , anyway ) .
Maybe he'd like to share with you what he 's doing with it .
The Storm worm first appeared at the beginning of the year , hiding in e-mail attachments with the subject line : " 230 dead as storm batters Europe . "
Those who opened the attachment became infected , their computers joining an ever - growing botnet .
Although it 's most commonly called a worm , Storm is really more : a worm , a Trojan horse and a bot all rolled into one .
It 's also the most successful example we have of a new breed of worm , and I 've seen estimates that between 1 million and 50 million computers have been infected worldwide .
Old style worms – Sasser , Slammer , Nimda – were written by hackers looking for fame .
They spread as quickly as possible ( Slammer infected 75,000 computers in 10 minutes ) and garnered a lot of notice in the process .
The onslaught made it easier for security experts to detect the attack , but required a quick response by antivirus companies , sysadmins and users hoping to contain it .
Think of this type of worm as an infectious disease that shows immediate symptoms .
Worms like Storm are written by hackers looking for profit , and they 're different .
These worms spread more subtly , without making noise .
Symptoms do n't appear immediately , and an infected computer can sit dormant for a long time .
If it were a disease , it would be more like syphilis , whose symptoms may be mild or disappear altogether , but which will eventually come back years later and eat your brain .
Storm represents the future of malware .
Let 's look at its behavior :
Storm is patient .
A worm that attacks all the time is much easier to detect ; a worm that attacks and then shuts off for a while hides much more easily .
Storm is designed like an ant colony , with separation of duties .
Only a small fraction of infected hosts spread the worm .
A much smaller fraction are C2 : command - and - control servers .
The rest stand by to receive orders .
By only allowing a small number of hosts to propagate the virus and act as command - and - control servers , Storm is resilient against attack .
Even if those hosts shut down , the network remains largely intact , and other hosts can take over those duties .
Storm does n't cause any damage , or noticeable performance impact , to the hosts .
Like a parasite , it needs its host to be intact and healthy for its own survival .
This makes it harder to detect , because users and network administrators wo n't notice any abnormal behavior most of the time .
Rather than having all hosts communicate to a central server or set of servers , Storm uses a peer - to - peer network for C2 .
This makes the Storm botnet much harder to disable .
The most common way to disable a botnet is to shut down the centralized control point .
Storm does n't have a centralized control point , and thus can't be shut down that way .
This technique has other advantages , too .
Companies that monitor net activity can detect traffic anomalies with a centralized C2 point , but distributed C2 does n't show up as a spike .
Communications are much harder to detect .
One standard method of tracking root C2 servers is to put an infected host through a memory debugger and figure out where its orders are coming from .
This wo n't work with Storm :
An infected host may only know about a small fraction of infected hosts – 25 - 30 at a time – and those hosts are an unknown number of hops away from the primary C2 servers .
And even if a C2 node is taken down , the system does n't suffer .
Like a hydra with many heads , Storm 's C2 structure is distributed .
5 . Not only are the C2 servers distributed , but they also hide behind a constantly changing DNS technique called " fast flux . "
So even if a compromised host is isolated and debugged , and a C2 server identified through the cloud , by that time it may no longer be active .
6 . Storm 's payload – the code it uses to spread – morphs every 30 minutes or so , making typical AV ( antivirus ) and IDS techniques less effective .
7 . Storm 's delivery mechanism also changes regularly .
Storm started out as PDF spam , then its programmers started using e-cards and YouTube invites – anything to entice users to click on a phony link .
Storm also started posting blog - comment spam , again trying to trick viewers into clicking infected links .
While these sorts of things are pretty standard worm tactics , it does highlight how Storm is constantly shifting at all levels .
8 . The Storm e-mail also changes all the time , leveraging social engineering techniques .
There are always new subject lines and new enticing text : " A killer at 11 , he 's free at 21 and ... , " " football tracking program " on NFL opening weekend , and major storm and hurricane warnings .
Storm 's programmers are very good at preying on human nature .
9 . Last month , Storm began attacking anti-spam sites focused on identifying it – spamhaus.org , 419eater and so on – and the personal website of Joe Stewart , who published an analysis of Storm .
I am reminded of a basic theory of war :
Take out your enemy 's reconnaissance .
Or a basic theory of urban gangs and some governments :
Make sure others know not to mess with you .
Not that we really have any idea how to mess with Storm .
Storm has been around for almost a year , and the antivirus companies are pretty much powerless to do anything about it .
Inoculating infected machines individually is simply not going to work , and I can't imagine forcing ISPs to quarantine infected hosts .
A quarantine would n't work in any case : Storm 's creators could easily design another worm – and we know that users can't keep themselves from clicking on enticing attachments and links .
Redesigning the Microsoft Windows operating system would work , but that 's ridiculous to even suggest .
Creating a counterworm would make a great piece of fiction , but it 's a really bad idea in real life .
We simply do n't know how to stop Storm , except to find the people controlling it and arrest them .
Unfortunately we have no idea who controls Storm , although there 's some speculation that they 're Russian .
The programmers are obviously very skilled , and they 're continuing to work on their creation .
Oddly enough , Storm is n't doing much , so far , except gathering strength .
Aside from continuing to infect other Windows machines and attacking particular sites that are attacking it , Storm has only been implicated in some pump - and - dump stock scams .
There are rumors that Storm is leased out to other criminal groups .
Other than that , nothing .
Personally , I 'm worried about what Storm 's creators are planning for Phase II .

If anybody in the White House press room these days deserves a raise it 's Helen Thomas , who continues to be the only journalist in the room to consistently uphold the duties of the Fourth Estate .
Thank you Helen for keeping it real ever since landing a job at UPI all the way back in 1943 .
Transcript and commentary after the jump .
Helen Thomas :
No troops out from Iraq on his watch .
I know .
I 'm talking about all troops .
Dana Perino :
Well , 5700 troops will be home by the end of the year so that is some troops coming home .
The President said the troop levels are going to be made by the commanders on the ground and we are going to have to talk about return on success .
[ return ?
You mean like the return of the $ 3.5 trillion this war is going to cost since your ( mis ) administration promised that Iraq was " a country that can really finance its own reconstruction , and relatively soon . " ]
Helen Thomas :
Why should it be ?
Why do n't the American people have a say ?
Dana Perino : The American people have had a say .
They elected a President [ no , they did n't ] who is their commander in chief [ no , he is not ] and is making decisions based on what his commanders on the ground are telling him .
Helen Thomas : Do You think that was the vote from the American people ?
Dana Perino :
They elected a commander in chief [ not ! ] and the President is bringing home 5700 troops based on the recommendations of his commanders on the ground and based on return on success .
Hopefully in the future we can bring home more but it's going to depend on what Gen Petraeus reports and remember he will come back in March .
Helen Thomas :
Why should we depend on him ?
Dana Perino :
Because he is the commander on the ground , Helen .
He 's the one who is making sure that the situation is moving —
Helen Thomas :
You mean how many more people we kill ?
Dana Perino :
Helen , I find it really unfortunate that you use your front row position bestowed upon you by your colleagues to make such statements .
This is .
It is an honor and a privilege to be in the briefing room , and to suggest that we , at the United States , are killing innocent people is just absurd and very offensive .
Helen Thomas :
Do you know how many we have since the start of this war ?
Dana Perino :
How many ...
We are going after the enemy , Helen .
To the extent that any innocent Iraqis have been killed , we have expressed regret for it .
Helen Thomas :
Oh , regret .
It does n't bring back a life .

By and large , you 're a good bunch .
I enjoy providing you with the help you need when you call 911 .
You make my workdays ( and nights ) interesting .
However , from time to time , I notice a few small issues -- perhaps we can call them gaps in your knowledge ?
-- that make my job a little bit more frustrating .
Herein I offer a few simple pieces of advice to help make everyone 's emergency experience more satisfying .
1 .
When I ask you questions , please strive to tell me the full and complete truth .
There 's no badge or gun on me .
I 'm not going to get you in trouble for being high on drugs , but I really would like to know what exactly you did .
You 're not fooling anyone .
Likewise , I do n't care who you were having sex with , where , with what exciting accessories , and what your respective spouses will think , but if it 's contributed to your condition you should probably bring it up .
2 . I regret to inform you life is not like TV .
We do not run from the ambulance to the patient , we do not drive everyone to the hospital with lights and sirens , and most dead people stay dead despite our best efforts .
On the other hand , we are not just a fancy taxi ride .
I can start an IV ( in your arm or leg or neck ) , put a breathing tube down your throat , do an EKG to see if you 're having a heart attack , shock your heart if it's in a bad rhythm , and give about thirty different drugs for different medical conditions .
I can do more in the short term than most nurses .
I had to go to school for years .
Respect me and I 'll respect you .3 . In a related vein , if you could keep the drama to a bare minimum when your parent / sibling / spouse / friend / neighbor / coworker is hurt or sick , it will help everyone immensely .
I understand that the situation is upsetting , and I respect your feelings , but the best thing you can do for the patient , me , and even yourself is try to remain as calm as possible .
Shouting at me to do something or hurry up will not help .
Yelling in general is not , in fact , helpful .
Trying to keep out of our way , answering the questions we ask in a succinct and informative manner , and keeping your dramatic tendencies restrained are the absolute best thing you can do .4 .
However , if it is your young child who is badly hurt or critically ill , you are allowed all the drama you want .
5 .
If I am trying to help you and this makes you upset for some reason , please do not try and hit me .
I may not be as big and beefy as some of my coworkers .
I make up for it in dirty tricks .
If you do decide you 'd like to tussle , I 'd like to point out that you get ONE swing and it is never free .
I have giant zip - ties , sedatives , and a radio that can call a whole lot of cops , who are n't nearly as nice as me .
6 .
If you are driving and happen to see my big vehicle with all the blinkies and woo - woos , please get the hell out of the way .
Specifically , pull ALL THE WAY to the right of the street and STOP YOUR CAR .
You do n't know where I 'm going and when I 'll need to turn .
Unless you 're driving a Hummer I 've probably got more weight than you , and if you do something stupid that I can't avoid and we stack it up , things wo n't come out well for you .
Also I 'll lose my job .
7 .
Finally , exercise a modicum of common sense about when to call 911 .
Examples of when 911 is IS appropriate : Traffic accidents with injuries .
Chest pain .
Trouble breathing .
Lack of breathing .
Serious bleeding .
Unconsciousness .
Seizures .
Strokes .
Examples of when 911 may NOT be appropriate : Blisters .
Small cuts .
Dissatisfaction with your fast food order .
Needing a prescription refill .
Colds .
Minor problem ( sore leg , stomachache ) which has been going on for three days .
Bearing all that in mind , it 's a pleasure to serve you , and hopefully I wo n't be showing up at your doorstep , street corner , or car door anytime soon .

PR firm hired to flag and remove content that defamed SF
I Was Hired By SF to Delete PostingsReply to : comm-189951276 [ at ] craigslist.org Date : 2006-08-03 , 9:35 PM
PDTI work for a marketing company called Tomkins and Scott LLC .
We are not a typical marketing company .
Many of our campaigns involve what is known as " black PR " - a covert type of marketing campaign designed to influence and sway public opinion through covert means .
Although many of the techniques we use are not specifically in violation of the law , the fact that many of the clients we have give us money for black PR campaigns is .
I have decided to come out and tell the public about what my company is doing because I believe it is unethical and wrong .
Several years ago we received a contract from an agency with the city of San Francisco .
The purpose of this contract was to block the spread of any information which spreads a negative light on the city , or might adversely affect its burgeouning tourism industry or robust real estate market .
Members of the agency were concerned about community forums like Craigslist which are read by millions of people .
Our job at Tomkins and Scott , my job specifically , was to monitor Craigslist and summarily flag all postings which reflected negatively upon the city in any way .
I am going public with this because , after 3 years of being a censor for Craigslist , I believe what we are doing is totally wrong .
I can tell you that the agency of the city of San Francisco which contracted us is not the only government agency to be engaging in black PR operations .
If you knew the full list of agencies hired by us and sister firms you would be absolutely shocked .
If the average citizen understood the extent to which the information being presented to him or her is being filtered and skewed they would be up in arms immediately .
Information is power and the powers that be fully realize this , which is why they are willing to devote multi-million dollar budgets to covert campaigns like ours to distort and funnel public perceptions in ways that they consider appropriate .

ATLANTA ( CNN ) --
To a degree some may find hard to swallow , science is proving the old adage " you are what you eat . "
Americans eat corn in the form of chips but also consume it in the ubiquitous high fructose corn syrup .
Proteins and fats in your food are incorporated into your body and brain with potentially profound effects on your health and even your behavior .
Todd Dawson , a plant biologist at the University of California - Berkeley , can test a strand of hair to determine how much corn is in your diet or mine by looking for a form of carbon found in corn .
" We are what we eat with respect to carbon , for sure .
So if we eat a particular kind of food , and it has a particular kind of carbon in it , that 's recorded in us , in our tissues , in our hair , in our fingernails , in the muscles , " Dawson says .
Dawson tested a strand of my hair : 69 percent of the carbon came from corn .
This may seem high , but it is typical for Americans .
" America 's Killer Diet " Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains how we really are what we eat .

" We 're like corn chips walking because we really have a very , very large fraction of corn in our diets , and we actually can't help it because it's an additive in so many of the foods we find on the market shelves , " Dawson says .
Foods like ketchup , salad dressing , soda , cookies and chips all contain corn , usually high fructose corn syrup .
" I think where the danger comes in with corn is that much of the corn grown now in North America is going into making high fructose corn syrup , " Dawson says .
" So it 's not that corn per se is bad , but it 's the sweetener made from corn that gets into many of the foods that Americans are probably consuming too much of , and we now see that showing up as obesity and heart disease and potential for type 2 diabetes . "
To be fair , researchers say we 're eating too much of all kinds of sugar , not just high fructose corn syrup .
And the Corn Refiners Association points out that " many parts of the world , including Mexico and Europe , have rising rates of obesity and diabetes , despite having little or no high fructose corn syrup in their foods and drinks . "
Europeans eat a diet with far fewer processed foods and corn - based sweeteners .
Dawson tested his own hair after three months in Italy : 5 percent corn .
Americans also eat an extraordinary amount of soybean oil , another key ingredient in most processed foods .
Checking labels during a recent trip to the grocery store I found soybean oil in everything from tortilla chips to fruit syrup .
Dr. Joseph Hibbeln at the National Institutes of Health estimates that soybeans , usually in the form of oil , ­ account for an astonishing 10 percent of our total calories in the United States .
In recent years , a form of soybean oil has been the primary source of trans fats , which raises levels of LDL , or bad cholesterol , in our bodies and is thought to contribute to heart disease .
Our bodies need a balance of omega - 6 fatty acids like soybean oil and omega - 3 fatty acids like fish oil , Hibbeln says .
Over the last century , our diets have shifted almost completely to omega - 6 fatty acids .
" It 's quite likely that most of the diseases of modern civilization , major depression , heart disease and obesity are linked to the radical and dramatic shift in the composition of the fats in the food supply , " Hibbeln says .
Our brains are composed of fatty acids , and an absence of omega - 3 fatty acids can actually change our behavior , according to Hibbeln .
Hibbeln 's research suggests diets containing omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish reduce depression , aggression and anger , while improving mental well - being .
Quite literally , food for thought .

On the last morning of his life , Ian Luck phoned his wife from the hospital bed where , ten days earlier , he had been admitted for a gastric disorder .
" He was crying so much I could hardly understand him , " says Debra , his widow and mother of his son Ben , now nine .
" Ian said he had spent most of the night in agony - the nurses had forgotten his pain - killing injections .
" He was covered in his own vomit , he'd been sick on the floor , and when a nurse finally came , she told him he was ' disgusting ' . "
Scroll down for more ...
Debra will never forget that dreadful conversation in June 2002 .
Not least because just before he rang off , Ian said something so upsetting that it makes Debra cry to talk about it even today .
" Ian had been bedridden for almost the entire ten days he'd been in the hospital , " she says .
" But he said if he could walk , he would have gone to the window and jumped out .
He could n't bear being in that uncaring place for another day . "
Less than 24 hours later , Ian , aged just 37 , suffered two cardiac arrests and died .
A post -mortem showed that he had a ruptured oesophagus caused by continual vomiting .
This rare condition causes massive shock and infection , which would have put fatal strain on the heart .
According to medical experts , the most likely cause of Ian 's excessive vomiting was a bleeding stomach ulcer , a condition that doctors initially picked up and treated .
But when Ian 's symptoms returned , they failed to carry out a simple exploratory process to diagnose further bleeding , which could have been treated with drugs or surgery .
As if his death was n't tragedy enough , Debra is haunted by the misery , pain and squalor he endured at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow , Essex , during the ten days before he died .
" An animal would have been treated with more compassion , " says Debra .
" No one wanted to help us .
Every time we asked for pain relief , or to see a doctor , we were told to wait , or that we did n't know what we were talking about . "
The final day of Ian 's life was spent in misery and humiliation on a geriatric ward , with uncaring nurses and doctors who failed to recognise that he was dying .
He had been shunted there from his surgical ward , having been told his bed was needed for a more urgent surgical patient .
" That day was a nightmare , " says Debra , now 43 .
" I knew he was dying , his usual happy character had vanished , he was frightened and very low .
He looked grey and clammy , his stomach was swollen , he was hallucinating and there was vomit all over his T - shirt .
" As fast as I changed him he was sick again .
The nurses were not interested in helping me .
" At one point , an old man fell out of the bed next to us and lay there , crying for help .
When I ran up to the nurses ' station to tell them , they said : ' Just leave him . '
" I was n't strong enough to help him by myself and it was 15 minutes before anyone came to lift him back into bed .
He lay there calling for help next to my dying husband .
" All the time I could hear the nurses chatting and laughing .
It was frustrating , terrifying , horrible .
" This was a British hospital in the 21st century , yet it felt as if we were in the Dark Ages . "
A fortnight ago , after nearly five years of legal wrangling , the Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust agreed to pay £ 200,000 damages to Debra , and a further £ 25,000 to her son , Ben , without accepting liability .
Although she acknowledges the money will help make Ben 's future secure , Debra is disappointed .
" No one has been punished or sacked , " she says .
" No one from the hospital has offered to meet me and tell me how things went so wrong , let alone offered an apology .
" For all I know , the same appalling standard of care is still acceptable in that hospital .
If that is the case , then there will be more unnecessary deaths . "
Sadly ,
Ian 's story of uncaring treatment is one that is all too common in the NHS .
Scroll down for more ...
While many nurses and other medical professionals rightly take great pride in the high standards of care they offer patients , too often we hear of similar stories of poor nursing .
The recent scandal surrounding the lack of hygiene at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals - which led to 90 deaths from the superbug C. difficile between 2004 and 2005 - may have grabbed the headlines , but similarly shocking cases elsewhere in the country have surfaced with depressing regularity .
" Although Ian 's story sounds dreadful , unfortunately it is not an isolated incident , " says Vanessa Bourne , of The Patients ' Association .
" There has been a profound change in the nursing profession .
Nurses no longer seem to want to care , or do the most basic forms of nursing .
" Patients often contact us about incidents where they have been left with buzzers unanswered or in dirty bed linen .
When they have broached the subject , they have been told off like naughty children . "
Debra is emphatic about the " care " her husband received .
" I actually feel that Ian was murdered , " she says .
" He died because people could n't be bothered to do their job properly . "
Ian had suffered from gastric problems for two years .
He was admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital several times in the first half of 2002 to replace the fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea .
Ian underwent tests and was diagnosed with inflammation of the intestines and stomach , and then with Type 1 diabetes which , it was thought , could be exacerbating his problems .
Finally , after a particularly serious bout of vomiting on June 12 , 2002 , and weak and unable to eat , Ian was again admitted to hospital .
This time he had an endoscopy , where a tube with a camera on the end is passed down the throat into the stomach .
" The doctor spotted he had quite a large duodenal ulcer , about 3 cm in diameter , which he said might have caused the vomiting , " explains Debra .
" After six days in hospital Ian 's condition slightly improved and , hydrated , he was allowed home . "
The most common cause of a duodenal ulcer is an infection , which usually clears up with antiobiotics , but these did n't work , so the doctor arranged another endoscopy .
On the morning of his appointment on June 20 , Ben , who suffers from asthma , was wheezy , and Ian told Debra to stay with their son .
He kissed them goodbye and headed to the hospital .
It was the last time father and son would see each other .
When Debra rang the hospital that afternoon , she was told Ian 's ulcer had bled during the endoscopy and he'd had to undergo emergency treatment .
" The surgeon told us that if left untreated , a bleeding ulcer was lifethreatening .
But although Ian and I were frightened , he reassured us that we were on the surgical ward , right next to theatre , and if the bleeding started again we were in the best possible place to get it fixed . "
But the doctor 's optimism was not reflected in the remainder of Ian 's care .
From the day he was admitted to the day he died , Debra feels she struggled to get him even the most basic level of nursing care .
" He was vomiting ten times an hour , and there were bowls around his bed to catch it , " says Debra .
" Often they were n't emptied for more than an hour and they smelled awful .
The first time that happened I found a nurse and asked if she could empty them .
When she said she was too busy , I offered to do it myself .
" What I 've learned since is that his urine and vomit should have been monitored continuously .
Both were vital to working out just how ill he was and whether he would need further investigations .
The fact that no one kept a record probably added to his lack of correct treatment . "
Debra found herself doing other basic nursing tasks , too .
" Many times the vomiting came on so suddenly that Ian would vomit over his pillow , bed or T - shirt .
It was often ages before someone came along to clean him up .
I would arrive in the morning and he would have dried stains on his pillow or a filthy T - shirt .
" I started bringing in clean pillow cases and changing them myself .
I would leave him at night feeling guilty because I knew he would n't be looked after until I came back .
" The next day I would walk up the stairs to his ward with my stomach in knots , terrified of what I 'd find next . "
And all the time , Ian was deteriorating before her eyes .
" In the last two days of his life I saw only junior doctors .
After four days in hospital he was so weak and he'd stopped eating or drinking because he felt too ill .
If he did try to sip water , it would come back up straightaway , " she says .
The hospital continued to carry out tests .
Ian had a CT scan , which indicated looped intestines , although later tests discounted this as a cause of his pain .
One junior doctor casually mentioned to the horrified couple that Ian might have pancreatic cancer , although this was never mentioned again .
Another junior doctor tried to put a tube down Ian 's throat to drain his stomach but gave up after 20 minutes of Ian retching .
By June 27 , Ian was receiving six injections of the painkiller penthidine , plus three injections of Maxalon , an anti-sickness drug , each day .
Yet despite the battery of tests , there was no definitive diagnosis about whether the ulcer was still bleeding or if his symptoms were caused by something else .
" I made two appointments to speak to a consultant during the course of those ten days , " she says , " and both times he did n't turn up .
When I tried to talk to junior doctors they were either too busy or did n't know enough .
" We had health insurance so I rang our local private hospital and they agreed to take him , but the Princess Alexandra would n't release him , saying he was n't fit enough to travel .
I felt at a loss about what to do next .
" I really tried , " she says plaintively .
" But I should n't have let them brush me off ; I should have shouted until he got the help he needed . "
Indeed , according to Vanessa Bourne , making as much fuss as possible is exactly what you should do if you feel that your care is inadequate .
" You have to stand up for yourself , " she says .
" A useful weapon is to state that you are keeping notes of everything .
Speak to the sister , then the senior doctor .
If they do n't help , demand to see the chairman . "
During the night of Friday , June 28 , Ian was seen by a junior doctor who was sufficiently alarmed about his condition to request an examination by a consultant with a view to carrying out a laparotomy - an exploratory stomach operation .
During the night the consultant did visit Ian .
He requested more fluids but failed to order the laparotomy .
Independent experts later found that had this procedure gone ahead , it probably would have saved Ian 's life .
The next morning another junior doctor was sufficiently concerned to call for another consultant review .
This was never done .
" When I arrived on Saturday morning Ian looked dreadful , " remembers Debra .
" He was grey and clammy .
I stayed for the rest of the day , nursing him , and went home scared . "
On Sunday morning , after his emotional call to Debra , Ian was seen by the on - call physician , a geriatric consultant .
After considering the notes of the two junior doctors , she found nothing that warranted immediate action .
" When we arrived at the hospital around mid-morning Ian was lapsing in and out of consciousness , " said Debra .
" He was covered in vomit and had wet himself .
I changed him , but when I asked for clean surgical stockings the nurse said there were none left in his size .
" I could n't change his T - shirt without help , because of his drip , but I was told by the nurse she was too busy and to leave him dirty . "
As night fell , Ian told Debra to go home to Ben .
" I was frightened to leave him , but he said he'd hang on until the morning ward round and a doctor would help him .
I left in tears . "
An hour later , Ian was struggling to breathe .
A junior doctor suspected a collapsed lung and , while undergoing a chest X -ray , Ian suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated .
However , by the time Debra and other family members arrived , Ian had suffered another arrest and died .
" My father was shouting at the staff saying they had murdered Ian , " says Debra .
" I asked to see a doctor who had been with him when he died , but no one came . "
Two days after Ian died , Debra told four - year - old Ben that his father had gone to Heaven .
He was inconsolable and later saw a psychologist to help him cope with his grief .
A spokesperson for the Princess Alexandra NHS Trust said : " The trust looked into Mrs Luck 's complaint thoroughly in 2002 and we have taken on board many of the issues raised , particularly with regard to communication between doctors , nurses and patients .
" Since then we have introduced training both for nursing and medical staff and we continue to strive to improve in this area .
" The trust offers Mrs Luck and her family best wishes for the future . "
This is little consolation to Debra .
" If I had that time again I would not let the nurses fob me off , or try to tell me that it was normal to leave patients in filth .
" I would n't allow the doctors to make me feel I was being a nuisance .
I would raise the roof until my loved one got the help he needed and I 'd advise anyone else to do the same .
" Ian was a kind man who enjoyed helping other people .
It is a tragedy that when he needed help , in the very place he should have got it , there was none . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. air traffic controllers used personal cell phones to sort out flights on Tuesday when a major communications systems failure in Memphis knocked out radio and radar , officials said .
The three - hour midday disruption in a telephone line prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to clear all commercial flights over an eight - state area in the Southeast and Midwest while the problem was fixed , the agency said .
The FAA said it did not know why the communications line failed , but there was no evidence of sabotage .
Three long - range radar units were knocked out as well as radio communications .
Controllers used personal cell phones to call other air traffic control centers that still had radio contact with planes that they could not reach , a union official said .
“ They had to use personal cell phones to talk to other air traffic control facilities about specific flights that they could not communicate with themselves , ” said Doug Church , a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association .
There were 150 planes in the affected air space at the time of the outage around 12:30 p.m. EDT , the FAA said .
The agency could not say how many aircraft were affected , but the air traffic controllers union said the number exceeded 1,000 .
The regional air traffic control center in Memphis monitors flights passing between 40 miles and 250 miles of Memphis .
AGING SYSTEM
The outage was the latest in a string of embarrassing air traffic equipment and other problems this past spring and summer that spotlighted the aging system that handles thousands of flights daily .
On Tuesday , jetliners planning to fly through the area were grounded at airports around the country , and those already in the air were diverted .
Air traffic controllers said there were delays in Atlanta , Dallas and Charlotte -- hubs for American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and US Airways .
Delta said it canceled 10 flights , while American canceled 88 flights .
US Airways reported eight cancellations .
FedEx Corp. , which is based in Memphis , said it diverted a small number of flights .
But the cargo giant ’s air operations occur mainly at night , so it did not expect any additional problems .
Flights had resumed at Memphis International Airport and communications were restored at the regional air traffic control center , an airport spokesman said .
ALL - TIME WINGNUTTIEST BLOG POST CONTEST … .
While the rest of the blogosphere concerns itself with the worthy task of choosing the all - time best blog posts , I ’m keeping my focus where it belongs : on the all - time worst blog posts .
And thanks to help from my commenters , plus commenters over at FDL and John Cole ’s place , we now have an official list of nominees .
A note on methodology : Several prose stylings that seem like they ought to be on the ballot missed out because intensive research by the PA staff determined that they were n’t actually blog posts .
“ Objectively pro-terrorist ” deserves recognition , for example , but it came from a Michael Kelly column , not a blog post .
Ditto for “ The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead — and may well mount a fifth column , ” which Andrew Sullivan wrote for the Sunday Times , not his blog .
Or John Derbyshire ’s musings on women over the age of 20 .
And “ Lucky Duckies ” was a Wall Street Journal editorial .
Since this contest is all about blog wingnuttery , these contenders were sadly but firmly disqualified .
But why focus on the all - time worst in the wingnut blogosphere anyway ?
Is n’t that mean ?
What ’s driving this besides sheer bloody - mindedness ?
History , that ’s what .
A century from now , even the very best blog posts will be long forgotten .
Let ’s face it : they are n’t that good .
But bad blog posts will still be every bit as bad as they were on the day they were spawned .
They ’ll endure .
So really , we ’re doing this for the children .
And the grandchildren .
The fourteen finalists for the worst , most embarrassing , most risible wingnut blog posts of all time are listed below .
You can vote for up to five .
So take a trip down memory lane and then vote for your favorites .
Remember :
It ’s your civic duty .
UPDATE : Voting is now finished .
Thanks to one and all .
The final five winners are announced here .
If you 're good at what you do , you can judge when to employ which design patterns .
And , on the other hand , when employing said design patterns would make the means too complicated to justify the ends .
Dale M. sent in an example of this sort of overcomplication :
Interface : 10 lines ( 4 Lines Of Code w/o comments )
core /src/com/.../enterprise/util/codetable/IYesNo.java
Factory : 141 lines ( 69 LOC )
core /src/com/.../enterprise/util/codetable/YesNoFactory.java
( Note that the factory includes an inner class called YesNoInstanceType )

core - restricted/src/com/.../enterprise/util/codetable/restricted/YesNo.java
Concrete class : 87 lines ( 61 LOC )
core - restricted/src/com/.../enterprise/util/codetable/restricted/nonpersistent/YesNo.java
This is a total of 151 lines of code .
For a class that has a value of either yes or no .
I 'll have to double check my java documentation , but I 'm fairly certain that java has a built - in datatype for storing boolean values .
Now if only I could remember what the boolean type is called in java ... oh yeah .
" Boolean . "
Seeing the word " enterprise " in the file paths speaks volumes .
That was n't all Dale gave us , though .
Here 's a usage example :
YesNoFactory.getFactoryInstance ( ) .
YES.getDescription ().equals ( array [ 0].toUpperCase ( ) ) ;
I can't imagine a single scenario in which creating an instance of the YesNo class using the YesNoFactory 's " getFactoryInstance " method is simpler than using a boolean or an enum , and this is exactly the kind of thing that will trip up new developers that have to maintain ridiculously ( and unnecessarily ) complex code .
TUUSULA , Finland ( Reuters ) - Seven children were killed when a fellow pupil opened fire at a school in southern Finland on Wednesday , hours after a video was posted on YouTube predicting a massacre there .
An image from YouTube shows what is believed to be the teenaged gunman who opened fire at a school in southern Finland November 7 , 2007 .
At least eight people were killed in the shooting on Wednesday .
It was not clear if the gunman was among the dead .
The YouTube video , set to a hard - driving song called " Stray Bullet " shows as red - tinted picture of a man pointing a handgun to the camera .

The school principal also died .
The gunman , who had walked through Jokela High School firing into classroom after classroom with a . 22 - caliber handgun , is in hospital after wounding himself in the head .
“ Five boys , two girls and one adult woman were killed , ” police chief Matti Tohkanen told a news conference .
He later identified the woman as the principal of the school in Tuusula municipality , a town of 35,000 some 60 km ( 40 miles ) from Helsinki .
The YouTube video , set to a hard - driving song called “ Stray Bullet , ” shows a still photo of a low building that appears to be Jokela High School .
The photo breaks apart to reveal a red - tinted picture of a man pointing a handgun at the camera .
“ He ( the gunman ) was moving systematically through the school hallways , knocking on the doors and shooting through the doors , ” said Kim Kiuru , who was teaching a grade 8 class when the shooting began .
“ It felt unreal , a pupil I have taught myself was running towards me , screaming , a pistol in his hand . ”
Police said the gun used in the massacre was legal and registered to the gunman on October 19 .
“ When police arrived there was complete chaos , pupils were jumping out of the building through the windows , ” said inspector Timo Leppala , head of the field investigation .
Outside a church community building close by , a mother waited as a Red Cross bus pulled up outside .
She watched children stepping off the bus and burst into tears when , through a window , she spotted her child , unharmed .
STURMGEIST89 POSTING
The YouTube video , entitled “ Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007 , ” was posted by a user called Sturmgeist89 .
“ I am prepared to fight and die for my cause , ” read a posting by a user of the same name .
“ I , as a natural selector , will eliminate all who I see unfit , disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection . ” “ Sturmgeist ” means storm spirit in German .
Lyrics to various KMFDM songs , including “ Stray Bullet , ” were posted on a web site maintained by Eric Harris , one of the gunmen in the 1999 Columbine High School massacre .
Hours after the shooting , the user ’s account was suspended .
The school serves some 500 middle and high school students .
“ This is a peaceful place , nothing like this has happened and nothing like this is to be expected either , ” Tuusula mayor Hannu Joensivu said .
Despite having the world ’s third - largest per capita handgun ownership , violent incidents are rare at Finnish schools .
According to Finnish media , there have been four stabbings at schools since 1999 .
None of these caused fatalities .
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen told reporters the shooting was an “ extremely sad event . ”
The last major attack in the country occurred in 2002 when a young man killed including himself and six others in a bomb blast at a shopping mall in Helsinki .
The US military on Tuesday announced the deaths of five more soldiers and one sailor , making 2007 the deadliest year for US troops despite a recent downturn , according to an Associated Press count .
At least 853 American military personnel have died in Iraq so far this year — the highest annual toll since the war began in March 2003 , according to AP figures .
Opinion
An ominous victory Yoram Schweitzer Prospect of ‘ Iraq alumni ’ terror attacks worldwide could undermine US victory in Iraq
An ominous victory
Five US soldiers were killed Monday in two separate roadside bomb attacks , said Rear Adm.
Gregory Smith , director of the Multi-National Force - Iraq 's communications division .
" We lost five soldiers yesterday in two unfortunate incidents , both involving IEDs , " Smith told reporters in Baghdad 's heavily - guarded Green Zone .
Later , the military said four of the soldiers died after an explosion near their vehicle in Kirkuk province , and one was killed in Anbar .
In a third statement , American forces said a sailor died of injuries from an explosion Monday in Salahuddin province , north of Baghdad .
With nearly two months left in the year , the US toll has already surpassed that of 2004 , when 850 troops died — mostly in larger , more conventional battles like the campaign to cleanse Fallujah of Sunni militants in November , and US clashes with Shiite militiamen in the sect 's holy city of Najaf in August .
But the American military in Iraq reached its highest troop levels in Iraq this year — 165,000 .
Moreover , the military 's decision to send soldiers out of large bases and into Iraqi communities means more troops have seen more " contact with enemy forces " than ever before , said Maj .
Winfield Danielson , a US military spokesman in Baghdad .
" It 's due to the troop surge , which allowed us to go into areas that were previously safe havens for insurgents , " Danielson told the AP on Sunday .
" Having more soldiers , and having them out in the communities , certainly contributes to our casualties . "
' Iran appears to be keeping its promise '
Meanwhile , the US said it planned to release nine Iranian prisoners in the coming days , including two captured when US troops stormed an Iranian government office in Irbil last January .
The office was shut after the raid , but it reopened as an Iranian consulate on Tuesday , Iraqi and Iranian officials said .
A military spokesman said Iran appears to have kept its promise to stop the flow into Iraq of bomb - making materials and other weaponry that Washington says has inflamed insurgent violence and caused many American troop casualties .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last week that Iran had made such assurances to the Iraqi government .
" It 's our best judgment that these particular EFPs ... in recent large cache finds do not appear to have arrived here in Iraq after those pledges were made , " Rear Adm .
Gregory Smith , director of the Multi-National Force - Iraq 's communications division , told reporters Tuesday .
Kurdish rebels released another Iranian soldier captured two months ago in northern Iraq .
AP Television News showed the soldier being handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the Qandeel mountains near the town of Ilan Shahir .
Among the weapons Washington has accused Iran of supplying to Iraqi insurgents are EFPs , or explosively formed projectiles .
They fire a slug of molten metal capable of penetrating even the most heavily armored military vehicles , and thus are more deadly than other roadside bombs .
The No. 2 US commander in Iraq , Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno , said last week that there had been a sharp decline in the number of EFPs found in Iraq in the last three months .
At the time , he and Gates both said it was too early to tell whether the trend would hold , and whether it could be attributed to action by Iranian authorities .
Iran publicly denies that it has sent weapons to Shiite militias in Iraq .
Also Tuesday , the US military said Iraqi troops had discovered 22 bodies in a mass grave northwest of Baghdad over the weekend .
The bodies were found during a joint operation Saturday .
It was the second mass grave found in the area in less than a month .
After the discovery , US and Iraqi forces launched an operation Sunday , including ground raids and air assaults targeting al - Qaeda in the area , the US statement said .
About 30 suspects were detained , it said .
Two car bomb facilities and a number of weapons caches also were found , it added .
Iraqi officials were trying to identify the bodies and notify families .

For our latest mission , over 50 redheads rode the subway together and protested a Manhattan Wendy ’s for their “ racist logo . ”
Enjoy the videos first and then go behind the scenes with our mission report , photos , and more videos below .
Agent Fountain organizes the group photo
Agent McCarthy stopped me on the street a couple of months ago with an awesome suggestion .
He proposed , “ What would it be like if you got onto a subway car and slowly realized that everyone on the car but you had red hair ? ”
Redheads only make up 1 % of the world ’s population , and with the racial diversity of the New York subway system , it ’s probably an even smaller percentage .
We had no idea how many redheads we could actually find .
I sent an email to our New York agents list and was amazed at the response .
We had tons of redheads in our ranks , and everyone else seemed to have a friend to forward it on to .
Agent Kula briefs the crowd
One of the most fun parts of the mission for me was walking to the meeting point in Central Park and trying to figure out who was a part of the group .
Everyone was curiously checking out everyone else ’s hair as they approached , trying to make sure they were in the right spot .
About 50 redheads showed up , and Agent Kula ( Improv Everywhere ’s most senior redhead ) briefed the crowd on the day ’s activities .
The subway ride was first on our agenda .
Of course , we ’d be taking the 1 train , as it ’s on the red line .
The redheads acted as if they did n’t know each other and went about their normal subway routine .
The youngest redheaded agent
The 1 train goes above ground for a few stops in upper Manhattan , which could have been dangerous for our redheads had a very enterprising salesmen not have arrived to hawk $ 1 squirts of sunscreen .
Agent Rodgers makes a sale
The vendor was played by Agent Rodgers , reprising his “ subway entrepreneur ” role from No Pants 2k6 when he sold dozens of pants to half - naked riders .
That kid always seems to have what ’s in demand .
Agent Rodgers ’07
Agent Rodgers ’06
The 30 , 45 , and 50 SPF squirts of sunscreen sold very well .
Folks on the train giggled and whispered to each other as riders began applying sunscreen .
At 168th street , the redheads got out and rode the train back downtown .
It was fun to see the mass of red hair on the platform .
We even manged to have one Asian redhead
After the ride we met back up in the park and regrouped for our Wendy ’s protest .
We would be protesting Wendy ’s racist mascot that was an unfair , stereotypical representation of redheaded people .
It was time for the National Association for the Advancement of Redhaired People to take a stand against this offensive logo .
Several agents brought some awesome signs , and a few more brought supplies to create some on the spot .
“ You want lies with that ? ”
We walked a few blocks to the Wendy ’s on 8th and 55th and set up our peaceful protest along the sidewalk , careful not to block foot traffic .
Agent Kula led the first few chants , pumping the crowd of angry ( perhaps fiery , even ) redheads .
Throughout the day there were some really hilarious chants .
Some of my favorites :
-“ Biggie Size Bigotry ! ”
-“ Value Menu Us ! ”
-“ Fiery Burgers Not Fiery Redheads ! ”
-“ Give Wendy Some Pigment ! ”
-“ Where ’s Our Beef ? In Your Logo ! ”
-“ We Want Frosties , But At What Costies ?!? ”
We were right in front of a bus stop , which worked out well .
Every few minutes a new bus would arrive and the driver would gawk at us .
We got great reactions from folks walking by .
Crowds gathered on either side of us and across the street .
Most folks laughed and snapped a camera phone photo ; a few even called friends to tell them what was going on .
Some tried to get to the bottom of it , but our agents played it straight and insisted they were legitimately upset with Wendy’s .
Some younger onlookers …
… and some older ones
Our favorite crowder member was a bald man who after exiting the Wendy ’s looked confused for a few minutes trying to figure out what was going on .
When he put it together , he immediately started dancing , jumping , and screaming , “ Wendy ’s logo has got to go ” with us and shouting , “ I ai n’t go no hair ! ”
He was awesome .
Our second favorite person was an older woman with red hair who emerged from the Wendy’s .
She smiled and gave the crowd a fist pump , which elicited enormous cheers of solidarity .
One of our own agents got a much nastier greeting when he emerged a bit later with a Wendy ’s cup in his hand .
We had planned ahead that he’d be booed and called a “ scab ” for eating Wendy ’s food .
“ Scab !!!! ”
The Wendy ’s staff never came outside to address us .
I went inside to capture some footage early in the mission ( which you can see in the main video at the top of this page . )
Most of the employees I encountered were laughing and trying to figure it all out .
An employee and two customers look out from the 2nd floor window
We got plenty of funny looks from customers as they ate as well .
The manager came to the window at one point and stared for awhile , but he opted not to come out and give Wendy ’s official stance on their racist mascot .
After about a half hour we packed it up and headed out .
As we got back to the meeting point we realized a guy had followed us the whole way .
He had two giant bags of cheeseburgers for us .
He claimed he did n’t work at Wendy ’s and that he just thought we looked hungry .
I guess it was just a nice guy ?
Anyway , once the mission was over the redheads very much enjoyed the free food .
Mission Accomplished

Graham Goring , renown remaker and host of The Arsecast , has finally finished possibly the last remake of his career .
A remake of the C64 game Wizball !
You can expect Graham ’s usual high level of polish and even higher level of hardware accelerated effects .
Seriously , this man ’s love of particles borders on criminal .
The release of Wizball ( alledgedly ) marks the end of Graham ’s remaking career , but also the beginning of his rise to indie gaming superstardom .
I know he ’s already got some rad projects lined up … but I ’m still anxious to hear what he announces .
Yay Graham !
Download the remake here .
UPDATE : A new version has been uploaded that fixes some issues with the first release .
Bryce Carrier ’s cellphone rang at 3 a.m. : Help !
The fire is almost to my house .
Carrier hopped into his heavy - duty red Ford F - 550 and sped to northeast Poway , dodging fallen eucalyptus and heading straight toward the wind - whipped blaze .
He arrived to find flames marching up an embankment toward the multimillion - dollar home .
Yanking out the hose in the back of his truck , he began applying Phos - Chek fire retardant along the perimeter of the property , the shrubs and the roof .
When the flames hit the milky white liquid , they stopped .
Another home saved .
Carrier is a certified firefighter , but he does n’t work for a government agency .
He ’s an employee of Firebreak Spray Systems , which partners with the insurance company American International Group Inc. to protect the mansions of the moneyed .
AIG ’s Wildfire Protection Unit , part of its Private Client Group , is offered only to homeowners in California ’s most affluent ZIP Codes -- including Malibu , Beverly Hills , Newport Beach and Menlo Park -- and a dozen Colorado resort communities .
It covers about 2,000 policyholders , who pay premiums of at least $ 10,000 a year and own homes with a value of at least $ 1 million .
Carrier and his 15 crew mates sprayed retardant on and around more than 160 homes in Malibu , Lake Arrowhead and the hardest - hit areas of Orange and San Diego counties this week .
They claim to have saved a dozen homes .
Jim Moore of Malibu , for one , was grateful for their services .
“ Just picture it , ” said Moore , whose house was sprayed by Firebreak early Monday .
“ Here you are in that raging wildfire .
Smoke everywhere .
Flames everywhere .
Plumes of smoke coming up over the hills .
Here ’s a couple guys showing up in what looks like a firetruck who are experts trained in fighting wildfire and they ’re there specifically to protect your home .
. . .
It was really , really comforting . ”
For the insurance company , it ’s also savvy business .
One saved home covers the cost of the program .
“ We are saving homes that may average $ 3 million to $ 5 million , ” said Firebreak Chief Executive Jim Aamodt .
“ Those are the hard dollars , money the insurance company is not paying out . ”
AIG says the service is not a replacement for public fire departments ; after all , the insurer did lose some houses .
But like an air bag in a car crash , the company says , it ’s better than nothing .
Others say that it ’s just another way for the wealthy to buy their way around cash - strapped , understaffed public services .
Firefighters across the region have complained this week that they simply did not have enough trucks , helicopters and airplanes .
“ What we have is a dangerous confluence of events : underfunded states , increasingly inefficient disaster response , a loss of faith in the public sphere . . . and a growing part of the economy that sees disaster as a promising new market , ” said Naomi Klein , whose new book , “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , ” looks at , among other things , the response to Hurricane Katrina .
Klein said AIG offers a glimpse into the future of what she calls “ disaster apartheid , ” in which the affluent are better equipped for emergencies .
“ You ca n’t fault businesses for seeing an opportunity , and you ca n’t fault individuals for wanting to protect their property .
Pretty much anyone who could afford it would want it , ” she said .
“ But survival should n’t be a luxury item . ”
AIG said it did apply fire retardant to homes of some standard policyholders if they happened to be nearby , because it made financial sense .
Though AIG is the only insurance company to provide emergency fire response teams , there are other fire prevention businesses that cater to the elite .
As blazes raged in Malibu this week , camera crews captured a groundskeeper at movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg ’s mansion coating the building with foam using a system installed several years ago .
Firebreak sells similar retardant systems apart from its work with AIG and says sales have tripled over last year .
Installation costs about $ 10,000 for a device that can be activated remotely or deployed automatically when sensors detect fire approaching .
More - frugal homeowners can spend $ 1,000 to buy Phos - Chek , the same retardant used by the U.S. Forest Service but without the red coloring .
The concentrate is mixed with water and applied with a hose .
AIG ’s private fire service approach is n’t exactly new .
In the 1800s , many firefighters worked for for - profit companies and would battle blazes only for those with insurance .
Insurers in places including Richmond , Va. , gave their clients plaques to alert crews that their homes had coverage .
AIG began its Private Client Group insurance in 2000 , and it has since grown to almost $ 1 billion in gross premiums .
Besides specialty fire protection , in Florida AIG offers a similar service for hurricanes , dispatching pre-disaster consultants to assess shutter protection , property storage and landscaping .
Home restoration teams head in after storms to help with immediate repairs , even before claims are reported , said Todd Triano , vice president of loss prevention for AIG Private Client Group .
On Thursday , AIG and Firebreak teams fanned out across San Diego County , returning to homes they had sprayed to assess saves and losses .
On one block of Zumaque Street in Rancho Santa Fe , with homes all around burnt to the ground , Aamodt surveyed two surviving homes bounded by blackened mountainside and singed trees .
“ This is a classic use of Phos - Chek , ” Aamodt said , pointing at shrubs that were half blackened and half green .
“ It chars at the edge of the Phos - Chek line and then it stops .
. . .
This is a great feeling .
We ’re ecstatic . ”
One of the houses is owned by Kerry Roland , who returned home Thursday feeling lucky .
Three houses to the south and one just north were gone .
Roland said she believed a number of factors contributed to the save , including firefighters who had put out a flare - up on her roof before AIG arrived ; sprinklers she kept running ; and the location of her house , on the crest of the ridge .
“ When I packed up and left on Monday morning , I did n’t think our home would survive , ” said Roland , 51 .
“ It ’s amazing , is n’t it ?
My property and the one opposite me , we both had fire retardant used . ”
Local firefighters have mixed opinions about the value of services such as Firebreak .
Capt .
Dan Froelich of San Diego Fire and Rescue said he was concerned what could happen if private companies sent undertrained , ill - equipped crews into fire zones and the crews got trapped and needed rescuing .
But Maurice Luque , a spokesman for San Diego Fire and Rescue , said fire retardant could be effective .
“ The stuff works really well , ” he said , noting that private companies are used more in eastern San Diego County .
In such places , he said , there are not many fire agencies and response times can be long .
“ The residents have to fend for themselves in these mountain or remote areas , ” he said .

IronKey : Encrypted Flash Drive ( Review )
Last month we wrote a small piece about IronKey ’s Hardware Encrypted Flash Drive , which can self - destruct .
The folks over at IronKey were kind enough to provide us with sample unit for review .
For those of you that do n’t know what the IronKey is , it ’s pretty much one of the safest flash drives available on the market .
And yes , it does “ self - destruct ” its insides rendering it completely useless when someone tries to steal your data .
Right off the bat , we ’ve got to say that we ’re quite impressed .
Just to begin with , the IronKey required no additional software to run .
( No issues with our Windows XP or Vista machines . )
Main IronKey Features :
Military - Grade Encryption
Self - Destruct Sequence
Secured Online Back Up
Stealth Browsing ( Tor )
Password Management
Water / Tamper - proof
1GB , 2GB , & 4GB Sizes
What Is The IronKey ?
Just like any flash drive , the IronKey lets you store data onto it for portable storage .
But unlike your normal thumb drives , any data placed onto the memory is encrypted by IronKey ’s Cryptochip technology .
If this drive were stolen or lost , no one would be able to access your data since it ’s encrypted .
And this is n’t just any simple encryption , the data is first software encrypted with 256 - bit AES then encrypted once again with 128 - bit AES .
As far as I am aware of , this technology has never been cracked to date .
( correct me if I ’m wrong . )
If some one were to actually try to guess the password or tries to brute force their way through , the IronKey will self - destruct after 10 failed attempts .
If the thief was a bit more “ hard - core ” and attempted to physically open the drive to directly read the contents , the IronKey will be able to detect the intruder ’s presence and destroy itself as well .
What Else Can It Do ?
In addition to protecting your data , the IronKey can manage all your passwords and will allow you to browse the web securely and anonymously .
Instead of saving your passwords into your browser when logging into a website , the passwords are encrypted and saved onto the IronKey .
Since it ’s encrypted no one can get those passwords without the IronKey ’s main password .
Using the IronKey ’s password manager tool is easy as plugging in the thumb drive , not additional software was required .
For secure browsing , the IronKey utilizes a VPN , which tunnels all traffic through a secure transport .
This meaning , you can securely browse the web from even unsecured WiFi networks or public HotSpots and not have to worry about someone stealing your information .
And for anonymity , the IronKey also sports a very impressive dedicated high - performance Tor network .
This technology uses state - of - the -art cryptography to create a multi- layer encryption for your data which then travels through multiple networked Tor servers to prevent anyone from getting any information about your machine .
How It Works :
Just plug the IronKey into your Windows XP or Vista machine and a popup will prompt the user to name the drive and setup a password .
( Unfortunately it does n’t work on Mac OS X )
When you purchase an IronKey and plug it in for the first time , the software on the flash drive prompts the user to setup a password .
Once complete , the IronKey generates AES encryption keys , sets up up the secure file system , and configures the on - board Firefox browser .
IronKey also offers their customers the option to create a secure backup of all your data online so users would be able to download their data if their flash drive was stolen .
Anytime the IronKey is plugged into any computer ( XP or Vista ) after it has been setup , it will simply prompt the user for a password .
The data and security tools will be inaccessible unless you login .
Once logged in , you can save your data and settings and logout by clicking on the “ Lock Drive ” button found in the system tray .
We did n’t test the actual self - destruct feature since it not only deletes your data , but also renders the IronKey useless .
Hopefully that important part works as advertised .
Other Information :
At the moment only Firefox was specifically designed to run via the IronKey launcher , however future firmware upgrades to the IronKey will allow more compatibility with other portable applications .
You can still run any portable app , however it may not be ensured that the program will leave any remnants of data on the machine it is used with .
Just like a credit card , IronKey recommend that you either engrave or sign your name onto space they have provided on the back .
You can also add contact information onto the software so that there ’s a “ Lost & Found ” message if someone plugs it into their machine .
Another tool I found useful was the built in password generator which will create and save the password it generates .
Therefore if it ends up being impossibly hard to remember , you do n’t have to know it since the IronKey will take care of everything for you .
It weighs just 0.8 ounces , is waterproof , and operates anywhere from - 40 to +85 degrees Celsius ( - 40 to 185 Fahrenheit ) .
The IronKey is available in 1GB , 2GB , and 4GB capacities priced at $ 79 , 109 , and $ 149 on IronKey.com respectively .
It is available for cheaper through other resellers .
This drive is a great tool for business people , those who want to carry sensitive data , want an easy way to manage passwords , and / or browse the web safely .

Welcome to 2005 .
If you ’re a typical Southern California homeowner , the value of your house is back to what it was that year thanks to the weak real estate market , according to a report released Wednesday .
And if the trend continues , it could soon be 2004 all over again .
The median price last month was $ 444,000 , the lowest since April 2005 , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
That ’s a 3.9 % drop from September and an 8 % decline from October 2006 .
The number of homes sold , meanwhile , slipped to a 20 - year low .
Kurt Freck did n’t need to see the latest numbers to know that the housing market is getting worse .
He ’s had the Anaheim Hills home he bought in 2003 on the market for nearly a year and has lowered the price by $ 100,000 -- a 12 % discount from his original asking price of $ 849,000 .
“ The good thing is that I paid less than that , but I have definitely lost equity , ” Freck said .
He bought the house for less than $ 500,000 four years ago .
Freck ’s story is becoming more common as fewer people have been willing to buy a house at current prices .
“ It looks pretty dismal , ” said economist G.U. Krueger of IHP Capital Partners , an Irvine residential real estate investment firm .
Krueger said part of the problem was that the mortgage meltdown triggered by rising defaults has made it tougher for people to get jumbo loans , or those that exceed $ 417,000 .
Conventional loans below that amount , he said , remain widely available .
For home sales to pick up , Krueger said , prices need to fall “ to within striking distance of [ conventional ] loan limits . ”
Current price declines are moving the market in that direction , he said .
“ Riverside is already there , San Bernardino is there , San Diego is closer , all of Southern California is closer , ” he said .
For its monthly report , DataQuick counts all homes sold -- including new houses , existing houses and condominiums .
It tracks values based on the median price , or the point where half the homes sell for less and half for more .
Repeating a pattern , the steepest price declines last month were in Riverside County , where values fell 15.1 % .
Los Angeles County saw a 3.8 % decline in median values .
“ The extent of the pain is not evenly distributed , ” said USC economist Raphael Bostic .
Riverside County was a center of home construction during the recent housing boom , attracting thousands of new buyers looking for affordable housing .
Many of those buyers have gone into default , however , often because they were unable to make higher payments under their adjustable - rate mortgages .
DataQuick ’s chief analyst , John Karevoll , said that though there was plenty of bad news in the latest report , there were a few potentially positive signs as well .
Foreclosures are at record levels , but risky financing with adjustable - rate mortgages and multiple mortgages has dropped because of tightened lending standards .
Also , bargain - hunting speculators appear to be tiptoeing back into the market , which could be a sign that they think the bottom is near , he said .
DataQuick said sales to nonresident owners were up in October to 22 % of sales , from 18 % a year ago .
Typically , such buyers are investors looking to rent out or resell a property .
“ It ’s too early to tell , but it could be a sign bottom - fishers are coming back into the market , ” Krueger said .
“ It could be the silver lining we have not seen in a long time . ”
But recovery wo n’t be quick .
When prices do find their low point , they will follow the historical pattern and “ drag along the bottom for a while before they go up , ” Karevoll said .
That would be bad news for anyone who recently purchased a home and has been hoping to sell at a profit .
But a cyclical downturn does n’t concern Richard Schmidt , a music - industry marketing executive who bought a four - bedroom house in the Country Club Park section of Los Angeles in 2003 .
Schmidt , 52 , says he thinks his house is still worth more than what he paid for it -- less than $ 700,000 .
Even if it falls below that price , however , Schmidt says it wo n’t matter to him because he and his wife do n’t plan to leave for at least 10 years .
By then , they expect the younger of their two sons to be out of college .
Schmidt and wife Kathi Sweet rode out the early - 1990s real estate crash .
They bought a house near the top of the market in 1991 and then saw prices around them plummet .
But they did n’t sell that place until 2003 , when it was snapped up in a week , and for more than the asking price .
“ It ’s a cycle , ” Schmidt said .
“ It goes up , it goes down .
But we ’re in for a long time .
It ’s not an up - or - down thing for us . ”

Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe has accused US President George W Bush of " rank hypocrisy " for lecturing him on human rights and likened the US Guantanamo Bay prison to a concentration camp .
" His hands drip with innocent blood of many nationalities , " Mugabe said in a typically fiery speech to the UN General Assembly .
" He kills in Iraq .
He kills in Afghanistan .
And this is supposed to be our master on human rights ? "
This spring 's debate over a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq may have implied that the US presence there is likely to wind down soon , but recent comments from both the administration and military officials suggest a different scenario .
In Washington and among American military officers in Iraq , the idea of establishing permanent US bases there is under discussion – with one official citing as an example the decades - long presence of US troops in Korea .
The aim would be to keep American soldiers on Iraqi soil well into the century as a support for the Iraqi government against outside aggression , a means of training and developing a new Iraqi military , and a platform from which the US could fight Al Qaeda and other war - on - terror opponents .
Yet as early proposals in notebooks at the White House and the Pentagon are slowly revealed to a US public increasingly opposed to the Iraq war , many Iraq and Middle East experts warn that any plan for permanent bases would cement the US image in Iraq and the region as that of an occupying force .
" This is a really bad idea , one that will only feed the image of the US as the occupier , the colonial power , " says Larry Diamond , a former official with the American provisional authority that governed Iraq in the two years after Saddam Hussein 's ouster .
" There 's no way long - term military bases are going to be acceptable to a majority of the Iraqi population . "
Mr. Diamond , now an expert in democratization at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif. , has argued for more than two years for the US to relinquish any plans for permanent bases .
Such a step , perhaps more than anything else the US could do , he says , would cool the conflict and ease the deadly opposition to the 160,000 US troops now on Iraqi soil .
Even supporters of a permanent American presence in Iraq say now is not the time to stoke flames of anti-American feeling by openly discussing prospects for permanent bases .
" We 'd be stupid not to be planning for what I see is the probability of long - term bases , " says Ralph Peters , a retired Army intelligence officer specializing in the Middle East .
" But it 's premature to openly discuss the prospect until you win the war , so I 'd have to say the floating of these ideas was not very artfully done . "
WHAT GATES AND SNOW BROACHED
In recent comments to the press , White House spokesman Tony Snow broached the idea of a long - term US military presence in Iraq and specifically drew a comparison to Korea and the 30,000 troops the US keeps there five decades after the end of the Korean War .
At the same time , Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke of a " protracted " US presence in Iraq .
Such comments from the civilian leadership increasingly mirror the perspective of US military leaders on the ground in Iraq .
An Army officer who requested anonymity on the issue because he is not authorized to discuss long - term policy said , for example , that a consensus is growing among US military leaders for the need for long - term training of Iraqi forces and a continued US presence to fight Al Qaeda .
In making public statements about the possibility of permanent bases in Iraq , the Bush administration sought to send a signal to the Iraqi government , say some experts .
" The reason these ideas were floated out of the White House now basically lies in the context of all the speculation and congressional debate over a big drawdown being just over the horizon , " says Michael O'Hanlon , a military affairs expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" This is the Bush administration wanting to send a message of resolve , to Americans but mostly to the Iraqi people , " he adds .
" If Iraqi leaders believe we are getting ready to leave , they are more likely to focus on preparing for full - blown civil war and less on the steps needed for national reconciliation . "
The Korea comparison and comments from military officers in Iraq suggest the US may be contemplating a long - term presence in Iraq of 30,000 to 50,000 troops – perhaps one - quarter of the numbers there today .
But many experts caution against equating Iraq in the 21st century with South Korea in the 20th .
" The analogy does n't make sense , " says Mr. O'Hanlon .
" South Korea was threatened by an external enemy .
Iraq is threatened by internal chaos . "
Others single out the perception of US forces as the essential difference between the two cases .
" Korea was pro-American , and there was a sense of common cause in the face of the communist threat , " says Stanford 's Diamond .
Planning permanent bases in Iraq could backfire and set back the progress the US has made against Al Qaeda by turning some newly acquired US allies back into opponents , Diamond adds .
" Certainly this would not sit well with the Sunnis , who are finally willing to engage with us and ally with us against Al Qaeda , " he says .
" If we start talking about permanent bases with 30,000 troops , they 'll go back to seeing us as something they need to resist . "
AN AIR - GROUND COMBO IN THE NORTH ?
Mr. Peters takes a different view , however , saying the minority Sunnis are starting to see the American presence in a different light as they wrangle with the majority Shiite population and government over Iraq 's future .
Still , even he assumes that any permanent US bases would have to be in the " pro-American " Kurdish north .
" I do n't think we'd try to keep open bases the Iraqis did n't want , " Peters says .
His assumption is that the US plan would call for one or two air bases jointly located with ground - forces bases – something comprising about 30,000 troops .
Peters says he sees US discussion of permanent bases as part of planning for the possibility that Iraq may not hold together .
A continued US presence then becomes a kind of caution light against jittery neighbors that may step up their intervention and openly take sides .
But he also sees some sense in the Korea analogy .
" The point is , our forces in Korea really have kept the peace , and they did allow South Korea , a country that was in ruins , to develop , " he says .
" By talking about Korea , they 're talking about giving Iraq time to develop . "
That reasoning assumes that a long - term US presence will aid in Iraq 's stability and development – something not everyone agrees can be assumed .
" We are going to have to be in Iraq for a number of years still , but to talk in terms of a number of decades is not helpful , " says Brookings ' O'Hanlon .
" Despite our best efforts , we have been part of the reason for the turmoil in Iraq .
We should not presuppose that our long - term presence will be beneficial . "
While examining ways to refactor the PFP library , it struck me that its strategy of storing repeated values and dealing with displaying them as an aggregate later was somewhat generalizable .
This is a first stab at a counter datatype with constant - time update and ( probably ) O( m ) lookup — where m is the sum of counts .
The alternate strategy , using a Map , has O ( log (n ) ) lookup and update time — where n is the number of counters .
What do we want to do here ?
module Counter ( count , inc , dec , empty , fromCounter , toCounter ) where
We want to store a list of values together with counts , e.g .
* Counter > example
" Rock " 18
" Jazz " 27
" Classical " 13
" Etc. " 35
We should be able to retrieve any count
* Counter > count " Rock " example
18
We want cheap inc
* Counter > inc " Rock " example
" Rock " 19
" Jazz " 27
" Classical " 13
" Etc. " 35
inc should handle gracefully ( and still cheaply ) new values :
* Counter > inc " Traditional " example
" Traditional " 1
" Rock " 18
" Jazz " 27
" Classical " 13
" Etc. " 35
There should be a functioning dec that also handles invalid cases gracefully :
* Counter > dec " Classical " example
" Rock " 18
" Jazz " 27
" Classical " 12
" Etc. " 35
* Counter > dec " Mbembe " example
" Rock " 18
" Jazz " 27
" Classical " 13
" Etc. " 35
There should be a simply empty counter so new counters can be constructed via inc chains :
* Counter > inc False $ inc True $ inc False $ inc True empty
False 2
True 2
Finally , there should be convenience functions to construct a counter from a list of ( key , count ) pairs
* Counter > toCounter [ ( " Bjork " , 15 ) , ( " Gentle Giant " , 12 ) ]
" Bjork " 15
" Gentle Giant " 12
and to destruct a counter into such a list
* Counter > fromCounter example
[ ( " Rock " , 18 ) , ( " Jazz " , 27 ) , ( " Classical " , 13 ) , ( " Etc. " ,35 ) ]
Here ’s how we implement it .
A counter is merely a list of values .
data Counter a = C {unC :: [ a ] }
unC is not a field name , it ’s an automatically generated destructor .
Maybe I ’m catching a bad habit from Erwig .
We increment a key ’s counter by consing it to the beginning of that list :
inc , dec :: ( Eq a ) = > a ->
Counter a ->
Counter a
inc x = C . ( x : ) . unC
We decrement a counter by removing the first appearance of the key in the list
dec x ( C y ) = case ( findIndex ( ==x ) y ) of
Just a -> C ( take a y ++ drop ( a+1 ) y )
Nothing -> C y
This is the empty counter :
empty :: Counter a
empty = C [ ]
We retrieve a counter by , oh me , counting :
count ::( Eq a ) => a ->
Counter a ->
Int
count x = length .
filter ( ==x ) . unC
The counter is trivially destructed into a list of ( key , value ) pairs from this function :
fromCounter :: ( Eq a ) => Counter a -> [ ( a , Int ) ]
fromCounter ( C x ) = map ( \y - > (y , count y ( C x ) ) ) ( nub x )
To construct a counter , we employ an auxiliary function for n-increasing a count ; we do n’t export it elsewhere .
toCounter :: ( Eq a ) = > [ ( a , Int ) ] ->
Counter a
toCounter [ ] = empty
toCounter ( ( a , b ) : xs ) = ninc b a ( toCounter xs ) where
ninc :: ( Eq a ) => Int -> a ->
Counter a ->
Counter a
ninc 0 x y = y
ninc n x y = inc x ( ninc ( n - 1 ) x y )
Finally , our Show method .
Beware , it ’s kind of ugly .
First we display one key and its count
countShow :: ( Eq a , Show a ) => a ->
Counter a ->
String
countShow y x = ( show y ) ++ " \t " ++ ( show ( count y x ) ) + + "
"
Then we define this ugly auxiliary function to keep track both of the whole counter and of the part that remains to count .
show_ :: ( Eq a , Show a ) = > [ a ] -> [ a ] ->
String
show_ _ [ ] = " "
show_ everything remaining = countShow ( head remaining ) ( C everything ) ++ show_ everything ( tail remaining )
From here show is trivial .
instance ( Eq a , Show a ) =>
Show ( Counter a ) where show ( C x ) = show_ x ( nub x )

CARACAS , Nov 28 ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Wednesday CNN may have been instigating his murder when the U.S. TV network showed a photograph of him with a label underneath that read “ Who killed him ? ”
The caption appeared to be a production mistake -- confusing a Chavez news item with one on the death of a football star .
The anchor said “ take the image down ” when he realized .
But Chavez called for a probe in an interview on state television , where he repeatedly reviewed a tape of the broadcast , questioning why the unconnected photograph and wording were left on screen for several seconds .
“ I want the state prosecutor to look into bringing a suit against CNN for instigating murder in Venezuela , ” he said .
“... undoubtedly it is part of the psychological warfare . ”
The anti-U.S. president often denounces plots to kill him without providing much detailed evidence .
On Tuesday , he said a sniper trained his gun on him at a political rally this month .
Chavez has singled out CNN for biased reporting in what he says is a U.S. - sponsored campaign in the foreign media to destabilize Venezuela .
CNN says its coverage is objective .
In power since 1999 , Chavez on Sunday faces his tightest vote battle to date .
Venezuelans will decide whether he can run for re-election indefinitely in a referendum that polls show is a dead heat between the “ Yes ” and “ No ” camps .
Well - known for wild accusations and harsh insults , Chavez usually focuses his attacks against the United States during campaigns .
With the Bush administration avoiding being drawn into a spat , he has become involved in disputes with Spain and Colombia and repeatedly lambasted the Roman Catholic Church .
Some political analysts and Wall Street economists say the fights appear to be a tactic that burnishes his nationalist credentials and also helps distract voters from debating some of the unpopular details in his proposed reform package .
Alcoholism

Children of alcoholics are not destined to be alcoholics too .
But recent research reports about 50 percent of the risk for alcoholism is genetically determined .
The environment accounts for the other risky half .
The disease is considered genetically complex , meaning that several genes come into play and they can affect individuals differently .
Breast Cancer
( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
The cause of most breast cancers is still a mystery , however researches have discovered that mutations in particular genes , such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 , cause some cancers .
Women who inherit the mutation tend to get cancer early in life and in both breasts .
Men with BRCA1 have an increased risk of prostate cancer , while BRCA2 increases the likelihood of cancers in the male breast , prostate , pancreas , and elsewhere .
Color Blindness

Ten million men in the U.S. cannot distinguish red from green .
Yet the disorder only affects less than 600,000 American women .
Why ?
The genes for red and green receptors sit near each other on the X - chromosome .
Men only have one X - chromosome , which they inherit from their mother .
Meanwhile , women have two , and a normal gene can often balance out a defective one .
Bullying

Next time you 're in the principal 's office with a pink slip for roughhousing on the playground , point the finger at your family .
A gene that increases an individual 's risk for violence has been discovered .
Researchers have also found aggressive behaviors in boys are more likely to be inherited than non-aggressive antisocial behaviors like stealing someone 's lunchbox .
But genes play a bigger role in female thieves .
Obesity
( Image credit : Stockxpert )
Super size fries and a heavy set of genes is a recipe for obesity .
One scientific theory suggests the same genes that helped our ancestors survive famines are now working against people living in places where food is plentiful .
Genes have been shown to be the cause of obesity disorders such as Bardet - Biedl syndrome and Prader - Willi syndrome .
Many of today 's bulging waistlines have only to do with eating too much of the wrong foods , however .
Heart Disease
( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
A family history of heart disease , diabetes , stroke or high blood pressure is n't good for your heart .
Children of parents with heart and blood vessel diseases are more likely to develop them too .
Plus , a person with a congenital heart defect is slightly more likely to have a baby with a heart defect .
Having Twins
( Image credit : Dawn Allynn / Stock.XCHNG )
Although identical twins are random events , fraternal twins pop up in families again and again .
A mother doing double diaper duty carries a gene that makes her release multiple eggs during ovulation , called hyperovulation .
Although a man who carries the gene will probably not father twins , passing the family trait to his daughter could make him a grandfather of twins .
This is why twins sometimes appear to skip generations , even though there 's no evidence that twins are more likely to occur every other generation .
Acne
( Image credit : Stockxpert )
Go ahead and fault your parents for your pimples .
Studies have shown that many school - age boys with acne have a family history of the skin condition .
As well , having parents who endured a bad case of zits makes one more likely to suffer from severe acne too .
Lactose Intolerance
The Chinese distaste for milk was thought to be a cultural one , until scientists in the 1960s discovered lactose intolerance in Asians , Africans , and southern Europeans .
Within the past 10,000 years , a genetic change allowed the ability to digest milk to evolve , but only where dairy farming was the norm .
If you can't tolerate milk , your relatives probably left cow udders alone .
Baldness
( Image credit : LiveScience.com )
Although baldness is common in men , scientists do n't understand much about why so little is going on up there .
Genes do play a role , but your mom is not the only one at fault .
Baldness is likely due to abnormalities in several genes from one or both parents .
People with a rare type of permanent baldness called alopecia universalis , lose hair all over their bodies and carry defective ' hairless ' genes .
A gutted red bungalow known by neighbours as the " Bombay Bunker " was the focus of an intensive police search overnight by bomb squad investigators probing a string of attempted letter bombings here and in Guelph .
Police , who have one man under arrest , are investigating the manufacture of at least six explosive devices – three sent to unwitting recipients here and in Guelph during the past several weeks , and three found in the trunk of a rental car stopped Thursday night at an Esso station at Overlea Blvd . and Thorncliffe Park Dr. in Don Mills .
" We do n't have a motive at this point , " Toronto police Const .
Wendy Drummond said .
" We do know that the three victims – the two in Toronto and the one in Guelph – were not chosen at random . "
The discovery of the bombs in the car led to a day of high drama in a city unused to bomb threats .
Officers , unable to safely disassemble the devices , decided to explode them on the remote Leslie St. Spit , and shut down the Don Valley Parkway 's southbound lanes around noon for the convoy transporting the explosives .
As helicopters buzzed overhead , more than a dozen vehicles took 90 minutes to make the journey through leafy residential streets , down the DVP and along the Leslie St. Spit 's rutted dirt tracks to an isolated point of land jutting out into Lake Ontario , where the three devices were exploded in a ball of black , yellow and white smoke .
Thursday night 's dramatic high - risk takedown of the suspect , who police had been following , came after the man began acting nervously at the gas station .
" I was pumping some gas and I went inside to pay for the gas , and there was a guy inside who was asking for jumper cables , " said Jamal Watson , 23 , who witnessed the takedown .
" I thought there was something wrong with his car , the way he was acting – he was nervous , you could just see it , " Watson added .
" He kept yelling `Jumper cables !
Do you have any jumper cables ? '
And the man at the cash would n't answer him . "
The suspect , Watson said , " was getting agitated , and he kept going in and out of the store , yelling to the shop owner . "
That 's when Watson noticed two men , who he now realizes were plainclothes police officers , following the suspect .
" Two guys who were behind him in line stepped outside , and were waiting for him to come out , " Watson said .
" They were undercover cops , I think .
So as soon as he stepped out , four guys were on top of him .
" They handcuffed him and yelled at us `Police officers !
Police !
Just get out !
Get out !
Move out ! ' "
Not sure of what was happening , Watson heeded the orders , jumped into his car and drove off as police were handcuffing the suspect , who was being held face - down on the pavement .
Yesterday Adel Mohamed Arnaout of 176 Ashdale Ave.was remanded to Sept. 5 during a brief appearance in provincial court on Eglinton Ave. E .
Arnaout , handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit , is charged with three counts of attempted murder , three counts of intending to cause an explosion , one count of criminal harassment and one count of possession of explosive material .
Within hours , police were scouring the Ashdale Ave. bungalow , in the Coxwell Ave. and Gerrard St. E. area , which neighbours said was sometimes home to up to 30 people at a time .
" That 's definitely a strange house , " said Ashley Hinds , who lives nearby .
" Most of the residents have a nickname for it , `Bombay Bunker . '
It was n't because of the families , it was because of the brick extensions and the double steel doors in the front , the tiny peep windows with mesh lining .

" Everyone thought something unusual was always happening there , because people came and went all the time .
The illegal extensions were reported to authorities , but nothing was done . "
Neighbour Sue Hammond said the house , with two gaping open windows and surrounded by construction debris , " was conspicuous because of the way that the front was built .
" When the doors are shut and the gates are shut , it looks like a fortress compared to the homes around it . "
Karrie Peterbaugh , another neighbour , said " There were so many people in and out of that place , it was really hard to keep track .
It was also difficult to keep track of the construction that always seemed to be going on , she added .
" It started out as a small little shack .
They kept on adding and saying it was for family , and the next thing it was a rental unit . "
According to police sources , the investigation into the letter bombs began in June when Toronto resident Steven Scott complained to police of being repeatedly harassed by a man .
The ensuing police investigation began drawing links between the suspect and a string of incidents involving letter bombs .
The first recipient , Abdelmagid Radi , who lives in the Victoria Park and Lawrence Ave. E. area , sustained minor injuries when he opened a letter bomb Aug. 11 .
The second , real estate lawyer Terrence Reiber , called police Aug. 19 after noticing a package smelling of a petroleum - type odour at his house in the Yonge St. - Sheppard Ave. area ; that device was later detonated by police .
Both of the packages were bubble - wrapped envelopes , had properly addressed courier receipts and contained petroleum - type fluid .
While both packages bore the same courier label , they were not delivered by courier , Const .
George Schuurman said .
" So there 's a belief that the suspect modified blank courier labels . "
A third package , opened by Guelph resident John Becker Aug. 22 , contained a bomb packed with nails and explosive materials , but the device did not explode .

Philip Coyle , an analyst with the Center for Defense Information and a former assistant secretary of defense from the Clinton administration period , has a troubling question about the recent nuclear weapon incident in the US .
He wants to know if the six nuclear - tipped Advanced Cruise Missiles that were improperly removed from a guarded bunker at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and flown in launch position on a wing pod of a B - 52H Stratofortress bomber on Aug. 29 - 30 to Barksdale AFB were programmed with targeting information .
He also wants to know if the Air Force and Pentagon , which last Friday concluded an investigation into that shocking incident ( no nuclear weapons have been flown on a bomber over US territory for 40 years on presidential orders , and since 1991 no nuclear weapons are even supposed to be loaded for practice on a parked plane ) , ever checked the missiles ' computer guidance systems .
No mention of target programming on the missiles , which were originally designed to fly low and fast to their targets to evade Soviet radar and interceptors , was made at the Pentagon press conference , at which the whole incident was explained away as a big " mistake . " which
It was announced that five officers and 65 enlisted people were " fired " from their positions as a result of the incident , but no specific information was given about what they had done , or not done , that led to their firings .

His latest book , co-authored by Barbara Olshansky , is " The Case for Impeachment " ( St. Martin 's Press , 2006 , and now out in paperback ) .
The Brookings Institution invites me to an event :
The nation is now readying itself to assess America ’s Iraq policy against the progress report General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker present to Congress .
On September 13 , leading Brookings experts representing a uniquely broad spectrum of views will examine the implications of a pivotal Iraq progress report .
Specifically , they will review the details of the surge report card ; assess if President Bush ’s “ surge ” strategy is working ; should be modified or abandoned ; and provide an assessment of the way ahead in Iraq .
Participants will include Philip H. Gordon , senior fellow ; Michael O’Hanlon , senior fellow ; Kenneth M. Pollack , senior fellow and director of research , Saban Center for Middle East Policy ; Bruce Riedel , senior fellow ; and Peter Rodman , senior fellow .
Brookings President Strobe Talbott will provide introductory remarks .
Carlos Pascual , vice president and director of Foreign Policy Studies , will moderate the panel .
After the program , panelists will take audience questions .
And a broad range of views it is indeed .
From Philip " Iraq : Why France Should Join the Coalition " Gordon on the left , to Peter " Some opponents of the Iraq war are toying with the idea of American defeat " Rodman on the right , all kinds of different Iraq hawks will be on the panel .
UPDATE : Bruce Reidel , it should be said , is a good guy .
Still , this overall situation is absurd .
Would it really kill them to invite people representing an actual broad range of views ?

" Just because we 're not finding them does n't mean they 're not there , " says Major Alayne Conway of the dread Iranian infiltrators .
By the same token , of course , maybe the insurgency is being fueled by Martians or Venezuelan space terrorists -- after all , just because we 're not finding them does n't mean they 're not there .
This is all from Chris Collins ' report for McClatchy which makes the evidence sound pretty thin :
Conway said that U.S. - led forces have not caught any of the Iranians , but she said military intelligence and recently discovered caches of weapons with Iranian markings on them indicate that the Iranians are there .
Lynch 's assertion is the latest in a series of accusations leveled by military officials against Iran .
They have warned that Iraq 's neighbor is actively supplying Shiite insurgents - specifically , the Mahdi Army - with deadly weapons that have killed dozens of U.S. soldiers .
So there you have it .
Given the vagaries of the small arms market and the fact that Iran is conveniently located next to Iraq , it 's hard to say what this is supposed to mean .
The core point , however , remains that even if the full bill of particulars against Iran is true and they 're the primary source for EFPs and Mahdi Army weapons more generally ( this last is plausible -- their guns come from somewhere ) it 's not at all clear why you 'd think escalating the conflict with Iran would be the preferred solution .
The US has already thrown way , way , way more of our assets into Iraq than has Iran -- any escalation we undertake can be responded to and not necessarily to our advantage .
Rationally , the Iranian government can no more be indifferent to events in Iraq than we could be to a massive Iranian invasion force in the middle of a civil war in Mexico .
We can either escalate to full - scale war with Iran , or we can reach some kind of agreement that takes care of both sides ' core interests .

Ben Collins - Sussman , one of the key developers behind Subversion , argues in Version Control and the 80 % that distributed version control will remain a niche interest , and will not move in to the mainstream ( as his favorite tool certainly has ) .
He has a number of good reasons to back up this thesis .
I think he ’s wrong .
The “ other 80 % ” are not profoundly stupid imbeciles who could never grasp the point of DVCS .
Rather they are , generally , working developers with important projects underway , for which they need tools to work well out of the box when used in the default way .
DVCS tools can certainly do that .
More specifically , the list of reasons he gives why DVCS wo n’t become broadly popular , should be read more as a to - do list of how to improve DVCS so they can become broadly popular .
What the DVCS community needs is at least one DVCS which :
Installs easily on Windows , with a single installer , including diff / merge tool and GUI
Includes a very good standalone GUI
Secures client / server ( peer - to - peer ) communicate by default , without user setup of SSH , HTTPS , etc .
Integrates well with Eclipse
Integrates well with Visual Studio
Integrates well with Explorer ( i.e. TortoiseBlah )
Integrates , begrudgingly , with Microsoft ’s SCC API so as to support the many tools which can use an SCC API plugin
Includes permission controls for server repositories , including good tools for configuration thereof
Automates sharing of branches trivially ( some already do this , some less so ) Automates the common ways of using a DVCS , most importantly the usage model in which the DVCS is used as a better SVN with full offline capabilities
Guides users , if so configured , gently back toward a small number ( one , in some cases ) of main central branches , which is what most projects want
Communicates clearly what kind of project it can support well ( most of them ) and what kind it wo n’t support well ( those with an enormous pile of huge files , of which most users only need a few )
( SVN itself is not without flaws .
Ben lists some of them as areas in which improvements are coming , while others ( such as , in my opinion , using the file namespace for branches and tags ) are likely here to stay . )
In the next few years we will probably see one or more DVCS tools gain most or all of the features above .
With addresses , an important truth will be more obvious : distributed source control is , in most ways , a superset of centralized source control , and the latter can be thought of as a special case of the former .
That said , though , I think the DVCS movement will lose a bit of steam when SVN ships better merge support , if that merge support is sufficiently good .
The merge “ features ” are certainly the biggest issue we have here with SVN .

Facebook A New Jersey company has expanded a recall of frozen hamburgers to 21.7 million pounds of patties because they may be contaminated with a deadly type of E. coli , making it the second - largest ground beef recall in U.S. history .
Topps Meat Company of Elizabeth , N.J. , originally recalled 332,000 pounds of pre-formed , frozen hamburgers on Tuesday .
It broadened the recall Saturday .
The recalled packages carry the number " 9748 " inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture mark of inspection and have a " sell by " date or a " best if used by " date between Sept. 25 of this year and Sept. 25 , 2008 .
Most of the recalled products are 10 - pound boxes of pre-formed hamburgers sold to institutional customers such as restaurants , hospitals and schools .
However , some are 1.5- , 2 - and 3 - pound boxes that consumers might have purchased .
The boxed , frozen hamburgers were distributed to retail grocery stores and food service institutions throughout the USA .
The company believes most have already been eaten , it said on its website , but emphasized that it is " imperative that consumers look for these products in their freezers , " and if they find them , dispose of them immediately .
As of Sunday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified 25 cases of E. coli O157:H7 in eight states .
Three of those illnesses have been linked to Topps products , and 22 are under investigation , according to the USDA .
The cases emerged between July 5 and Sept. 9 : two in Connecticut , one in Florida , one in Indiana , one in Maine , seven in New York , five in New Jersey , one in Ohio and seven in Pennsylvania .
" We are still concerned and still monitoring the situation , " said Shelly Diaz , CDC spokeswoman .
The CDC is working on the casetogether with retailers , states and the USDA .
" We sincerely regret any inconvenience and concerns this may cause our consumers , " said Geoffrey Livermore , Topps ' operations vice president .
The E. coli O157:H7 bacteria releases a toxin that can cause cramping , nausea and vomiting that lasts a week .
In some people , generally children , the elderly and those with compromised immune systems , it can lead to severe cramping , bloody diarrhea and in extreme cases , kidney failure and death .
While this is the first recall in Topps ' 65 - year history , it is not the first time the company has had problems with E. coli O157:H7 .
In 2005 , a 9 - year - old girl in Glenmont , N.Y. , went into kidney failure after being infected with bacteria linked to a Topps beef patty , said Seattle food - safety attorney Bill Marler , who settled the case in August .
The largest ground beef recall in U.S. history was the 1997 Hudson Foods Company recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef .
The third largest was the ConAgra Foods recall of 2002 , which covered 18 million pounds of ground beef .
A full list of the recalled products is available at http://www.toppsmeat.com/.

Liberal markets create an addiction to gas
By Jerome Guillet
Energy has become a hot political topic in Europe .
Oil price volatility , cross - border mergers and concern about global warming and the security of future oil supplies have conspired to keep the issue in the headlines .
Added to this have been fears that the Kremlin will use our increasing dependence on Russian gas as a geopolitical weapon , and the European Commission ’s plan to tackle climate change while pushing on with energy market liberalisation .
In all this some basic realities of energy markets seem to be have been forgotten , in particular the growing connection between electricity and gas markets .
Electricity market liberalisation has meant that wholesale prices are no longer set by regulated utilities on the basis of production costs , but by supply and demand .
Electricity demand is inflexible – users , except for some industrial consumers , turn on the switch whenever they need electricity .
They do not do so on the basis of price .
In a market situation , this inflexibility leads to the price ’s being set by the production cost of the most expensive power plant needed at a given moment .
This is the marginal price , and it is usually higher than the average production cost of available capacity .
Gas - fired power plants provide technical flexibility , thanks to the speed at which they can vary their output .
They are also cleaner and emit less carbon than coal - fired plants .
This has helped make gas the fuel of choice for electricity generation during the past 15 years .
With their ubiquity and rapid response to demand peaks , gas - fired plants are almost always the market ’s marginal cost plants , and thus set the electricity price – creating a direct link between gas prices and electricity prices .
Low gas prices during the 1990s created the illusion that marginal prices were almost as low as the price of base load electricity ( production from coal - fired , nuclear or hydro power plants , which is needed all the time and is usually cheaper ) .
That is no longer the case .
Gas prices – which , in Europe , still largely follow oil prices – have increased sharply and drawn wholesale electricity prices up with them .
Retail prices have followed .
Politicians who pushed for deregulation never described marginal pricing to consumers and now have to explain why liberalisation is not bringing prices down as promised .
Rather than face the music , they blame price rises on insufficient liberalisation or “ uppity ” suppliers such as Russia .
But the fundamental reason gas - fired plants have been favoured in today ’s liberalised environment is their lower financing costs .
Some technologies have lower investment costs and higher fuel costs ( gas ) ; some have higher investment costs and lower operating and fuel costs ( nuclear and wind ) .
Deregulation and competition rules put the burden of funding investment on financial markets instead of the public purse .
This makes financing costs higher than for public utilities that could rely on state guarantees and thus borrow at lower rates .
The increase in financing costs favours technologies with lower initial investment costs – that is , gas and , to a lesser extent , coal - fired plants .
Thus liberalisation increases the European Union ’s demand for gas and its dependence on imported gas at a time when domestic supplies are declining .
Worrying about Russia controlling our supplies while de facto encouraging investment in gas - fired power plants appears silly .
If we are so concerned about our dependence on energy imports , why do we not focus our policies on what we actually control – our demand – instead of concentrating only on the supply side ?
Taking into account pollution , carbon emissions and the expected depletion of resources , moving away from burning hydrocarbons should be an overriding long - term goal .
A sane energy policy should focus , as a priority , on reducing our electricity demand via conservation and energy efficiency and on switching to capital - intensive , locally built , renewable energy sources .
That will require thinking again about how we finance the sector .
Energy market deregulation is incompatible with the fight against global warming – markets like to finance gas plants – and with security of supply when exporters will not play by our rules .
There is no reason to expect them to do so at a time of increasing tightness in energy markets .
We have solutions available , if we act on demand reduction and promotion of renewable energy .
Sadly , we seem to be doing the exact opposite .

CBS : Three weeks after Blackwater shooting , FBI ignores key evidence David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 10 , 2007

Print This Email This CBS
News reported on Tuesday that the FBI 's investigation of last month 's Blackwater shooting incident in Baghdad appears to be ignoring evidence that might support the Iraqi government 's version of events and hold Blackwater at fault .
" The FBI investigation is supposed to wrap up in days , not weeks , but there 's still a lot of work to do , " reports CBS .
" Our investigation turned up many witnesses who have n't yet been interviewed , not to mention vehicles that are key evidence still driving around the streets of Baghdad . "
According to the CBS reconstruction of events , based on " remarkably consistent " eyewitness accounts , the September 16 incident began when a four - vehicle Blackwater convoy heading around a traffic circle found its way blocked by a barrier protecting a maintenance crew .
The convoy tried to warn nearby cars to stop but also opened fire on one car that continued to inch forward , instantly killing the driver .
The Blackwater vehicles then pushed the barrier aside and moved ahead , firing on other cars and a city bus as they went .
CBS found that not only is the bus , on which at least one woman was killed , continuing to follow its regular route -- with a driver who is happy to show off the bullet - holes and smashed - out windows -- but " astonishingly , that car [ that was first to be shot at ] , full of forensic clues , is still sitting by the side of the road three weeks later . "
Military analyst Col. ( ret. )
Steve Lyons told CBS that with relations between the United States and the Iraqi government in a delicate state , much hinges on a successful resolution of the incident .
However , he indicated the best hope was for the US to " show that there was either an anomaly , in that it was an accident that should n't have happened , or that perhaps the evidence does show that they were defensive in nature and that there was more firepower that was at that location . "
Lyons said there is little chance the US government will meet Iraqi demands either by severing all ties with Blackwater , which is by far the largest and most competent of the many security contractors in Iraq , or by turning over the gunmen responsible for the shooting .
Even the Iraqi demand of $ 8 million in compensation for each of the victims is uncertain .
" These contractors are long gone , " Lyons stated .
" They 're back in the United States .
They 've scattered , really , to the four winds .
...
They 're not going to get any money from those individuals . "
Lyons explained that Blackwater employees in Iraq are protected from arrest or demands for restitution by an order known as CPA 17 -- put in place by the Coalition Provisional Authority just days before its authority expired in June 2004 -- which exempts US solders , consultants , and contractors from all Iraqi legal processes .
He said the order crucially lacks a " flip side , " which is common in such arrangements , whereby Americans who commit crimes in Iraq could be subject to prosecution under US law .
The House of Representatives has now approved a bill that would do just that , but it would not apply retroactively .
Lyon 's statements suggest that the US is hoping for a positive , or at least inconclusive , outcome to the FBI investigations .
" A lot of that evidence has been destroyed , " he noted .

When the FBI team set off for Baghdad last week , Senator Patrick Leahy made a special request that they not be guarded by Blackwater , writing to Secretary of State Rice ,  This step would help alleviate the appearance of a conflict of interest and hopefully contribute to the credibility of this investigation in the eyes of the people of Iraq .

The following video is from CBS News Up to the Minute , broadcast on October 9 , 2007 .
We 've certainly gotten cranky after being denied some quality gaming time , but 16 - year - old Cory Ryder took it to the next level by attempting to hire a hitman to kill his parents after they took away his PlayStation and denied him television .
Seems young
Cory had been making threats around the house , so his mom hired a cop to pose as a hitter -- and Cory took the bait , offering up his dad 's truck as payment .
After a couple rounds of " negotiations , " the officer revealed himself and arrested Cory for attempted murder , for which he 's now awaiting trial .
Of course , you 'd think that having a hitman conveniently show up after you 'd been threatening to kill your parents might set off an alarm or two , but Cory 's apparently not the brightest bulb around -- his PlayStation was confiscated due to failing grades .

So , I was just getting caught up with 9rules , what originally was a network of blogs , but has since become a community of bloggers from all niches when I noticed there were some interesting things happening , besides launching a new design , it seems there are a large number of members leaving the community .
A friend of mine who is a 9rules member is shocked at the mass exodus that occurred over the change in rules at 9rules .
See , they instituted a change a few months ago , asking members to either participate or leave .
They did n’t ask them to participate every day , or even every month .
They just asked for some participation .
At first , this idea made me angry .
How could 9rules ask their members to participate in their public community site ?
Why should these bloggers add content to a site that does n’t give much back to the 9rules members anymore ?
With 9rules selling advertising on their site , I could see why some bloggers might be against this , until I learned that they did n’t have to contribute to the public community site .
They could contribute to the private forum and still be a valid member .
After finding this out , I found it very hard to defend those that decided to ditch the 9rules logo , the leaf , and go their own separate way .
There is no quota associated with contributing to remain a member , and there is a private forum which is most likely not monetized , and certain bloggers thought they were too good to stop by the site , post their opinions on a few things to be part of what is still considered a rather elitist community ?
While I am sure they all had their reasons , I doubt too many of them have reasons that are really good enough to warrant what is being called an exodus of members .
9rules is n’t what it used to be , no matter what the owners say .
With all the hoopla surrounding the Iphone ( and its fluctuating pricetag ) one might might be lulled into thinking that the Iphone is the be-all and end - all in the world cell phones .
The truth be told though , the Iphone is more like the Corvette of the cellphone industry , relatively expensive to the average consumer , but in the bigger picture , it ’s a cheap horsepower contender and drop in the bucket when compared to these high rolling entrants into the world of cellphones .
And yes , the top cellphone contender is more expensive than the Mercedes Maybach , the Ferrari Enzo and the Bugatti Veyron !

A highly decorated Arab - American sergeant in the US army , who is currently serving as a paratrooper in Afghanistan , faces deportation on his return to the United States because of an irregularity in his immigration papers .
Sgt Hicham Benkabbou has been served with an order to stand trial for deportation as soon as he arrives home , despite the fact that he has been on active service in Afghanistan for almost two years with the 508th parachute infantry regiment , known as the Red Devils .
His lawyers say his treatment illustrates the harsh justice meted out to Arab - Americans by the US immigration authorities .
Benkabbou came to the US from his native Morocco in 1987 , and was granted permanent residency four years ago .
But when he applied to become a naturalised US citizen in 2005 - by which time he was already serving in the army - immigration officials discovered that he had failed to register his first marriage and alleged that the ceremony had been arranged fraudulently to get him into the country .
Benkabbou says that the marriage was annulled and argues it is therefore irrelevant to his immigration status .
" I do not think I deserve to get deported after serving honourably during a time of war ! " he wrote in an email from Afghanistan .
" I can read , write and speak Arabic , French and English .
I have earned the respect and confidence of my superiors and I shall be a great asset for our country if given the opportunity to become a US citizen . "
His case has been taken up by the Association of Patriotic Arab Americans in the Military , which represents up to 3,500 Arab - Americans serving in the armed forces .
The anti-discrimination committee for Arab - Americans , ADC , has also protested .
" This is a very disturbing case .
This man has been serving our nation , putting his life on the line on behalf of America .
This is a setback to attempts to encourage recruitment to the military , " said the ADC 's Imad Hamad .
The aggressive prosecution of the case has surprised immigration lawyers who point to a directive that advises officials against pressing to deport acting military personnel unless they have been involved in drug trafficking , crimes against children or violence , or unless they pose a danger to the public .
Benkabbou 's irregularity over his marriage falls into no such categories .
His lawyer in Atlanta , Georgia , Paul Ford , said the only explanation he could find was that his client was a Muslim , " which sets off all the buzzers .
There is no question that Arab - Americans are given a totally different treatment . "
Ford said that Benkabbou had been accused of being a terrorist by officials from the immigration enforcement agency , ICE .
" In court , ICE lawyers called Morocco a terrorist country , which I found astonishing . "
A spokesman for the US citizenship and immigration services said that under privacy laws the department could not discuss individual cases .
But he added that in general , " if someone is placed in deportation proceedings , that is not the end of the process .
If the case involves someone serving in the military we will look at it very closely .
" We understand the service of those who put themselves in harm 's way to preserve the rights in this country that they do not themselves yet enjoy . "
Several commanding officers have offered support to Benkabbou .
Lieutenant Colonel Peterman said : " It is not an understatement to say that Sgt Benkabbou has been instrumental in sustaining the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment during this combat deployment to Afghanistan .
He is a leader , a problem solver , and possesses the physical gifts of a US paratrooper . "
Is n’t it great how creativity kicks in when times running out .
Take for example this incredible and beautiful installation by artists Dan Havel and Dean Ruck a few months before this house was to be demolished ….
I ’m guessing they saw any opportunity to do something freaking crazy cool to a space that was going to be destroyed and turned this old house into a trippy wooden warp zone !

Trapped !
Inside a Recursive Data Structure
Flat lists are simple .
That 's what list comprehensions are designed to work with , for example .
Code for scanning or transforming a flat list can usually be tail recursive .
Once data becomes deep , where elements of a list can contain other lists ad infinitum something changes .
It 's trivial to iterate over a deep list ; any basic Scheme textbook covers this early on .
You recurse down , down , down , counting up values , building lists , and then .... trapped .
You 're way down inside a function , and all you really want to do is exit immediately or record some data that applies to the whole nested data structure and keep going , but you can't .
As an example , here 's the standard " is X contained in a list ? " function written in Erlang :
member ( X , [ X|_ ] ) -> true ; member ( X , [ _|T ] ) -> member ( X , T ) ; member ( _ , [ ] ) -> false .
Once a match is found , that 's it .
A value of true is returned .
A function to find X in a deep list takes a bit more work :
member ( X , [ X|_ ] ) -> true ; member ( X , [ H|T ] ) when is_list ( H ) -> case member ( X , H ) of true -> true ; _ -> member ( X , T ) end ; member ( X , [ _|T ] ) -> member ( X , T ) ; member ( X , [ ] ) -> false .
The ugly part here is that you could be down 50 levels in a deep list when a match is found , but you 're trapped .
You can't just immediately stop the whole operation and say " Yes ! Done ! "
You 've got to climb back up those 50 levels .
That 's the reason for checking for " true " in the second function clause .
Now this example is mild in terms of claustrophobic trappage , but it can be worse , and you 'll know it when you run into such a case .
There are a couple of options here .
One is to throw an exception .
Another is to use continuation passing style .
But there 's a third approach which I think is cleaner : manage a stack yourself instead of using the function call stack .
This keeps the function tail recursive , making it easy to exit or handle counters or accumulators across the whole deep data structure .
Here 's member for deep lists written with an explicit stack :
member ( X , L ) -> member ( X , L , [ ] ) . member ( X , [ X|_ ] , _ Stack ) -> true ; member ( X , [ H|T ] , Stack ) when is_list ( H ) -> member ( X , H , [ T|Stack ] ) ; member ( X , [ _|T ] , Stack ) -> member ( X , T , Stack ) ; member ( _ , [ ] , [ ] ) -> false ; member ( X , [ ] , [ H|T ] ) -> member ( X , H , T ) .
Whenever the head of the list is a list itself , the tail is pushed onto Stack so it can be continued with later , and the list is processed .
When there 's no more input , check to see if Stack has any data on it .
If so , pop the top item and make it the current list .
When a match is found , the exit is immediate , because there are n't any truly recursive calls to back out of .
Would I really write member like this ?
Probably not .
But I 've found more complex cases where this style is much less restrictive than writing a truly recursive function .
One of the signs that this might be useful is if you 're operating across a deep data structure as a whole .
For example , counting the number of atoms in a deep list .
Or taking a deep data structure and transforming into into one that 's flat .

Corporate media will bring ' 1984 '
Posted Monday , December 3 , 2007 6:51 am
Monday , December 03
With the help of the FCC chairman , the current administration continues its systematic evisceration of the First Amendment .
Permitting a few huge corporate entities to gobble up independent news outlets will inevitably result in a dangerous mixture of pap and propaganda being fed to us as news .
Have you noticed the lack of serious and sustained investigative journalism , hard questions , and criticisms of political figures and parties in power ?
Do n't you wonder why so many important stories seem to surface briefly and then just disappear ?
Where are Woodward and Bernstein now that we really need them ?
Media consolidation is a very real danger for the dwindling democracy in the U.S. Control of the media by a few corporations has already severely damaged our freedom .
The FCC should be rolling back consolidation , requiring divestiture , not handing over the keys to the newsroom .
Congress must prevent any further consolidation of broadcast media and prevent cross-ownership of broadcast and print media .
Freedom of our airwaves and press is our right and responsibility .
Stop further media consolidation by passing S. 2332 , The Media Ownership Act Of 2007 .
Time is short  the deadline is Dec. 11 .
Please , people , stand up for a basic and crucial freedom .
If we allow special interests to control the news , we will be well on our way to a bleak future 

Olive Beal , who has failing eyesight and uses a wheelchair , finds it difficult to hear with her five - year - old analogue aid and needs a digital version that cuts out background noise and makes conversation easier .
Mrs Beal , a former piano teacher who was involved in the suffragette movement , would be 110 by the time she gets her new hearing aid .
" I could be dead by then , " she said yesterday .
Her family said they had been shocked to be told there was an 18 - month waiting list by the Eastern and Coastal Kent Primary Care Trust .
A digital hearing aid costs about £ 1,000 on the open market .
Maria Scott , 52 , her granddaughter , said : " After having a hearing test on Wednesday they said , 'yes , she does need a digital hearing aid , but there is an 18 - month waiting list ' .
" I would have thought they would take her age into account as she probably has not got 18 months to wait .
" Olive has worked hard from the age of 16 to her late 60s and paid taxes .
She has been healthy all her life and lived with her daughter until 15 years ago - she has never sponged off the state .
I thought a 108 - year - old deserved to be treated better than this . "
Born in 1899 , Mrs Beal grew up in Paddington , west London , and went to school with Christabel Pankhurst , daughter of suffragette leader Emily , and helped at suffragette demonstrations .
She had four children , two boys and two girls , but only her eldest son is still alive .
He is in his 80s and lives in Dover .
Her husband died in 1962 .
A spokesman for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf said : " I am afraid this is a common problem .
In some parts of the country there are over two year waiting lists , which is shocking . "
A spokesman for Eastern and Coastal Kent Primary Care Trust said : " We are reducing waiting times .
The priority is given to patients who do not have an existing hearing aid , but we accept our service needs improving . "

The film tells the story of a Jewish woman saved by an Iranian diplomat
Jackbooted Nazis are rounding up Jews for the concentration camps , while terrified Parisians look on .
It is a familiar plot for a television blockbuster .
And this time the formula has been as popular as ever , drawing in massive audiences week after week .
The only difference is that this is a series made for Iranian state TV , and it has been piling up the ratings in the country whose president once questioned the very existence of the Holocaust .
The fact that Zero Degree Turn has been allowed on TV , shows the official sensitivity over the accusations of anti-Semitism that have followed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's various comments about Israel and the Holocaust .
' Iranian Schindler '
" There 's been a menu of demonising Iran to portray it as anti-Jewish , which is not the case at all , " argues Iranian commentator and film - maker Nader Talebzadeh .
We sympathise just as much with those innocent Jewish victims of the Nazis , as much as we do with the Palestinian victims of Zionism
Hassan Fathi
TV series writer and director
The series has gone a step beyond simply acknowledging the Holocaust .
The central character is an Iranian diplomat , who provides false Iranian passports to enable Jews to flee the Nazi- occupied France , a sort of the Iranian Schindler .
He even has a love affair with a Jewish woman .
The writer and director of the series , Hassan Fathi , says he used a true story from World War II to show the outside world they have the wrong impression of Iran .
" In those terrible years there were many people who could help the Jews , but they did n't because they were afraid they would be arrested , " Mr Fathi explains .
" But some Iranians , when they saw they could save some Jews , they left their fear behind and did so - because of their character and their culture , their beliefs and their traditions , " he adds .
Ahmadinejad 's stance
But the outside world also sees Iran 's relentless criticism of Israel and Zionism .
In fact , the Islamic Republic sometimes seems almost to define itself by its opposition to the Jewish state .
Ahmadinejad has accused Israel of propagating a " Holocaust myth "
" Let 's be absolutely clear about this .
We sympathise just as much with those innocent Jewish victims of the Nazis , as much as we do with the Palestinian victims of Zionism , " Mr Fathi insists .
" And this is not just the view of a minority , it 's the position of most Iranians . "
President Ahmadinejad takes pride in meeting members of Jewish sects who are also opposed to the existence of a Jewish state .
But most other Jews would take issue with his claim not to be anti-Semitic .
Mr Ahmadinejad no longer openly questions the existence of the Holocaust .
Instead he calls for further research on the issue .
To the West , he defends this as an innocent call for academic freedom .
But the signal to the Arabs and Muslim masses that he is trying to rally is that there is still some doubt over the Holocaust - if not over its existence , then at least over the scale of it .
' Wishful thinking '
And what of Mr Ahmadinejad 's call for an end to the Israeli state ( when he was quoting the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khomeini ) and his description of the holocaust as a myth ?
There is an interesting perspective from Mr Talebzadeh .
Some six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II
" The media loves to harp on that theme , " Mr Talebzadeh complains .
" ' They want to wipe Israel off the map ' , ' This is Hitler ' .
I mean that ' Hitler - Ahmadinejad ' is almost a strategic theme now for three years .
" You know , the Soviet Union disintegrated very unexpectedly .
It 's a very good example of what would happen .
Does America think it 's going to be there for ever ?
" I could right now see America dismantling into different states .
Israel , I think , would probably fall into the same pattern , and that , I think , is what the president [ Ahmadinejad ] is trying to convey right now , " Mr Talebzadeh says .
The idea that the US is about to splinter apart is a piece of wishful thinking quite widely shared here in Iran .
' Hollywood standard '
But there is also a very genuine belief here in Iran 's history of religious tolerance .
There 's a small Jewish community here , as well as Christian and other minorities ( though the government has been criticised by human rights groups for its treatment of the Bahai minority ) .
Most Iranians , even those taking part in the most ardent anti-Zionist demonstrations , would be quite shocked at any accusation that they are anti-Semitic .
The new TV series also happens to be extremely well produced , with music and cinematography up to the highest Hollywood standard .
Week after week , Iranian audiences have been pulling out their handkerchiefs as the tragically doomed romance unfolds between an Iranian diplomat and a French Jewish woman .

By Stefan Gates
BBC presenter , Cooking in the Danger Zone
For the BBC Two series Cooking in the Danger Zone , food writer Stefan Gates travels to Chernobyl in Ukraine and meets people who live and eat in the " radioactive zone " .
" Niet ! Niet ! " screamed the cook .
It is very dangerous - and illegal - to live in the radioactive zone
I had asked her if it was possible to eat any of the local food , to which she replied : " Good God , no .
We do n't eat fish , meat , fruit .
We do n't eat anything .
It 's all contaminated .
You can 't .
You can't . "
In 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear accident took place at Chernobyl Power Plant here in northern Ukraine when an explosion blew the top off reactor number four and a fire sent plumes of radioactive material into the air , contaminating much of Europe .
Today a vast exclusion zone , the size of Lancashire , encircles Chernobyl and much of the land is still radioactive .
Despite this , several thousand people still work here decommissioning the plant , so the Chernobyl canteen cook has to import food from the farthest reaches of Ukraine .
' Zone of Alienation '
It turns out that the Chernobyl " Zone of Alienation " is home to several hundred mainly elderly people living illegally in the area , and their attitude to the risks of radiation is very different .
Anna has stubbornly refused to leave her home
They returned to their homes soon after the disaster and are now growing vegetables and raising livestock again , despite the fact that the entire region is now an empty , isolated and post - apocalyptic vision of abandoned villages and rampant wildlife .
Anna is a wonderful , garrulous 83 - year - old babushka who has returned to the Zone of Alienation .
She was outraged to hear that the BBC had instructed me not to eat any of her food and she began a sustained bullying campaign , saying : " What 's wrong with you ?
There 's nothing to fear from my food - God will protect you . "
Her reasoning was pretty simple : " If it were contaminated we would have died a long time ago , but we 've been eating it for 20 years already ! "
The ultimate test
It did seem odd that we were filming a fabulous cook making food but could not eat it .
Anna kept chipping away at my resolve , saying : " Just eat it !
You wo n't die .
God will protect you .
We eat it and we 're alive and you 'll be alright too ! "
I felt much more comfortable with the idea after Anna forced several glasses of her plum moonshine down my throat
My producer Marc Perkins was hissing : " You 're NOT allowed to eat it , " but when she produced her homemade butter and our local guides made me more confident by tucking in , my resolve crumbled .
I fell upon the food , much to her admiration .
It was just pork fat soup , but it tasted deep , smoky and very , very Ukrainian .
Admittedly , the fear of radiation had made my taste buds extra sensitive , but I felt much more comfortable with the idea after Anna forced several glasses of her plum moonshine down my throat .
Standard of living
The nearest functioning town to the Zone of Alienation is Slavutych , a town built to re-house workers who continued to work at the nuclear plant after the accident ( strange though it may seem , the other three nuclear reactors at Chernobyl were restarted six months later and continued to operate until 2000 ) .
Slavutych is only 50 km ( 31 miles ) from Chernobyl and land around here was also contaminated by the accident .
The local market even has a radiation testing lab and stallholders have to have their produce tested regularly .
Despite this , the residents are remarkably sanguine about radiation .
Lena Vasilenko , an English teacher , explained to me that radiation effectively provides Slavutych with employment and a higher standard of living than the rest of Ukraine , and the construction of the town was 85 % funded by the company running Chernobyl .
Conditions here are better than in the rest of Ukraine , which is still recovering from the post - Soviet reform .
Death toll
We ate lunch with Lena 's friends Yuri , Denis , Natasha and Anatoly , who seemed to be in denial about radiation .
A lot of people are eager to come here to work and we pay this price of not paying attention to radiation
English teacher Lena Vasilenko
" Nothing 's happened yet , " they say .
Yuri echoes a widely - held belief that vodka absorbs and flushes radiation out of the system , a dangerous attitude in a country so fond of hard liquor that 38 % of men are classified as " heavy alcohol users " .
The real toll of the disaster is highly disputed , with the authorities - represented by the Chernobyl Forum - predicting the total final number of deaths at 4,000 .
Greenpeace , however , suggest 270,000 cases of cancer attributable to Chernobyl fallout with around 93,000 of these fatal .
If these numbers are right , it seems highly dangerous to turn a blind eye to radiation .
' National character '
The future for the Slavutych now looks bleak as jobs at Chernobyl begin to disappear .
We were shocked to see that the mushrooms were eight times over the safe levels
We met up with the town mayor , who was keen to put a glossy spin on the situation and took us mushroom - picking to prove his point .
Mushrooms are one of the foods most susceptible to radioactive contamination but Ukrainians love them , and in the forest next to the town , we found a carpet of fine ceps .
" None of the land around here is dangerous , " he enthuses , " it 's not a problem we have . "
Just to be sure , we took the mayor 's mushrooms to the market testing - station and had them checked for radiation poisoning .
Both the inspector and myself were shocked to see that they were eight times over the safe levels .
I called the mayor to warn him but he just said : " It does n't matter . "
I asked if he was really going to eat them and he said : " Yes. No problem . "
I was shocked , but Lena said : " A lot of people are eager to come here to work and we pay this price of not paying attention to radiation . "
Ukraine has a history of suffering .
The country was on the frontline of world wars , faced appalling famines under Stalin and has been trying to rebuild itself since the fall of communism .
I ask if this attitude to radiation is part of the Ukrainian national character and Lena sighs .
" Ah , yes , we are used to suffering . "
On our last day in Ukraine I had a full body radiation check , which discovered unusually high radiation in my stomach .
The doctor told me that the levels were reasonable for someone who was just visiting the area briefly , and that I would return to normal pretty soon , but I realised that Lena and her friends were almost certainly being affected by the foods they ate .
They were gambling with their health .
The Chernobyl canteen cook was right .
Just say " niet " .
But the people of Slavutych feel as though they have little choice .
Lena 's friend Natasha put it very simply : " Why are we so tolerant ?
Radiation feeds us . "
Cooking in the Danger Zone was broadcast on Sunday , 13 May , 2007 at 1900 BST .
In a victory for the Bush administration and its use of the “ state secrets ” defense , the Supreme Court refused Tuesday to hear a lawsuit from a German car salesman who said he was wrongly abducted , imprisoned and tortured by the CIA in a case of mistaken identity .
The court ’s action , taken without comment , was a setback for civil libertarians who had hoped to win limits on the secrecy rule , a legacy of the Cold War .
Since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the so - called state secrecy privilege has been invoked regularly to bar judges or juries from hearing claims of those who say they were beaten , abused or spied upon by the government during its war on terrorism .
Administration lawyers have argued successfully that hearing such claims in open court would reveal national security secrets .
Civil libertarians said Tuesday that the government was using the secrecy defense to cover up its own wrongdoing .
They also said the broad use of this rule was doing further damage to the nation ’s image , already sullied by international condemnation of its “ extraordinary rendition ” program of arresting terrorism suspects and transporting them to foreign countries for interrogation .

“ In a nation committed to the rule of law , the government ’s unlawful activity should be exposed , not hidden behind a state secrets designation , ” said Steven R. Shapiro , legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union , which had urged the high court to hear the case of Khaled el - Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent .
The White House said it had no comment on the court ’s decision .
Though the Bush administration has not publicly acknowledged El - Masri ’s account , the German government has said that the U.S. admitted it made a mistake .
The Supreme Court dismissed El - Masri ’s appeal in a one - line order but may consider the state secrets rule in a future terrorism case .
The justices are due next month to hear a challenge to the administration ’s continuing detention of several hundred men at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
They also are likely to act in the months ahead on other appeals that raise the secrecy rule in cases challenging the warrantless wiretapping of Americans .
The state secrets rule dates to 1953 with a case involving the crash of a B - 29 bomber .
When the widows of three crewmen sued and sought the official accident report , the Air Force refused , saying the plane was on a mission to test secret electronics equipment .

The court ruled , in U.S. vs. Reynolds , that the need to protect the nation ’s security outweighed the widows ’ claim .
Recent disclosures show that the justices apparently had been misled .
When the accident reports were declassified , they revealed the plane had been poorly maintained but did not contain military secrets .
Since then , the state secrets privilege has been invoked by every president to shield certain evidence from being disclosed in court .
In recent years , the secrecy rule has been used more often and more broadly , said Amanda Frost , an assistant professor at American University ’s Washington College of Law .
“ Before , it was used to limit discovery .
Now , they seek an immediate dismissal of the complaint , ” she said .
For example , administration lawyers have said judges cannot hear challenges to the warrantless wiretapping of Americans because doing so would expose secret details about the National Security Agency ’s program .

Civil libertarians had hoped the Supreme Court would reconsider the secrecy rule in El - Masri ’s case because U.S. officials had acknowledged privately that he was an innocent man .
El - Masri was on vacation in the Balkans in 2003 when he was stopped at a border crossing in Macedonia and his passport was taken .
He said he was questioned intensely and accused of associating with Islamic radicals .
According to his complaint , he was then blindfolded , taken to an airport and stripped of his clothes by a team of masked men .
He said they drugged him and chained him inside an airplane , and he was flown to Afghanistan , where he was held in a CIA - run prison for five months .
Only then did intelligence agents conclude they had the wrong man .
He was not Khalid al - Masri , a wanted terrorist and a member of Al Qaeda ’s Hamburg cell that organized the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington .

American officials did not apologize to El - Masri for the mistake or return him to his home .
Instead , he was dropped from a truck on a hillside in Albania .
From there , he returned to Germany and contacted a lawyer .
Two years ago , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after a meeting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that U.S. officials “ admitted this man had been taken erroneously . ”
In January of this year , German prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 13 CIA agents for their roles in the abduction and abuse of El - Masri .
In 2005 , El - Masri filed suit against George J. Tenet , CIA director at the time of El - Masri ’s kidnapping , and the private contractors who flew him to Afghanistan .
He sought damages for his “ unlawful abduction , arbitrary detention and torture by agents of the United States . ”
In response , administration lawyers said the suit must be dismissed without a hearing “ to protect classified intelligence sources . ”
A federal judge in Alexandria , Va. , agreed and threw out the suit .
This decision was upheld by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond , Va .

In their appeal , ACLU lawyers said it made little sense to use secrecy as a reason to throw out a case whose facts had been broadcast and discussed throughout the world .
“ This is a sad day , ” said Ben Wizner , an ACLU lawyer for El - Masri .
“ By denying justice to an innocent victim of this country ’s anti-terror policies , the court has provided the government with complete immunity for its shameful human rights and due process violations . ”

Resigned to the fact that people know me as Benheck I put it in this article ’s title , to save other web sites a little time rewriting their links .
How considerate of me .
For a larger version with no captions click here .
Anyway , today I ’m going to show you all the prototype for the new single handed controller I have designed and built , which I ’ve been calling the “ Access Controller ” .
This is actually the second prototype , a more refined version of the first .
Alongside the new Elite - based Xbox 360 laptop ( yes , it is coming ) this has consumed most of time in recent months , hopefully explaining the drought of new projects .
Here ’s the basic principle :
You lay this controller on your leg , table or arm of a chair and all the buttons are available on the top surface .
The gag is that each of the five sections is removable and you can plug them anywhere you want .
This not only makes the controller work for both left and right handed use ( simply mirror the layout ) but it also allows the user to optimize the button placement on a game - by - game basis .
Even if the user has partial use of both hands it should still be easier to work with than a standard controller .
In this configuration example the thumb controls the left analog ( player movement ) where the forefinger is on the right analog .
The middle or ring finger can press the analog shoulder buttons .
More details and photos follow below .
This unit is currently in pre-production for manufacturing thanks to the folks at eDimensional.com and will first appear as a wireless model for the PS2 / PS3 , with an Xbox 360 version pending .
If you ’re interested in obtaining one of these or simply wish to express interest please email them directly at access@eDimensional.com .
All other normal inquiries ( photo permissions , interview requests , offers to send me free beer ) can go to my usual address using the link over on the right .
Here ’s a shot of the controller casing before the guts were put in , along with a module .
Each module is about 3/4 ″ thick with a pin header on the bottom .
This header connects to a signal bus inside the main unit , which provides each module hole with every possible signal required by the game controller .
This allows any module to be placed wherever the user wants and it will retain its original function .
End view of the controller , top .
By designing something that would fit the curve of a leg , specifically the top of a thigh , it ended up being shaped like a big hip flask !
This was n’t the original intention ( as I am not a fan of hard liquor ) but as the controller came together it resembled something I could n’t quite my finger on it …
Until one day when it just hit me .
Anyway , fun story for you all .
Bottom of the unit .
The prototype was an Xbox 360 controller , and as mentioned the first production units will work on the PS2 / PS3 .
The battery position may change , might be 3 instead of 2 , but they ’ll be in this general area , flush inside the case with a door .
Well that ’s about all I have to say about this unit at this time , more details as they become available .
Again if you ’re interested in this project please email Michael directly using the link above .
Bonus fun story :
One day , to test this unit , I sat out on my porch to play Uno on Xbox Live Arcade .
I can see the TV in the living room through the sliding glass , so it ’s quite doable .
So I ’m sitting there , drinking a beer with one hand , playing Uno using the controller with the other .
But I did n’t put the headset jack in the prototype .
So I go into an Uno room and some dude is like “ Hey it ’s Benheck ! ” , since , well , my gametag is Benheck .
But I ca n’t say anything because I have no mic .
So after a bit the guy is like “ Oh , the great and might Benheck is too good to talk to us ! ”
And then I get booted .
So the moral of the story is use your microphone on Uno or you ’ll get booted .
But fear not , if we do an Xbox version of this controller it WILL have the headset jack , so you ’ll be good to go .
Vacation - starved Americans , who have among the fewest days off work of any industrialized country , are using Thanksgiving as an opportunity to visit Europe and other international destinations .
" The fact that we 're seeing more people going to Europe despite the fact the dollar just is n't strong there is really amazing , " said Amy Ziff , editor at large for No. 2 U.S. travel Web site Travelocity .
American wanderlust reflects the resiliency of U.S. consumers to shrug off a housing sector slowdown , signs of a slowing economy , and the weak dollar , which is hovering near record lows against the euro and other currencies .
But many of the bookings were made months ago , before the dollar 's most recent swoon .
Ziff said travelers booked trips , on average , 85 days in advance for domestic travel and more than 100 days for international trips in order to lock in low prices and secure seats .
Terry Trippler , travel expert for myvacationpassport.com , said , " People are working hard , and a lot of people do n't like their jobs .
So when they get that vacation , they 're taking it . "
Thanksgiving , which this year is on Thursday , Nov. 22 , usually gives Americans a rare four - day weekend , as many businesses are closed the following Friday .
By tacking on a few vacation days , they can stretch the holiday into a chance to take a longer trip .
Western Europe , which is the fourth most popular travel destination for Americans , has increased its share of Thanksgiving bookings this year by 9.5 percent , according to Travelocity data .
Eastern Europe , where the dollar goes a bit farther than in cities like Paris and London , saw a 24.6 percent surge in its share of bookings , Travelocity said .
U.S. airlines are seeing similar trends in international travel for the 12 - day Thanksgiving holiday rush , which starts Friday and is typically the busiest travel period of the year .
The Air Transport Association expects international traffic on U.S. airlines to climb 8 percent from a year ago , compared to a 3.5 percent rise in domestic travel , said John Heimlich , the trade group 's chief economist .
Heimlich said the growth in international travel , which also gets a boost from Europeans and others traveling to the U.S. , is fueled by traffic across the Atlantic and to Latin America , which is expected to grow more than 10 percent .
The heavy Thanksgiving travel could mean lower demand later : Heimlich said that many Americans are taking trips during Thanksgiving this year , rather than over the Christmas or New Year 's holidays .

Anti-bacterial hand washes are no better at cleaning your hands than ordinary soaps and may actually encourage some superbugs , scientists have warned .
Researchers have completed the first known comprehensive analysis of whether anti-bacterial washes work better than plain soaps .
The U.S team found the anti-bacterial soap was no more effective at removing bacteria during hand washing than the plain variety .
It was also no more effective in preventing infectious illness and did not clear bugs such as E.coli .
They found the way the main active ingredient in many antibacterial soaps - triclosan - reacts in the cells , may cause some bacteria to become resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as Amoxicillin .
Resistance to common antibiotics is a feature of superbugs , such as MRSA , which are plaguing UK hospitals .
However triclosan is used in higher concentrations in hospitals than in supermarket soaps .
Research leader Allison Aiello from Michigan University said : " We need to be aware of what 's in the products .
The soaps containing triclosan used in the community setting are no more effective than plain soap at preventing infectious illness symptoms , as well as reducing bacteria on the hands . "
The study , ' Consumer Antibacterial Soaps : Effective or Just Risky ? ' appears in the August edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases .
It looked at 27 previous studies conducted between 1980 to 2006 .

1 In 1871 , the Surgeon General post was created as the top officer in the Marine Hospital Service , a quasi-military organization meant to battle diseases spread by merchant sailors .
2 The first SG was John Maynard Woodworth , who created a mobile body of physicians , the Commissioned Corps .
Today it remains one of only seven uniformed services of our government .
( No , the post office does n’t count . )
3 Before 1977 , all SGs served in the Commissioned Corps .
Today the only requirement is that they agree with everything the president says .
4 The second SG , John B. Hamilton , really was a surgery professor .
Rather than relocate to San Francisco with the Marine Hospital Service , he resigned in 1896 to run the Illinois State Insane Hospital , where he died two years later .
5 During World War I , under SG Rupert Blue , cigarettes were issued as part of each fighting man ’s basic field rations kit .
6 In 1964 , SG Luther Terry published a report that nailed cigarette smoking as a cause of cancer , triggering the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act .
This sent the tobacco lobby into a frenzy of denial , bribery , and intimidation that continues to this day .
7 Antonia Novello , under George H. W. Bush , was a harsh critic of Big Tobacco .
Her brother - in - law , Don Novello , played a chain - smoking priest , Father Guido Sarducci , on Saturday Night Live .
8 Surgeon General Hugh Cumming is remembered for the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment , begun under his watch in 1930 , to study the effects of untreated syphilis in African American men .
The program continued under six successive SGs , being declared unethical only in 1973 .
The study proved that it ’s unhealthy to leave syphilis untreated .
9 In 1981 , Reagan ’s ultraconservative SG , C. Everett Koop , brought the traditional full military regalia back to the office .
But he was no dandy :
His famous uniform was made of polyester .
10 Koop penned a brochure ( PDF ) explaining the risks of AIDS — writing frankly about sexuality — and had it mailed to every household in the United States .
It was the first government mass mailing of its kind .
He took a lot of flak for it .
11 He also performed a cameo in The Exorcist III .
12 Today the 90 - year - old Koop is a pitchman for Life Alert , the emergency medical response service with the catchphrase , “ I ’ve fallen and I ca n’t get up ! ”
13 Joycelyn Elders was our first black SG .
Like Koop , she advocated frank sex education in schools .
Unlike Koop , she did not survive the flak ; she was gone within 15 months , the shortest tenure of any SG .
14 She was forced to resign because , when asked about masturbation at a U.N. conference on AIDS , she responded in a positive way .
There are no existing audio or videotapes of her response ; the exact words that led to her firing remain unknown .
15 Under George W. Bush , SG Richard H. Carmona said officials asked him to censor his reporting on embryonic stem cell research , contraception , and the unrealistic proposition of abstinence - only sex education .
He was also instructed to mention the president three times per page in every speech he gave .
16 Separated at birth ?
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu also required scientists to sprinkle his name in their speeches .
17 Carmona , a high school dropout , earned his GED in the Army , was a decorated Vietnam Special Forces combat veteran , then won the “ Gold - Headed Cane Award ” as top graduate at the University of California Medical School .
He also served as a paramedic and a nurse .
18 Resistance to Bush ’s nomination of James W. Holsinger as 18th Surgeon General comes partly from his purported antigay bias .
In a paper he wrote for the United Methodist Church in 1991 — which some say is light on science and heavy on dogma — Holsinger declared that male homosexuality is unnatural and unhealthy .
19 On the bright side , PETA likes him : Acting SG Robert A. Whitney , who served in the interim between Novello and Elders , was a veterinarian .
20 The SG ’s position has been vacant on many occasions .
The longest vacancy was four years .
During those times , the health infrastructure of the United States collapsed to dust .
Just kidding .
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2004 December 3
Explanation : The Milky Way is an ordinary 12 billion year old spiral galaxy , and even our middle - aged Sun is pushing 4.5 billion years .
But all the stars in dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18 are much younger .
In fact , based on Hubble Space Telescope image data , that galaxy 's first stars formed only about 500 million years ago , making it the youngest known galaxy .
In this view , the bright knots are the two major star forming regions of I Zwicky 18 , embedded in expanding filaments of glowing interstellar gas .
Scattered , much older background galaxies are seen as small red blobs , and a companion galaxy lies just beyond the upper right corner of the cropped picture .
Astronomers believe that diminutive I Zwicky 18 resembles the earliest galaxies formed , but also want to understand how such a young galaxy can be only 45 million light - years away - surrounded by mature galaxies in an aging Universe .
The tiny galaxy itself is a mere 3,000 light - years across .
The US has hailed Turkey as moderate Islamic democracy , the kind it would like to see develop elsewhere .
It 's a key NATO ally , with US aircraft stationed here .
Yet , as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives in Ankara Friday to defuse tensions over Kurdish rebels operating in Iraq , she faces a nation that is now the most anti-American in the world , according to one survey .
In the meetings with Ms. Rice , and next Monday in Washington with President Bush , Turkey 's prime minister is expected to press the US to take steps against the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) rebels in Iraq .
That might help soften attitudes here toward the US .
But given the depth of anti-American feeling that has developed in just the past few years , few expect Turkish public opinion to turn quickly .
In a recent global survey by the Pew Research Center , only 9 percent of Turks held a favorable view of the United States ( down from 52 percent in 2000 ) , a figure that placed Turkey at the rock bottom of the 46 countries surveyed .
" People have become accustomed to this plot line of America being a threat to Turkish national security .
This was inconceivable five years ago , but now it has come to be the prevailing view , " says Ihsan Dagi , a professor of international relations at Ankara 's Middle East Technical University .
That perception has been reinforced in the past two years by some of Turkey 's most popular books and films which portray the US and Turkey at odds – if not at war .
Turkey 's all - time box office champ , 2006's " Valley of the Wolves , " saw a ragtag Turkish force square off heroically against a whole division of bloodthirsty American soldiers in northern Iraq .
" Metal Storm , " a bestselling political fantasy book from the year before , went even further , describing an all out war between Ankara and Washington in the not so distant future ( the year 2007 , to be exact ) , in which Turkey ultimately prevails with the help of Russia and the European Union .
Analysts say the public 's mood represents a trend that has worrying implications for the future health of the ties between the two NATO allies .
" The public is really convinced that the United States is no longer a friend and ally .
That is really frustrating , " says Professor Dagi .
Real life events have also done little to improve America 's image in Turkey .
The recent passage by a US congressional committee of a resolution recognizing the mass killing of Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire as a genocide – something Turkey strongly rejects – set public opinion aflame .
At the same time , the renewed attacks on Turkish forces by PKK guerrillas have only strengthened the widespread belief that Washington is doing little to get rid of the PKK in northern Iraq .
Ankara has been building up its troops on the Iraqi border and threatening an invasion , something Washington strongly opposes .
" The clearest fact is that the real threats against Turkey come not from its neighbors , but from its ' allies ' and each new development brings
Turkey face to face with its Western allies , " Ali Bulac , a columnist for the liberal - Islamic Zaman newspaper , recently wrote .
" The United States ... is taking its place on the stage as the force behind the PKK . "
Says Gunduz Aktan , a former Turkish ambassador who is currently a parliamentarian with the right - wing Nationalist Action Party ( MHP ) : " The entire Turkish public opinion now is one of frustration and exasperation and a kind of acute expectation of the US to do something meaningful and concrete [ on the PKK issue ] and to understand the problem that we have in Turkey . "
But experts say Turkey 's growing anti-Americanism also has a domestic element .
The success of the Islamic - rooted ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) has forced Turkey to confront the issue of how to reconcile secularism with Islam , while the renewal of PKK violence has again brought to the surface the decades - long struggle to square a strong national Turkish identity with the country 's diverse ethnic identities .
" Turkey is caught right now between East and West , between Islam and secularism , between Kurdish and Turkish nationalism , " says Omer Taspinar , director of the Turkey program at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
" Since the cold war ended , we are living in an era where all the problems that defined the Turkish Republic in the early years are back , and Turkey is blaming the West for this . "
The Rice visit and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's trip to the White House on Nov. 5 are part of an effort to stave off any further deterioration in US - Turkish relations .
" I will openly tell him [ President George Bush ] that we expect concrete , immediate steps against the terrorists , " Mr. Erdogan recently told parliamentarians from his party .
" The problem of the PKK terrorist organization is a test of sincerity for everybody , " he said .
" This test carries great importance for the region and in determining the fate of our future relations . "
Observers inside and outside Turkey say Ankara could play a role in easing regional tensions by dropping its objections to speaking directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq and its leader , Massoud Barzani .
But METU 's Dagi says that without American action on the PKK front , there is little Ankara can do to defuse the public 's growing dislike of the US .
" The government has somehow been taken hostage by this public mood , " he says .
" The first thing is to deal with this mood , and in that America has to contribute something . "
It is extremely hard to know how big a crisis is while it is actually unfolding .
Retrospectively , we tend to think of crises -- whether financial or geopolitical -- as one - day wonders :
Think of “ Black Monday , ” the stock market crash of Oct. 19 , 1987 , or 9/11 , the terrorist attacks of six years ago .
This notion of short , sharp shocks fits in well with our human inclination to live for the moment .
Perhaps it is also a symptom of our era ’s chronic attention - deficit disorder .
Yet the really big crises in history unfolded over months and years , not mere days .
In these protracted sequences of events , there were many gloomy nights , but also many false dawns .
Because hope springs eternal , people tended to attach more importance to the latter , mistaking them for real dawns and blinding themselves to the underlying downward drift .
To illustrate the point , think of the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis , which started July 2 , 1997 , with the speculative assault on the Thai baht , but was not really over until after the bailout of Long Term Capital Management ( Sept. 23 , 1998 ) and the Fed ’s three successive interest rate cuts of Sept. 29 , Oct. 15 and Nov. 17 .
In total , that crisis may be said to have lasted 503 days .
What , I wonder , will we see in the next 500 days ?
The consensus view at the moment is that aggregate losses resulting from the crisis in the U.S. sub -prime mortgage market could amount to $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion .
What nobody knows yet is exactly who has been hit hardest by these losses .
In the coming weeks , we are likely to see a dash for the exits as investors try to redeem money from suspect hedge funds .
That in turn could add to the pressure on the banks that act as the hedge funds ’ prime brokers .

As the shock waves spread through the financial system , jobs are already being shed .
And it ’s worth remembering how much more important financial services are today than they were 20 years ago .
Meanwhile , American homeowners are experiencing something that has happened in only a handful of years since the 1960s : Average house prices are actually declining .
The combination of tighter borrowing conditions , job losses in finance and housing and a growing mood of pessimism among consumers could prove to be a more toxic cocktail than many investors want to believe .
Today ’s geopolitical crisis is playing out in a similarly extended time frame .
Just as investors seize on scraps of good news as they track the stock market from hour to hour , so it ’s still possible for die - hard supporters of President Bush to point to improvements in the security situation in Iraq .
Since the “ surge ” of additional U.S. troops got underway earlier this year , there have been marked declines in Iraqi military and police fatalities and in the number of victims of multiple fatality bombings , according to the Brookings Institution ’s Iraq Index .
Advertisement
Yet the monthly death tolls scarcely tell a story of incipient peace .
According to Brookings , at least 655 Iraqi civilians lost their lives last month as a result of bombings ( the latest Iraqi figures are three times higher ) ; 79 U.S. military personnel were killed and more than 400 wounded .
Meanwhile , the prospects for an enduring and peaceful political solution to the conflicts among Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds seem as remote as ever .
And , back at home , public confidence in Bush ’s strategy is at an all - time low .
This is one important respect in which Bush may be right in drawing a parallel between the Iraq and Vietnam wars .
The American people started to lose faith in the Vietnam War at the time of the Tet offensive , which began at the end of January 1968 .
From October 1968 on , a clear majority of Americans were telling pollsters that they regarded the war as a mistake .
By that time , the Paris peace talks between the U.S. and the North Vietnamese had been initiated .
Yet it was not until Jan. 27 , 1973 , that the Paris peace accords were finally signed .
In other words , the agony of ending the Vietnam War lasted more than 1,700 days .

In just the same way , the outcome of the American intervention in Iraq will be determined not in Baghdad but in Washington .
Sooner or later , this president or his successor will come under irresistible public pressure to start drawing down American troops in Iraq .
This will almost certainly happen , as in Vietnam , before the country they are leaving has genuinely been stabilized .
This great crisis of U.S. foreign policy , like the slow - burning financial crisis we are living through , will play out over hundreds , if not thousands , of days .
Throughout that time , we shall read many reports in the newspapers that the surge is working and the markets are rallying .
But these reports will just be so much “ noise ” -- mere static on the airwaves of history .
As in the early 1970s , the underlying geopolitical and financial crises of our time are in synch -- and inexorable .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 16 — A federal appeals court said today that secrecy laws forced it to exclude critical evidence about the National Security Agency ’s domestic eavesdropping program from being used by an Islamic charity in a lawsuit even though the mere existence of the program could no longer be considered a “ state secret . ”
The complex ruling was a victory for the Bush administration and signaled trouble for civil rights groups that are trying to show that the eavesdropping program was unconstitutional and to hold telecommunications companies liable for carrying it out .
The Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , a charity in Oregon , had perhaps the best evidence of anyone that it had been a target of the wiretapping program , based on a top secret document mistakenly given to the group in 2004 .
But the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , based in San Francisco , found that evidence about the document could not be introduced in court because it fell under the “ state secrets ” privilege invoked by the government .
The court , reversing a lower court ruling , said the trial judge had made “ a commendable effort to thread the needle ” but that its final ruling in allowing the evidence was flawed .

General Motors ’
OnStar cell phone system will be losing thousands of customers starting January 1st , 2008 due to technological changes .
The OnStar system , which uses cell phone networks and GPS data to both call for help and provide location information , will not work for some customers after January 1st , 2008 due to an edict by OnStar in response to an FCC decision five years ago relating to analog cell phone systems .
Back in 2002 , the Federal Communications Commission decided that the time had come to accelerate the conversion of cell phone systems from analog to digital .
To effect this , they allowed ( but did not require ) cell phone companies to turn off their analog cell phone transmitter sites on Monday , February 18 , 2008 .
Because digital cell systems are much more capable and efficient , expect most analog systems to be turned off on that day or within a few weeks of it .
But , this presents a problem for some drivers of vehicles equipped with the OnStar system .
When OnStar was first offered for sale in 1996 , digital cell systems were new , so OnStar decided to go with analog equipment until around the 2002 model year .
Guess what ?
If you have an OnStar - equipped vehicle made in that time frame , you ca n’t upgrade it to digital , so your OnStar will fade out for good on 1/1/08 .
If your vehicle was made between 2002 - 2004 , it probably can be upgraded to digital , and OnStar systems made after that are already digital .
It sounds like something out of a horror movie , but wrong - sided surgery happens more often than you think .
Concerns about surgeons operating on the wrong part of the body made headlines this week after The Providence Journal reported that on three separate occasions this year , surgeons at Rhode Island Hospital operated on the wrong side of a patient ’s head .
The most recent case happened last Friday , when the chief resident started to cut on the head of an 82 - year - old patient .
The resident , a doctor in the seventh year of specialty training , realized the error before reaching the skull and closed the wound with a single stitch .
The procedure was done on the correct side , “ with good results , ” according to a statement from the hospital , which was fined $ 50,000 by the state health department .
On a percentage basis , surgery on the wrong side or area of the body is considered rare .
But nonetheless , it affects hundreds of people a year , and hundreds more cases likely go unreported .
This month , the Archives of Surgery ran a letter from The Joint Commission , the primary accrediting agency for hospitals in the United States , noting that it receives about nine voluntary reports per month of so - called “ wrong - site adverse events ” to its Sentinel Event Database .
Last September , the same medical journal reported that wrong - site surgery may be underreported by a factor of 20 .
That study concluded that there are 1,300 to 2,700 wrong - site procedures annually in the United States .
Many mistakes involve near misses , like the recent case in Rhode Island , where the surgeon starts to cut but realizes the mistake before real damage is done .
Sometimes the mistake has dire consequences .
In one widely publicized Florida case a few years ago , a series of mistakes by medical staff resulted in a doctor amputating the wrong leg .
British doctors in 2002 were tried and acquitted for manslaughter when a patient died after they removed the wrong kidney .
In July , another surgeon at Rhode Island Hospital drilled into the wrong side of an 86 - year - old patient ’s head during an emergency procedure .
The doctor realized his mistake and operated in the correct place .
However , the patient died a few days later , but a preliminary investigation showed the patient did n’t die as a result of the surgical error , reports The Providence Journal .
The Joint Commission has a set of guidelines for hospitals to follow to prevent wrong - site surgery .
They require hospitals to verify the surgical procedure to be performed , mark the surgical site in advance and take a “ time out ” immediately prior to starting the operation , during which team members verify that they ’ve got the right patient , ensure that scan films are n’t reversed and confirm that medical records and scans match the marked surgical site .
Patients who have scheduled surgical procedures can adopt some simple strategies to protect themselves from wrong - site surgery .
Speak directly with the surgeon just prior to your surgery to discuss the specifics of the operation he or she is scheduled to perform .
Talk to the surgeon before you are prepped or given any anesthesia .
Do n’t let nurses or other surgical staff mark the surgical site .
Insist that the surgeon who will be doing the cutting use a permanent marker to mark the incision site .
In Canada , surgeons are advised to put their initials on the place to be cut .
“ It ’s very reasonable to ask and participate in the marking of the site , ” said Dr. Peter Angood , vice president and chief patient safety officer of the Joint Commission .
As you interact with surgical nurses , anesthesiologists , radiologists and other providers prior to the surgery , confirm they know what procedure you are scheduled for .
Talk to your doctor about what procedures the hospital has in place to prevent medical mistakes like wrong - site surgery , and make sure the hospital where your operation is being performed is accredited by The Joint Commission .
“ I think a patient should recognize that they have the ability to prevent this , ” said Dr. Angood .
“ Each time they talk to the surgeon or people involved in the procedure they should verify that it ’s the right leg or the left arm .
As they move into the procedure area , the patient and patient ’s family should n’t hesitate to ask , and re-ask , the nurses and the providers , ‘ Are you sure we ’re doing the correct side ? ’ ”
The commission lists these tips for patients to help prevent wrong - site surgery .
The page also includes a brochure for download called “ Help Avoid Mistakes In Your Surgery ” that includes a checklist of extra precautions for surgical patients .
When Palm first announced the Foleo last week , its new portable device that will sell for around $ 500 , my first reaction was , ' so what . '
While it has some interesting features such as instant - on , full keyboard and 10 inch screen in a device about the size of a large paper back , it does n't have any applications ( or so I thought ) .

In fact , I scoffed at such a device several weeks when I posted about the imminent demise of the UMPC arguing that someone who has $ 500 in disposable cash is more inclined to by an iPhone .
a device that does all of the same things and fits in your pocket , all for the same $ 500 .
Well , I 've decided to rethink this position , at least to some degree and perhaps the two types of devices are n't mutually exclusive after all .
My ( partial ) transformation came while researching an article on Enterprise 2.0 , the concept of applying Web 2.0 functionality to the enterprise to help workers collaborate and work more efficiently .
It occurred to me that if we are doing most of our work on the internet , perhaps a small device with a full keyboard like the Foleo , could be the very item the mobile knowledge worker needs to access work and collaboration tools wherever he or she is , so long as there in an internet connection .
While the iPhone certainly does all of these things , it does n't have a 10 inch screen or a full keyboard and it still requires you to be an expert thumb typist .
It also occurred to me this morning while I was watching the Foleo demo that it would be perfect tool for an online operating system like Glide 2.0 , an internet - based set of tools for sharing media and files and which includes a growing set of Office productivity tools .
If you combined this online system with your Foleo , you might have something pretty powerful .
But then there 's the rub ( as there always is ) .
What happens when you 're offline ?
Your productivity grinds to a halt without off - line access to your applications .
There are also security issues of having all your work on the internet .
These are problems ( but the same ones you have with an iPhone or Smart Phone ) , so I 'm rethinking this little machine .
Maybe it is n't as silly as I thought initially and maybe it could be a very useful device , perhaps not a mass - market device , but one that many business users could find useful for accessing their web applications wherever they are .
And at $ 500 , it 's a lot cheaper than a sub-notebook .
But 9/11 is not just about military operations or science or national security procedures .
People 's views on 9/11 are also partly a function of their political , psychological , and religious views .
The following links take you to summaries of what prominent liberals , conservatives , psychiatrists and psychologists , Christians , Jews and Muslims themselves say about 9/11 :
Polls show that a large portion of the American population believes outlandish theories about the attacks of September 11th .
These myths have been spread far and wide both by malicious people and by good people who have been duped by false information .
What do credible people , like high - level military leaders , scientists , legal scholars , members of Congress , and the 9/11 Commissioners themselves think ?
The following links take you to summaries of what the experts say about 9/11 :
The pending confirmation of Michael Mukasey to the position of Attorney General , now destined to go to the full Senate , thanks to Lieber - moves of Shumer and Feinstein , is troublesome to more than just we in the progressive community .
Senator Patrick Leahy received this letter ( .pdf ) from four retired JAGs , who understand that the concept of " Rule of Law " must mean something , even with Bushies in charge .
Dear Chairman Leahy ,
In the course of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's consideration of President Bush 's nominee for the post of Attorney General , there has been much discussion , but little clarity , about the legality of " waterboarding " under United States and international law .
We write Because this issue above all demands clarity : Waterboarding is inhumane , it is torture , and it is illegal .
In 2006 the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the authority to prosecute terrorists under the war crimes provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code .
In connection with those hearings the sitting Judge Advocates General of the military services were asked to submit written responses to a series of questions regarding " the use of a wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of drowning ( i.e. , waterboarding ) . . . "
Major General Scott Black , U.S. Army Judge Advocate General , Major General Jack Rives , U.S. Air Force Judge Advocate General , Rear Admiral Bruce MacDonald , U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General , and Brigadier Gen. Kevin Sandkuhler , Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps , unanimously and unambiguously agreed that such conduct is inhumane and illegal and would constitute a violation of international law , to include Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions .
We agree with our active duty colleagues .
This is a critically important issue - but it is not , and never has been , a complex issue , and even to suggest otherwise does a terrible disservice to this nation .
All U.S. Government agencies and personnel , and not just America 's military forces , must abide by both the spirit and letter of the controlling provisions of international law .
Cruelty and torture - no less than wanton killing - is neither justified nor legal in any circumstance .
It is essential to be clear , specific and unambiguous about this fact - as in fact we have been throughout America 's history , at least until the last few years .
Abu Ghraib and other notorious examples of detainee abuse have been the product , at least in part , of a self - serving and destructive disregard for the well - established legal principles applicable to this issue .
This must end .
The Rule of Law is fundamental to our existence as a civilized nation .
The Rule of Law is not a goal which we merely aspire to achieve ; it is the floor below which we must not sink .
For the Rule of Law to function effectively , however , it must provide actual rules yhat can be followed .
In this instance , the relevant rule - the law - as long been clear : Waterboarding detainees amounts to illegal torture in all circumstances .
To suggest otherwise - or even to give credence to such a suggestion - represents both an affront to the law and to the core values of our nation .
We respectfully urge you to consider these principles in connection with the nomination of Judge Mukasey .
Sincerely ,
The Fifa president Sepp Blatter today confirmed that the 2014 World Cup will be staged in Brazil , who will host the tournament for the first time since 1950 .
Brazil were the only country bidding to host the finals , but their delegation went through the formality of making a 30 - minute presentation to the world governing body 's executive committee in Zurich earlier today , before being officially awarded the finals .
" The task was not easy - for us it was a real big challenge to have the same list of requirements and the same conditions for only one candidate than if we had two and perhaps we put the bar higher than if we had two , " said Blatter .
" There was an extraordinary presentation by the delegation and we witnessed that this World Cup will have such a big social and cultural impact in Brazil .
" This the country that has given to the world the best football and the best footballers , five times world champions , and if we do n't stop the invasion of Brazilian footballers then in years to come we may have only Brazilians in all the national teams !
That 's why the executive committee has decided unananimously to give the right and the responsibility to organise the 2014 World Cup to Brazil . "
Brazil now face the daunting task of building or completely refurbishing every single one of their stadia for the tournament .
Fifa 's inspection report has identified 18 grounds with more than 40,000 capacity that could host matches and these will be whittled down to nine or 10 .
However , of the 18 four would have to be built from scratch and all of the other 14 undergo substantial renovation .
Fifa inspectors said the Brazilian football federation had estimated £ 550 m as the budget for building and renewing the grounds but that figure appears very optimistic .
So basic are the facilities at the moment that most of the stadia are not even equipped for television commentary .
Fifa 's inspection report noted that Brazil was " more than capable of hosting an exceptional Fifa World Cup " , but added , " surprisingly , most of the stadiums are not equipped for TV commentators .
In fact , many of them will use TV commentary positions for the first time thanks to the projects and the necessary Fifa requirements for staging a World Cup . "
The inspectors said Fifa must maintain close links with the Brazilian organisers - and start immediately .
" Brazil has a rich history of hosting sporting and other international events , " added the report , " but the standards and demands of the World Cup will far surpass those of any other event staged in the history of Brazil in terms of magnitude and complexity .
" The inspection team is of the opinion that it would be important for Fifa experts to carefully review the process and progress of host city selection to ensure that adequate financing is committed and secured by the time of the deadline for the selection of the host cities and the related stadium facilities or potential stadium construction sites . "
Meanwhile , Germany were awarded the 2011 women 's World Cup ahead of Canada .

Please note that the descriptions of curry and partial application here are correct , the code is not .
In the Haskell examples I got the curry slightly wrong ( hence my confusion on that point ) and in the C++ I got my V1 and V2 mixed up .
Alexey Romanov and BobMac kindly pointed out the errors for me .
I will write a full and proper description of this now that I have some working code to use .
Currying and partial application are very similar , in fact so similar that lots of people get them confused .
Currying is a unary function , meaning it takes only one argument .
That argument is a function and the curry returns another function .
The only difference between the two functions is how the arguments are applied .
Because nearly every Haskell function is already curried it 's going to be easier to see this in C ++.
int add ( int a , int b ) { return a + b } ; int ten = add ( 7 , 3 ) ; // Normal uncurried form int eleven = curry ( add ) ( 7 ) ( 4 ) ; // Curried form
The difference between the curried and uncurried forms is that normally we apply the arguments together , but once curried we apply the arguments one after another .
Partial application is a binary function .
It takes a function and an argument and it also returns a function .
int add ( int a , int b ) { return a + b } ; int ten = add ( 7 , 3 ) ; // Normal form int eleven = papply ( add , 7 ) ( 4 ) ; // Partial application
You can see this is very similar to currying .
Partial application is very easy to write in C++ using the Boost .
Lambda or Boost .
Bind libraries — I 'm going to use Boost .
Lambda .
template < typename R , typename V1 , typename V2 > boost :: function < R ( V2 ) > papply ( boost :: function < R ( V1 , V2 ) > f , V1 v ) { return boost :: lambda:: bind ( f , v , boost : : lambda::_1 ) ; }
Given this it is fairly easy to write a curry function :
template < typename R , typename V1 , typename V2 > boost :: function < boost :: function < R ( V1 ) > ( V2 ) > curry ( boost :: function < R ( V1 , V2 ) > f ) { return boost :: lambda::bind ( papply < R , V1 , V2 > , f , boost : : lambda::_1 ) ; }
What I wanted to know was what the result of currying papply would be ?
Thinking it through I was expecting some form of curry to be the result .
It turns out I was wrong .
If you followed my Yoda speaks Visual Haskell article and actually tried any of it you 'll find a copy of GHCi in C : \Program Files \Visual Haskell\bin .
This is an interactive Haskell shell and we can use it to do some experimenting .
You can type single expressions into the shell and they will be compiled and executed .
In order to define a function in the shell you need to use let , so papply becomes this : let papply ( f , a ) b = f ( a , b ) And curry becomes this : let curry f ( a , b ) = papply ( f , a ) b
You can redefine a function simply by doing a new let .
The shell is useful because once you have inc defined you can try it out and get back a result immediately : Prelude > inc 8 9 Prelude > inc 10 11 Prelude > inc 2324 2325
Haskell is good for trying this sort of thing , but it is n't entirely straightforward .
Although the error messages are shorter ( much shorter ) they 're not really any more illuminating .
Another complication is that in Haskell it is normal to write all functions in curried form .
Trying to write these function in uncurried form took me quite some time , in fact much longer than it took me to write them in C ++.
In any case I ended up with this for partial application :
papply ( f , a ) b = f ( a , b )
Following the way that the C++ curry is defined , the same thing in Haskell becomes this :
curry f ( a , b ) = papply ( f , a ) b
We need a function to practice on so we can convince ourselves that we 're doing sensible things .
Turning addition into an increment function seems a perfectly likely candidate .
Here are two different versions .
If you can understand the second you probably do n't need to be reading this post ( I 'm going to assume you 're doing this in GHCi — see the sidebar ) .
let add ( a , b ) = a + b let add = uncurry (+)
Whichever definition of add you want to use , increment is the same :
let inc = papply ( add , 1 )
One useful thing that GHCi can do is to tell you the type of an expression .
We do this by typing :t before the expression :
Prelude > :t papply papply :: ( ( t , t1 ) -> t2 , t ) -> t1 -> t2 Prelude > :t curry curry :: ( ( t , t1 ) -> t2 ) -> ( t , t1 ) -> t2
I do n't want to go into what those type signatures mean , but we do now have enough to answer the question , what is the result of currying partial application ?
Prelude > :t curry papply curry papply :: ( ( t , t1 ) -> t2 , t ) -> t1 -> t2
Look carefully and this is the same type signature as partial application , not curry as I was expecting .
We show that it does work as partial application with this :
let inc = ( curry papply ) ( add , 1 )
Try using that and you should be able to convince yourself that it works .
We can curry that result as often as we like and it will still work :
let inc = ( curry $ curry papply ) ( add , 1 ) let inc = ( curry $ curry $ curry papply ) ( add , 1 )
Now I just hope that somebody can explain , in terms simple enough even for me to understand , why this happens .
Why does currying this particular binary function give back a binary function ?
I think that I have something wrong because I can't apply my Haskell insight back into C++.
The following C++ fails to compile for me :
#include < boost/ function.hpp > # include < boost / lambda/bind.hpp > # include < cmath > # include < iostream > template < typename R , typename V1 , typename V2 > boost :: function < R ( V2 ) > papply ( boost :: function < R ( V1 , V2 ) > f , V1 v ) { return boost : : lambda:: bind ( f , v , boost : : lambda::_1 ) ; } template < typename R , typename V1 , typename V2 > boost :: function < boost :: function < R ( V1 ) > ( V2 ) > curry ( boost :: function < R ( V1 , V2 ) > f ) { return boost :: lambda:: bind ( papply < R , V1 , V2 > , f , boost : : lambda::_1 ) ; } int add ( int a , int b ) { return a + b ; } int main ( ) { //
Explicitly making these functors makes things a bit simpler boost : : function < int ( int , int ) > fadd ( add ) ; boost : : function < boost : : function < int ( int ) > ( boost : : function < int ( int , int ) > , int ) > fpapply ( papply < int , int , int > ) ; boost : : function < int ( int ) > in c1 ( papply ( fadd , 1 ) ) ; std::cout << in c1 ( 6 ) << " " << in c1 ( 10 ) << std::endl ; boost : : function < int ( int ) > in c2 ( fpapply ( fadd , 1 ) ) ; std::cout << in c2 ( 6 ) << " " << in c2 ( 10 ) << std::endl ; curry ( fpapply ) ; //
Fails with a very nasty error nearly 180 lines long }
If the Haskell is correct I think I should be able to define inc3 as :
boost : : function < int ( int ) > inc3 ( curry ( fpapply ) ( fadd , 1 ) )
Although what I was expecting was this :
boost : : function < int ( int ) > inc3 ( curry ( fpapply ) ( fadd ) ( 1 ) )
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . —
The gallery of photos lining a hallway at Google ’s headquarters here is filled with the faces of luminaries who have visited the company : Mikhail Gorbachev , Bill Clinton , the Dalai Lama , Muhammad Ali and Jane Fonda .
And in each of the more than 100 pictures , there is someone else : Tan Chade - Meng , a geeky fellow with a big smile who is a household name only in his own household .
Mr. Tan is a 37 - year - old engineer at Google , and his initial chutzpah , his quirky workplace and a steady stream of distinguished visitors have turned him into the company ’s in - house Zelig .
The visitors are often there to get a glimpse of the future in progress , and perhaps something to drop into conversation that suggests an advanced I.Q. : “ When I was out at Google the other day ... ”
The Constitutionalism of Ron Paul has ignited a debate that ’s sorely needed in this country .
The Founding Fathers envisioned a nation of individual States , each with its own quirks and ideas , and each with wide latitudes to set its own internal laws and policies as it saw fit .
The central government was tasked only with foreign affairs and acting as arbiter of inter-state matters .
The individual States had nearly full sovereignty with most other affairs .
In many ways , the United States was set up and that is why the American symbol is of freedom with a roughly similar mix between central authority and State sovereignty as the current EU .
Ron Paul and many libertarians reflexively yearn for a return to such an idea .
The central government we have now is a behemoth , trampling our freedoms under its oppressive taxes and mountains of regulation .
Even worse , the system is largely out of control , and citizens have almost no power over its workings .
Devolving power to the States and local governments would counter the dilution of power that naturally occurs when one is a single voice out of 300 million .
Petitioning your city or state representative is much more effective than some Senator who may represent several million people .
Inherent in the assumption by these libertarians , though , is that moving power to smaller levels of government will improve individual freedom .
I ’m not sure that assumption is accurate .
There are pros and cons of both systems .
Federalism :
On the positive side , federalism allows for experiments in freedom .
States and localities compete on a whole host of aspects , such as taxation , regulation , and social policies .
In many instances , it allows those states to do things that would not be allowed in a true top - down structure .
In some cases , that may be liberalized policies such as California allowing doctors to prescribe medical marijuana , the city of Galveston , Texas to opt out of social security for their retirement plans , or states like Massachusetts recognizing gay marriages .
These are all things that individual states or localities are doing to increase personal freedoms .
But there ’s a big negative .
Many policies undertaken by individual states inimical to individual freedom .
For example , the trend to outlaw smoking in private businesses would be a simple example .
Another fairly innocuous example would be the crazy alcohol “ blue laws ” dotting the nation , many of which have absolutely no justification and are simply a way to appease special interests at the expense of freedom .
On a more serious note would be the “ Jim Crow ” laws , or if you ’re looking for a modern incarnation , Massachusetts ’ new health - care plan .
States are laboratories for new policies , but those policies are not always pro-freedom .
Central Government :
The benefit of central government mandates are simple : if the central government does something right , it can immediately apply that across the country .
Many of our Constitutional amendments have followed this path , such as the 24th , eliminating a poll tax .
It was a way to end an immoral form of discrimination in a place which sorely needed it .
Similarly , while the 14th amendment may have opened the door to some very strange unintended consequences , the idea is purely in favor of liberty : to make sure that individual states and localities cannot engage in unfair discriminates against individuals based on things such as race or gender .
But again , there ’s a big negative .
As co-contributor tarran quoted Barry Goldwater to me in a discussion on this topic , “ The government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take it all away . ”
Look no further than the government ’s failed attempt at Prohibition , a distinctly anti-freedom policy that might have been proven to be damaging if done in individual states that was instead foisted on the entire nation .
Even worse , our central government has the potential to cut down individual states ’ pro-freedom policies at the knees , as we saw in Raich .
So what ’s best ?
Well , the ideal government would be a single world government that was only powerful enough to protect freedom but disciplined enough not to infringe on individual freedom for the “ common good ” .
However , such a government has never existed , will never exist , and with the incentives inherent in government , can never exist .
So looking at the ideal government is not a useful way to answer this question .
The best way to answer this question is to ask how federalism relates to individual freedom .
I used “ vs. ” in the title of this post for a reason .
Of course , I do n’t believe that federalism works contrary to individual freedom .
However , I do n’t think it necessarily works FOR individual freedom either .
Federalism is only a tool for individual freedom if the people in a region believe in individual freedom , likewise a strong central government is only as damaging to individual freedom as the populace allows it to become .
Where federalism does shine , however , is in giving individuals choice over what mix of freedom and of taxation / regulation they prefer .
However , as the differences in politics between the “ liberal ” and “ conservative ” states show , federalism does not automatically equal liberty .
In states like California , there are large degrees of personal freedom , but not much economic freedom .
In states such as Georgia , there is a large degree of economic freedom , but the level of social conservatism circumscribes personal freedoms .
All this occurs in the spheres of control outside those of the central government , and I see no reason to believe this would not be the case if the central government were weakened .
The problem , whether you look at the central government or individual states , is that the government will only be as pro-liberty as the populace it represents .
If you ’re in Massachusetts , you just might get a weak version of socialized medicine through “ mandatory coverage ” .
If you ’re in Alaska , you may find nearly non-existent government that actually pays you out of oil revenues to live there .
But as I mentioned , if you then have a choice between Massachusetts and Alaska , you have a lot more choice than between America and Australia .
The closer in proximity those choices become , for example between Taxachusetts and the Free State , and the better it will be for lovers of liberty .
And the weaker the central government is , the more differentiation there will be between more - free and less - free states .
Federalism is not a panacea that will solve our nation ’s problems .
It ’s a step in the right direction , but it must always be remembered that the message must be about freedom , not about federalism .
Federalism is a potential means to the end , but it is not the end in itself .
Scientists and Intellectuals are supposed to be above petty politics and popularity contests , right ?
Nope .
Here are a few bright bulbs that never got the fancy Nobel gold medallion ( or the millions of Swedish krona that go with it ) .
And you thought the Oscars were bad .
1. Joan Robinson , Economics
Great Britain's Joan Robinson may be one of the most exciting figures in the history of " the Dismal Science . " 
An acolyte of the great John Maynard Keynes , her work covered a wide range of economic topics , from neoclassicism to Keynes 's general theory to Marxian theory .
Not to mention , her notion of imperfect competition still shows up in every Econ 101 class .
Add to that the fact that Robinson 's greatest work , The Accumulation of Capital , was published way back in 1956 but is still widely used as an economics textbook .
So why no Nobel ?
Some say it 's because she 's a female , and no female has ever won the Nobel in Economics .
Others say that Robinson 's work over her career was too eclectic , rather than hyperfocused like that of so many other laureates .
Still others claim that she was undesirable as a laureate because of her vocal praise for the Chinese Cultural Revolution , a fairly anti-intellectual enterprise .
2. Dmitri Mendeleev , Chemistry
Why would this guy deserve a Nobel Prize for chemistry ?
After all , his only achievement was to devise the entire periodic table of elements , the miracle of organization and inference on which all of modern chemistry is based .
Mendeleev 's table was so good , it even predicted the existence of elements that had n't yet been discovered .
But here 's where politics rears its ugly head .
In 1906 , Mendeleev was selected by the prize committee to win the honor , but the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stepped in and overturned the decision .
Why ?
The intervention was spearheaded by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius , who had himself won the prize in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation .
Mendeleev had been an outspoken critic of the theory , and Arrhenius seized the opportunity as the perfect chance to squeeze a few sour grapes .
3. Mahatma Gandhi , Peace
The Susan Lucci of Nobel Peace Prize contenders , Mohandas " Mahatma "  ( Great - Souled ) Gandhi was nominated like crazy : 1937 , 1938 , 1939 , 1947 , and 1948 .
More after the jump ...
He certainly deserved it , as his nonviolent methods helped kick the British out of India and became the model for future Peace Prize laureates like Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi 's final nomination came in 1948 , and he was the odds - on favorite to win it that year .
However , the " Mahatma "  was assassinated just a few days before the deadline .
Since the Nobel Prize is never awarded posthumously , the prize for peace went unawarded that year on the grounds that there was " no suitable living candidate . " 
The decision was also motivated by the fact that Gandhi left no heirs or foundations to which his prize money could go .
4. James Joyce and 5 . Marcel Proust , Literature
One wrote Ulysses and Finnegan 's Wake , almost universally regarded as two of the most brilliant works of the 20th century ( in the case of Ulysses , the most brilliant ) .
And the other is , well , Marcel Proust .
Proust 's towering work , A La Recherche du Temps Perdu ( In Search of Lost Time , or , sometimes , Remembrance of Things Past ) is considered one of the greatest literary achievements ever , combining seven novels and 2,000 characters for a celebration of life , consciousness , and sexuality spanning 3,200 pages .
James Joyce 's works and stream - of - consciousness style are the basis of countless college courses , doctoral theses , and poetic ruminations .
But the writings of Proust and Joyce were probably just too controversial and " out there "  for the more conservative Nobel committees of their day .
And Nobel 's stricture against posthumous awards has n't exactly helped , especially since the influence of these two artists has continued to grow long after their deaths .
Most ironic , Proust and Joyce have been major influences on many writers who went on to win Nobels themselves , like Saul Bellow , Samuel Beckett , Jean - Paul Sartre , Albert Camus , and Hermann Hesse .
Other literary giants who have gotten the Nobel shaft ?
Evelyn Waugh , Jorge Luis Borges , Bertold Brecht , Graham Greene , Henry James , Vladimir Nabokov , and Simone de Beauvoir , to name a few .
6. Jules - Henri PoincarÃ© , Physics
Although PoincarÃ© was a mathematician , his genius was too universal to be confined to one category .
Sure , he came up with all sorts of mathematical theories with crazy names : algebraic topology , abelian functions , and Diophantine equations .
But he was into physics , too .
PoincarÃ© laid the foundation for modern chaos theory and even beat Einstein to the punch on certain facets of the theory of special relativity .
And one of his math problems , the PoincarÃ© conjecture , even remained unsolved for nearly 100 years !
So why was Henri overlooked for the Big One ?
Due to Alfred Nobel 's stipulation that his prizes go to those whose discoveries have been of practical benefit to mankind , the Nobel committees have often been accused of rewarding experimental discoveries over purely theoretical advances .
PoincarÃ©'s work in physics seems to be a victim of that prejudice .
7. Raymond Damadian , Medicine
Lots of deserving folks have been passed over for the Nobel , but few were as vocal about it as 2003 runner - up Raymond V. Damadian .
He was the brain behind the science of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a technique that completely revolutionized the detection and treatment of cancer .
But the 2003 Prize for Medicine went to Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield , two scientists who expanded on Damadian 's discovery .
Enraged at the slight , Damadian ran full - page ads in the New York Times and Washington Post featuring a photo of the Nobel Prize medal upside down and the headline " The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted . " 
The ad featured quotes from other scientists backing up Damadian 's claim , even a letter of protest to be cut out , signed , and mailed to the Nobel Committee .
Some claim Damadian was slighted because his fundamentalist Christian belief in creationism made him anathema to the scientific community .
Others say it was because his discovery was n't really useful in medicine until Lauterbur and Mansfield improved upon it .
Either way , 2003 left the poor scientist Nobel - less .
8. Oh , and Anybody in Mathematics
When dynamite inventor ( that 's not a comment on his abilities ; he really did invent dynamite )
Alfred Nobel stipulated in his will that his fortune be used to establish a fund to award five annual prizes , he famously left out mathematics .
All kinds of theories have popped up to explain the omission , the most salacious of which claim that Nobel hated all mathematicians because his wife was schtupping one on the side .
Nope .
The most likely reasons for Nobel 's ditching math are ( 1 ) He simply did n't like math all that much , and ( 2 ) Sweden already had a big , fancy prize for mathematics , bestowed by the journal Acta Mathematica .
Although math is still a Nobel bridesmaid , a prize for economics was added in 1968 , thereby giving the extremely boring sciences their due .

Mark Zuckerberg has been given a taste of his own medicine : his personal information is being plastered all over the web forever .
The Facebook boss has failed in a court bid to gag a magazine that published data including drunken extracts from his college diary and his social security number .
Federal judge Douglas Woodlock told the 23 - year - old 's lawyers on Friday that the independent Harvard alumni magazine 02138 had the right to release the documents , which were part of another court case .
02138 's investigation centred on the dispute between Zuckerberg and the operators of ConnectU , another Harvard - founded social network .
It 's alleged that in the early days of Facebook , " the new Bill Gates " nicked ideas and source code from brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , who had asked him to work on their project .
Digging into that period , freelance reporter Luke O'Brien turned up a series of depositions and other documents on a visit to the courthouse , and the magazine ran them in support of his article .
The piece is sympathetic to the Winklevoss twins and reports accusations by classmates that Zuckerberg had lied in front of them .
Facebook lawyers applied to have the documents taken down on Thursday , saying the court had ordered them to be sealed .
A spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal : " One reason the court ordered certain documents ' protection was to prevent exactly what has happened : misusing documents and taking documents out of context to sling mud . "
Their failed application also attempted to force O'Brien to reveal how he obtained the files , since they had been locked up .
He has maintained he was given them by a Federal Appeals Court clerk .
The judge denied all Facebook 's claims .
According to the New York Times , the clerk mistakenly handed over the files to O'Brien .
Zuckerberg and Co. will be hoping Friday 's decision marks the end of a run of public embarrassments for Facebook .
On Thursday , it was finally forced to bow to pressure over its creepy new ad system Beacon .
There could be more privacy - related defeats ahead , however .

Bleak skies ahead for Japan ’s Nova Usagi
Japan ’s largest English Language conversation school , Nova is the second largest employer of foreigners in Japan ( the first being the Japanese government , bless them ) employing over 4,500 teachers nationwide .
The company name NOVA , originates from the English word for a star that suddenly becomes thousands of times brighter and then gradually fades to its original intensity ( or to nothing in this case ! ) .
It has however , been made into a now familiar acronym by its eikaiwa ( 英会話 ) senseis , who proclaim to be heavily overworked , and given little or next to NO VAcation .
Last Friday ( 26th October 2007 ) , Nova filed for court protection from creditors , and also temporarily closed all of its 1000 +
English conversation schools .
It is hard to imagine any other event which could cause as much disrupt to the “ Eigoken ” foreign population in Japan , short of war or Government meltdown .
On Thursday 25th , a finance deal with two foreign funds to save the company in its current form fell through , and in the wee hours of the 26th , the three remaining board members fired the founder and CEO Nozomu Sahashi ( 猿橋 望 ) , who was absent from the meeting and did not even have the offer of a chance to put in a word of defense for himself .
It has been a rocket ride for Sahashi .
He studied aboard in both France and Denmark when he was young , but was overcome by the sadness he felt about not being able to communicate with the locals .
Upon returning to Japan , he decided that he did n’t want foreigners to have the same feelings of solitude in Japan , and so in 1990 , with two Canadian and Swedish friends he created Nova.
17 years later , as of March 2007 , Nova boasted over 1000 schools nationwide and over 500,000 students , which is more than half the entire English teaching market in Japan .
In 1995 , Nova ’s sales were as high as 75 billion yen .
CEO Sahashi had changed his name from Saruhashi thanks to the ribbing from diligent kanji studying foreign teachers who relentlessly called him Monkey - Bridge , or just MB .
However the company had listed in 1996 , he made Japan ’s top 100 tax - payers list in 1997 paying over 900 million yen in tax , and Japan ’s population was becoming more adept ( theoretically at least ) at the English language .
Not bad for a shy young lad from Kishiwada , the heart of Osaka ’s underworld .

However at the beginning of 2007 , it all started to come crashing down .
The company ’s business model had relied on selling bulk lessons to students up front , which they could then attend over time .
This meant that they had lots of cash coming in , and could finance its rapid expansion , which meant opening almost one school a day during 2005 and 2006 .
The catalyst for the down spiral however , was a lawsuit from a student who claimed that Nova refused to refund prepayments for lessons that he no longer wanted to take .
After a court battle , the Supreme court threw out an appeal by Nova , demanding the repayments to be made .
After this began and in early 2007 , the media was all over Nova , for all the wrong reasons .
First , in January , seven Nova teachers were caught in possession of cocaine .
In February , Nova was raided by METI and the police over the refund issue .
And then in late March , one of their teachers , a cute Brit was murdered .
With the Japanese school year beginning in April , the first 3 months are vital to Nova sales .
However with all the bad PR and the ongoing lawsuits , the number of new contracts dropped and cancellations increased dramatically .
With less prepayments for lessons coming in , and more prepayment refunds going out , the cash stopped flowing in , and Nova started to become late on payments .
Then in June , METI ( 経済産業省 , Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ) banned the company from selling any contracts longer than a one year term .
After Nova became officially guilty of illegal business practices , Sahashi held a press conference and apologized , but did n’t take responsibility and resign .
Also bowing in apology next to Sahashi was his Assistant CEO Shouichi Watanabe .
Here is the NHK news clip ( Japanese ) in full for some ( mi - ni - yo - ku - tsku ) revision :

http://www.stippy.com/wp/wp-content/zuploads/z_movs/200710-nova-eiwakaiwa-goes-down.flv[/flv]
Article 24 of the Labor Standards Law ( 労働基準 法２４ 条 ) stipulates that companies must pay wages to employees at least once a month , on a fixed date .
In July however , Nova began delaying ( by weeks , and in some cases months ) payments of salaries and stopped paying office rents .
Since September , many schools have been shut down because the firm was unable to secure native English - language teachers , all of which lead to the events of last week .
This business and social disaster has been coming for months , and Sahashi and his aides have been courting potential suitors to takeover the company ( and all its problems ) , but to no avail .
The most speculation was around a potential takeover by HIS ( Japan ’s largest travel agency ) .
Rumour has it that Sahashi pushed too hard of a bargain , and HIS gave up in disgust .
In the end , the building list of creditors , the unknown total liability of the prepayments , and the possibility of underworld connections to the business all contributed to the result of not being able to seduce a suitor .
However , with still over 50 % of the English language market , some superb school locations , and the mass of students , Nova still has many attractive points .
Therefore , now that the company has filed for protection from creditors , the race is on for potential acquirers .
Names thrown about so far have included Rakuten , Aeon , and of course now that Sahashi is gone , HIS has come back on the scene .
All will likely be revealed in the next few days .
Nova teachers rally outside the Osaka labor standards office

The signs read , “ Sahashi , pay us our money ! ”

Despite Nova ’s largest office being in Tokyo ( Shinjuku ) , the 55 year old , single Sahashi has always spent most of his time in Osaka ( Shinsaibashi ) , where its modest headquarters are located .
In past months , he has been said to have been passing the lonely evenings in the local izakayas , slowly drinking his favourite shochus , and desperate for a compassionate ear and new ideas on how he could save his crumbling empire .
There have been concerns voiced as to his will to save the company as he has remained mostly hidden from the public and many of his aides , communicating with the staff only through intermittent faxes .
That this culminated with him not even attending his own board meeting where he was fired may not come as a surprise to some .
However Sahashi has always been said to have a very good heart , and we believe that he has been doing his utmost right up until the end .
The potential fallout from Nova ’s implosion cannot yet to be gauged .
However it has already begun to cause huge unrest in the foreign community .
Nova teachers are represented by a labor union called the General Union , whose homepage is covered with articles and “ emergency advice ” for its distraught members .
It is not only the senseis who should be worried though , 4,500 foreigners suddenly appearing on the local job markets may have repercussions for many people already working here .
As well as that for many of the teachers who are in Japan on working holidays straight out of school , without pay checks , how will they survive ?
The Australian and British Embassies have already begun to offer assistance to teachers who have not received salaries , but there are limits on what they can do , as it is a domestic employment issue .
QANTAS is offering discounted airfares to sacked Nova teachers for the next few days if they want to go home to Australia , as 20 % of Nova teachers are Aussies .
The Australian Embassy ’s website posts detailed info for Nova refugees as follows :
Following discussions with the Australian Government , Qantas has advised that for a limited period it will be offering a reduced air - fare rate for Australian NOVA employees who wish to return to Australia .
Enquiries ( including about conditions and availability ) should be directed to the Qantas Tokyo office on ( 03 ) 3593 7000 .

Senator John F. Kerry , whose 2004 presidential campaign was torpedoed by critics of his Vietnam War record , said yesterday he has personally accepted Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens ' offer of $ 1 million to anyone who can disprove even a single charge of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
In a letter to Pickens , who provided $ 3 million to bankroll the group during Kerry 's race against President Bush , the Massachusetts Democrat wrote : " While I am prepared to show they lied on allegation after allegation , you have generously offered to pay one million dollars for just one thing that can be proven false . "
Kerry , a Navy veteran and former prosecutor , said he was willing to present his case directly to Pickens and would donate any proceeds to the Paralyzed Veterans of America .
Pickens issued his challenge Nov. 6 in Washington , while serving as chairman of a 40th anniversary gala for American Spectator magazine , according to two Internet accounts of the gathering and Kerry , who said he spoke to people who were there .

Setback for Mich . primary
LANSING , Mich . - A state appeals court yesterday dealt a blow to Michigan political leaders ' hopes of holding a presidential primary on Jan. 15 .
In a 2 - 1 ruling , Judges Patrick Meter and Donald Owens objected that a law recently passed by the Legislature setting up the primary would let the state political parties keep track of voters ' names and whether they took Democratic or GOP primary ballots , but give no public access to that information .
The logjam involving the courts has delayed scheduling of the nation 's first primary .
New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner says he wo n't set the date of his state 's primary until it 's clear what 's going on with Michigan .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Two hedge fund firms that racked up huge gains betting on the subprime mortgage meltdown have begun winding down those trades and looking elsewhere .
They 're now betting against corporate debt using derivatives .
Paulson & Co. has generated returns of up to 435 % in the first nine months of 2007 thanks to short positions on securities backed by subprime home loans , according to an update the $ 24 billion hedge fund firm sent to investors recently .
Short sales rise in value when the securities in question fall .
Scion Capital LLC , $ 621 million hedge fund firm run by Michael Burry , reported gains of between 78 % and 85 % , after fees , during the first nine months of this year from similar bets .
As rising delinquencies on subprime mortgages escalated into a global credit crisis this summer , some in the $ 1.8 trillion hedge fund industry thrived , like Paulson and Scion , while others fell .
Sowood Capital Management and two funds run by Bear Stearns BSC , - 10.00 % , collapsed .
After being among the first to spot problems in the subprime mortgage business , Paulson and Scion may now be among the first to begin closing negative bets , even as credit market turmoil continues .
" The correction in the subprime market is well under way , " John Paulson , the former Bear investment banker who runs Paulson & Co. , wrote in a letter to investors .
" We took advantage of market conditions to selectively realized gains . "
Silicon Valley - based Scion had $ 1.7 billion worth of short positions on parts of subprime mortgage securities at the start of 2007 .
By mid-October , those short positions had been whittled down to $ 479 million , according to a letter Burry sent to investors this month .
MarketWatch obtained copies of both letters .
" The opportunity in 2005 and 2006 to short subprime mortgages was an historic one , " Burry wrote .
" With continued hard work and a bit of luck , we will latch onto another opportunity like the subprime short .
But I am not counting on it happening anytime soon . "
It 's not over yet
Still , both Paulson and Burry said the credit crisis is far from over .
The housing market will likely deteriorate further , Paulson predicted .
Home prices have fallen 3 % in the U.S. so far , but he reckons there could be a 15 % to 25 % drop in prices from their peak .
Most of Paulson 's remaining subprime mortgage positions will likely be written off as losses on these securities keep rising , he added , noting that his firm bet against the lowest - rated , riskiest parts .
Cumulative losses of 6.25 % , on average , would wipe out these securities , but losses on such securities sold in 2006 could end up being at least twice that , which will wipe out higher - rated parts of these structures , Paulson explained .
Corporate debt bets
Other parts of credit markets also remain vulnerable , Paulson said .
The firm has researched " dozens " of financial - services institutions and has been betting against these companies through credit default swaps .
( CDS are a bit like insurance against a company defaulting .
The buyer of protection , such as Paulson , is betting that companies ' ability to repay their debts deteriorates ) .
" We believe the opportunity is similar , though not as great , as when we started buying protection on subprime well ahead of actual recognition of the problem , " Paulson wrote .
" We do not feel that the credit correction is over . "
Scion 's Burry also has a derivative bet against corporate debt that 's worth roughly $ 2.2 billion , he noted in his letter to investors .
That could still generate big gains if there 's more turmoil in credit markets , he said .

The average game developer salary is n’t astronomical — it ’s comfortable , but not astronomical .
It ’s about $ 70,000 per year .
How much money game creators make is one of the biggest misconceptions students have about the working industry , says Professor John Small , a long - time industry professional ( Criterion ) and game development instructor at Savannah College of Art and Design .
Another issue new recruits must tackle is to decide what job title they ’re after .

Nov. 14 , 2007  --
In a dramatic turn of events on Capitol Hill today , the State Department inspector general recused himself from all Blackwater - related issues after admitting to Congress that his brother served on the private security contractor 's advisory board .
After initially rejecting allegations that his brother , Alvin " Buzzy " Krongard , was a Blackwater board member , Howard Krongard later told lawmakers that his brother was in fact on the board .
The State Department has come under fire in recent months for its oversight of the embattled private security firm , which protects U.S. diplomats in Iraq .
Blackwater was involved in a Sept. 16 shooting in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead , an incident the FBI is currently investigating .
Chairman Henry Waxman of California began the House Oversight Committee hearing by stating that " we have now learned that Mr. Krongard 's brother , Buzzy Krongard , serves on Blackwater 's advisory board . "
Inspector General Refutes Allegations
The Inspector General immediately refuted the allegations .
" I can tell you , very frankly , I am not aware of any financial interest or position he has with respect to Blackwater , " Howard Krongard said .
" When these ugly rumors started recently , I specifically asked him .
I do not believe it is true that he is a member of the advisory board that you stated .
And that 's something I think I need to say . "
However , Democrats then produced a July 26 letter in which Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder and CEO , invited Buzzy Krongard , a former top CIA official , to join Blackwater 's advisory board , followed by a Sept. 5 letter in which Prince welcomed Krongard to the board .
Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. , told the inspector general that Buzz Krongard was even scheduled to attend a Blackwater board meeting earlier this week in Williamsburg , Va..
Howard Krongard then promised to recuse himself from Blackwater - related issues if his brother was a board member .
A Surprising Turn of Events
An hour later , after a brief recess , the inspector general did just that .
" During the break , I did contact my brother , " Krongard said .
" I learned that he had been at the advisory board meeting yesterday .
I had not been aware of that .
And I want to state on the record right now that I hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with Blackwater . "
Krongard testified that he had spoken to his brother about Blackwater approximately five or six weeks ago , and that their conversation focused on allegations that Buzzy Krongard had a " significant financial interest in Blackwater . "
" I 'm not my brother 's keeper , and we do not discuss our business with each other , " Howard Krongard said , adding that " we have gone to great lengths to keep our professional experiences separate because of his position and because of my position . "
Rep. Stephen Lynch , D. - Mass. , then suggested that " we ought to subpoena Buzzy and get him in here and testify as to his conduct and his conversation with his brother . "
Krongard 's Republican Defenders Taken Aback
One of Krongard 's most vocal supporters , Rep. Chris Shays , R - Conn. , who called him " an honorable man " and apologized to him for being " trashed by this committee , " said that he would be " one pretty unhappy guy " if he were in Krongard 's position .
" To have been in contact with your brother and to have your brother tell you that he was not involved in Blackwater and then to find out at a hearing that he actually attended and then left , and to find out he 's connected , is a pretty outrageous thing .
He has done you tremendous damage by that , " Shays said .
" Would n't it make sense , given your position , to have been upfront with your brother , to say , ' Since I investigate everything the State Department does , I need to know any contact that you have , because I need to recuse myself , ' " Shays said .
" Now , the other argument could be , ' Do n't tell me anything you have , because then I 'm not in conflict . '
But the problem is nobody 's going to believe you , frankly . "
Krongard was also grilled by lawmakers about other allegations made by seven current and former officials in the IG 's office during the course of Waxman 's two - month investigation , such as " inadequate oversight of the construction of the Baghdad embassy , " " refusal to pursue charges of procurement fraud implicating Dyncorp , " and " failure to assist a Justice Department investigation of Blackwater for arms smuggling . "
Waxman called Krongard 's reign as inspector general is one of " reckless incompetence , " but Republicans defended him against what Shays called " salacious allegations , " " personal attacks , " and " shallow , drive - by assaults . "
The harshest criticisms that Republicans directed at Krongard were in a staff report that denounced his " extraordinarily abusive management style . "
Krongard admitted that he " sometimes clashed with a minority of people in [ his office ] that were resistant to change " but was adamant that he " never had any political ties whatsoever , " has " never met or spoken with the president or any other person in the White House " and has " never impeded any investigation . "

Alberto Fujimori was extradited from Chile earlier this year
Fujimori in court
He was found guilty of ordering the removal of sensitive video and audio tapes from a flat belonging to the wife of his former intelligence chief .
Mr Fujimori is the first ex-Peruvian head of state to have been convicted of crimes committed while in office .
The sentence comes a day after he went on trial for human rights violations .
Mr Fujimori is accused of authorising two death squad massacres , in which 25 people were killed , during a campaign against the left - wing Shining Path insurgency in the early 1990s .
He denies the charges .
If convicted , he could face up to 30 years in prison .
' Vladi Videos '
In a separate hearing on Tuesday , Supreme Court Judge Pedro Guillermo Urbina found Mr Fujimori guilty of having a military aide pose as a prosecutor and search without a warrant the apartment of the wife of spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos in November 2000 .
During the illegal raid , police removed dozens of boxes of videos suspected to contain incriminating evidence of corrupt practices .
The tapes , which the Peruvian media have termed " Vladi Videos " , had been secretly made by Mr Montesinos showing himself bribing broadcasters and opposition politicians .
Mr Montesinos , who has been in prison for the last six years , has said he was just doing his master 's bidding .
In an earlier hearing , Mr Fujimori admitted ordering the police raid without a warrant , but said he had been looking for evidence of money laundering .
His lawyer said he would appeal against the sentence .
Mr Fujimori , who was extradited from Chile earlier this year , also faces other separate charges of corruption relating to his time in office between 1990 and 2000 .

Via MPP , battle lines are being drawn on the campaign trail over medical marijuana .
Linda Macia of Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana suffers from nerve damage , fibromyalgia , reflex sympathetic dystrophy and degenerative arthritis .
She 's allergic to other medications and has only found relief through medical marijuana .
You'd think that anyone hoping to become president would show some compassion for this unfortunate woman , but alas … Notice how McCain turns his back to her the moment she utters the phrase " medical marijuana . "
Words could not better describe his position .
McCain goes on to claim he 's seen no documentation of medical marijuana 's effectiveness , even though Granite Staters ' Stuart Cooper had personally presented him with sound scientific evidence .
Will she have better luck with Rudy Giuliani ?
Let 's see … Ouch .
Giuliani struggles when she explains that she 's allergic to the " other medications " he recommends .
He also claims not to have lobbied on behalf of OxyContin , which I guess depends on your definition of " lobbying .
" Sometimes we do n't get the answers we want .
That 's what happens when you look to the drug war for answers .
But at least we 're asking the right questions , and asking them often .
Perhaps next time we should ask if they 've seen the polling on medical marijuana .
Maybe that will get their attention .
PS : Also watch McCain insult a New Hampshire student who asks him about medical marijuana , then apologize to him .

Passengers aboard a cruise ship to the Antarctic were roused from their beds and hustled into lifeboats early today , when an iceberg punched a small hole in the ship 's side .
All 100 people aboard the Explorer were pulled safely from the frigid seas by a passing ship , but the Explorer was listing badly and its Canadian owners feared it would sink .
" The passengers are absolutely fine , " Susan Hayes , vice president of marketing for GAP Adventures , the Canadian company that owns the Explorer , told The Associated Press .
" They 're all accounted for , no injuries whatsoever . "
Hayes said 91 passengers , including 13 Americans , are currently on board the Nordnorge , a Norwegian cruise ship .
The nine crew members are also safely on board .
The Explorer 's emergency began when it struck a chunk of ice that tore a hole in its hull about the size of a fist , Hayes said .
She called the evacuation process " calm , " saying pumps were able to deal with incoming water until the Nordnorge arrived .
Argentine rescue operations received the first distress call at 11:30 Thursday night .
A statement by the Argentine navy said that the captain ordered passengers to abandon ship about 90 minutes after the first call and that they and the crew took to eight semirigid lifeboats and four life rafts , with the captain leaving the ship later .
Still , Hayes said the ship is in danger of sinking .
" It is listing . …
There is a possibility we may lose the ship . "
Capt .
Arnvid Hansen , of the Nordnorge , said the rescue operation went smoothly .
" All are aboard my vessel , " he told Britain 's BBC television .
" There are no afraid passengers or anything like that . "
" They were a bit cold and wet , but in good condition .
We have brought them aboard and gave them warm clothes and food and accommodation so they are in a good mood now , " Hansen said .
The Explorer was listing badly off King George Island , which lies about 700 miles south of Cape Horn , the tip of South America .
The ship was in the middle of a 19 - day cruise of Antarctica and the Falkland Islands that allowed passengers to observe penguins , whales and other forms of wildlife .
Earlier reports put the number of people on board at 154 , but a spokesman said that was the ship 's maximum capacity .

One of the less noted aspects of the Bush Administration 's ' War on Terror ' is the government 's simultaneous War on Language , a calculated use of Orwellian double speak .
Post 9 - 11 , the invasion of other countries became a ' preemptive strike ' , the capture and torture of civilians ' extraordinary rendition ' .
A sign on the front of the US prison in Guantanamo Bay reads ' Honor Bound to Defend Freedom ' .
Small comfort to the 460 ' unlawful combatants ' who after four years still languish inside , without any access to basic human rights .
A particularly shocking example of this phenomenon is the Department of Defense 's attitude toward suicide attempts by Guantanamo 's detainees .
Officially , 41 attempts have been admitted by the US government to date .
Speak to any of the prisoners who have been released , and they will tell you the figure is laughably low .
The reason for this discrepancy ?
No doubt aware of the adverse publicity the facility was receiving in the media , those running the prison decided to re-label suicide attempts as ' manipulative self - injurious behaviour ' or ' SIBs ' , to euphemise still further .
After reclassification , predictably the rate of attempted suicides plummeted overnight .
Nevertheless , the British journalist David Rose has written that in the six months after the new terminology came into practice , there were forty reported SIBs , almost two a week .
For our film , The Road to Guantanamo , Michael Winterbottom and I interviewed the Tipton Three , young British men who had been detained by the US in Guantanamo for over two years .
The eldest , Shafiq Rasul , paints a very different picture of suicide attempts in the prison .
' People tried to kill themselves all the time , ' he told us .
' I thought about suicide when I was there .
You can't talk to anyone back home , not even your family .
You do n't know if you 'll ever be released , or if you 'll be executed .
Eventually you just lose hope .'
This weekend , three prisoners , two Saudis and a Yemeni , finally succeeded where so many before had failed , and took their own lives .
Without access to family or lawyers , after over four years in US custody , they knotted bedsheets together and hung themselves from the grills above their cells .
Shafiq met the Saudis while being held by Northern Alliance fighters in Afghanistan .
Later , he saw them again while detained in Guantanamo .
He says , ' They were just like us : normal people .
Who knows , if we were still there , maybe it could have been us .
My only surprise is it has n't happened before . '
Spokesmen for the US have since called the deaths ' a good PR move ' by the prisoners , and ' an act of assymetrical warfare ' .
The War on Language continues .
Megan McArdle has a post up outlining the divide that developed among libertarians over foreign policy in the wake of the Iraq War :
A real non-interventionist has to accept that the United States should not have entered into World War II .
Yes , Japan attacked us , but they did so because we were encroaching on their sphere of influence .
Had we actually kept the navy within our territory , Japan would never have attacked , and we would never have entered World War II .
And no , I ’m not convinced by arguments that our intervention in WWI brought about WWII ; our role , other than urging France and Britain to mitigate their vengeance , was fairly minor .
Moreover , since we ’re not starting from some blank , non-interventionist slate now , this is not a compelling argument against entering into World War II at the time of World War II .
Some libertarians do accept that ( as does Pat Buchanan ) .
Most , especially the more moderate breed nurtured post - Reagan , ca n’t accept a philosophy which means we should have allowed more millions to die in concentration camps , left the Russians and British to starve without lend - lease , etc .
Their minds also turn to wondering how the American Revolution might have turned out had the French government adopted a similarly modest foreign policy .
If you are not willing to posit that Americans should stay home even when millions are being senselessly slaughtered , then you end up in sticky pragmatic arguments about the possibilities of inherently untrustworthy state power to counteract even more noxious state power , and how much in the way of cost we can reasonably be expected to bear in order to advance liberty .
I do n’t think there ’s an inherently libertarian answer to those questions .
Libertarians should be inherently more suspicious of the American government ’s ability to make things better than other groups–but by the same token , it seems to me that they should be inherently more suspicious of repulsive states such as the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein .
Keep in mind that when we use the word “ intervention , ” it can mean any number of things such as cutting off diplomatic relations , joining in international pressure directed at a regime that is repressing its citizens , leading or joining in an economic boycott against that regime , supporting an internal opposition aimed at overthrowing that regime , all the way up to direct military action .
This is important because the answer to the “ should we intervene ” question depends , in no small degree , on the type of intervention we ’re talking about .
The question that McArdle ’s post raises , of course , is when , if ever , the fact that a state like Iraq is violating the rights of its citizens justifies intervention in their internal affairs .
If the answer is that the existence of a repressive regime is per se justification for intervention , then you ’ve basically adopted a neo - conservative / Wilsonian idea of foreign policy , with all the attendant disasters that come from it .
And here I disagree with McArdle in one respect — the negative impact that Wilsonian interventionism had on World War I , or more specifically on the peace that followed , clearly did have an influence on the events that led to another World War less than 30 years later .
If the United States had stayed out of World War I and not intervened in the peace negotiations in Versailles that ended the war , then the treaty that ended the Great War would have , most likely , been far less punitive toward Germany , and that alone could have prevented the rise of Naziism .
If the answer to McArdle ’s question is that intervention is never justified unless the United States is directly threatened , and even sometimes not even in that case , then you ’ve basically adopted the position of the isolationists prior to World War II , who would have apparently been okay with Europe falling under Nazi rule and every Jew being sent to their death .
I do n’t think that there ’s an easy answer to this question and , in part , it depends on the kind of intervention that is being talked about .
Absent a direct threat to the United States or its interests , military action against , say , Burma , would not be justified ; but that does n’t mean that it would be impermissible under libertarian principles for the United States to suspend diplomatic relations with the Burmese junta , or to impose economic sanctions against the country in retaliation for their repression of the pro-democracy movement .
Similarly , though less convincingly , the no-fly zones that were imposed in the northern and southern Iraq from the end of the First Gulf War until the U.S. invasion in March 2003 were arguably justifiable as means to protect the Kurdish and Shiite minorities that had been terrorized by Saddam Hussein ’s forces .
Since there are gradations of “ intervention ” , many of which fall short of direct or indirect military action , I do n’t think it makes sense to say that “ intervention ” can be judged by a specific set of principles or that “ intervention ” is always per se unjustified .
Again , if you make the former argument they you are essentially saying that the United States should have stood by and done nothing in the years prior to World War II while the Nazis rolled over Europe — because Lend - Lease would have been a violation of a policy of strict non-interventionism .
I do n’t know about you , but that ’s not an outcome that I could accept .
From a very early age , perhaps the age of five or six , I knew that when I grew up I should be a writer .
Between the ages of about seventeen and twenty - four I tried to abandon this idea , but I did so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write books .
I was the middle child of three , but there was a gap of five years on either side , and I barely saw my father before I was eight .
For this and other reasons I was somewhat lonely , and I soon developed disagreeable mannerisms which made me unpopular throughout my schooldays .
I had the lonely child 's habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons , and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued .
I knew that I had a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts , and I felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life .
Nevertheless the volume of serious — i.e. seriously intended — writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pages .
I wrote my first poem at the age of four or five , my mother taking it down to dictation .
I cannot remember anything about it except that it was about a tiger and the tiger had ‘ chair - like teeth ’ — a good enough phrase , but I fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake 's ‘ Tiger , Tiger ’ .
At eleven , when the war or 1914 - 18 broke out , I wrote a patriotic poem which was printed in the local newspaper , as was another , two years later , on the death of Kitchener .
From time to time , when I was a bit older , I wrote bad and usually unfinished ‘ nature poems ’ in the Georgian style .
I also attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure .
That was the total of the would - be serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years .
However , throughout this time I did in a sense engage in literary activities .
To begin with there was the made - to - order stuff which I produced quickly , easily and without much pleasure to myself .
Apart from school work , I wrote vers d'occasion , semi-comic poems which I could turn out at what now seems to me astonishing speed — at fourteen I wrote a whole rhyming play , in imitation of Aristophanes , in about a week — and helped to edit a school magazines , both printed and in manuscript .
These magazines were the most pitiful burlesque stuff that you could imagine , and I took far less trouble with them than I now would with the cheapest journalism .
But side by side with all this , for fifteen years or more , I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different kind : this was the making up of a continuous ‘ story ’ about myself , a sort of diary existing only in the mind .
I believe this is a common habit of children and adolescents .
As a very small child I used to imagine that I was , say , Robin Hood , and picture myself as the hero of thrilling adventures , but quite soon my ‘ story ’ ceased to be narcissistic in a crude way and became more and more a mere description of what I was doing and the things I saw .
For minutes at a time this kind of thing would be running through my head : ‘ He pushed the door open and entered the room .
A yellow beam of sunlight , filtering through the muslin curtains , slanted on to the table , where a match - box , half - open , lay beside the inkpot .
With his right hand in his pocket he moved across to the window .
Down in the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf ’ , etc. etc .
This habit continued until I was about twenty - five , right through my non-literary years .
Although I had to search , and did search , for the right words , I seemed to be making this descriptive effort almost against my will , under a kind of compulsion from outside .
The ‘ story ’ must , I suppose , have reflected the styles of the various writers I admired at different ages , but so far as I remember it always had the same meticulous descriptive quality .
When I was about sixteen I suddenly discovered the joy of mere words , i.e. the sounds and associations of words .
The lines from Paradise Lost —
So hee with difficulty and labour hard
Moved on : with difficulty and labour hee .
which do not now seem to me so very wonderful , sent shivers down my backbone ; and the spelling ‘ hee ’ for ‘ he ’ was an added pleasure .
As for the need to describe things , I knew all about it already .
So it is clear what kind of books I wanted to write , in so far as I could be said to want to write books at that time .
I wanted to write enormous naturalistic novels with unhappy endings , full of detailed descriptions and arresting similes , and also full of purple passages in which words were used partly for the sake of their own sound .
And in fact my first completed novel , Burmese Days , which I wrote when I was thirty but projected much earlier , is rather that kind of book .
I give all this background information because I do not think one can assess a writer 's motives without knowing something of his early development .
His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in — at least this is true in tumultuous , revolutionary ages like our own — but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape .
It is his job , no doubt , to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature stage , in some perverse mood ; but if he escapes from his early influences altogether , he will have killed his impulse to write .
Putting aside the need to earn a living , I think there are four great motives for writing , at any rate for writing prose .
They exist in different degrees in every writer , and in any one writer the proportions will vary from time to time , according to the atmosphere in which he is living .
They are :
( i) Sheer egoism .
Desire to seem clever , to be talked about , to be remembered after death , to get your own back on the grown - ups who snubbed you in childhood , etc. , etc .
It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive , and a strong one .
Writers share this characteristic with scientists , artists , politicians , lawyers , soldiers , successful businessmen — in short , with the whole top crust of humanity .
The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish .
After the age of about thirty they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all — and live chiefly for others , or are simply smothered under drudgery .
But there is also the minority of gifted , willful people who are determined to live their own lives to the end , and writers belong in this class .
Serious writers , I should say , are on the whole more vain and self - centered than journalists , though less interested in money .
( ii ) Aesthetic enthusiasm .
Perception of beauty in the external world , or , on the other hand , in words and their right arrangement .
Pleasure in the impact of one sound on another , in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story .
Desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed .
The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers , but even a pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will have pet words and phrases which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons ; or he may feel strongly about typography , width of margins , etc .
Above the level of a railway guide , no book is quite free from aesthetic considerations .
( iii ) Historical impulse .
Desire to see things as they are , to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity .
( iv ) Political purpose . —
Using the word ‘ political ’ in the widest possible sense .
Desire to push the world in a certain direction , to alter other peoples ’ idea of the kind of society that they should strive after .
Once again , no book is genuinely free from political bias .
The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude .
It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one another , and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to time .
By nature — taking your ‘ nature ’ to be the state you have attained when you are first adult — I am a person in whom the first three motives would outweigh the fourth .
In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive books , and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties .
As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer .
First I spent five years in an unsuitable profession ( the Indian Imperial Police , in Burma ) , and then I underwent poverty and the sense of failure .
This increased my natural hatred of authority and made me for the first time fully aware of the existence of the working classes , and the job in Burma had given me some understanding of the nature of imperialism : but these experiences were not enough to give me an accurate political orientation .
Then came Hitler , the Spanish Civil War , etc .
By the end of 1935 I had still failed to reach a firm decision .
I remember a little poem that I wrote at that date , expressing my dilemma :
A happy vicar I might have been
Two hundred years ago
To preach upon eternal doom
And watch my walnuts grow ;
But born , alas , in an evil time ,
I missed that pleasant haven ,
For the hair has grown on my upper lip
And the clergy are all clean - shaven .
And later still the times were good ,
We were so easy to please ,
We rocked our troubled thoughts to sleep
On the bosoms of the trees .
All ignorant we dared to own
The joys we now dissemble ;
The greenfinch on the apple bough
Could make my enemies tremble .
But girl 's bellies and apricots ,
Roach in a shaded stream ,
Horses , ducks in flight at dawn ,
All these are a dream .
It is forbidden to dream again ;
We maim our joys or hide them :
Horses are made of chromium steel
And little fat men shall ride them .
I am the worm who never turned ,
The eunuch without a harem ;
Between the priest and the commissar
I walk like Eugene Aram ;
And the commissar is telling my fortune
While the radio plays ,
But the priest has promised an Austin Seven ,
For Duggie always pays .
I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls ,
And woke to find it true ;
I was n't born for an age like this ;
Was Smith ?
Was Jones ?
Were you ?
The Spanish war and other events in 1936 - 37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood .
Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written , directly or indirectly , against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism , as I understand it .
It seems to me nonsense , in a period like our own , to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects .
Everyone writes of them in one guise or another .
It is simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows .
And the more one is conscious of one 's political bias , the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one 's aesthetic and intellectual integrity .
What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art .
My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship , a sense of injustice .
When I sit down to write a book , I do not say to myself , ‘ I am going to produce a work of art ’ .
I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose , some fact to which I want to draw attention , and my initial concern is to get a hearing .
But I could not do the work of writing a book , or even a long magazine article , if it were not also an aesthetic experience .
Anyone who cares to examine my work will see that even when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a full - time politician would consider irrelevant .
I am not able , and do not want , completely to abandon the world view that I acquired in childhood .
So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style , to love the surface of the earth , and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information .
It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself .
The job is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes with the essentially public , non-individual activities that this age forces on all of us .
It is not easy .
It raises problems of construction and of language , and it raises in a new way the problem of truthfulness .
Let me give just one example of the cruder kind of difficulty that arises .
My book about the Spanish civil war , Homage to Catalonia , is of course a frankly political book , but in the main it is written with a certain detachment and regard for form .
I did try very hard in it to tell the whole truth without violating my literary instincts .
But among other things it contains a long chapter , full of newspaper quotations and the like , defending the Trotskyists who were accused of plotting with Franco .
Clearly such a chapter , which after a year or two would lose its interest for any ordinary reader , must ruin the book .
A critic whom I respect read me a lecture about it .
‘ Why did you put in all that stuff ? ’ he said .
‘ You 've turned what might have been a good book into journalism . ’
What he said was true , but I could not have done otherwise .
I happened to know , what very few people in England had been allowed to know , that innocent men were being falsely accused .
If I had not been angry about that I should never have written the book .
In one form or another this problem comes up again .
The problem of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss .
I will only say that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly .
In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing , you have always outgrown it .
Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried , with full consciousness of what I was doing , to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole .
I have not written a novel for seven years , but I hope to write another fairly soon .
It is bound to be a failure , every book is a failure , but I do know with some clarity what kind of book I want to write .
Looking back through the last page or two , I see that I have made it appear as though my motives in writing were wholly public - spirited .
I do n't want to leave that as the final impression .
All writers are vain , selfish , and lazy , and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery .
Writing a book is a horrible , exhausting struggle , like a long bout of some painful illness .
One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand .
For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention .
And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one 's own personality .
Good prose is like a windowpane .
I cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest , but I know which of them deserve to be followed .
And looking back through my work , I see that it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages , sentences without meaning , decorative adjectives and humbug generally .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) -
The NATO force in Afghanistan does not have enough troops or equipment to secure advances made against Taliban insurgents and to guarantee a successful end to its mission , a lawmakers ’ report concluded on Friday .
U.S. troops present arms during a ceremony for the victims of the 9/11 attacks on the anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 attacks , at the Bagram airbase , the major hub of U.S. - led operations in Afghanistan , September 11 , 2007 .

The findings of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly , which draws legislators from 42 countries , echoes recent complaints by NATO commanders that troop shortages are hampering operations and come as some allies face domestic pressure to pull troops out .
“ The NATO mission still suffers from a lack of personnel and assets , ” the assembly ’s Defence and Security Committee concluded after a six - day tour of allied operations last week which included talks with local and national Afghan officials .
“ Fundamentally , the delegation came away with a sense that current efforts are making significant incremental progress , but not at a rate that will ensure without doubt an acceptable end state to our mission there , ” it concluded .
The report did not recommend how many reinforcements were needed on top of the 50,000 troops currently under NATO and U.S. command .
The most pressing needs included more helicopters , intelligence and reconnaissance assets and trainers to build up the Afghan security forces , it said .
NATO commanders say they have had success in wresting towns from the Taliban and handing them back to government control , only to watch them be re-taken by insurgents because of the weakness of local Afghan army or police forces .
NATO wants to accelerate efforts to train up the Afghan army but is facing resistance from many allies who refuse to send either troops or trainers into the southern heartlands of the Taliban where most fighting takes place .
“ Consolidation means being able to ensure that the insurgents do not return , ” NATO Parliamentary Assembly Secretary - General Simon Lunn told Reuters .
“ ‘ More ’ in this case would imply more boots on the ground , more trainers and more enablers , ” he said , using the military term for helicopters and other vital operational equipment .
Top soldiers including U.S. General Dan McNeill , commander of the NATO - led force in Afghanistan , and General Ray Henault , the Canadian who heads up NATO ’s Military Committee in Brussels , have in recent days complained of troop shortfalls .
But they have stopped short of making specific calls for more troops at a time when key allies such as Canada and the Netherlands -- both in the south -- face tough decisions about extending their missions in the face of domestic opposition .
The NATO Parliamentary Assembly draws its members from the 26 NATO allies and 16 other countries .
Its aims range from making the alliance more accountable to fostering dialogue on security issues .

It bothers me when I hear people describe a personal set of conditions that need to be met before they can make the next move in their life .
Most often , they ’re just making excuses — creating obstacles that are n’t actually there , placing the blame on some outside force they can’t control , and choosing to let day after day of inaction turn into many years of waiting for their cosmos to align .
In other words , they stay where they ’re comfortable until it ’s the perfect time to move on .
“ Once I find a better job , then I ’ll leave this one . ”
“ Once I save enough money , then I ’ll stop living at my parents ’ place . ”
“ Once I ’m out of this stressful period of my life , then I ’ll quit smoking . ”
What ’s even worse are the people who connect their obstacles in a way that makes their current situation circular , like a trap they will never escape :
“ I ca n’t pursue my dream career unless I leave my job , but I ca n’t pay the bills unless I stay at my job . ”
Then there ’s also the people who have a thousand complaints about their life .
They typically do n’t even explain any connections between their obstacles , they just rant about anything that ’s causing them stress , but do nothing to correct any of it .
They ’re so overwhelmed they do n’t even know where to begin , and their easiest option is to give up .
If any of this sounds familiar , then my advice to you is this :
Stop waiting for that “ perfect time ” to make your next move .
Perfect timing does n’t exist .
It ’s fictional .
You ’ll wait forever for it .
There will never be a perfect time to leave your job , move out of state , and start from scratch .
Similarly , there will never be a perfect time to get married , have a baby , or have another baby .
That ’s because no matter when you make these choices , they will involve risk — and it ’s the risk involved that makes choices like these easier to put off until another day .
What you often fail to realize is you ’re not just waiting , you ’re stagnating .
You stop growing , hinder your advancement , and basically become dull as a result of your choice to keep life on pause .
If your current job is holding you back , then you should quit .
Seriously .
You can quit your dead - end job today .
Just walk straight up to your boss and say “ I quit . ”
Leave and do n’t come back .
The place wo n’t crumble without you .
They ’ll find a replacement and be just fine .
Then hop in your car and drive across the country just to see that you can .
Just for fun .
Just to help you remember that you have a choice .
No car ?
Hitchhike .
Not your thing ?
Walk .
I ’m sure you see my point :
You have more freedom than you realize .
So if you want to create change in your life , then stop waiting .
Let go of perfection and act .
Once you have , you ’ll only regret you did n’t start doing it sooner .

After the invasion , they were Iraqi pariahs , seen by Americans as remaining too loyal to Saddam Hussein to be trusted .
Members of the ruling Baath party , many of them Sunni Arabs , were purged from the country 's ministries and military in an aggressive de-Baathification program initiated by then US administrator Paul Bremer and , later , misconstrued by the new Shiite political elite to serve their ambitions .
But now the Americans are trying to reverse much of the impact of the de-Baathification policies .
Analysts and the US itself say that that approach – along with disbanding the former army – polarized Iraqi society and helped fuel the violent Sunni-led insurgency .
Reintegrating many former Baath Party members , as a way to weaken support for the insurgency , has become one of Washington 's top priorities and a cornerstone of its new strategy here .
In fact , US zeal for reversing de-Baathification has been so intense that a source close to the process told the Monitor that Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdel - Mahdi was summoned to Washington in mid-March to discuss the issue .
Upon his return to Baghdad , the source says , he met with former US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad to draft a bill to reform anti-Baath policies .
Before leaving Iraq , Mr. Khalilzad lobbied hard for the bill , the Iraqi source says , wanting President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki to sign it ahead of a recent Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia , a gesture of goodwill to Sunnis in Iraq and to those in the region critical of the Shiite government 's perceived treatment of their Iraqi coreligionists .
" The prime minister was fuming because of the pressure , and how such an issue was being used by the White House for its argument with Congress on funding for the war , " said the source , who added that Mr. Maliki 's only solace was that his Shiite allies in parliament , who include partisans of anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , would realize " how pro-Baath the bill is and would change it . "
Indeed , the US continues to face much opposition from Shiite leaders in Iraq .
Several Iraqi officials say that the Shiite - dominated parliament has already decided to water down a de-Baathification reform bill sent to it last month by Mr. Talabani and Maliki to render it meaningless .
Others say that even if lawmakers were to pass it as is , it would , contrary to claims by the Bush administration , have little impact on promoting reconciliation because it 's too late .
" It looks to be a little late .
It has become very tough , " says Mahmoud Othman , a Kurdish parliamentarian close to Talabani .
" Even after the hanging of Saddam [ Hussein ] , there are those who have become tougher and say ' nothing Baathist will come back . ' "
On his visit to Iraq last week , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Maliki during a meeting Friday that Iraqi lawmakers should not take their summer recess until they passed a series of laws , including the one dealing with de-Baathification reform titled The Reconciliation and Accountability Law .
" It 's clear to me from the beginning that an enormous priority for Iraq , and for all of us , is a national reconciliation process that brings all Iraqis together in a single nation working for common purposes , " Ryan Crocker , the new US ambassador in Baghdad , told state - owned Iraqiya TV last week .
" I see this whole process of de-Baathification reform as leading to that end … we need to push forward . "
The Monitor has obtained an English - language draft of the bill , identical to the one sent to parliament in Arabic , with the following headline : " Mahdi Debaath version 3 , March 21 , 2007 . "
The US denies that it wrote the draft law , but says it " facilitated dialogue and briefed key leaders on US government goals for reform . "
The bill makes it easier for senior members of the party who committed no crimes to obtain pensions .
It also offers those who worked in Mr. Hussein 's myriad security agencies the chance to either get a job in the present Army or police or receive a pension .
It also clips the wings of the controversial de-Baathification Commission , a special government agency , by vesting more powers in independent judges and would fold the commission altogether in six months .
But the executive director of the de-Baathification Commission , Ali al - Lami , calls " unconstitutional " elements of the reform bill , such as dissolving the commission and setting a three - month statute of limitation for all claims against former Baathists .
Waiting to be de-Baathified
Nawal Abed - Ali Hmoud has been waiting in vain for close to four years to be de-Baathified , the term for ex-Baath members who have gone through a reeducation program administered by the de-Baathification Commission .
Until this occurs , she cannot regain her $ 300 - a- month job as a typist at the state - owned Rashid Bank .
The commission has de-Baathified some 16,500 Iraqis .
After Bremer first enacted the policy , about 140,000 former Baath members were kicked out of jobs .
Just over 100,000 low - level Baathists were later returned to their jobs .
Ms. Hmoud was fired from her job in September 2003 .
She , like millions of her compatriots , had simply joined the Baath Party out of economic expediency .
But , she says , she is losing hope that she will be de-Baathified soon .
In the meantime , to make ends meet , she has set up a candy shop in an abandoned store in northern Baghdad where she had come with her family to flee sectarian violence in their own neighborhood .
" I am utterly convinced now that this commission is a sham and that the only Baathists that are returned to work are the ones that pay bribes or have someone to back them , " she says .
The irony is that more than 20 years ago Ms. Hmoud and her sister helped a neighbor escape Hussein 's henchmen .
He was wanted for membership in Maliki's then banned Shiite political party .
The Baathist threat
In an interview at his Baghdad office , Mr. Lami says that while the work of his commission is now focused on the fate of just 21,500 former Baathists – out of 12 million Iraqis who ranged from sympathizers to active members – the body must continue to exist to make sure all government institutions are cleansed of the Baath Party 's " totalitarian " ways .
" Baath , not Al - Qaeda , is Iraq 's biggest enemy , " he says .
The party has not given up its ambition to return to power , he says , through both armed and political means .
Lami says that he has lists that prove that all the heads of the main Sunni Arab insurgency groups are senior Baathists .
While most lawmakers backed the commission 's work , he says , some Iraqi politicians were " misguided " in their effort to link reconciliation to the commission 's work and that the Shiite United Iraqi Alliance ( UIA ) parliamentary bloc , to which Maliki belongs , must remember that it was only able to sweep into power because of an anti-Baath platform .
" If they appear to be retreating from their campaign promises , then they would be committing treason toward the people that voted for them , " Lami says .
He nonetheless admits that his commission is helpless when it comes to reining in provincial authorities , mainly Shiite ones , and making sure they pursued a more balanced approach to de-Baathification .
He recounts how his commission , which is chaired by former Washington favorite Ahmed Chalabi , recently recommended that a group of former school teachers be returned to their jobs in Karbala after it was proven that they committed no crimes and after they had been de-Baathified .
But the province refused after leaflets were circulated on the city 's streets warning that the teachers would be killed if they came back .
Yet research on solar power and methods for storing intermittent energy has long received less spending , both in the United States and in other industrialized countries , than energy options with more political support .
Indeed , there are few major programs looking for ways to drastically reduce the cost of converting sunlight to energy and — of equal if not more importance — of efficiently storing it for when the sun is not shining .
Scientists are hoping to expand the range of sunlight ’s wavelengths that can be absorbed , and to cut the amount of energy the cells lose to heat .
One goal is to make materials to force photons to ricochet around inside the silicon to give up more of their energy .
For decades , conventional nuclear power and nuclear fusion received dominant shares of government energy - research money .
While venture capitalists often support the commercialization of new technologies , basic research money comes almost entirely from the federal government .
These days , a growing amount of government money is headed to the farm - state favorite , biofuels , and to research on burning coal while capturing the resulting carbon dioxide , the main heat - trapping smokestack gas .
In the current fiscal year , the Energy Department plans to spend $ 159 million on solar research and development .
It will spend nearly double , $ 303 million , on nuclear energy research and development , and nearly triple , $ 427 million , on coal , as well as $ 167 million on other fossil fuel research and development .
Raymond L. Orbach , the under secretary of energy for science , said the administration ’s challenge was to spread a finite pot of money to all the technologies that will help supply energy without adding to global warming .
“ No one source of energy that we know of is going to solve it , ” Dr. Orbach said .
“ This is about a portfolio . ”
TAIPEI / SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A new generation of super - thin , power - sipping displays is making its way to the market , stretching battery lives to new limits and perhaps one day posing a challenge to heavier , energy - gobbling LCDs .
A visitor looks at new G- series Aquos LCD TVs from Sharp Corp. at a launch event in Tokyo July 2 , 2007 .
The TV features a compact design with the industry 's thinnest profile of 8.1 cm and the double - speed 120 - Hz frame rate LCD panel for fast - motion images .
A new generation of super - thin , power - sipping displays is making its way to the market , stretching battery lives to new limits and perhaps one day posing a challenge to heavier , energy - gobbling LCDs .
New screens that glow on their own are taking on their clunkier liquid crystal display rivals -- which require powerful backlighting -- by producing sharper video images for smartphones , game consoles and portable media players .
But industry watchers say it will be years before a clear winner -- if any -- emerges with the clout to outdo LCDs .
Organic light - emitting diode ( OLED ) and bi-stable technologies are the most likely challengers to LCDs .
An OLED screen uses as much as 40 percent less power than a comparable LCD and could be twice as thin because it does not need backlighting .
These technologies are already being used in some smaller portable devices , such as music players from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930.KS and Reigncom Ltd. 060570.KQ
and a thin mobile phone from Kyocera .
And Sony Corp. 6758 .T plans to sell small - sized TVs using the OLED technology later this year .
“ In hand - held devices , display consumes power most .
It ’s all about power and then maybe brightness , ” said Lehman Brothers analyst James Kim in South Korea .
Analysts reckon Apple's AAPL.O iPhone , which launched in the United States on Friday , may end up using more energy - efficient screens , such as OLED , given the short battery life of its pilot models with LCD screens .
“ It makes sense ( for Apple ) to move to OLED screens .
They are working to improve the battery issue , ” said Kim Woon - ho , an analyst at Prudential Investment & Securities .
“ OLED makers have some expectations for Apple ’s switch , too , although there ’s no firm plan yet . ”
Apple was not available for comment .
IN ON THE ACT
The commercial for these new display types has caught the eye of some LCD makers , like Samsung SDI Co. 006400.KS and Sony , given that LCD prices have plunged by a third in the last year .
Samsung SDI is already making OLED screens , while Taiwan 's Chi Mei EL Corp. ( CMEL ) -- an pure OLED maker owned by LCD company Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. 3009 .
TW -- is running at full capacity .
The market for low - power forms of OLED and low power LCD displays is set to grow rapidly , reaching $ 24 billion in sales by 2012 , rising at an annual growth rate of 27 percent from $ 6 billion in 2007 , according to market researcher iSuppli Corp .
Developing new technology is costly , so some LCD producers like LG .
Philips LCD Co. Ltd. 034220.KS are improving existing LCDs -- using new power control technology and optical sensors for backlight units .
“ LCD companies are working to improve LCD panels , ” Prudential ’s Kim said .
“ It may take years for the ( OLED ) market to grow if the trend continues . ”
But some industry experts reckon OLED technology -- which began life powering car radios -- may end up on large televisions .
OLED producers will have to improve the organic material used between the two electrodes which illuminate the screen , and costs will have to come down before OLEDs become widely used in cellphones , PCs and flat - screen TVs .
“ The price of an OLED display is 1.7 to 1.8 times higher than that of a LCD and it wo n’t become more competitive until after the price falls sharply , ” CMEL President Peter Chen said .
A rival to OLED technology are bi-stable displays , which retain images without power , making them suitable for public displays and sub- screens on devices , although bi-stable displays have image quality issues .
Another product is color flexible OLED display .
LG .
Philips LCD recently unveiled a 4 - inch full - color flexible OLED display , although the size is still too small for handheld e-books .
And that ’s just the beginning .
One day , versions of newspapers and magazines that are updated wirelessly might be rolled up or folded , and carried like a piece of paper , for instance .
“ That ’s when we will see real differentiation ( with other display technologies ) , ” said Chung Ho-kyoon , Samsung SDI ’s chief technology officer .

John Resig 's blog post on Flexible Javascript Events presents cross - browser functions to register and deregister DOM events to / from any DOM element : addEvent ( ) and removeEvent ( ) .
He wrote these functions in response to a addEvent ( ) recoding contest , that was published at a well - known site for Web developers run by Peter - Paul Koch and included Scott Andrew LePera , Dean Edwards and John Resig himself as co-judges .
The recoding contest itself was a response to wide interest in his blog post addEvent ( ) considered harmful where he outlined a problem with a widely used function addEvent ( ) published by Scott Andrew LePera .
It should also be noted that John Resig 's entry was judged as the winner entry .
Most web developers are familiar with the names mentioned in the previous paragraph .
They have published books , maintain highly visible websites ( Google PageRank of websites / blogs maintained by Peter - Paul Koch , Dean Edwards , John Resig , Scott Andrew LePera are 9 , 8 , 7 and 7 , respectively at the time of this blog post ) , blog regularly and are generally considered gurus in the area of client side web development .
I add all this background only to make the point that writing cross - browser DOM event handling code is non-trivial and has attracted the attention of best minds in the field .
With that feeling of comfort that comes with being in good hands , one would think that the problem , although considered difficult in the past , has been solved once and for all and can be reused without much thought .
At least this is what I thought till some strange behavior in my AJAX code that used John Resig 's winning addEvent ( ) and removeEvent ( ) forced me to analyze each and every line of the whole program and discovered a couple of really interesting things about the addEvent ( ) function .
But before I get into my discovery , let us take a look at the addEvent ( ) code from John Resig 's page :
function addEvent ( obj , type , fn ) { if ( obj.attachEvent ) { obj [ 'e '+ type+fn ] = fn ; obj[ type+fn ] = function ( ) {obj [ ' e'+type+fn ] ( window.event ) ;} obj.attachEvent( ' o n '+ type , obj[ type+fn ] ) ; } else obj.addEventListener( type , fn , false ) ; }
As you can see , this code takes on two issues with IE 's support for DOM events : ( a ) IE uses a non-standard method attachEvent ( ) to register event handlers ; and ( b ) it runs the handler code in the global context ( ie ; built - in variable this is set to window object during handler execution ) and not in the context of the element to which the handler is registered .
The removeEvent ( ) code is very similar and does n't need to be reproduced here .
So , what is the problem ?
Actually , none whatsoever , at least not until you have an event handler function that is few tens of lines long and you pass the name of the function as the last argument to addEvent ( ) function .
If you are like me , you would think that the code will either use the function name string or some kind of address to create a short string as key to store the handler function reference within the DOM element object .
But what really happens is that whole text of the handler function consisting of few tens of lines of code becomes part of the key ( key is ' on ' + type + fn ) .
In my code I had a key with length greater than 2000 !
This in itself would not be much of a problem if the key was created only once during registration and then used for lookup during handler execution , though even a lookup in a hash table with very long strings is probably going to tax the JavaScript interpreter badly .
The killer is that the key gets created every time the handler is run .
This could be very frequent if the event type is ' mousemove ' and could easily result in excessive memory use and sluggish behavior .
" This does n't sound like an insurmountable problem , " you may say , " just wrap your long function within another function that simply invokes the long function .
This way the addEvent ( ) code will use the body of the wrapper function for forming the key and avoid creation of long strings . "
Actually , this is very similar to what I tried , my motivation bring two - fold : reduce the length of the code that gets used as part of the key and also pass an argument at the time of event handler registration .
The wrapper creation function looked something like this :
function create_handler ( func , arg1 ) { return function ( event ) { return lfunc.call ( null , event || window.event , arg1 ) ; } }
And I used it as follows :
function long_function ( event , arg1 ) { ... tens of lines of code ... } addEvent ( obj , ' mousemove ' , create_handler ( long_function , arg1 ) ) ;
which , actually , ended up creating this fixed text for every function : " function ( event ) { return lfunc.call ( null , event || window.event , arg1 ) ; } " .
As the key is a created by concatenating the even type and function text , same key will be created for different handlers if the event type remains same , causing overwrite !
This actually happened in my code !
So , even the winning entry has skeletons in the cupboard .
It is not that every use would result in broken programs , but there certainly are situations where they fall short .
In fact , this is true for most library function and it is always a good practice to know not only the interface and purpose but also the underlying assumptions and how the thing actually works .
To be fair to the author John Resig , the recoding contest post had a strict set of requirements and being a reusable function under different conditions was not one of those .

Tuesday night PBS Frontline aired " Showdown with Iran , " which completely laid bare the failures of the Bush administration 's foreign policy .
Despite the U.S. ' long history with Iran that resulted in the blowback in the form of the ' 79 Iranian Revolution that brought the current Islamic Republic to power largely based on its hatred of America , Iran had reached out to the U.S. after 9/11 , denouncing terrorism and became an important ally of the coalition against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Iran 's leaders had even tendered " a secret proposal for a grand bargain resolving all outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran , including Iran 's support for terrorism and its nuclear program " which Bushco simply ignored ( forgot ? ) , opting instead to include them in his " Axis of Evil " on his 2002 State of the Union Address , which once again angered the nation , completely discrediting their moderate reformist leadership and ultimately helped bring the hard - line party of Ahmadinejad to power .
Infected dogs are the most common cause of human infection
Edinburgh University 's Royal Dick Vet School staff have carried out extensive research into the disease , which kills about 55,000 people per year .
If enough domestic dogs are vaccinated , worldwide the disease cycle could be broken leaving no threat to humans .
They hope village - based campaigns could reach 70 % of the dog population .
The first World Rabies Day took place on Friday .
Children are most at risk of being bitten by a rabid animal and in sub-Saharan Africa it can cost 40 % of an annual income to pay for post - exposure vaccination and hospital visits
Sarah Cleaveland
Edinburgh University
Edinburgh University staff are working with vaccine manufacturer Intervet on a programme to eradicate the disease in the Serengeti region of east Africa .
This follows work by the university which found all animals infected with rabies there had a variant of the disease that originated from the domestic dog .
Staff at the university 's vet school have also been involved in setting up the Alliance for Rabies Control , a Scottish - based charity established to combat the disease .
They claim that in areas where there is a high prevalence of the disease , such as Africa and Asia , the need for vaccination schemes has often been overlooked , despite the fact this would cost less than other healthcare programmes .
Hospital visits
Vet school staff member Sarah Cleaveland , one of the alliance 's board members , said : " Very few people in Western Europe will ever die from rabies , but for those affected in developing countries it can cause immeasurable suffering .
" Children are most at risk of being bitten by a rabid animal and in sub-Saharan Africa it can cost 40 % of an annual income to pay for post - exposure vaccination and hospital visits .
" It 's estimated that in Africa and Asia almost eight million people a year receive costly post - exposure prophylaxis , yet the cost to eradicate rabies is comparatively small compared to other healthcare programmes . "
More than 45 countries across the world are holding events throughout September to raise awareness of the need to control the spread of the disease .
Claim : Photographs show an encounter between a polar bear and some sled dogs .
Status : True .
Examples : [ Collected via e-mail , 2006 ]
Norbert Rosing ’s striking images of a wild polar bear playing with sled dogs in the wilds of Canada ’s Hudson Bay .
The photographer was sure that he was going to see the end of his huskies when the polar bear materialized out of the blue :
Obviously it was a well - fed Bear …
The Polar Bear returned every night that week to play with the dogs …
Photographs © Norbert Rosing
Origins : These
remarkable and amusing images of an encounter between a polar bear and some sled dogs were snapped by German wildlife photographer Norbert Rosing , whose work has often been featured in National Geographic .
Rosing regularly travels to the western coast of Canada ’s Hudson Bay ( near Churchill , Manitoba ) to photograph polar bears , and in 2006 he published The World of the Polar Bear , an engaging collection of images and text that follows a family of polar bears over the course of a year , from the cubs ’ first entry into the world outside their snow cave in the spring through their trek across the ice of frozen seas in winter .
These particular pictures ( and some of the text ) were lifted from a talk and accompanying slide show given by Stuart Brown , a psychiatrist who specializes in the study of the evolution of human and animal play , and the founder of the National Institute for Play .
We note that although these photographs are genuine , the interpretation of what they depict is somewhat subjective .
Although most lay observers would characterize the activity shown in these images as “ play , ” animal behavioralists differ as to whether it truly constitutes play ( i.e. , activity engaged in purely for pleasure ) or whether that description is an anthropomorphization of more instinctive , survival - based behaviors .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A 4 - year - old British boy who released a balloon with a message hoping to find a pen pal in a foreign land ended up having a correspondence with the Queen .
Tom Stancombe let go of his helium balloon in Hampshire , west of London , but rather than flying across to France or half way around the world , it ended up just 20 miles away , landing inside Windsor Castle , the Daily Mail reported .
The Queen instructed her personal assistant to reply and so the monarch and the boy , helped by his parents , exchanged a series of letters , mostly about the fact that one of the boy ’s ancestors , an artist , had works in the royal art collection .
“ She ( the Queen ) was delighted to find that your balloon had traveled all the way to the gardens at Windsor Castle , ” the monarch ’s assistant wrote .
Asked if he thought his son would be exchanging any more letters with the Queen , Tom ’s father said : “ I do n’t expect we ’ll get another one , but I think it ’s incredible they bothered replying at all . ”

Slow - growing coral species are at risk from trawling
They said more than $ 150 m ( £ 80 m ) was paid to trawler fleets , promoting overfishing of unviable resources .
In particular danger were slow - growing deep - sea fish and coral species caught by bottom trawling , they argued .
2006 UN talks failed to implement a ban on the method , which uses heavy nets and crushing rollers on the sea floor .
" Eliminating global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on overfishing and vulnerable deep - sea ecosystems , " said Dr Rashid Sumaila , of the University of British Columbia .
Travel money
Eleven nations have bottom - trawling fleets , with Spain 's being the biggest .
Researchers at the University of British Columbia estimate that without subsidies , these fleets would operate at a loss of $ 50 m ( £ 27 m ) annually .
Coral clearance : Bottom - trawling and its bycatch
In pictures
" There is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1 billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old - growth fish , " said Dr Daniel Pauly , one of the researchers who has looked at the issue .
Japan , South Korea , Russia , Australia and France are amongst the other countries that subside their trawlers .
Continuing payments to these fleets would inevitably lead to depleted fisheries , said Dr Pauly .
" You get a signal from the stock - I am old , I am rare and I am depleted , " he said .
" Subsidies allow you to overlook that signal and keep fishing to the end . "
Slow reproduction
Deep - sea species that are currently caught by deep - sea trawling methods include orange roughy , previously known as slimeheads , and Patagonian toothfish , better known as Chilean sea bass .
The fish were renamed to be more palatable to consumers .
Cold - water species like the orange roughy are particularly at risk because they lead such long lives .
" This is a species that grows so slowly that it might not reach sexual maturity until it is 34 years old and they live to be 150 years old , " said Dr Selina Heppell , from Oregon State University .
" There is a strong correlation between living a long time and not reproducing very quickly so they are very easy to over exploit . "
The fish also tend to cluster around seamounts and cold - water coral reefs .
Because deep - sea fishing methods are so indiscriminate these ecosystems can easily be destroyed .
Ancient species
" The corals like the fishes are extremely slow growing ; they 're also extremely long lived , " said Dr Murray Roberts of the Scottish Association for Marine Science .
Species can live for up to 2,000 years , making them the longest - lived organisms in the sea .
" These animals can live for hundreds of years but they can be removed in one sweep , " he said .
They are also important he said because the corals were an archive of past climates , locking in the chemical signatures of past sea water .
" We not only run the risk of losing a structure that supports fish but also a climate archive that we have only just begun to unravel , " said Dr Roberts .
Slow movement
Last year , conservation groups and governments from countries such as the Netherlands and Norway argued for a ban on bottom - trawling at the United Nations .
But the talks ended with only an agreement for some precautionary measures to ensure that trawlers do not cause significant damage to marine ecosystems .
The compromise declared areas where deep - sea corals and other vulnerable species occur closed to bottom - trawling , unless fishing nations can prove their activities will do no harm .
And on 2 February this year , Japan , Korea , Russia and the US agreed to phase in a management plan for deep - sea fisheries around seamounts in the Northwest Pacific .
But even with these agreements , the scientists , assembled in San Francisco for the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting , believe subsides need to be scrapped .
" From an ecological perspective , we cannot afford to destroy the deep sea , " said Dr Sumaila .
" From an economic perspective , deep - sea fisheries cannot occur without government subsidies .
" The bottom line is that current deep fisheries are not sustainable . "

George Bush : HIV / AIDS Relief Superhero

PEPFAR has never gotten much … Read More By Joey Kurtzman / June 1 , 2007
If you do n’t know that George Bush just doubled the size of PEPFAR , the Bush anti-HIV / AIDS initiative that was already the largest and most ambitious anti-disease program in human history , you should n’t feel too bad .
PEPFAR has never gotten much media attention , and this week ’s stunning announcement was no different .
Here are the dull details , accurately presented by Dan Turner in an L.A.
Times op -ed :
Today , Bush upped the ante by asking Congress to double the size of his AIDS program , the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , to $ 30 billion over five years .
That is a vast commitment that dwarfs past efforts and provides real hope that humanity will in the near future be able to stop the spread of AIDS — an accomplishment akin , at least in scope , to putting a man on the moon .
This disease has killed 25 million people so far and is still raging out of control , especially in Africa .
According to Newsmap , which visually represents how much attention a given topic gets from the international newsmedia , the top story in the UK last night was “ Hamas says Israel wounds 2 Gaza gunmen . ”
PEPFAR ?
I ca n’t find it on the UK Newsmap at all .
Or on the American one .
Or the Canadian or French or Spanish or Australian or German or any of the others .
But can you blame them ?
Is n't it all a bit dull ?
I mean , how many stories are you going to write about the fact , as Turner puts it , George Bush “ has done more to relieve poverty and disease in Africa … than any other American president ” ?
My own interest is partly due to a memorable conversation I had with an HIV pharmacologist from the Infectious Disease Institute in Kampala , Uganda .
She described how people like her had spent the Clinton administration tirelessly but fruitlessly begging Clinton and other world leaders to send the antiretroviral medication needed to save the lives of those infected .
As she watched patient after patient die for lack of meds readily available in the West , progress was virtually non-existent .
By the end of the Clinton administration , the number of people in all of sub -Saharan Africa receiving ARV therapy was still pitifully small , almost darkly absurd : 50,000 .
Then Clinton left , Bush arrived , and before long she was struggling with a very different sort of challenge : finding enough doctors to prescribe the crates of ARV meds that kept arriving .
“ Bush ’s money , ” as she repeatedly referred to it , had changed everything .
I hope we can celebrate PEPFAR as a boon for HIV - infected Africans without being insensitive to the plight of the progressive , socially - conscious Westerners who find the program ’s existence so irritating .
You ’ll get a sense of their confusion and pain if you play a little parlor game I ’ve developed .
Find an article on PEPFAR in a left - of - center publication , and see how long it takes to spot an egregious factual error or misrepresentation that conveniently diminishes the accomplishments of the program .
For a taste of egregious factual error , try this line from an extremely rare attempt by Counterpunch to write about PEPFAR : " three - fourths of the monies allocated for treatment must be spent on the purchase and distribution of antiretroviral drugs from U.S. pharmaceutical manufactures and cannot be substituted by generic alternatives . "
Well …no .
Not exactly .
Or even at all .
PEPFAR uses both foreign - made and generic drugs .
In cases in which a foreign - manufactured drug violates a patent held by an American pharmaceutical company , the FDA still approves the drug for use by PEPFAR though not for sale in the U.S. itself .
So the Counterpunch quote is dead wrong , a plain fabrication that portrays the Bush administration and PEPFAR as slaves to corporate avarice .
The upcoming FCC 700 MHz spectrum auction certainly has spurred both lively debate and , at times , heated rhetoric .
With the FCC set to vote tomorrow on the rules for the auction , I thought it would be useful to summarize briefly where things stand at this point .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has stated from the beginning that his number one priority is to make broadband available to all Americans through a “ third pipe ” to the home ( in addition to telephone and cable company broadband service ) .
In support of that viewpoint , the Chairman has taken a bold stand for consumer choice by proposing that licensees must allow the use of any device or application on a specified portion of the 700 MHz spectrum .
This approach -- if crafted with appropriately effective and enforceable provisions -- would free consumers from burdensome and artificial constraints on what they can do with their phones and software .
These license conditions for the first time will enable device and applications competition at the " edges " of the wireless network .
Unfortunately , these same conditions fall well short of Chairman Martin 's own goal of fostering the creation of a third pipe competitor .
As long as incumbents are motivated by a desire to protect their current business models , and can continue to use a “ blocking premium ” to thwart fair market rates , they have every incentive to outbid would - be rivals .
Such an auction outcome will constitute business as usual -- with no new broadband options in sight for consumers .
Google has joined numerous public interest groups and other Web companies in seeking more fundamental “ wholesale open access ” conditions .
We believe these additional conditions would ensure that , no matter who wins the auction , consumers , along with service providers of all shapes and sizes , will have a seat at the table .
We even committed to invest at least $ 4.6 billion in such a scenario , despite the fact that we have not traditionally been a communications company .
Some have criticized us for , in their view , rigging the auction to our own benefit .
We think quite the reverse is true : only by imposing certain openness conditions will potential new market entrants have a fair shot at successfully bidding in the auction .
Openness , user choice , and innovation have been elements fundamental to the rise and success of the Internet .
We believe those same elements are critical for even the possibility of new broadband competition in the wireless space .
If the FCC ultimately decides not to adopt " wholesale open access " license conditions , we do not see how significant new competition can emerge from this auction .
The time for debate is drawing to a close .
The five FCC commissioners are this moment contemplating the relative merits of the parties ' arguments , and are set to make a final decision on Tuesday morning .
The prospects for fostering robust competition in this slender but valuable slice of spectrum hangs in the balance .
Each of us plays a unique role in the creation of a free , fair , and prosperous society .

Ritter expressed real anger about the feeling of being betrayed by Powell and many others associated with the Iraq war .
Ritter also accused the CIA of knowingly falsely claiming that there were still SCUD missiles left in Iraq , during the first Gulf War , that had not been destroyed and that this led to several Americans ' dying while searching for missiles that the CIA knew did not exist .
He stated that the CIA lied about the Scud missiles in order that America might retain credible reasons for maintaining sanctions against Iraq at that time .
Ritter claimed to be speaking from first - hand knowledge .
The talk which he gave , following a comedy routine by local Boston comedian Jimmy Tingle , was anything but funny .
It was the gravest and most direct indictment of George W. Bush and the people that surrounded him at the time , even those we mistakenly trusted to represent the reasonable American ’s point of view .
It was all the more powerful because he was a direct witness to some of the critical pieces of evidence that point the finger at Bush , the vice president and his cabinet for direct and knowing lies .
Ritter made clear he feels that there is clear evidence that this was a war of aggression and that it breaches the UN Charter which is a treaty and as such must be treated as the " supreme law of the land " as per the US Constitution .
He feels that the antiwar movement needs a clearer focus and some bedrock legal and rhetorical framework based on the US Constitution , a sentiment with which I heartily agree .
Ritter laid out his critique of the anti-war movement as being badly organized , defocused and ineffective as a result .
He was promoting a short book on making war against the war mongers effectively using the same principals of organization that are used to make war .
One only has to look at the pathetic efforts of the Democrats in Congress trying to bring the war to an end , while being very concerned about winning the next election and countering the GOP attack machine .
This alone is evidence that Ritter is onto something important in his analysis .
His cry is for others to stop being observers of this tragic debacle and become active and lead .
Do not wait for some messianic leader to emerge .
Too many people will have died or have been horribly injured before we are likely to be rescued by any messiah .
When questioned as to " whether 41 brave Democratic Senators should filibuster any war funding unless it contains a withdrawal schedule " he stated that this would be a bold tactic but only if the ground work were laid before hand to educate the American public as to why this was a valid tactic , given the string of filibusters that the GOP has now used to block any effective change in Iraq war policy .
Scott opposed impeachment right now , but feels that inquiries to get the evidence into the record should be taking place so that due process would lead inevitably to impeachment .
Going too early would create voter blow - back .
His book , " Waging Peace , " has been reviewed before on Daily Kos but I did not see any reference to his severe indictment of Colin Powell .
What Scott was unable to answer was why Colin Powell chose to lie and betray all of us who trusted him .
I 'm sure you all know I 'm a shameless Microsoft fanboy ( yeah , right ) , but Vista has been disappointing .

I 'm really surprised that Vista was released as it was .

The campaign argues that giving housing and transit police officers jurisdiction beyond the city ’s public housing and subways gave the city more flexibility to fight crime .
It said that it usually notes the effects of the merger when describing the size of the police force , and said it would change a post on its
Web site to mention the merger when citing the increase .
And the group also found that Mr. Giuliani erred at a Republican debate when , while calling for tort reform , he said that 2.2 percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product “ is spent on all these frivolous lawsuits . ”
That statistic , the group reported , came from a study that pegged the cost of all civil claims at 2.2 percent of the G.D.P. , without judging whether the cases had merit or not .
Even some people who support Mr. Giuliani ’s proposals say he risks undercutting his own arguments when he relies on imprecise or questionable statistics .
In a recent radio advertisement by the campaign about his health care proposal , Mr. Giuliani repeated another false statement that he had been using on the campaign trail .
In the advertisement Mr. Giuliani , who has had prostate cancer , asserted that his chances of surviving prostate cancer in the United States were 82 percent , while his chance of surviving in England would have been only 44 percent .
His point was that the American health care system is far superior to England ’s government - run system , which he refers to as “ socialized medicine . ”
The figure came from an article written by one of Mr. Giuliani ’s health care advisers , but was soon discredited : the source of the research that was used to derive the statistic said that its data had been misused .
The Office for National Statistics in Britain said that the true five - year survival rate was 74.4 percent — still lower than in the United States , but by a much smaller margin .
Mr. Giuliani stood by the statistic , however , and kept using the advertisement , though it has since gone off the air .
Ramesh Ponnuru , a senior editor at National Review magazine , said Mr. Giuliani ’s plan “ may be the best of the Republican health care plans . ”
“ The trouble is that the exact statistic he used was misleading , ” Mr. Ponnuru said in a recent interview , elaborating on a blog post he wrote .
“ It became an argument about the statistics , and he dug in and defended it when he was wrong . ”

The Indians used more colorful place names than Paleface .
Even though at this time of day you almost can imagine why they called it Panties of the Virgin , fact it 's named after the Indian who discovered it !
Panties of the Virgin was a valiant Indian , and obviously used to brag a lot .
Just like teenagers in Z - 28 Camaros who hang panties off their rear view mirrors , Panties of the Virgin used to hang them from the front of his horse .
He bragged of getting around so much , and that probably helped him find the falls which were named after him up until the 1800s .

I ’m sure you ’ve seen the photos of many of those many delighted lottery winners !
Yes , they do exist .
As we all know , though , winning the Powerball requires a lot of luck .
For every smiling winner there are millions of people with nothing to show for their money .
How much luck does it take to win the lottery ?
According to this Powerball site , the odds of picking all six two - digit numbers correctly is one chance in 146,107,962 .
This is bleak , but how bleak ?
Some state lotteries show you how to do the mathematics , but I doubt that this complicated math can counteract the heavy advertising done by the lotteries –advertising that takes advantage of widespread innumeracy .
How can the small chance of winning the lottery be conveyed in a visual and understandable way ?
I decided to use plain M&M ’s ( not peanut ) and a football field for my thought experiment .
I did n’t really do this demonstration , but you could .
If you ’d like to do it , just go out and buy 146,107,962 M&M’s .
Instead of actually buying the M&M ’s , I used mathematics .
I decided to allow all six lottery numbers to serve as the coordinates for ONE M&M in a big pile of M& M’s .
I started by wondering whether 146,107,962 M&M ’s might cover a football field ( the field between the goal lines , not including the end zones ) .
A football field , between the goal lines measure 300 ft long x 160 feet wide = 48,000 square feet .
That equals 6,912,000 square inches .
Based on my experiments with M&M ’s at home , I found that 17 M&M ’s will cover about 3 square inches .
146,107,962
M&M ’s would thus completely cover three football fields , from goal line to goal line .
So . . . here ’s the proposition .
Assume that ONE M&M was painted silver and mixed into the M&M ’s that covered 3 adjacent football fields that had been completely covered with M& M’s .
Then assume that a lottery company allowed you to pay $ 1 to walk out into those 3 huge fields blindfolded to pick up only one M&M with a tweezer –the silver one .
Would you do it , or would you rather keep your dollar ?
Or how about this option : would you scoop up one liter of M&M ’s ( enough to fill about one quart , which you could do by scooping up a bit more than a square foot ) for $ 549 ?
BTW , I refered to this site to determine how many M&M ’s there are in a specific volume .
It turns out that one liter ( which is a little more than a quart ) of M&M ’s is about 1098 M& M’s .
This thought experiment helped me to understand the low odds of winning the lottery , but I ’m curious .
Would this visual have the power to cure anyone else of the urge to spend their hard - earned money on the lottery ?
Could this serve as an “ anti-lottery ad ” ?
If none of this cures you of the urge to play the lottery , consider this : coming into large sums of money will only temporarily change your happiness level .

In the HBO documentary “ Alive Day Memories ” Dawn Halfaker , 27 , a former Army first lieutenant , is sitting in a chair on a stark stage , talking , somewhat incongruously , to James Gandolfini , the star of “ The Sopranos . ”
Mr. Gandolfini serves as the interviewer in the film , set to have its premiere Sunday night at 10:30 .
It deals with the recovery of American veterans from devastating injuries inflicted during the war in Iraq .
Ms. Halfaker , whose right arm and shoulder are gone , blasted away by a rocket - propelled grenade , says she has wondered whether her child , if she ever has one , will be able truly to love her .
And then a look of intense emotion clouds her face .
Ms. Halfaker ’s eyes flutter , seemingly looking at some image far , far away .
Finally , after a long pause , Mr. Gandolfini asks quietly , “ What were you just thinking about ? ”
And Ms. Halfaker tells him : “ The reality of , will I be able to raise a kid ?
I wo n’t be able to pick up my son or daughter with two arms . ”

Chris Matthews has always puzzled me as a talking head .
There 's always been this strange disconnect between his embarrassingly slavish adulation of political figures ( please , do n't make me repeat the glimmering GWB , the manly - smelling Fred Thompson , etc .
We 've groaned through them enough ) and their actions .
But the always brilliant Jon Stewart -- after reading Matthews ' new book " Life 's a Campaign " -- calls it for me : for Tweety , it 's all strategy .
It does n't matter if you 're doing right or good .
It does n't matter if you are sincere ... all that matters is that you play the game .
As Stewart has said , that book has been written already .
How unintentionally revealing of Chris Matthews .
MATTHEWS : I 'm listening to you ...
STEWART : No , you 're not ...
MATTHEWS : Of course I am , you 're trashing my book .
STEWART : I 'm not trashing your book , I 'm trashing your philosophy of life .
Kudos for the best interview from The Daily Show in a long , long time .
LANCASTER , N.Y. — CamerynLee was only 3 years old when her father , Lance Cpl. Eric J. Orlowski , a Marine Corps reservist , was killed in an accidental shooting during the first days of the Iraq war .
Now 8 , she is suddenly hungry for information about the man she remembers only in sketchy vignettes :
Did he like chicken wings as much as she does ?
How about hockey ?
Was he funny ?
“ When it happened , I do n’t think she fully understood , ” said her mother , Nicole Kross , 29 .
“ At that age she really did n’t ask too many questions .
It ’s all coming out more now . ”
In a grim marker of the longevity of the war , children who were infants or toddlers when they lost a parent in action are growing up .
In the process , they are coming to grips with death in new , more mature and at times more painful ways — pondering a parent they barely knew , asking pointed questions about the circumstances of the death and experiencing a kind of delayed grief .
Families and bereavement counselors say that media coverage of the war , dedication ceremonies and even school events — in which most classmates have both parents in attendance — can all heighten yearning for the missing parent .
For young children , the flood of prickly feelings and questions often arises just as the surviving parent is moving beyond his or her own intense grief , sometimes with a new spouse or partner in the picture .
Conspiracy theories and
the Persian Mind
By Ahmad Ashraf
Encyclopaedia Iranica
Conspiracy theories in Persia are a complex set of beliefs attributing the course of Persian history and politics to the machinations of hostile foreign powers and secret organizations .
In contemporary social psychology such theories are defined as elaborate and internally consistent systems of " collective delusions , " often tenaciously held and extremely difficult to refute .
Many conspiracy theories are based on a simple dualism in which the world is viewed as divided between good and evil forces with the latter determining the course of history .
Various failures and disasters , for example , defeats in war , revolutions , and general backwardness can thus be blamed on powerful enemies .
Conspiracy theories often serve an important social function , helping to assuage certain kinds of anxiety among group members but also often limiting or hindering their capacity to respond effectively to external and internal social and political challenges .
Particularly since the beginning of the 20th century , Persians from all walks of life and all ideological orientations have relied on conspiracy theories as a basic mode of understanding politics and history .
The fact that the great powers have in fact intervened covertly in Persian affairs has led ordinary people , political leaders , even the rulers themselves to interpret their history in terms of elaborate and devious conspiracies .
The acceptance of such theories has in itself influenced the course of modern Persian history , for it has engendered a sense of helplessness in dealing with the rumored activities of foreign conspirators .
Conspiracy theories in modern Persia can generally be divided into two categories : those focused on supposed plots by Western colonial powers and those focused on satanic forces believed to have been active against Persia from antiquity to the present .
Conspiracy theories focused on colonial powers
The weakness of Persia under the last three Qajar shahs ( 1896 - 1924 ) , coupled with such events as the Constitutional Revolution of 1905 - 11 , which had the support of Great Britain against Russian interests ; the Anglo - Russian Convention of 1907 , by which Russia and Great Britain divided Persia into zones of influence ; the occupation of Persian territory by Great Britain , Russia , and Ottoman during World War I ; the abortive 1919 Anglo - Persian agreement , by which Persia was to become a kind of semiprotectorate ; and the British - backed coup d'etat of 1921 , which led to the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty , encouraged the development of conspiracy theories focused on foreign powers .
During most of this period , foreign embassies openly intervened in Persian affairs through individual political notables , tribal khans , wealthy merchants , and members of the olama ( clergy ) .
For their part , these Persian notables found foreign patronage extremely tempting ; it was easy to overcome rivals and to mislead timid compatriots with the air of being ' in the know . '
Such notables , hinting at knowledge of the real intentions of the foreigners , fostered a general sense that Persian affairs were directed by hidden plotters in the embassies .
Conspiratorial schemata focused on the British
Although there have been conspiracy theories implicating all the Western powers that have competed in Persia , those involving the British have been most popular among members of the ruling and middle classes born before World War II .
The basic premise is that the British have controlled the course of modern world history , including all major events in Persia from the Russo - Persian wars of the early 19th century to the Revolution of 1979 .
The British are depicted as cold - blooded , foxy , and cunning ( rubah-e makkar ) , able to " cut off the heads of their enemies even with cotton " -- that is , possessing nearly miraculous powers ( siasat-e Engelis ) to achieve their ends .
They are supposed to have duped and manipulated the " simple Russians " and the " naive Yankees . " such notions were influenced by conspiracy theories abroad in France and Germany since the 18th century by students returning from Europe .
Russian , German , and Ottoman propaganda against the British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries encouraged fears of secret British designs against Persia and the Islamic world as a whole .
Conspiracy theories focused on the C.I.A .
After the C.I.A. had engineered the 1953 coup that overthrew the Mosaddeq government , the dominant position of the United States in Persia began to be reflected in conspiracy theories .
The Persian elite of the post -Mosaddeq period , one American diplomat noted , belied in the myth of " American omnipotence . "
Imagining that prime ministers were chosen by the United States , " candidates or would - be candidates for prime minister come to advertise their assets and their availability . "
It was widely believed that the shah 's White Revolution and the land - reform program of the 1960s had been designed in detail by Americans , though in fact American officials had favored more moderate land reform .
Leftists and many others in the middle class believed that the reforms had been designed to undermine the feudal basis of British interests in Persia .
Khomeini , among others , considered land reform part of an American plot to destroy Persian agriculture in order to create a market for surplus American produce and to ensure Persian dependence on food supplies from the United States .
Satanic theories of conspiracy
According to the satanic theories , the failure of Persia to attain its " natural " position of political , military , cultural , and religious superiority is the result of conspiracy by inimical global forces , variously " Hellenic westernism , " Freemasonry , Zionism , the Bahai faith , and even the Shi'ite clergy .
Hellenic westernism .
The uneasy relationship between Persia and and western powers from antiquity to the present has encouraged intellectuals like Ahmad Fardid , Zabih Behruz , and Hosayn Malek to adopt theories of conspiracy .
The term gharbzadegi ( " plagued by the West " or " westoxication " ) was coined by Fardid , who claimed that Freemasons and Jews are engaged in a great conspiracy to " hellenize " the entire world .
The concept of " westoxication " appears to be derived from a recurring theme in Martin Heidegger 's works , the " darkening of the world . "
The perceived decadence of the West had already begun , according to Fardid , with the development of Greek philosophy , in which human beings ( vojud ) were separated from the the unity of consciousness ( delagahi ) .
The humanistic belief that man is at the center of the universe has determined the Western ethos since the time of the Greek philosophers .
Western man is immersed in technology and more concerned with himself than with his spiritual calling in the world .
This ethos is in conflict with the " spiritual ethos " of the East , but , on the other hand , the East has lost its cultural potency and is dominated by Western civilization .
The liberal conception of a free society is useless in a world in which being and consciousness are no longer well integrated .
Fradid believed that the Constitutional Revolution in particular was tainted by Western Freemasonry and Judaism .
His theories have been adopted by some intellectuals who claim that the policies of the current Islamic regime are manifestations of Eastern spirituality .
Conspiracy between the shi'ite olama and world powers
In the 1980s Shoja - al - Din Shafa , a former Persian deputy court minister for cultural affairs , developed another conspiracy theory , based on ideas in the deposed shah 's book that a " strange amalgam " -- among the Shi'ite clergy , leftists , Western media , major oil companies , and the British and American governments -- had set out to destroy the rapidly developing nation of Persia .
Shafa suggested that " the emergence of the Shi'ite olama in the 10th century constitutes the greatest conspiracy in Persian history and perhaps the oldest conspiracy in world history . "
The purpose was to emasculate true Shi'ism by transforming it into the instrument of corrupt Shi'ite leaders .
Three " capital investments " ensured the loyalty of the olama .
First , they received financial support from temporal authorities and bazaaris , a " sacred coalition " of the forces of tyranny ( estebdad ) , exploitation ( estesmar ) and demagoguery ( estehmar ) .
Second , they accepted the " Indian money " and other contributions from Great Britain in the late 19th century .
Finally , in the 1970s a gigantic coalition of big oil companies and the intelligence agencies of the United States , Great Britain , the U.S.S.R. , and Israel used the olama to mobilize the forces of the Islamic revolution in order to halt the development of Persia and to prevent its impending entry into the " northern club . "
Conspiracies of the Freemasons , Bahais and Zionists
It is commonly believed in Persia that various elite groups are organized in secret lodges of Freemasons under the control of the British , who use them to advance their secret designs to control world affairs .
Groups accused of being under the thumb of the Freemasons include former courtiers , landowners , tribal chiefs , intellectuals , leading olama , wealthy merchants , contractors , influence peddlers , political bosses , and most politicians , including deputies to the Majles and cabinet members .
Belief in a conspiracy among the adherents of the Bahai faith is based on a forged document attributed to Prince Dimitri Dolgorukov ( known in Persian as Kinyaz Dalguroki ) , the Russian minister to Persia in 1846 - 54 .
It purports to a memoir in which the prince described how he created the Babi and Bahai faiths as a way of weakening Shi'ism and Persia as a whole .
It was first circulated in Tehran in various forms in the late 1930s and has since been widely cited in Muslim polemics as evidence that the Bahais were controlled first by the Russians and later by the British or the Americans or both .
Those who believe in an international Jewish conspiracy to dominate the world find their proof in the protocols of the Elders of Zion , a document originally forged by the czarist secret police but still widely accepted as authentic in the Middle East .
The Zionist conspiracy is thought to have supported the " despotic " rule of the shah ; for example , soldiers who are supposed to have massacred " thousands " of innocent people on Black Friday ( 8 September 1978 ) are said to have been Israelis .
Some people have argued that Israel supported the Islamic revolution in order to weaken its only potential rival for domination in the region by replacing the shah with a " vulnerable and dependent Islamic regime . "
The popularity of conspiracy theories among Persians arises from a combination of political , social , psychological , and cultural factors : frequent foreign interference during the period of semicolonialism in the early 20th century and great - power politics in the 1940s - 80s ; the legacy of deeply rooted pre-Islamic and Shi'ite cultural beliefs about satanic forces ; and the effectiveness of such theories as a collective defense mechanism , particularly during periods of powerlessness , defeat , and political turmoil .
Certain deep - rooted aspects of the Persian cultural heritage , which seem to have no parallel in other Muslim societies , may also have contributed to the popularity of conspiracy theories .
They include a dualistic world view , probably derived from pre-Islamic religious beliefs , in which good and evil powers were considered to be in conflict , with the latter directing the course of history .
The mythological character of traditional Persian historiography , which may reflect a particular receptivity to the mythological mode of thought ; a propensity to poetic exaggeration ( eghraq- e sha'erana ) among the Persians at all social levels ; and a long tradition of attributing miraculous deeds to the twelve Shi'ite imams are other probable contributing factors .
Although blaming others can help assuage anxiety about failures , ready acceptance of conspiracy theories has also proved to be highly dysfunctional ; in modern Persia it has contributed to political malaise that has sometimes precluded rational responses to internal and external crises .
( CNN ) -- Karl Rove , perhaps the most powerful White House aide in recent history , called it quits Monday , provoking some to declare a symbolic end to the presidency of George W. Bush .
Karl Rove was dubbed by President Bush as " the architect . "
Known as " Bush 's brain " by critics and " the architect " by Bush himself , Rove announced his resignation during a low point in the administration , with Democrats having taken control of Congress and after Bush 's immigration and Social Security plans failed .
" This is the end of the Bush presidency , absolutely , " said Wayne Slater co-author of a book on Rove titled " The Architect . "
" All lame ducks are lame ducks ; this one , with Karl Rove now turning out the lights , is the most lame duck we 've seen in a long time . "
Democratic strategist Donna Brazile , who holds a " grudging respect " for Rove and his accomplishments , said she did n't know whether his absence would push Bush " over the edge " into lame - duck status .
" To lose someone with Rove 's ability is , I 'm sure , very humbling , " said Brazile .
" There would be no Bush presidency without Karl Rove so it 's hard to separate president Bush 's legacy from that of Karl Rove . "
GOP strategist Bill Bennett downplayed the effect of Rove 's departure , saying it's not a " big blow " to the administration .
" There are limits to what the president can do now on the domestic front particularly .
In his role as commander in chief there are other people that the president will rely on , " said Bennett , who served under two Republican presidents .
With Rove facing a subpoena from a Senate committee investigating why U.S. attorneys were fired earlier this year , some people in the White House thought that Rove had become a distraction , reported CNN White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux .
Bennett described Rove as probably the most influential senior aide to any president .
" People tend to think of Karl Rove as a political strategist and indeed he is , one of the best we 've seen , but he was also a policy guy , " said Bennett .
Rove was often involved in meetings on major policy issues , gaining experience that would be extremely valuable to the current group of Republicans seeking the presidency .
See how Rove has played a vital role in the administration from the beginning »
But Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter said Rove 's mistake was that he tried to " run the White House and the federal government like a campaign . "
Rove left after White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten requested that White House staffers resign before Labor Day or commit to serving the president through the end of his term -- January of 2009 .
" But that wo n't stop people in Washington from saying Rove is abandoning the President , " said CNN 's senior political analyst Bill Schneider .
Watch what Rove 's resignation may mean »
" If Republicans want to consult with Karl Rove , they will do so very quietly behind the scenes , " Schneider said .
" But I think right now he 's too explosive , he 's too poisonous really , because of his association with a very unpopular president . "
Rove was one of a group of loyal Texans who followed Bush to the White House after helping him win the state 's governorship .
Another member of that group , former Bush aide Karen Hughes , called Rove " the Energizer bunny of the West Wing " because he was always upbeat .
" Karl is brilliant .
He is funny .
And he 's a passionate advocate for the president and his policies , " said Hughes .
" And I know he 'll continue to play that role outside the administration . "
Bennett said he doubts that Rove would get involved in the upcoming presidential race .
" Would n't you love to track the phone lines this morning from the various campaigns ? "
Bennett said , smiling .
" I wonder if any Democrats might call him ? "

All About George W. Bush • Karl Rove
Since the first automobile emerged in the 1880 ’s , the design of a car with an internal combustion chamber has been prevalent in human society .
The car industry and the oil industry have become interdependent on this design , based on the combustion of crude oil .
This interdependence can be observed in the struggle for survival of several car companies .
Huge losses are made by General Motors , Ford and other car companies because they continue to think in the old ways , holding on to the production of big expensive and inefficient machines as long as possible .
Soon this way of thinking will be extinct because the incentives in these industries are changing .
The increasing fuel costs and pressure from lobby groups , civilians and politicians that care about the environment of the earth are changing the fundamental basis of the car .
Super efficient new technologies have been developed which will soon arrive at a home near you .
The future of the car is based on direct power in the wheels .
By transferring power without any gearing but by using an electromotor that spins itself inside the wheel , huge energy losses are averted , leading to a super efficient car .
Link the four electric wheels to an embedded software and hardware system and optimum force control and traction is obtained without heavy mechanical solutions .
Another beauty of the system is braking .
By reversing the magnets in the wheel in the opposite direction , the forward motion of the car is converted back into electrical power .
The advantage of this system is that it reduces the power necessary to propel the car by half compared by a geared traction motor thanks to the reduction of friction losses / mechanical efficiency .
The electric power of the car can be supplied in different ways .
The best solution would be to mount a generator that can use a variety of fuels , powering the battery train that supplies electric power directly to the wheels on a constant basis .
In this setting the radius of the car , the power , the loading time , the comfort and so on are not any different then in standard cars with an internal combustion system .
Because the car becomes far more efficient , fuel and environmental costs can be reduced drastically , leading also to signficant reductions in economical costs when the lifetime of the car is taken into account .
This technology has been developed independently in different forms by a variety of large and small companies .
Some examples : The Tweel from Michelin , the VDO eCorner from Siemens , the Wheelmotor from PML flightlink , the Wheel from e-Traction and the colt prototype from Mitsubishi .
The technology has also been proven in a variety of prototypes .
PML Flightlink has applied their technology to two mini’s which now have a quad electrical wheel system :
e -Traction has retrofitted two busses with a quad electrical wheel system :
The troubling question is why this technology , which can slash fuel usage in half , is not already applied in large quantities in the cars and busses of today .
The main reason is that markets are not functioning as they should because the incentives for car companies and the oil industry to halt such progress is still bigger .
Consider the companies that make gearboxes , which would no longer be needed with an electrical wheel system .
Consider the decreasing dependence on crude oil , if such a technology would quickly be implemented worldwide .
Such technologies mean a fundamental shift in industries , were some will win and others will lose big - time .
If the incentives start to change financially because people do n't want gas guzzling cars anymore , and the pressure grows hard enough to truly innovate , then innovation will come .
Which company will be the first that starts to produce the electric wheel in ten thousand cars annually cannot be foretold , but that it will happen in the coming five years , is a certainty .

Velociraptor , the fearsome dinosaur made famous in the Jurassic Park films , had feathers and probably more closely resembled a big turkey than the killer screen dinosaur , scientists have discovered .
Velociraptor , which was much smaller in real life than its screen version , was a one - metre tall , two - legged predator that lived more than 70 m years ago .
Equipped with large claws on each leg , it was a close relative to the earliest birds .
In a study of the fossilised forearms of velociraptors found in Mongolia in 1998 , palaeontologist Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History found " quill knobs " - bumps where the feathers used for flight in modern birds are anchored to the bone with ligaments .
His results are published today in the journal Science .
" The more that we learn about these animals the more we find that there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor , " said Professor Norell .
" Both have wishbones , brooded their nests , possess hollow bones , and were covered in feathers .
If animals like velociraptor were alive today our first impression would be that they were just very unusual looking birds . "
Because of velociraptor 's relatively short forelimbs , the feathers would not have helped it to fly .
The researchers speculated that the feathers could have been passed down from smaller ancestors that did fly but would have served other functions such as display , shielding nests , temperature control or to help stability and manoeuvring while running .

Nestling in the foothills of the Alps in northern Italy , 30 miles from the ancient city of Turin , lies the valley of Valchiusella .
Peppered with medieval villages , the hillside scenery is certainly picturesque .
But it is deep underground , buried into the ancient rock , that the region 's greatest wonders are concealed .
Scroll down for more ...
Here , 100 ft down and hidden from public view , lies an astonishing secret - one that has drawn comparisons with the fabled city of Atlantis and has been dubbed ' the Eighth Wonder of the World ' by the Italian government .
For weaving their way underneath the hillside are nine ornate temples , on five levels , whose scale and opulence take the breath away .
Constructed like a three - dimensional book , narrating the history of humanity , they are linked by hundreds of metres of richly decorated tunnels and occupy almost 300,000 cubic feet - Big Ben is 15,000 cubic feet .

Few have been granted permission to see these marvels .
Indeed , the Italian government was not even aware of their existence until a few years ago .
But the ' Temples of Damanhur ' are not the great legacy of some long - lost civilisation , they are the work of a 57 - year - old former insurance broker from northern Italy who , inspired by a childhood vision , began digging into the rock .
It all began in the early Sixties when Oberto Airaudi was aged ten .
From an early age , he claims to have experienced visions of what he believed to be a past life , in which there were amazing temples .
Around these he dreamed there lived a highly evolved community who enjoyed an idyllic existence in which all the people worked for the common good .
More bizarrely still , Oberto appeared to have had a supernatural ability : the gift of " remote viewing " - the ability to travel in his mind 's eye to describe in detail the contents of any building .
" My goal was to recreate the temples from my visions , " he says .
Oberto - who prefers to use the name ' Falco ' - began by digging a trial hole under his parent 's home to more fully understand the principals of excavation .

But it was only as he began a successful career as an insurance broker that he began to search for his perfect site .
In 1977 , he selected a remote hillside where he felt the hard rock would sustain the structures he had in mind .
A house was built on the hillside and Falco moved in with several friends who shared his vision .
Using hammers and picks , they began their dig to create the temples of Damanhur - named after the ancient subterranean Egyptian temple meaning City of Light - in August 1978 .
As no planning permission had been granted , they decided to share their scheme only with like - minded people .
Volunteers , who flocked from around the world , worked in four - hour shifts for the next 16 years with no formal plans other than Falco 's sketches and visions , funding their scheme by setting up small businesses to serve the local community .
By 1991 , several of the nine chambers were almost complete with stunning murals , mosaics , statues , secret doors and stained glass windows .
But time was running out on the secret .

The first time the police came it was over alleged tax evasion and still the temples lay undiscovered .
But a year later the police swooped on the community demanding : " Show us these temples or we will dynamite the entire hillside . "
Falco and his colleagues duly complied and opened the secret door to reveal what lay beneath .
Three policemen and the public prosecutor hesitantly entered , but as they stooped down to enter the first temple - named the Hall of the Earth - their jaws dropped .
Inside was a circular chamber measuring 8 m in diameter .
Scroll down for more ...
A central sculpted column , depicting a three dimensional man and woman , supported a ceiling of intricately painted glass .
The astonished group walked on to find sculpted columns covered with gold leaf , more than 8 m high .
Stunned by what they had found , the authorities decided to seize the temples on behalf of the government .
" By the time they had seen all of the chambers , we were told to continue with the artwork , but to cease further building , as we had not been granted planning permission , " says Esperide Ananas , who has written a new book called Damanhur , Temples Of Humankind .
Retrospective permission was eventually granted and today the ' Damanhurians ' even have their own university , schools , organic supermarkets , vineyards , farms , bakeries and award - winning eco homes .
They do not worship a spiritual leader , though their temples have become the focus for group meditation .
' They are to remind people that we are all capable of much more than we realise and that hidden treasures can be found within every one of us once you know how to access them , ' says Falco .
Do you inhale your food ?
Are you so busy that even chewing seems like a luxury ?
Here are some tips on improving digestion :
Tip # 1 : Cover the Basics
Chew , Chew , Chew
Take smaller bites .
Put your fork down in between meals .
Try using chopsticks - it forces you to slow down .
Thoroughly chew each bite of food .
Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth - chewing grains thoroughly allows amylase , the digestive enzyme present in saliva , to digest the grains .
Basic 2 : Get Enough Water
Basic 3 : Increase Your Dietary Fiber
Dried fruit , such as dates , figs , and prunes
Beans and legumes — if you do n't have time to cook dried beans , buy canned , but make sure you rinse them thoroughly before cooking .
Lentils and split peas are less gas - forming than other legumes .
Bring an apple with you to work as a snack
Ground flaxseeds are a gentle laxative .
They can be useful for chronic constipation , damage to the intestine wall from laxative use , irritable bowel , and to soothe inflammation .
Sprinkle ground flaxseeds on rice , grains , salads , or any other meal of your choice .
Tip # 2 : Practice Mindful Eating
Eat in the moment .
Savor every bite , enjoying the flavors , textures , and smells of your meal .
Buy fresh flowers to put on the dining table .
Use smaller cutlery so that you eat less with each bite .
Create a beautiful atmosphere - dim the lights , play music and light candles .
Tip # 3 : Address Food Sensitivities and Allergies
Tip # 4 : Increase Good Gut Bacteria
Irritable bowel syndrome
Diarrhea
Gas , bloating , flatulence
Recurring vaginal yeast infections
Bad breath
Tip # 5 : Supplement to Restore Digestive Health
# Enteric - Coated Peppermint Oil - Peppermint oil can reduce abdominal pain , bloating , and gas .
Digestive Enzymes - Enzyme supplements are believed to support the body 's own digestive enzymes to aid digestion and help with other disorders stemming from poor digestion .
Insufficient water intake is a primary cause of constipation .
Constipation then causes an imbalance in bacteria , promotes inflammation of the intestinal lining , and can even lead to the absorption of larger molecules , a condition known as intestinal permeability .
Good sources of dietary fiber include : A pilot study at Indiana State University found that mindfulness , including specific instructions to slowly savor the flavor of food and be aware of how much food is enough , helped to reduce eating binges from an average of four binges per week to one and a half .
Food sensitivities are behind many digestive disorders .
For example , between 33 % and 66 % of IBS patients report having one or more food intolerances , resulting in bloating , gas , and pain .
The most common culprits are milk and dairy ( 40 - 44 % ) and grains ( 40 - 60 % ) .
A trained practitioner can supervise an elimination diet .
Many foods are removed from the diet for a brief period of time , then re-introduced sequentially to isolate the body 's reaction to the offending foods .
Not all bacteria is bad .
There are over 400 different kinds of bacteria and yeasts in the digestive system .
Of these , the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophillus and Bifidobacterium bifidum are considered good " probiotic " bacteria because they can help to maintain intestinal health .
Although good bacteria can be found in some yogurt , there is a wide variation in the quantity and quality .
Look for good quality organic yogurt that add the active cultures after pasteurization , because this heat process destroys both good and bad bacteria .
Supplements containing acidophilus and bifidobacteria can be found in health food stores .
They are especially helpful for the following conditions :
A shepherd in a remote region of Nepal near the border with Tibet has been instrumental in the discovery of an extraordinary art treasure that lay hidden from the world for centuries - a collection of 55 exquisite cave paintings depicting the life of Buddha .
A partially collapsed cave containing the 12th to 14th century depictions of scenes from Buddha 's life was unearthed last month by a team of Italian , US and Nepalese conservators and archaeologists in Mustang , a lost kingdom long forbidden to foreigners in the high Himalayas , 250 - km north - west of Kathmandu .
" Finding the cave was almost like a miracle , " said Luigi Fieni , a member of the team that used ice axes to cut its way into the inaccessible 3,400 m - high cave in a region that for centuries was part of greater Tibet before being taken over by Nepal .
Foreigners were only permitted to enter Mustang in 1992 , and Mr Fieni 's team began work nine years ago , restoring the spectacular wall paintings in a 15th century Tibetan monastery .
When they inquired about other art treasures in the region , a villager remembered that as a boy he had seen a cave full of colourful paintings .
" Unlike the murals in the monastery , the Mustang cave paintings do not reveal a Tibetan but a strong Indian influence , including the animals they depict - leopard , tiger , monkey and deer , " Mr Fieni said .
" In fact , the style evokes the fabulous cave paintings of Ajanta , which predate the Mustang caves by several centuries . "
The location of the cave has been kept secret to deter art smugglers , but the team call it " the snow leopard cave " as the animal 's footprints were found inside .
" The cave paintings have been affected by wind and rain and really need restoration , " Mr Fieni said .
" It 's a long process , and we 're hoping now to raise funds for the project . "
The simultaneous discovery of ancient Tibetan manuscripts in nearby caves has led to speculation that the caves might have been a teaching retreat on the lines of the Buddhist university in Nalanda .
Mustang is of special significance to Buddhist experts because it is perhaps the only region where Tibetan culture and religion have survived over the centuries virtually untouched by time and modern Chinese colonisation .
" The Mustang people are Tibetans .
They speak the Tibetan language ; their origin is in the Tibetan culture , " said Lama Guru Gyaltsen .
The opening up of the region has brought inevitable challenges to Mustang way of life .

George W. Bush ’s ill - fated decision to frighten this nation into an illegal , immoral , ill - conceived war against Iraq , a country that posed no real threat to us , will haunt him throughout history .
Now most Americans believe the U.S. should never have undertaken this calamitous military misadventure and support bringing our troops home .
Let ’s look at the current reality in Iraq .
Thus far in April , an average of 25 American soldiers have died each week , a rate that could bring the total to more than 4,000 by year ’s end .
The unrelenting violence currently claims approximately 50 Iraqi lives daily , with total civilian deaths estimated at more than 60,000 .
Our allies in this conflict are drawing down their forces .
The various factions in the Iraqi government continue to squabble rather than deal with pressing issues .
Aware that the American public no longer believes his original pretexts for war ( WMDs , al - Qaida / Saddam connection , etc. ) , Bush and his apologists have fabricated an inventory of dubious justifications for “ staying the course . ”
We must give the “ surge ” an opportunity to work .
One definition of insanity : Continuing to do the same thing over and over , each time expecting a different result .
A bloodbath will ensue if we leave .
If the warring factions in Iraq are intent on more sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing , keeping our troops there only forestalls the inevitable .

Elijah Cummings was angry .
The Democratic congressman from Baltimore represents a district that is home to the Afro- American Newspaper , a weekly publication that is in jeopardy of going out of business due to the United States Postal Service ’s recent rate hike on small periodicals .
Cummings ’ testiness showed when a House subcommittee heard testimony on the rate increase from a host of postal officials earlier this week .
“ If these small publications go out of business , is that a win-win ? ” Cummings asked James Miller , chairman of the USPS ’s Board of Governors , the entity that approved the rate hikes , during one tense exchange .
“ That ’s a hypothetical , ” Miller protested .
“ Nah , nah , nah , ” Cummings said .
“ You got a lot of businesses that put out publications that are saying that this is going to affect them in a negative way … .
I ’m asking you a simple question .
If they go out of business , is it a win-win ? ”
“ I would say if they cannot cover their costs , it is a win- win situation , ” said Miller .
“ Let me tell you why I think that .
Because other classes of mail would be covering their costs . ”
He went on to explain that every American letter writer pays 200 percent of the cost of shipping his or her letter because small magazines and periodicals do n’t pay their fair share .
“ So your answer is , it ’s a win - win for everybody but the people who go out of business , ” Cummings retorted .
“ Yes , yes , ” Miller said , adding , “ It ’s not that I ’m heartless .
It ’s not that we ’re heartless .
We have to cover all sides .
And I think the fairest thing is for every class of mail to cover the cost directly attributable to carrying their mail . ”
The problem is , Miller ’s comments muddled the issue , to put it charitably .
Since the 1970s , all classes of mail have been required to cover the costs associated with their delivery , what ’s called attributable cost .
But periodicals , as a class , get favorable treatment :
They do n’t pay overhead , meaning that they do n’t foot the bill for the Postal Service ’s infrastructure , employees , and so on .
That ’s a tradition that goes back to the origins of the nation .
The founding fathers saw the press as the lifeblood of democracy — only informed voters could compose a true democracy , they believed — and thus created a postal system that gave favorable rates to small periodicals .
( George Washington actually supported mailing newspapers for free . )
For 200 years , small periodicals and journals of opinion were given special treatment .
The 2007 rate hikes , which went into effect this summer , changed that .
Now , periodicals are still expected to cover attributable costs and pay no overhead , but because the cost of delivering mail has gone up , rates within the class have gone up as well .
In advance of the rate hike , the Postal Service submitted a proposal to the Postal Regulatory Commission that would have raised the rates in the class more or less evenly .
The PRC rejected the proposal in favor of a rate package put forward by Time Warner that , unsurprisingly , hands small periodicals much steeper rate hikes than their large counterparts .
Small periodicals in some instances face a rate hike of up to 50 percent .
An increase of that size is almost unbearable for periodicals that publish frequently , like the liberal Nation or the conservative National Review , both weeklies .
For them , postal expenses make up a massive portion of their budgets .
An increased cost of $ 500,000 per year , which is The Nation ‘s estimate , would be devastating .
( The rate hike is a smaller burden for Mother Jones , due to the fact that the magazine publishes six times a year .
Nevertheless , Mother Jones opposed the rate hike earlier this year . )
Small periodicals and their devotees have been complaining about the rate scheme for months , but without the money for lobbyists and lawyers they ’re left only to fight the battle through petitions and rhetoric .
Says Victor Navasky , publisher emeritus of The Nation , “ These journals , whose core franchise is public discourse about public affairs , are — like water , national defense , public highways , and public education — a public good and as such it would seem to me ought to be paid for out of public funds . ”
That ’s not the sort of argument that is going to find sympathetic ears with Miller , who , in a long career in and around public service , has always shown a desire to privatize .
In the Reagan Administration , Miller was executive director of a Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief , chairman of the Federal Trade Commission , and director of the Office of Management and Budget .
When Miller left the administration in 1988 , President Reagan commended him for playing “ a leading role in removing the shackles of excessive regulation from our economy . ”
Miller later sat on the board of Citizens for a Sound Economy , now called FreedomWorks , whose stated mission is “ lower taxes , less government , more freedom . ”
Faced with opponents this powerful Navasky and his colleagues can do little , especially considering the rate hikes have already been passed and no one has a plan for undoing them .
“ I ’m just trying to figure out if we ’re here wasting our time , ” an exasperated Cummings said at the hearing this week .
The best the panel of postal authorities could offer was that it was for the sake of “ discussion . ”
For small periodicals , the only discussion is whether or not they ’ll have to shut their doors .
The sun is out , it ’s a beautiful day , and there is a man who decides his shank needs some good crankin’ .
So he positions himself somewhat discreetly — in front of a public education banner encouraging “ civilised behaviour ” to welcome the Olympics — and proceeds to polish his bishop without a single care in the world .
We love how NONE of the passersby seem to notice or be bothered .
Surely , this must be the hallmark of a truly harmonious society ?

The Economics of Sugar Daddying
Not long ago , Levitt wrote about a Craigslist posting in which a woman solicited advice in marrying a man who made more than $ 500,000 a year .
That posting eventually made the international media rounds , from the Times to the BBC News to Scientific American .
But journalists have yet to jump on the wealth of posts like the following , posted in the Craigslist New York personals :
You with the long flowing hair , the mountainous , bust , the nipped in waist and the sculpted legs !
You ’re friggin incredible !
You ’re what all guys want and what all women want to be .
And on top of that , you ’re smart and witty … on second thought , I do n’t really give a crap about that .
I ’m about the boobs , and the little waist and the legs and the hair .
Anyway , like I was saying , you ’re hotter than hell .
And they expect you do what !
To work ?
At a job ?
YOU ?
That just ai n’t right .
Here ’s where I come in .
Ya see , I ’m an investment banker downtown .
Now do n’t get your hopes up , hot stuff .
I ’ll be honest with you .
Unlike you , I ’m not much in the looks department .
So I ca n’t give you that .
In fact , I ’m a troll .
Think Danny De Vito with a nicer suit .
What I do have is an apartment nearby that I ’m not using .
And a buncha cash I ’m not using .
And a poker ’s hand worth of platinum and gold credit cards I ’m not using either .
Maybe you ’d like to use them instead of going to some boring , friggin ’ office .
Now , I ’m gonna be upfront .
This generous offer is n’t simply so you can have the privilege of living in my place , spending my money and watching my credit card balances grow .
No , I would expect that in exchange for these privileges you will gladly , willingly and enthusiastically fulfill my deepest desires , especially of a sexual nature .
Let ’s call it an arrangement .
In order to qualify for this arrangement , I ’ll need to see several clear photos of you , both face and body .
And please do n’t give me any excuses about the Craigslist size limit .
If you do n’t have the brains to figure out how to reduce the size of your photo , you ’re disqualified .
If I ’m interested , I ’ll get back to you , if I ’m not , I wo n’t .
So let ’s hear from you and see those pics .
Otherwise , do n’t give up your day job .
While his offer ( the likes of which tend to pop up on Craigslist boards often , with an equal chance as the gold - digger ’s post of being bogus ) may seem at first glance like a generous arrangement , with a little analysis it too can be dismissed as “ crappy . ”
First , there ’s the issue of opportunity cost .
A woman who takes his offer is presumably already employed .
Quitting her job in order to become a kept woman would mean putting her career on hold or abandoning it .
Given the poster ’s self - description , it ’s safe to assume he has no intention of marriage or longterm financial commitment .
So she is sacrificing a potential long - term career of her own for what might be a short - term financial gain with little guarantee of longevity .
Then , of course , there ’s the matter of satisfaction derived from the money itself .
Just as a beautiful woman could be described as a “ depreciating asset , ” so could a rent - free apartment with an unlimited shopping budget .
A platinum card may thrill for a few months , but , particularly given the required tradeoff of supplying sexual favors to a man who describes himself as “ Danny De Vito with a nicer suit , ” it ’s also likely to offer diminishing returns .
Lastly , there ’s the risk factor .
Investment banking is indeed a gold standard for high incomes — but it ’s been a hard year for the markets , with the possibility of a recession still looming .
Major banks are taking hits , which could mean bad news for our poster ’s future employment , or at least his bonus .
There ’s also the possibility ( increasing or decreasing depending on his age ) that , at some point during the arrangement , he could become unable to work — he could get hit by a cab , or suffer a heart attack , or even be fired ( perhaps for inappropriate behavior towards female coworkers ? ) .
His self - described unattractive physical appearance ( not to mention loathsome personality , as exhibited in his posting ) will reduce the likelihood that he will secure another high - paying job .
All of which leads us back to the conclusion put forth by the initial poster : if you ’re planning to gold - dig , stick to the “ MARRIAGE ONLY ” rule .
Then , at least , you ’ll be entitled to equitable division of the spoils .
I came to the conclusion the other day that our perception of our ability to freely make choices is false .
Free will , it would appear , is indeed an illusion .
I will try and prove this point as plainly and succinctly as possible .
The world in which we live has a certain set of characteristics and properties .
Elements react with each other in certain ways , large bodies of mass attract each other via gravity .
Electrons flow , molecules form , the wind whistles through the trees and oceans of water crash upon stones and wear them down .
All of this behavior is set — there are simply ways the natural universe exists , and thats all there is to it .
I have to make an important distinction here however — “ science ” is NOT how all of that works .
Science is simply an approximation , a theoretical model .
We observe how things work and we describe those things , and for quite a lot of it we ’ve described it quite accurately .
There are lots of things however , that science has gotten wrong about in the past , is currently wrong about in the present , and will quite likely be wrong about or simply not be able to model for all of eternity .
However — and here ’s the important part — just because a system exists that is too complex for science to accurately model and understand , does not mean that system is magic .
That system is still behaving according to the rules by which it behaves .
The fact that we do n’t quite understand it is irrelevant .
Every single thing in this universe behaves in physically explainable ways , even if we as humans ourselves cannot explain them .
This is a very important point that I hope I have gotten across well enough to continue .
As an example , take the three main theories we have right now about everything — gravity , quantum theory , and electro magnetics .
Inside the scope of those three , they are explained quite well and we understand how they work .
Tying all three together however , is something scientists cannot do .
The theories of quantum mechanics do not extend to the movement of galaxies — science just does n’t have a way to explain how all three theories interact with each other .
That does n’t mean that interaction does n’t exist , it just means we have n’t discovered it .
This all came about to me rather on accident , actually .
I had stumbled across some Physics simulation software on the internet , I forget what it was called .
It was basically a CAD program that let you draw any sorts of shapes .
Balls , squares , polygons .
It had motors and springs and all the variables were available to be set .
Gravity , mass of objects , electro static fields , and so on .
You ’d set up a certain scenario — say , 3 ball shaped objects suspended above a flat platform — and press “ play ” .
It would run through the simulation , the balls would fall down , hit each other and the board , and bounce away .
It was quite novel and fun to play with , creating little systems that would funnel your balls down to a rotating board that would fling them back up into the air .
I had some friends over one evening and I was playing around with it , showing them what you could do with it .
I made a group of 30 or so small ball objects and let them fall onto an inclined plane that had a square object sliding down it at the same time .
The square object would hit the falling balls and send them scattering quite satisfactorily in an explosion of rotating circles on the screen .
One fellow stopped me and said “ Wow thats cool .
If you reset it , does it do the exact same thing again ?
Do all the balls go in the exact same place ? ”
We all kind of stared at him for a second , until someone else said “ Um , of course it does .
It ’s physics .
Thats how physics works .
If you reset all the variables back and play it again , of course its going to do the exact same thing .
If it did n’t , we ’d better be worried ! ”
And we all laughed .
Worried , indeed .
A few weeks later I was playing with it further and making more and more complex systems .
Lots and lots of components with conveyors and swinging things and springs and balls flying all over the place .
It got to be a bit of a game .
I began to realize that when things got really complex , the “ exact same thing ” was n’t happening each time .
It was just too much for my little laptop , so the program was having to not be as accurate with its calculations .
So with less accuracy , at the 30 or 40 second mark into the simulation , I was beginning to get different outcomes .
So I would bump down the speed , bump up the accuracy , and viola , problem fixed .
I realized I needed a faster computer .
The point in which I realized we do not have free will , then , was at the point that I realized the following :
The most accurate simulation of physics does not exist on any computer — it is our universe itself .
Our universe and the things inside of it behave with one another with 100 % absolute perfect accuracy , if accuracy is even the word you want to call it .
This is rather a bit of a complex way to express and identity rule .
1=1 . If 1 did not equal 1 … well it would n’t be 1 anymore , and it just does n’t make sense .
There are no rounding errors in reality , there are no levels of accuracy in our universe .
It is not a simulation of physics … it is physics .
The behavior of the system of our universe is catagorically perfect in all senses of the word .
It behaves the way it does , and thats all there is to it .
If it behaved some other way … then that would be the behavior of our system .
Either way , there is certainly no magic or supernatural anything going on .
I resist even saying that our universe follows rules or laws .
We as humans developed the concept of rules to be able to simply approximate how the universe works .
The rules follow the universe , not the other way around .
If that physics simulation on my laptop “ has ” to play the same scenario , with the same variables , in the exact same way everytime its played , then reality DEFINITELY has to .
If you could setup a scenario in our real , physical world and could somehow absolutely 100 % control all the variables involved , you would absolutely get the same result every single time .
Create a perfect vaccuum and drop an indestructable and unmalleable mass from a height of absolute precision , controlling every single other variable … that ball is going to fall with the exact same velocity and acceleration — its going to hit the bottom at the exact same angle , bounce in the same direction , every single time .
If it did n’t — all while still assuming we do indeed have “ perfectly exact ” variables — we ’d all be in for a lot of trouble and the world in which we live would n’t exist .
So , you might be asking ( or perhaps have already guessed ) what this all has to do with you , and your ability to freely make decisions , or to have free will .
Here ’s the crux of it :
You , and everything about you , exist in our physical reality .
“ Who you are ” is entirely dictated by that lump of grey matter sitting in your skull .
Smash that skull open on a freeway and disrupt the configuration of that grey matter , suddenly “ you ” stop existing .
We ’ve already shown that every single atom , molecule , object , planet and galaxy behaves according to perfect , unbreakable , unmutable laws of reality ( laws which we as scientists do not fully understand ) .
Your brain , and its structure , are composed of those atoms .
The decisions you make , the behaviors you exhibit , the way you process certain data , is all * somewhere * inside that brain of yours .
So go back to our “ perfect ” environment again , in which all variables are somehow able to be completely , 100 % controlled .
Say you have a ball rolling at a certain speed in a certain direction — now place another ball in its path .
They will collide , and they will behave in ways we can predict , and will shoot off from one another at certain angles and at certain speeds .
This is undeniable .
This is a fact .
Reset the situation and do it again , they will again follow the exact same paths , again and again and again .
Put a 3rd ball into the path of one of the diverted 1st or 2nd balls .
We ’ve got a more complex situation , but as we step through it , the truths still hold .
Those objects ARE going to behave however they are going to behave , and there ’s no way they can ’t .
Thats just how things work .
Add a 4th ball and a 5th , then a 10th and a hundredth .
Increase velocities , add obstacles , electromagnetic fields , add 1,000 balls , then 1,000,000 .
It does n’t matter .
Reset the scenario to exactly the same variables and at the end you absolutely will have the exact same outcome .
You have to .
There ’s no other way for it to behave except the way that it just does .
The point ?
No matter how complex the scenario is — even if it became so complex that we as humans could not fully understand or model it — it will behave the way it is supposed to .
And , supposing we could model it … if you gave us a snapshot of what the beginning looked like and told us all the variables , why , we could run it through a computer and tell you what would happen !
We could indeed see into the fucking future .
We could tell you what would happen as a result of events that had not yet occured .
We could step through it even , tell you where all the balls are at any time point .
They can also design favor bags and beautifully - personalized invitation packages for engagement announcements , weddings , bridal showers , baby showers , graduations , birthday parties or any special event .
Christmas and holiday cards will exude your personality and taste and , therefore , are one - of - a- kind .
What makes you think you are any different ?
Who “ you ” are , your consciousness , your mind , are nothing but by - products of that lump of grey matter in your skull receiving , processing , and outputting data and information .
Your entire brain is nothing more than an insanely complex system of interacting molecules , hormones , and neurotransmitters , all of which are absolutely 100 % behaving the way they have to , as the way they simply do .
Do we as scientists understand how it all works ?
Of course not .
Does that mean its magic ?
Say it with me now , of course not .
When you go to make a decision , completely autonomous subconcious processes begin firing in specific , highly ordered patterns .
Different subroutines of your brain ’s current configuration engage other subroutines , in ways we do not even come close to understanding .
Data is retrieved from your long term memory , values are weighed , and ultimately a decision comes out .
Reset * everything * back 5 seconds to the exact same variables , and replay the situation — IE , let you choose again — you will choose the * exact * same thing .
Everytime it ’s reset and replayed , you ’ll come up with the same decision .
There is no hand - wavey randomness in reality — only in our understandings of reality .
You build a fast enough computer , a big enough computer , a computer so intense that it could literally model every variable in our reality , and you would have in your hands a time machine .
A time machine that could see into the future , a time machine that could see into the past .
All it has to do is step backwards through its calculations .
The idea of free will is absolutely nothing more than an illusion .
A damned , damned convincing illusion , an illusion so palpable that its hard to admit to , but it is there .
The exact position of your hands at right this instant was determined several billion years ago when the universe began , and all the original variables were set .
Since then its been nothing but a chain reaction of events that could occur no other way than the way they did — and the events that will occur in the future , whatever they may be , can not be bent or changed or altered .
How then , I can accommodate this fact of reality with the visceral obviousness of my own existence is the next question .
The next time you 're in Carnegie Hall and the atmosphere seems stuffy , do n't blame the upper crust in their box seats .
Blame the building 's air .
It weighs almost 32,000 kilograms .
It 's one of many little - known facts about the stuff we breathe that British science writer Gabrielle Walker packs into the engrossing , surprisingly light book , An Ocean of Air : Why the Wind Blows and Other Mysteries of the Atmosphere .
Though we take air pollution very seriously , we tend not to pay much attention to the air itself unless it 's threatening us with harmful chemicals .
Yet Walker 's book tells the story of the inventive scientists who studied the air and came to fascinating conclusions .
" We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air , " wrote Renaissance mathematician Evangelista Torricelli , whose experiments discovered atmospheric pressure .
Walker takes us on a buoyant tour of the brilliant , though often flawed minds that have probed a substance so difficult to study .
The Sunday Star spoke to her about the weight of air , the good intentions behind CFCs , and the first man in space ( it 's not who you think it is ) .
In what way is the Earth 's air an " ocean " ?
It 's because it 's so big and heavy .
It 's so heavy that it 's almost inconceivable that we walk around and brush it aside , but it 's actually weighing down on us .
Just like an ocean , it 's also got currents that distribute warmth throughout the world , and it also has creatures moving through it .
I had thought that we were living on the surface of a rocky planet .
I had no idea I was living at the bottom of an ocean .
I imagined shrimps and lobsters marching around on the sea floor who have no idea of the miraculous substance above their heads .
What made you write a book about the atmosphere ?
Since working for Nature , I had to research the atmosphere and the oceans , and I found it really interesting .
I found out this story about the amazing Capt .
Joseph Kittinger .
I discovered that this extraordinary man had actually fallen through the atmosphere .
He 'd jumped out of a plane .
And I found footage of him doing it .
You can see what it was like when he jumped out , you can see him tumbling , and you see the balloon up overhead , and it 's incredible .
He could see the curvature of the Earth , and he could see that delicate , thin , blue curving line of the atmosphere .
This is before the astronauts saw it .
And as he was doing that , I was thinking , what would it feel like to be out in space , above the atmosphere and falling through it ?
I mentioned Capt .
Kittinger to several people , but no one believed the story .
It is incredible , and it is completely true .
But what really struck me about his description was that he was only 20 miles ( 32 kilometres ) up .
He was above the part ( of the air ) that brings food and water and rain and oxygen to the air ; it transforms the Earth .
That 's actually 99 per cent of the atmosphere .
He did n't feel like he was in a vacuum , he did n't know the air was so thin there that he would have died if he had n't had his pressure suit working .
But he felt like there was something deadly , an incredibly hostile environment .
He said , in a quote that I have in the beginning of my book , " There 's a hostile sky above me .
Man will never conquer space .
He may live in it , but he will never conquer it . "
And as he fell through space he got more and more comfortable , and by the time he landed on the ground , even though he was in a desert , he felt like it was the Garden of Eden because it was so full of life and it was so nurturing .
And the thing that made the difference between those two states was the air .
Twenty miles of it .
The book mentions a lot of striking facts , such as the revelation that if levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere get high enough , there 's a 1 per cent chance this planet could turn into another Venus .
One per cent seems pretty high .
Venus is a very different planet , but it's ( still ) extraordinarily similar to the Earth .
It would take a lot more than we have now for there to even be a chance .
But we also know there 's more carbon dioxide now than ever before in human history .
We 're changing the atmosphere beyond anything that we 've ever experienced .
Why is Thomas Midgley , the American who invented such environmental hazards as leaded gasoline and Freon , a sympathetic figure ?

The thing that amazed me about him is that I really did think , let 's look at the person who invented Freon .
And I had this notion that this must be a bad guy who did n't care about polluting the planet as long as he made a profit .
I could n't believe it when I found out who it actually was – someone who was really trying to help .
He was brilliant .
He was so unlucky , yet everybody liked him .
Midgley was feted in his lifetime and died without knowing the true nature of his inventions ...
At least that meant that he never lived to find out how much damage he 'd done .
He 'd certainly be heartbroken by it .
I have this image of him :
He 's showing how safe Freon is , showing that it is n't toxic by breathing it in himself , and showing it is n't flammable by exhaling it out on a flame ( and putting it out ) .
He wanted it to be safe , he really did .
It was just one of those tragedies .
It showed that when we put things into the atmosphere , we get it wrong more than we get it right .

They have taken Croquet and made it work for business .
The news is really terrific , not only for Qwaq and their customers , but for our open source communities as well .
Qwaq continues to share code and support both Croquet and Squeak , not to mention hiring some of the best and brightest Smalltalkers , something I ’m sure Qwaq will continue to do with this new funding .
Congratulations Qwaq !!
IT was the pale green and pink striped bikini that did it .
When Sandra Cornier , a mother of two from Brooklyn , looked at a recent photo of herself taken at Manhattan Beach , N.Y. , she did n’t like what she saw .
She had been nursing her son for 11 months , and now she could barely fill out the bathing suit top .
She made a decision :
She would have breast implant surgery , and right away , because she wanted to be cozy in her favorite bikini by the end of the summer .
She did not have the cash available , but she was willing to borrow .
“ I just wanted to proportion myself out and look like I did before I had children , simple as that , ” said Ms. Cornier , 33 , who is married and works for a government agency .
She took a loan for $ 10,800 .
“ I did not want to wait two or three years to save up for surgery . ”
Cosmetic medicine used to be the province of the rich and celebrated who would pay cash or write a check up front for their tummy tucks and eyelid lifts .
( Such procedures are not typically covered by health insurance . )
But in the last five years , with the advent of reality shows like “ Extreme Makeover ” and the popularization of nonsurgical treatments like lasers and wrinkle injections , people with blue - or pink - collar incomes and Beverly Hills ideals are embracing vanity medicine .
Mothers around the world are armed with anti-bacterial gels , sprays and baby blankets , diligently protecting their children from nasty forms of bacteria .
But recent research shows that society 's anti-bacterial and anti-infection crusade makes children and adults more likely to develop asthma and allergies - and perhaps even mental illnesses .
Dr. Gerald Callahan , who studies bacteria and infectious diseases at Colorado State University , argues that all living things on earth must have infections to thrive , and society 's challenge is to sort the good infections from the bad infections .
People 's love affair with anti-bacterial products is changing - and not necessarily for the better - how immune systems , gastrointestinal systems and even nervous systems develop and function .
" Microorganisms shape the lives of all living things and infections steer the course of the world .
Most people understand that infections are at the root of many terrible diseases like malaria and leprosy .
But infection may also play a significant role in many chronic aliments , including some that may surprise you such as schizophrenia , ulcers and obsessive compulsive disorder , " said Callahan , an immunology professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and the College of Liberal Arts .
The role Toxoplasm gondii , a parasite , may play in producing schizophrenia in people is n't clear .
But rats infected with T. gondii exhibit suicidal behaviors .
And otherwise normal men and women infected with T. gondii exhibit alterations in their behaviors :
Infected women are likely to be more warmhearted and outgoing , and infected men often are more jealous and suspicious .
About 15 percent of all cancers could be prevented if infectious diseases that play a role in causing these cancers , which include stomach , cervical and liver cancers , could be controlled , Callahan said .
But what many people may not realize is that most infections ensure our health instead of compromise it .

Mitochondria are bacteria - like components of cells that take fats and sugars and make adenosine triphosphate , or ATP .
Every action that distinguishes a living human being from a dead human being is dependent on ATP .
" We need our bacteria , " Callahan said .
Other research shows that sheltering a child from bacterial infections increases his or her chances of developing asthma and allergies .
In fact , recent studies show that the more educated parents are , the more likely their children are to develop asthma and allergies possibly because these parents are more likely to worry about bacterial infections .
Of course , parents want to protect children from infectious diseases .
Callahan draws an analogy between how parents teach their children to recognize unsavory characters and how society must differentiate good from bad bacteria and infectious microorganisms .
" We understand that part of becoming an adult is learning to interact with people and recognize both bad and good in those people .
The same is true for bacteria and other infectious microorganisms , " he said .
Humans have 10 times more bacterial cells in their bodies than human cells .
Without bacteria , there would not be humans .
Human life depends on certain infections .

" Before we knew the important role that infections play , we knew about things like rabies and polio and yellow fever , " Callahan added .
" Because of that , when Fleming finally introduced penicillin in 1945 , we went crazy with joy and began to slather everything with antibiotics , especially ourselves .
Now we are paying our dues for that overreaction . "
Not long ago , all staph infections responded to methicillin .
But within a few decades of the widespread use of methicillin , many staph infections are unfazed by this once powerful antibiotic and all of its chemical relatives .
Callahan points out that there are more bacteria by far in this world than any other living thing .
" We are a minority on this planet , and we must learn how to work with the majority , " he said .
Callahan is the author of two books on the topic of infectious disease , the human immune system and the impact of infection on life and the world : " Infection : The Uninvited Universe " and " Faith , Madness and Spontaneous Human Combustion . "
Opponents of the law say it is a relic of British colonial rule .
The law punishes offenders with up to two years in jail , although it has rarely been enforced .
Under the just - approved amendments , new offences were enacted to tackle child prostitution and sex tourism , as well as cover crimes committed with the use of technology such as the internet and mobile phone text messaging .
But a rare petition read in parliament to abolish the law banning sex between men sparked the most passionate debates in the normally staid legislature dominated by the ruling People 's Action Party .
Legislators supporting the law 's retention centred their arguments on the need to maintain family and moral values in the conservative Asian society , while proponents appealed for equal treatment of minorities guaranteed by the constitution .
Member of parliament Siew Kum Hong , who supported the petition , said legalising sexual acts between two consenting heterosexual adults , while refusing to decriminalise the same acts between homosexual men , was discriminatory .
But Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong weighed in for the retention of the law , saying that Singapore remains a conservative society - with the traditional family as its main building bloc - and homosexuals cannot set the tone for the mainstream .
Abolishing the law could " send the wrong signal " and push gay activists to ask for more concessions , such as same - sex marriage and parenting , Lee said .
Gays " are free to lead their lives and pursue their social activities " , the prime minister said , citing the existence of gay websites and gay bars .
" But there are restraints , and we do not approve of them setting the tone of mainstream society , " he said .
" They live their lives , that 's their personal space .
But the tone of the overall society , I think , it remains conventional , it remains straight and we want it to remain so . "
Lee said keeping the statute unchanged , while not aggressively enforcing it , remained the best option .
Singapore would adapt to global economic changes in order to stay competitive , but must take a more cautious approach when it comes to moral values , Lee said .
" We were right to uphold the family unit when Western countries went for experimental lifestyles in the 1960s - the hippies , free love , " he said .
" But I 'm glad we did that , because today , if you look at Western Europe , the marriage as an institution is dead , families have broken down , the majority of children are born out of wedlock and live in families where the father and the mother are not husband and wife living together bringing them up . "
Gay rights activists say the law against homosexual sex affects about 200,000 people in the wealthy island - republic of more than four million .

Yesterday , I wrote :
Science has a very exact idea of the capabilities of evolution .
If you praise evolution one millimeter higher than this , you 're not " fighting on evolution 's side " against creationism .
You 're being scientifically inaccurate , full stop .
In this post I describe some well - known inefficiencies and limitations of evolutions .
I say " evolutions " , plural , because fox evolution works at cross-purposes to rabbit evolution , and neither can talk to snake evolution to learn how to build venomous fangs .
So I am talking about limitations of evolution here , but this does not mean I am trying to sneak in creationism .
This is standard Evolutionary Biology 201 . ( 583 if you must derive the equations . )
Evolutions , thus limited , can still explain observed biology ; in fact the limitations are necessary to make sense of it .
Remember that the wonder of evolutions is not how well they work , but that they work at all .
Human intelligence is so complicated that no one has any good way to calculate how efficient it is .
Natural selection , though not simple , is simpler than a human brain ; and correspondingly slower and less efficient , as befits the first optimization process ever to exist .
In fact , evolutions are simple enough that we can calculate exactly how stupid they are .
Evolutions are slow .
How slow ?
Suppose there 's a beneficial mutation which conveys a fitness advantage of 3 % : on average , bearers of this gene have 1.03 times as many children as non-bearers .
Assuming that the mutation spreads at all , how long will it take to spread through the whole population ?
That depends on the population size .
A gene conveying a 3 % fitness advantage , spreading through a population of 100,000 , would require an average of 768 generations to reach universality in the gene pool .
A population of 500,000 would require 875 generations .
The general formula is
Generations to fixation = 2 ln( N ) / s
where N is the population size , and ( 1 + s ) is the fitness .
( If each bearer of the gene has 1.03 times as many children as a non-bearer , s = 0.03 . )
Thus , if the population size were 1,000,000 — the estimated population in hunter - gatherer times — then it would require 2763 generations for a gene conveying a 1 % advantage to spread through the gene pool .
1
This should not be surprising ; genes have to do all their own work of spreading .
There 's no Evolution Fairy who can watch the gene pool and say , " Hm , that gene seems to be spreading rapidly — I should distribute it to everyone . "
In a human market economy , someone who is legitimately getting 20 % returns on investment — especially if there 's an obvious , clear mechanism behind it — can rapidly acquire more capital from other investors ; and others will start duplicate enterprises .
Genes have to spread without stock markets or banks or imitators — as if Henry Ford had to make one car , sell it , buy the parts for 1.01 more cars ( on average ) , sell those cars , and keep doing this until he was up to a million cars .
All this assumes that the gene spreads in the first place .
Here the equation is simpler and ends up not depending at all on population size :
Probability of fixation = 2s
A mutation conveying a 3 % advantage ( which is pretty darned large , as mutations go ) has a 6 % chance of spreading , at least on that occasion .
2
Mutations can happen more than once , but in a population of a million with a copying fidelity of 10 ^ - 8 errors per base per generation , you may have to wait a hundred generations for another chance , and then it still has an only 6 % chance of fixating .
Still , in the long run , an evolution has a good shot at getting there eventually .
( This is going to be a running theme . )
Complex adaptations take a very long time to evolve .
First comes allele A , which is advantageous of itself , and requires a thousand generations to fixate in the gene pool .
Only then can another allele B , which depends on A , begin rising to fixation .
A fur coat is not a strong advantage unless the environment has a statistically reliable tendency to throw cold weather at you .
Well , genes form part of the environment of other genes , and if B depends on A , B will not have a strong advantage unless A is reliably present in the genetic environment .
Let 's say that B confers a 5 % advantage in the presence of A , no advantage otherwise .
Then while A is still at 1 % frequency in the population , B only confers its advantage 1 out of 100 times , so the average fitness advantage of B is 0.05 % , and B 's probability of fixation is 0.1 % .
With a complex adaptation , first A has to evolve over a thousand generations , then B has to evolve over another thousand generations , then A* evolves over another thousand generations ... and several million years later , you 've got a new complex adaptation .
Then other evolutions do n't imitate it .
If snake evolution develops an amazing new venom , it does n't help fox evolution or lion evolution .
Contrast all this to a human programmer , who can design a new complex mechanism with a hundred interdependent parts over the course of a single afternoon .
How is this even possible ?
I do n't know all the answer , and my guess is that neither does science ; human brains are much more complicated than evolutions .
I could wave my hands and say something like " goal - directed backward chaining using combinatorial modular representations " , but you would not thereby be enabled to design your own human .
Still : Humans can foresightfully design new parts in anticipation of later designing other new parts ; produce coordinated simultaneous changes in interdependent machinery ; learn by observing single test cases ; zero in on problem spots and think abstractly about how to solve them ; and prioritize which tweaks are worth trying , rather than waiting for a cosmic ray strike to produce a good one .
By the standards of natural selection , this is simply magic .
Humans can do things that evolutions probably can't do period over the expected lifetime of the universe .
As the eminent biologist Cynthia Kenyon once put it at a dinner I had the honor of attending , " One grad student can do things in an hour that evolution could not do in a billion years . "
According to biologists ' best current knowledge , evolutions have invented a fully rotating wheel on a grand total of three occasions .
And do n't forget the part where the programmer posts the code snippet to the Internet .
Yes , some evolutionary handiwork is impressive even by comparison to the best technology of Homo sapiens .
But our Cambrian explosion only started , we only really began accumulating knowledge , around ... what , four hundred years ago ?
In some ways , biology still excels over the best human technology : we can't build a self - replicating system the size of a butterfly .
In other ways , human technology leaves biology in the dust .
We got wheels , we got steel , we got guns , we got knives , we got pointy sticks ; we got rockets , we got transistors , we got nuclear power plants .
With every passing decade , that balance tips further .
So , once again : for a human to look to natural selection as inspiration on the art of design , is like a sophisticated modern bacterium trying to imitate the first awkward replicator 's biochemistry .
The first replicator would be eaten instantly if it popped up in today 's competitive ecology .
The same fate would accrue to any human planner who tried making random point mutations to their strategies and waiting 768 iterations of testing to adopt a 3 % improvement .
Do n't praise evolutions one millimeter more than they deserve .

A fragile private - school student and his dad are suing the city Department of Education for a retest after he bombed a high - school entrance exam because rowdy pupils broke his concentration , according to court records .
Barry Tessler , 12 , had his heart set on attending elite Staten Island Tech .
He spent his summer studying and taking a Kaplan course to prepare for the test .
But on Oct. 27 , Tessler left the examination hall at New Dorp HS in tears because other test takers distracted him and he was unable to finish .
“ Several test takers that were sitting near me spoke loudly , laughed , giggled and sang , ” according to Tessler ’s written statement .
Tessler said he complained to the proctor , but she was unable to control the children .
Tessler and his father , Akiva Tessler , an administrative judge with the State Liquor Authority , protested to school and DOE officials , but got nowhere .
So last week , they sued in Manhattan Supreme Court , demanding that Barry be allowed to complete the test or retake it .
We ’ve turned a horrible new page in the War on Terror as the FDNY — The Fire Department of the City of New York — have joined with the Department of Homeland Security to spy on residents .
The FDNY , as you know , made their place in history on 9/11 when 343 responders gave their lives .
The FDNY not only fight fires , they also have an elite EMS paramedic team that responds to people in distress .
The FDNY is the largest municipal fire department in the world with nearly 12,000 firefighters and 3,000 providing EMS .
Since 9/11 , the FDNY have become even more of the fabric and stone of the City as they are revered and honored in the ordinary and the every day .
The hallmark of the Bush administration ’s War on Terror is , if anything — creative in its cruelty and audacious in its daring
— and that ’s why the FDNY and its sparkling reputation were picked to test a new anti-terror program to spy on citizens .
The brilliance in this despicable effort is that the FDNY — unlike the police and other law enforcement agencies — do not need a warrant to enter your home .
If the FDNY senses or is merely made aware of a possible emergency in a home , they are required by law to forcefully enter to investigate .
My first entertainment agent in New York City actually helped make that requirement to enter an apartment the law when his elderly mother called 911 for emergency assistance .
When paramedics arrived at her apartment , and knocked on her door , she did not answer .
The paramedics left .
She was later found dead in her apartment .
My agent promptly sued the City claiming — rightfully so — that if a person is in emergency distress and calls 911 for help it is the DUTY OF THE CITY to break into an apartment or home to see why the person is unable to answer the door :
Are they dead ?
Are they unable to move ?
Are they being held against their will ?
That Must Enter law is a good law — and my agent made a tidy sum of money teaching that lesson to New York City in court — but , like all good things in life , there are those who will abuse the law and nudge the power of proper intentions for their darker , self - serving , needs and demands .
Enter the Department of Homeland Security .
Once the FDNY has access to your home , the Homeland Security surveillance program begins , as reported by WCBS - TV :
In times of emergencies , firefighters are trusted to help those in need – often putting their lives on the line to save others , but imagine having the FDNY telling police what they see in your or your neighbor ’s home .
Unlike the police , firefighters and paramedics do not need warrants to get into private homes and buildings – that is why there ’s a new push to make them an important part of the war on terror and crime .
The Department of Homeland Security is testing a program with New York City firefighters — the idea is to give fire departments a way to share intelligence information with the appropriate agencies — a system that did not exist before .
According to the AP , Homeland Security is training New York firefighters to spot unusual or dangerous chemicals , surveillance equipment , maps , photos , blue prints , and also firearms or weapons .
We now have FDNY firefighters — first trained to put out fires and to save lives — now secondarily looking at your bookshelf for bomb - making materials or anti-American propaganda and then reporting you to the government for further investigation .
If you have too many nails in your home are you planning to make a pipe bomb ?
Better report it , just to be safe .
If the Koran is on your nightstand — does that indicate a loss of American faith ?
Better report it just to get it on the record .
How do you feel about the FDNY spying on civilians as they put out kitchen fires and rescue dying mothers with one eye — while looking at your magazine subscriptions with the other eye on their way out the door ?
Is the next logical step in this FDNY / Homeland fiasco leaving behind listening devices or lipstick video cameras in the homes they now “ protect and serve ” and , perhaps , even answering phony “ 911 calls ” in order to get firefighters into homes faster than the police ?
How soon will the FDNY be issued sidearms and bullet - proof vests along with their axes and fire hoses as their “ New York ’s Bravest ” motto inevitably becomes : “ New York ’s Bravest Spies . ”

The following letter on the Middle East peace conference scheduled for Annapolis , Maryland , in late November , was sent by its signers on October 10 to President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
The statement is a joint initiative of the US / Middle East Project , Inc. ( General Brent Scowcroft , chairman , International Board , and Henry Siegman , president ) , the International Crisis Group ( Gareth Evans , president ) , and the New America Foundation / American Strategy Program ( Steven Clemons , director ) .
The Israeli-Palestinian peace conference announced by President Bush and scheduled for November presents a genuine opportunity for progress toward a two - state solution .
The Middle East remains mired in its worst crisis in years , and a positive outcome of the conference could play a critical role in stemming the rising tide of instability and violence .
Because failure risks devastating consequences in the region and beyond , it is critically important that the conference succeed .
Bearing in mind the lessons of the last attempt at Camp David seven years ago at dealing with the fundamental political issues that divide the two sides , we believe that in order to be successful , the outcome of the conference must be substantive , inclusive , and relevant to the daily lives of Israelis and Palestinians .
The international conference should deal with the substance of a permanent peace : Because a comprehensive peace accord is unattainable by November , the conference should focus on the endgame and endorse the contours of a permanent peace , which in turn should be enshrined in a Security Council resolution .
Israeli and Palestinian leaders should strive to reach such an agreement .
If they cannot , the Quartet ( US , EU , Russia , and UN Secretary General ) — under whose aegis the conference ought to be held — should put forward its own outline , based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 , the Clinton parameters of 2000 , the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative , and the 2003 Road Map .
It should reflect the following :
Two states , based on the lines of June 4 , 1967 , with minor , reciprocal , and agreed - upon modifications as expressed in a 1:1 land swap ;
Jerusalem as home to two capitals , with Jewish neighborhoods falling under Israeli sovereignty and Arab neighborhoods under Palestinian sovereignty ;
Special arrangements for the Old City , providing each side control of its respective holy places and unimpeded access by each community to them ;
A solution to the refugee problem that is consistent with the two - state solution , addresses the Palestinian refugees ’ deep sense of injustice , as well as provides them with meaningful financial compensation and resettlement assistance ;
Security mechanisms that address Israeli concerns while respecting Palestinian sovereignty .
The conference should not be a one - time affair .
It should set in motion credible and sustained permanent status negotiations under international supervision and with a timetable for their completion , so that both a two - state solution and the Arab Peace Initiative ’s full potential ( normal , peaceful relations between Israel and all Arab states ) can be realized .
The international conference should be inclusive :
In order to enhance Israel ’s confidence in the process , Arab states that currently do not enjoy diplomatic relations with Israel should attend the conference .
We commend the administration for its decision to invite Syria to the conference ; it should be followed by genuine engagement .
A breakthrough on this track could profoundly alter the regional landscape .
At a minimum , the conference should launch Israeli - Syrian talks under international auspices .
As to Hamas , we believe that a genuine dialogue with the organization is far preferable to its isolation ; it could be conducted , for example , by the UN and Quartet Middle East envoys .
Promoting a cease - fire between Israel and Gaza would be a good starting point .
The international conference should produce results relevant to the daily lives of Israelis and Palestinians :
Too often in the past , progress has been stymied by the gap between lofty political statements and dire realities on the ground .
The conference therefore should also result in agreement on concrete steps to improve living conditions and security , including a mutual and comprehensive cease - fire in the West Bank and Gaza , an exchange of prisoners , prevention of weapons smuggling , cracking down on militias , greater Palestinian freedom of movement , the removal of unjustified checkpoints , dismantling of Israeli outposts , and other tangible measures to accelerate the process of ending the occupation .
It is of utmost importance , if the conference is to have any credibility , that it coincide with a freeze in Israeli settlement expansion .
It is impossible to conduct a serious discussion on ending the occupation while settlement expansion proceeds apace .
Efforts also should focus on alleviating the situation in Gaza and allowing the resumption of its economic life .
These three elements are closely interconnected ; one cannot occur in the ab sence of the others .
Unless the conference yields substantive results on permanent status , neither side will have the motivation or public support to take difficult steps on the ground .
If Syria or Hamas is ostracized , prospects that they will play a spoiler role increase dramatically .
This could take the shape of escalating violence from the West Bank or from Gaza , either of which would overwhelm any political achievement , increase the political cost of compromises for both sides , and negate Israel ’s willingness or capacity to relax security restrictions .
By the same token , a comprehensive cease - fire or prisoner exchange is not possible without Hamas ’s cooperation .
And unless both sides see concrete improvements in their lives , political agreements are likely to be dismissed as mere rhetoric , further undercutting support for a two - state solution .
The fact that the parties and the international community appear — after a long , costly seven - year hiatus — to be thinking of resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is welcome news .
Because the stakes are so important , it is crucial to get it right .
That means having the ambition as well as the courage to chart new ground and take bold steps .

Analysis
By Steve Schifferes
Economics reporter , BBC News
The current market jitters are centred on disturbances in the world 's credit markets .
Worries about the viability of sub - prime mortgage lending have spread around the financial system , and the central banks have been forced to pump in billions of dollars to oil the wheels of lending .
But what happened in previous financial crises , and what are the lessons for today ?
There have been a growing number of financial crises in the world , according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
Among the key lessons of previous major financial crises are : Globalisation has increased the frequency and spread of financial crises , but not necessarily their severity
Early intervention by central banks is more effective in limiting their spread than later moves
It is difficult to tell at the time whether a financial crisis will have broader economic consequences
Regulators often cannot keep up with the pace of financial innovation that may trigger a crisis .
THE DOT .COM CRASH , 2000 During the late 1990s , stock markets became beguiled by the rise of internet companies such as Amazon and AOL , which seemed to be ushering in a new era for the economy .
When AOL's Steve Case took over Time Warner , the dot.com boom peaked Their shares soared when they listed on the Nasdaq stock market , despite that fact that few of the firms actually made a profit .
The boom peaked when internet service provider AOL bought traditional media company Time Warner for nearly $ 200bn in January 2000 .
But in March 2000 , the bubble burst , and the technology - weighted Nasdaq index fell by 78 % by October 2002 .
The crash had wider repercussions , with business investment falling and the US economy slowing in the following year , a process exacerbated by the 9/11 attacks , which led to the temporary closure of the financial markets .
But the Federal Reserve , the US central bank , cut interest rates throughout 2001 , gradually lowering rates from 6.25 % to 1 % to stimulate economic growth .
LONG - TERM CAPITAL MANAGEMENT , 1998 The collapse of hedge fund Long - Term Capital Market ( LTCM ) occurred during the final stage of the world financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997 and spread to Russia and Brazil in 1998 .
LTCM was a hedge fund set up by Nobel Prize winners Myron Scholes and Robert Merton to trade bonds .
The professors believed that in the long run , the interest rates on different government bonds would converge , and the hedge fund traded on the small differences in the rates .
John Meriwether , a Wall Street trader , headed LTCM But when Russia defaulted on its government bonds in August 1998 , investors fled from other government paper to the safe haven of US Treasury bonds , and interest rate differences between bonds increased sharply .
But when Russia defaulted on its government bonds in August 1998 , investors fled from other government paper to the safe haven of US Treasury bonds , and interest rate differences between bonds increased sharply .
LTCM , which had borrowed a lot of money from other companies , stood to lose billions of dollars - and in order to liquidate its positions it would have to sell Treasury bonds , plunging the US credit markets into turmoil and forcing up interest rates .
So the Fed decided that a rescue was needed .
It called together the leading US banks , many of whom had invested in LTCM , and persuaded them to put in $ 3.65 bn to save the firm from imminent collapse .
The Fed itself made an emergency rate cut in October 1998 and markets soon returned to stability .
LTCM itself was liquidated in 2000 .
THE CRASH OF 1987 US stock markets suffered their largest peacetime one - day fall yet on 19 October 1987 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average index of shares in leading US companies dropped 22 % and European and Japanese markets followed suit .
Program trading on the New York stock market worsened the crisis
The losses were triggered by the widespread belief that insider trading and company takeovers on borrowed money were dominating the markets , while the US economy was entering into an economic slowdown .
The losses were triggered by the widespread belief that insider trading and company takeovers on borrowed money were dominating the markets , while the US economy was entering into an economic slowdown .
There were also worries about the value of the US dollar , which had been declining on international markets .
These fears grew when Germany raised a key interest rate , boosting the value of its currency .
Newly - introduced computerised trading systems exacerbated the stock market declines , as sell orders were executed automatically .
Concerns that major banks might go bust led the Fed and other major central banks to lower interest rates sharply .
" Circuit - breakers " were also introduced to limit program trading and allow the authorities to suspend all trades for short periods .
The crash seemed to have little direct economic effect and stock markets soon recovered .
But the lower interest rates , especially in the UK , may have contributed to the housing market bubble of 1988 - 89 and to the pressures on the pound sterling which led to the devaluation of 1992 .
The crash also showed that global stock markets were now closely linked , and changes in economic policy in one country could affect markets around the world .
Laws on insider trading were also tightened up in the US and UK .
US SAVINGS AND LOAN SCANDAL , 1985 US Savings and Loans institutions were local banks which made home loans and took deposits from retail investors , similar to building societies in the UK .
Under financial deregulation in the 1980s , they were allowed to engage in more complex , and often unwise , financial transactions , competing with the big commercial banks .
By 1985 , many of these institutions were all but bankrupt , and a run began on S&L institutions in Ohio and Maryland .
The US government insured many of the individual deposits in the S&Ls , and therefore had a big financial liability when they collapsed .
It set up the Resolution Trust Company to take over and sell any S&L assets that it could , including repossessed homes , taking over the bankrupt institutions .
The cost of the bail - out eventually totalled about $ 150bn .
However , the crisis probably strengthened the bigger banks by weeding out their weaker rivals , and laid the groundwork for the wave of mergers and consolidations in the retail banking sector in the 1990s .
THE CRASH OF 1929 The Wall Street crash of 1929 , " Black Thursday , " was an event that sent the US and indeed the global economy into a tailspin , contributing to the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Franklin Roosevelt became US President after the crash
After a huge speculative rise in the late 1920s , based partly on the rise of new industries such as radio broadcasting and carmaking , shares fell by 13 % on Thursday , 24 October .
After a huge speculative rise in the late 1920s , based partly on the rise of new industries such as radio broadcasting and carmaking , shares fell by 13 % on Thursday , 24 October .
Despite efforts by the stock market authorities to stabilise the market , stocks fell by another 11 % the following Tuesday , 29 October .
By the time the market had reached bottom in 1932 , 90 % had been wiped off the value of shares .
It took 25 years before the Dow Jones industrial average recovered to its 1929 level .
The effect on the real economy was severe , as widespread share ownership meant that the losses were felt by many middle - class consumers .
They cut their purchases of big consumer goods such as cars and homes , while businesses postponed investment and closed factories .
By 1932 , the US economy had declined by half , and one - third of the workforce was unemployed .
The whole US financial system also went into meltdown , with a shutdown of the entire banking system in March 1933 by the time the new President , Franklin Roosevelt took office and launched the New Deal .
Many economists on both left and right have criticised the response of the authorities as inadequate .
The US central bank actually raised interest rates to protect the value of the dollar and preserve the gold standard , while the US government raised tariffs and ran a budget surplus .
New Deal measures alleviated some of the worst problems of the Depression , but the US economy did not fully recover until World War II , when massive military spending eliminated unemployment and boosted growth .
The New Deal also introduced extensive regulation of financial markets and the banking system through the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , and the separation of commercial and retail banking through the Glass - Steagall Act.
OVEREND & GURNEY , 1866 ; BARINGS , 1890 The failure of a key London bank in 1866 led to a key change in the role of central banks in managing financial crises .
The Bank of England was at the centre of the world financial system Overend and Gurney was a discount bank which provided money for commercial and retail banks in London , the world 's financial centre .
When it declared bankruptcy in May 1866 , many smaller banks were unable to get funds and went under , even though they were otherwise solvent .
As a result , reformers like Walter Bagehot advocated a new role for the Bank of England as the " lender of last resort " to provide liquidity ( cash ) to the financial system during crises , in order to prevent a failure of one bank spilling over and affect all the others ( " systemic failure " ) .
The new doctrine was implemented in the Barings Crisis in 1890 , when losses by a leading UK bank , Barings , made on its investments in Argentina , were covered by the Bank of England to prevent a systemic collapse of UK banking .
Secret negotiations by the Bank and London financiers led to the creation of an £ 18 m rescue fund in November 1890 , before the extent of Barings ' losses became publicly known .
The bankers also organised a committee to renegotiate the outstanding debts owed by Argentina , but a banking crisis engulfed the country and foreign lending to Argentina dried up for a decade .

What are these ?
In 2005 , Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( referred to as the EPAct from here on ) , the first attempt in recent history by the federal government to address the generation , transmission , refining , etc. of all types of energy on a national scale .
At 551 pages , the EPAct is packed full of good ideas , bad ideas , and ideas that furrow your brow and make you go “ hmmmm … . ”
Title XII , Subtitle B ( starting deep in the EPAct , on page 354 ) contains a significant number of ideas of the third variety .
In essence , this subtitle addresses the ability of the federal government to overrule local and state authorities and permit the use of eminent domain for the construction of new electrical power distribution lines as well as incentives to develop and deploy advanced transmission technologies and the methods by which all of this is funded .
What follows below is a detailed look at the roughly nine pages that make up the “ Transmission Infrastructure Modernization ” section of the EPAct .
The Designation of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors
The U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday designated nearly all of Southern California , parts of Arizona and much of the northeast as “ national interest ” energy transmission corridors , an action that allows federal regulators to approve new high - voltage towers and lets private utilities condemn homes and land even if a state agency wo n’t .

In addition to large blocks of southern California and SW Arizona , this declaration affects the entire mid-Atlantic megalopolis from Washington D.C. up to New York City , including massive portions of New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , and the entire states of Delaware , Maryland , and New Jersey .
Residents of most of the affected regions and their representatives are understandably unhappy by this turn of events .
Here ’s a sampling of quotes from local newspapers regarding the news that they ’re regions have been declared a “ national interest electric transmission corridor ” ( NEITC ) .
“ People live out here because they do n’t want the congestion and the traffic ; they ’re interested in a different quality of life , ” [ Danny Sall , 59 , a lifelong resident of Pioneertown ] said .
“ Constitutionally I think we should be able to do that without some conglomerate 100 miles away coming in saying , ‘ Ha ha , this is for the greater good because we have more heads to count , so we ’re taking your land . ” ( source : LA Times story )
“ By creating NIET Corridors , the federal government will be able to usurp states ’ rights to regulate what goes on within their boundaries , ” [ Chris Rossi , co-chairwoman of Stop NYRI , Inc. , a group dedicated to stopping a 400 kV transmission line through New York ] wrote .
“ They will be able take your property by eminent domain ; destroy recreational , cultural and historic sites throughout New York ; and subvert New York state ’s progressive energy policies . ” ( source : Oneonta Daily Star story )
“ It ’s almost as if the hearings never took place , ” said Robert Lazaro , director of communications for the Piedmont Environmental Council , referring to a series of public hearings at which the Energy Department gathered input over its draft corridor , proposed in May .
Hundreds of local residents turned out to one of the hearings in South Park in June .
No changes to the draft corridor were made , despite more than 2,000 public comments and letters .
( source : Pittsburg Post - Gazette story )
“ I am deeply saddened in the departmentâ€™s decision to go forward with this designation , ” [ Republican Rep. Frank R. Wolf ] said on Tuesday in a press statement .
“ It makes no sense and has the potential to destroy neighborhoods and desecrate huge swatches of historically significant land .
“ The fact that power companies will continue to be able to ignore the need for increased conservation and smart technology remains extremely troublesome .
It is almost as if the department didnâ€™t listen to any of the arguments against creating these corridors . ” ( source : Winchester Star story )
Don Corwin , president of the Halleck Community Association , which is outside of Morgantown , told The Dominion Post of Morgantown on Tuesday , “ The Department of Energy , driven by the power - industry lobby , has decided that the property rights of West Virginians should be sacrificed so people in New Jersey can air condition their mansions . ”
“ Once again , the people of West Virginia are asked to give away more of their rights for out - of - state corporations and get nothing in return , ” Corwin told the newspaper .
( source : Charleston Daily Mail story )
The quotes above make it obvious that the public did n’t see this coming , even though the applicable language of the EPAct makes it quite clear that such broad designations are possible .
What enabled this “ abuse ” of eminent domain and federal authority is some overly broad and remarkably vague language in the EPAct itself .
Section 1221.a.2 ( starting on page 354 ) states :
After considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties ( including an opportunity for comment from affected States ) , the Secretary shall issue a report , based on the study , which may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers as a national interest electric transmission corridor .
“ Any geographic area ” is broad language , and likely intentionally so .
Congress probably did n’t want to restrict the ability of the present or future administrations to ensure that public safety , the economy , national security , etc. did n’t suffer as a result of insufficient transmission line redundancy , reliability , and capacity .
And Congress was right to be concerned .
The U.S. power grid is both fragile and vulnerable to sabotage , and because electricity transmission lines are often shared across state boundaries and even different regions of the country , the federal government has a vested interest in ensuring that the transmission lines are dependable .
After all , when there is n’t enough capacity and redundancy in the system , we can suffer from major regional blackouts like 2003 North American Power Blackout .
When it comes to electricity service , we cannot afford to permit NIMBY - ism to result in a blackout that suspends vital services like police and fire dispatch , hospitals , traffic lights , air traffic control , etc .
Simply put , some things are simply too important , too much in the “ public interest , ” to allow one state to hold indefinite veto over the rights of another .
The question is where to draw the line – something that our representatives are supposed to figure out for their constituents .
Unfortunately , our legislators approved language that was both broad and vague , a bad combination for any legislation , and the result is a combination that gives the President expansive authority with regard to transmission lines .
Let ’s look at the language that defines what qualifies as an NIETC :
(4) In determining whether to designate a national interest electric transmission corridor under paragraph ( 2 ) , the Secretary
may consider whether –
( A ) the economic vitality and development of the corridor , or the end markets served by the corridor , may be constrained by lack of adequate or reasonably priced electricity ;
( B ) ( i ) economic growth in the corridor , or the end markets served by the corridor , may be jeopardized by reliance on limited sources of energy ; and ( ii ) a diversification of supply is warranted ;
( C ) the energy independence of the United States would be served by the designation ;
( D ) the designation would be in the interest of national energy policy ; and
( E ) the designation would enhance national defense and homeland security .
This means that if the administration determines that economic growth will be slowed by lack of cheap power , then it can overrule local control .
If the administration decides that local laws restricting the availability of certain kinds of power ( ie only “ clean ” sources , such as legislated in much of the northeast and mid-Atlantic states ) might slow economic growth , local control can be overruled .
If the administration decides that U.S. “ energy independence , ” “ national energy policy , ” “ national defense , ” or “ homeland security ” are at risk due to insufficient transmission lines , then local control can be overruled .
And this power is available to to all future administrations as well as the current one .
And we gave such broad authority to the federal government why , exactly ?
Just because the federal government has an interest in keeping the lights on does n’t mean they should be given carte blanche to overrule state and local objections to electric transmission lines in large areas .
It ’s one thing to permit the federal government to exercise eminent domain on a project - by - project basis if a state or local government is being obstructionist – it ’s something else entirely to declare three entire states an NIETC .
But given the current administration ’s aggressive views on presidential authority , declaring huge swaths of the country as NIETCs should have been expected .
After 9/11 , Vice President Cheney ordered the arrest of the Lackawanna Six because the FBI could n’t guarantee him 100 % that the Six were n’t a threat .
What is there to prevent the present administration , or a future one , from using the same unreasonable 100 % criteria ?
After all , it ’s not possible for anyone to guarantee , to 100 % certainty , that economic strength and growth will not be jeopardized or constrained by lack of diverse power sources .
Because of this , the phrases “ economic vitality … may be constrained … ” and “ economic growth … may be jeopardized … ” potentially give the administration massive and unrestrained authority .
The language of the EPAct could give an administration the authority to overrule local control regarding transmission lines nationwide just because every customer does n’t have the option to buy cheap coal power .
And , indeed , many people in the mid-Atlantic states and New England are claiming that this was the Bush Administration ’s very goal :
[ The newly designated corridors ] would also undermine Northeast states ’ bid to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions by causing them to rely more on cheaper coal - fired power from the Midwest , rather than cleaner but higher cost electric generators fired by natural gas .
( source : Christian Science Monitor story )
According to the White House ’s energy page , our National Energy Policy ( NEP ) is “ Reliable , Affordable , Environmentally - Sound Energy . ”
The Department of Energy ’s NEP page starts with the following quote from President Bush : “ America must have an energy policy that plans for the future , but meets the needs of today .
I believe we can develop our natural resources and protect our environment . ”
Neither of these NEP statements really summarizes what our national energy policy is , and nor does the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
After all , if the EPAct is itself the national energy policy , the circular reasoning could be used to justify literally anything .
Even if we buy that the “ reliable , affordable , environmentally - sound energy ” sound bite actually is the NEP , how does bypassing New England ’s various state laws requiring clean albeit more expensive energy qualify as “ environmentally - sound ? ”
More transmission lines will certainly help with the reliability , and it might make the electricity more affordable , but coal is hardly environmentally - sound .
At least , many mid-Atlantic and New England states have decided that coal does n’t meet their collective definition thereof .
But if you read deeper into the many articles quoted above , you ’ll notice that many of the locals fighting the new transmission lines have experts saying that the transmission line reliability is already good enough .
Finally , it ’s unclear how overruling local control enhances our energy independence – unless the federal government has decided to sell our national soul to the coal industry .
Put simply , the only local energy sources presently available that might enhance our energy independence is coal .
And giving the administration eminent domain authority in order to enhance national defense and homeland security is so broad it ’s difficult to know where to start .

How does it look ?
Next step is organize the code for the upcoming release .
The repo heads are the current best version right now .
Getting Started
1. darcs get http://happs.org/repos/happs.org
MyProject 2 . cd MyProject 3 . sp ghc -isrc src/ Main.hs -- make -- run --http-port=5000
Its easiest to start with a working site like this one and modify it as needed .
Now you can open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and access your site running off your machine .
Edit the source in the src directory and watch the shell as searchpath automatically recompiles and restarts your app .
Or edit your html , css , javascript , etc , in the public directory .
By convention , state , if you have it is kept in _local , and config info is in the config directory .
HAppS does not come with a server - side templating system .
We prefer the pattern of developing static web pages and using AJAX to populate them with dynamic content .
We 've found jquery to be a really good client javascript library for this style of development ( used for this site ) .
We 've heard good things about prototype as well .
That being said , nothing restricts you from other options including using haskell 's HTML or XHTML libs or using XSLT on XML generated automatically from your output data types .
Note :
You can also darcs pull the repos and use cabal to install if you feel so inclined .
Det blir stadig flere fordeler med å ha et kredittkort , og vi har nesten nå kommet til et punkt der det er vanskelig å skille ut de største fordelene – rett og slett fordi det er såpass mange !
For ikke så veldig mange år siden så var et kredittkort et simpelt plastkort som ga deg tilgang til lånte penger , men når vi nå har kommet så langt som til 2015 så er kredittkortene fullstappet med rabatter , bonuser og fordeler .
Deriblant kan du spare penger når du handler , reise på ferie og være forsikret helt gratis , eller spare flere hundrelapper hver eneste måned når du fyller bensin !
Det er vanskelig å finne et kredittkort som inneholder alle fordelene i ett og samme kort .
For eksempel finnes det ikke noe kredittkort som har både lav rente , høy kredittgrense , cashback og reiseforsikring inkludert .
Dersom man vil dra nytte av alle de fordelene som finnes i denne bransjen , så blir man faktisk nødt til å skaffe seg flere kredittkort .
Og det er slettes ingen dum idé – for da får man tilgang til de beste fordelene fra flere verdener !
Reiseforsikring , bonuser og rabatter
En av de aller største fordelene med et kredittkort for den vanlige mannen i gata , er at man får en gratis reiseforsikring inkludert i svært mange kredittkort .
Denne aktiveres automatisk når man betaler minst halvparten av transportkostnadene til en reise med kortet , og kan spare deg for mye penger sammenlignet med hva en slik forsikring koster deg i banken .
Videre så har kredittkortet flere fordeler på reisen , deriblant at du er bedre rustet mot svindel , samtidig som enkelte kredittkort ikke har gebyrer på uttak i utenlandske minibanker og lignende .
For hverdagslig bruk så kan mange kredittkort friste med bonuser og cashback , der du rett og slett sparer penger på å bruke kredittkortet når du handler .
De beste kredittkortene gir deg en bonus fra 1 til 3 prosent på alt du kjøper , uansett hva det er og hvor det er i verden .
Derfor velger stadig flere å konsekvent bruke kredittkortet når de handler i norske butikker .
Du kan også med mange kredittkort få rabatter på alt fra leiebil til overnatting og hotell , gjennom ulike fordelsprogrammer hos de ulike bankene i landet .
Spar penger på drivstoff
En stor fordel med mange kredittkort , eller såkalte bensinkort , er at du kan spare penger på drivstoff .
Disse kortene gir deg dedikerte bonuser på bensin og diesel , og ofte kan du spare opp mot 4 prosent uansett hvilken kjede du velger å fylle hos .
Dersom du gjør dette over en periode på fem år , så kan du ha spart opp ganske mange titusener som virkelig kan komme godt med i hverdagen .
Faktisk er fordelen med slike kort såpass stor at vi anbefaler samtlige nordmenn å skaffe seg et bensinkort , som de har liggende i bilen og kun bruker til å fylle tanken .
Rentefri betalingsutsettelse og gratis i bruk
En annen stor fordel med et kredittkort er at det ikke koster deg noe å bruke det , og heller ikke noe å eie det .
De færreste kredittkortene på det norske markedet har årsgebyr , og så godt som ingen har bruksgebyrer ( gjelder innenlands ) .
Rentene begynner heller ikke å løpe før etter halvannen måneds tid , og opp mot 52 dager på de beste kredittkortene .
Med andre ord kan du utsette betalingen både langt og lenge , uten at du betaler en krone ekstra for det .
Slike fordeler gjør at man kan bruke et kredittkort med god samvittighet , selv om mange forbinder disse kortene med en snarvei til økonomisk trøbbel .
Som du skjønner , så er det svært mange fordeler med et kredittkort .
Og ulempene , da ?
Faktisk vil vi strekke oss så langt at vi sier at det ikke er noen ulemper med kredittkort – forutsatt at man bruker det på riktig vis og betaler regningene sine før rentene begynner å løpe .
Update ( 11/10/10 ) : Have you seen PBS great spe­cials on Brain Fit­ness and Neu­ro­plas­tic­i­ty ?
The Brain Fit­ness Pro­gram DVD ( $ 24.95 )
“ The Brain Fit­ness Pro­gram is based on the brain ’s abil­i­ty to change and adapt , even rewire itself .
In the past two years , a team of sci­en­tists has devel­oped com­put­er - based stim­u­lus sets that dri­ve ben­e­fi­cial chem­i­cal , phys­i­cal and func­tion­al changes in the brain .
Dr. Michael Merzenich of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Cal­i­for­nia and his col­leagues share their sci­en­tif­i­cal­ly based set of brain exer­cis­es in this life - alter­ing pro­gram .
Peter Coy­ote ( pic­tured ) nar­rates . ”
PBS aired in Decem­ber 2007 a spe­cial pro­gram on neu­ro­plas­tic­i­ty , brain fit­ness , aging and the brain titled “ Brain Fit­ness Pro­gram ” .
To watch the 3 ‑minute trail­er : click here .
In 2008 , PBS released a sec­ond DVD :
Brain Fit­ness 2 : Sight and Sound DVD ( $ 24.95 )
“ This pro­gram , specif­i­cal­ly designed to help peo­ple get the most from their vision and hear­ing as they age , con­sid­ers how these sens­es change through­out life and what peo­ple can do to keep them healthy and ful­ly func­tion­al . ”
.
If you do not have time to watch these great doc­u­men­taries , here are a few points one needs to under­stand about neu­ro­plas­tic­i­ty :
1 . The human brain is now con­sid­ered to be a high­ly dynam­ic and con­stantly reor­ga­niz­ing sys­tem capa­ble of being shaped and reshaped across an entire lifes­pan .
It is believed that every expe­ri­ence alters the brain ’s orga­ni­za­tion at some lev­el .
The key words in this new approach to the brain are neu­ro­plas­tic­ity and neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis .
Neu­ro­plas­tic­ity refers to the life­long capac­ity of the brain to change and rewire itself in response to the stim­u­la­tion of learn­ing and expe­ri­ence .
Neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis is the abil­ity to cre­ate new neu­rons and con­nec­tions between neu­rons through­out a life­time .
The lat­ter process is also referred to as synap­to­ge­n­e­sis .
This new par­a­digm con­trasts with tra­di­tional ideas of the human brain being a fixed and essen­tially lim­ited sys­tem that only degrades with age .
2 . As we age , the rate of change in the brain , or neu­ro­plas­tic­ity , declines but does not come to a halt .
In addi­tion , we now know that new neu­rons can appear in cer­tain parts of the brain up until the day we die .
3. Brain plas­tic­ity is cru­cial fol­low­ing head injury .
It is the one brain ’s abil­ity that allows recov­ery .
Brain plas­tic­ity is also the abil­ity that brain train­ing takes advan­tages of to try to slow down the aging process .

Domino ’s credits Facebook and Foursquare promotions for lifting online sales by 61 percent in the U.K. and Ireland during the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2009 .
The international pizza chain also announced on Monday that web - based sales now account for 33 percent of its revenue , compared to 26 percent in 2009 .
“ Anything that helps to drive people to our online ordering page is always going to help drive sales , ” said Georgina Wald , spokesperson for the London - based division .
“ So when we use social media , we make sure there are plenty of ways to quickly get to the ordering site . ”
Domino ’s leverages a corporate Facebook page with 37,000 fans / ” People Like This ” for national campaigns .
Similar to user rewards programs like Foursquare ’s mayor system and Yelp ’s dukes and duchesses , the pizza brand has an ongoing “ Superfan ” promotion .
The male and female who bring the most friends to the Facebook page are anointed “ King ” and “ Queen , ” respectively , for the week and rewarded with a free pizza .
The company also encourages its 627 stores to set up Facebook pages for local marketing purposes .
Some U.K. locations – like in Plymouth and Huyton - with - Roby – have over 1,000 fans apiece .
The Plymouth store ran the following promotion on its page during the World Cup last month :
“ Buy any Pizza at regular price and we ’ll give your boss a Free Pizza – butter them up to be allowed to watch the game !!
This offer is available to all offices and workplaces from 11 am – 4 pm today !
Just contact your local store !!
COME ON ENGLAND ! ”
And Domino ’s has gotten a quick return from Foursquare after implementing a program with the geo-location service in late May .
“ We ’ve had nearly 10,000 check - ins since it launched from around 3,500 unique visitors , ” Wald said .
For all locations , a Foursquare check - in garners a complimentary side dish when customers spend more than 10 British pounds .
The aforementioned Huyton - with - Roby store created a YouTube video ( see below ) that explained how Foursquare generally works , as well as the location ’s check - in reward – free garlic pizza bread .
The brand has also built up 531 followers on Twitter .
As was the case with Facebook , some local stores have taken to Twitter .
For example , a Lincoln , U.K. location has nearly 300 followers .
It tweeted the following promotion yesterday : “ Thank pizza it ’s Tuesday !
Do n’t forget it ’s Two for Tuesday today – buy one medium or large Domino ’s #pizza and get another one free . ”
Outside of social media , Wald said search marketing has been another area of emphasis in recent months and has contributed to the increased online sales .
“ In addition , we have used tools such as [ an ] affiliates widget to encourage people to put their own link to the online ordering site on their blogs and Facebook pages , ” she said .

New elements in HTML 5
Structure and semantics
Development of HTML stopped in 1999 with HTML 4 .
The W3C focused its efforts on changing the underlying syntax of HTML from Standard Generalized Markup Language ( SGML ) to XML , as well as completely new markup languages like Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) , XForms , and MathML .
Browser vendors focused on browser features like tabs and RSS readers .
Web designers started learning CSS and the JavaScript™ language to build their own applications on top of the existing frameworks using Asynchronous JavaScript + XML ( Ajax ) .
But HTML itself grew hardly at all in the next eight years .
Frequently used acronyms CSS : Cascading Style Sheets
HTML : Hypertext Markup Language
W3C : World Wide Web Consortium
XML : Extensible Markup Language
Recently , the beast came back to life .
Three major browser vendors — Apple , Opera , and the Mozilla Foundation — came together as the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group ( WhatWG ) to develop an updated and upgraded version of classic HTML .
More recently , the W3C took note of these developments and started its own next - generation HTML effort with many of the same members .
Eventually , the two efforts will likely be merged .
Although many details remain to be argued over , the outlines of the next version of HTML are becoming clear .
This new version of HTML — usually called HTML 5 , although it also goes under the name Web Applications 1.0 — would be instantly recognizable to a Web designer frozen in ice in 1999 and thawed today .
There are no namespaces or schemas .
Elements do n't have to be closed .
Browsers are forgiving of errors .
A p is still a p , and a table is still a table .
At the same time , this proverbial unfrozen caveman Web designer would encounter some new and confusing elements .
Yes , old friends like div remain , but now HTML includes section , header , footer , and nav as well .
em , code , and strong are still present , but so are meter , time , and m .
img and embed continue to be used , but now there are video and audio too .
However , closer inspection by the caveman designer would reveal that these elements are n't that different .
Many of them might be things the designer needed back in 1999 but did n't have .
All these new elements are easily learned by simple analogy with elements the designer already understands .
In fact , they 're a lot easier to learn than Ajax or CSS .
Finally , when the caveman fired up the 300MHz laptop running Windows 98 that was also frozen in 1999 , they might be astonished to realize that the new pages display fine in Netscape 4 and Windows ® Internet Explorer ®
5 . Sure , the browser would n't recognize or do anything with the new elements , but the page still displays , and the content is all there .
That 's not a happy coincidence .
HTML 5 was explicitly designed to degrade gracefully in browsers that do n't support it .
The reason is simple :
We are all cave people .
Browsers now have tabs , CSS , and XmlHttpRequest , but their HTML renderers are stuck in 1999 .
The Web can't move forward without accounting for the installed base .
HTML 5 understands this .
It offers real benefits to page authors today while promising even more to page readers tomorrow as browsers are slowly upgraded .
With that in mind , let 's look at what HTML 5 brings you .
Structure
Even well - formed HTML pages are harder to process than they should be because of the lack of structure .
You have to figure out where the section breaks go by analyzing header levels .
Sidebars , footers , headers , navigation menus , main content sections , and individual stories are marked up by the catch - all div element .
HTML 5 adds new elements to specifically identify each of these common constructs :
section : A part or chapter in a book , a section in a chapter , or essentially anything that has its own heading in HTML 4
: A part or chapter in a book , a section in a chapter , or essentially anything that has its own heading in HTML 4 header :
The page header shown on the page ; not the same as the head element
: The page header shown on the page ; not the same as the element footer :
The page footer where the fine print goes ; the signature in an e-mail message
: The page footer where the fine print goes ; the signature in an e-mail message nav :
A collection of links to other pages
: A collection of links to other pages article :
An independent entry in a blog , magazine , compendium , and so forth
For example , consider a typical blog front page with a header at the top , a footer at the bottom , several entries , a navigation section , and a sidebar , as shown in Listing 1 .
Listing 1 . A typical blog page today
< html > < head > < title > Mokka mit Schlag </ title > </ head > < body > < div id =" page " > < div id =" header " > < h1 >< a href= " http://www.elharo.com/blog ">Mokka mit Schlag</a></h1 > </div > < div id =" container " > < div id =" center " class= " column " > < div class = " post " id =" post-1000572 " > < h2 >< a href= " /blog/birding/2007/04/23/spring-comes-and-goes-in-sussex-county / " >

< p > Yesterday I joined the Brooklyn Bird Club for our annual trip to Western New Jersey , specifically Hyper Humus , a relatively recently discovered hot spot .
It started out as a nice winter morning when we arrived at the site at 7:30 A.M. , progressed to Spring around 10:00 A.M. , and reached early summer by 10:15 .

I have n't been able to test it out yet ( 20 user limit apparently ) but this is certainly cool .
Personally , I can't imagine it replacing actually being out in the field by any small amount .
On the other hand , I 've always found it quite sad to meet senior birders who are no longer able to hold binoculars steady or get to the park .
I can imagine this might be of some interest to them .
At least one elderly birder did a big year on TV , after he could no longer get out so much .
This certainly tops that .

Even with proper indenting , it 's a fairly confusing mass of nested div s .
In HTML 5 , you can replace these with more direct semantic elements , as shown in Listing 2 .

No div s are needed any more .
Rather than using site - specific class attributes , the meaning of the different sections can be inferred from standard names .
This is especially important for audio , cell - phone , and other nonstandard browsers .
Block semantic elements
As well as the structural elements , HTML 5 adds some purely semantic block - level elements :
aside
figure
dialog
I use the first two all the time in articles like this one and in my books .
The third I do n't use so much myself , but it 's common in much written text .
aside
The aside element represents a note , a tip , a sidebar , a pullquote , a parenthetical remark , or something that 's just outside the main flow of the narrative .
For example , in developerWorks articles , you often find sidebars encoded as tables , as shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . A developerWorks HTML 4 sidebar
< table align = " right " border= " 0 " cellpadding = " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " width = " 40 % " > < tbody > < tr > < td width = " 10 " > < img alt= " " src="//www.ibm.com/i/c.gif " height = " 1 " width =
" 10 " ></td > < td > < table border= " 1 " cellpadding = " 5 " cellspacing = " 0 " width = " 100 % " > < tbody > < tr > < td bgcolor= " #eeeeee " > < p > < a name = " xf- value " >< span class= " smalltitle " >.xf-value</span></a></p> < p >
The < code type =" inline " >. xf - value </ code > selector used here styles the input field value but not its label .
This is actually inconsistent with the current CSS3 draft .
The example really should use the < code type = " inline " >:: value </ code > pseudo - class instead like so : </ p> < table border= " 0 " cellpadding = " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " width = " 100 % " > < tbody > < tr > < td class= " code - outline " > < pre class =" displaycode " > input :: value { width : 20em ; } #ccnumber : : value { width : 18 em } #zip : : value { width : 12em } # state : : value { width : 3em }</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><br> < p >
However , Firefox does n't yet support this syntax .
</ p> </td></tr></table>
In HTML 5 , you can write this much more sensibly , as shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . A developerWorks HTML 5 sidebar
< aside > < h3>.xf-value</h3 > < p >
The < code type =" inline " >. xf - value </ code > selector used here styles the input field value but not its label .
This is actually inconsistent with the current CSS3 draft .
The example really should use the < code type = " inline " >:: value </ code > pseudo - class instead like so : </ p> < pre class =" displaycode " > input :: value { width : 20em ; } #ccnumber : : value { width : 18 em } #zip : : value { width : 12em } # state : : value { width : 3em }</pre> < p >
However , Firefox does n't yet support this syntax .
</ p> </aside >
The browser can figure out where to put the sidebar , possibly with a little help from CSS .
figure
The figure element represents a block - level image , along with a caption .
For example , in many developerWorks articles , you find markup like Listing 5 ; the results are shown in Figure 1 .
Listing 5 . A developerWorks HTML 4 figure
< a name = " fig2 " >< b> Figure 2 . Install Mozilla XForms dialog</ b></a>< br /> < img alt = " A Web site is requesting permission to install the following item : Mozilla XForms 0.7 Unsigned " src=" installdialog.jpg " border= " 0 " height = " 317 " hspace = " 5 " vspace = " 5 " width = " 331 " /> < br />
Figure 1 . Install Mozilla XForms dialog
In HTML 5 , you can write this more semantically , as shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . A developerWorks HTML 5 figure
< figure id = " fig2 " > < legend >
Figure 2 . Install Mozilla XForms dialog </ legend > < img alt = " A
Web site is requesting permission to install the following item : Mozilla XForms 0.7 Unsigned " src=" installdialog.jpg " border= " 0 " height = " 317 " hspace = " 5 " vspace = " 5 " width = " 331 " /> </ figure >
Most important , browsers — especially screen readers — can clearly and unambiguously associate the caption with the picture .
The figure element is n't limited to pictures .
You can also use it to caption audio , video , iframe , object , and embed elements .
dialog
The dialog element represents a conversation between several people .
The HTML 5 dt element is overloaded to indicate the speaker , and the HTML 5 dd element is overloaded to indicate the speech .
This gives reasonable display even in legacy browsers .
Listing 7 shows a bit of famous dialogue from Galileo 's " Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems . "
Listing 7 . A Galilean dialogue in HTML 5
< dialog > < dt> Simplicius </ dt > < dd> According to the straight line AF , and not according to the curve , such being already excluded for such a use .
</dd > < dt> Sagredo </ dt > < dd> But I should take neither of them , seeing that the straight line AF runs obliquely .
I should draw a line perpendicular to CD , for this would seem to me to be the shortest , as well as being unique among the infinite number of longer and unequal ones which may be drawn from the point A to every other point of the opposite line CD .
</ dd > < dt> Salviati </ dt > < dd><p>
Your choice and the reason you adduce for it seem to me most excellent .
So now we have it that the first dimension is determined by a straight line ; the second ( namely , breadth ) by another straight line , and not only straight , but at right angles to that which determines the length .
Thus we have defined the two dimensions of a surface ; that is , length and breadth .
</p> < p >
But suppose you had to determine a height — for example , how high this platform is from the pavement down below there .
Seeing that from any point in the platform we may draw infinite lines , curved or straight , and all of different lengths , to the infinite points of the pavement below , which of all these lines would you make use of ?
</ p> </dd > </dialog >
The exact syntax of this element is still being argued over .
Some people want to embed additional nondialogue text ( such as stage directions ) inside the dialog element , and others are n't happy with the overloading of dt and dd .
However , most everyone agrees that some such semantic representation of dialogue is a good thing , even if they have n't yet agreed on the exact syntax .
Inline semantic elements
HTML 4 has five different inline elements to represent subtly different variations of computer code : var , code , kbd , tt , and samp .
However , it does n't have any way to indicate such basic qualities as time , numbers , or sarcasm .
HTML 5 aims to rectify this imbalance between techies and normal writers with several new inline elements .
mark
The m element indicates text that is " marked " somehow but not necessarily emphasized .
You can imagine it as being like highlighted passages in a book .
The canonical use case is Google 's cached pages .
When you follow a link to the cached copy , the search terms are marked .
For example , if you searched for " Egret " , then a cached Google page might be marked up like this :
The Great < m > Egret </m > ( also known as the American < m > Egret < /m > ) is a large white wading bird found worldwide .
The Great < m > Egret </m > flies with slow wing beats .
The scientific name of the Great < m > Egret </m > is < i>Casmerodius albus </i>.
The name of this element is currently subject to some debate .
It might be changed to mark instead of m before the spec is released .
time
The time element indicates a specific moment in history , such as 5:35 P.M. , EST , April 23 , 2007 .
For example ,
< p > I am writing this example at < time > 5:35 P.M. on April 23rd </ time > . </ p>
The time element helps browsers and others recognize times in HTML pages .
It does n't require any particular format for the element 's content .
However , each time element should have a datetime attribute that includes the time in a more machine - recognizable form , like this :
< p > I am writing this example at < time datetime = " 2007-04-23T17:35:00-05:00 " > 5:35 P.M. on April 23rd </ time > . </ p>
Machine - readable times are potentially useful for search engines , calendar programs , and the like .
meter
The meter element represents a numeric value in a specified range .
For example , you can use it for salaries , percentage of the French electorate that voted for Le Pen , or test scores .
Here , I use meter to mark up some data I got from a Google programmer at Software Development 2007 :
< p> An entry level programmer in Silicon Valley can expect to start around < meter > $ 90,000 < / meter > per year .
</ p>
The meter element helps browsers and other clients recognize amounts in HTML pages .
It does n't require any particular format for the element 's content .
However , each meter element can have up to six attributes offering information about this amount in a more machine - recognizable form :
value
min
low
high
max
optimum
Each of these should contain a decimal number indicating the relevant range .
For example , a final exam grade might be marked up like this :
< p> Your score was < meter value = " 88.7 " min= " 0 " max = " 100 " low = " 65 " high = " 96 " optimum =
" 100 " >B+</ meter >. </ p>
This indicates that the student 's score was 88.7 out of a possible 100 .
The lowest possible grade was 0 , but the lowest actual grade anyone got was 65 .
The highest grade anyone got was 96 , although of course the ideal score was 100 .
User agents can display this information using some sort of meter control or give the extra data in a tooltip , but most will probably style it like any other inline element .
progress
The progress element represents the state of an ongoing process , like the progress bar in a graphical user interface ( GUI ) application .
For instance , it can show you what percentage of a file is downloaded or how far you are into a movie .
This progress control says that a download is 33 % complete :
< p>Downloaded : < progress value= " 1534602 " max = " 4603807 " >33%</ progress > </ p>
The value attribute shows the current state of the operation .
The max attribute shows the total amount toward which the progress is moving .
Here the element indicates that 1,534,602 bytes out of a total 4,603,807 bytes have been downloaded .
You can display indefinite progress bars by omitting the max attribute .
You should use the JavaScript language to dynamically update the progress bar as the operation continues .
Statically , this element is n't very interesting .
Embedded media
Video on the Web is booming , but it 's almost all proprietary .
YouTube uses Flash , Microsoft uses Windows Media® , and Apple uses QuickTime .
Markup that works for embedding such content in one browser does n't work in the next .
Consequently , the WhatWG has proposed a new video element that allows the embedding of arbitrary video formats .
For example , I might embed my QuickTime movie of a Sora in Prospect Park like so :
< video src="//www.cafeaulait.org/birds/sora.mov " />
Whether any one format and codec will be preferred is still under debate .
Probably Ogg Theora support at least will be strongly recommended , if not required .
Support for proprietary formats such as QuickTime and patent - encumbered formats such as MPEG - 4 will be optional .
Most likely , the actual formats will be decided in the marketplace , much as GIF , JPEG , and PNG became the preferred formats for img elements over contenders like BMP , X - Bitmap , and JPEG 2000 .
A complementary audio element is also proposed .
For example , you might attach background music to a Web page like this :
< audio src=" spacemusic.mp3 " autoplay =" autoplay " loop = " 20000 " />
The autoplay attribute tells the browser to begin playing as soon as the page is loaded , without waiting for an explicit user request .
It then loops 20,000 times before shutting off ( or until the user closes the window or goes to another page ) .
Of course , browsers can and should offer users the ability to mute and pause embedded media , whether the page author has done so or not .
Browsers must support the WAV format .
Browsers can also support other formats such as MP3 if they like .
Because these elements are n't supported by legacy browsers and can be inaccessible to blind and deaf users , the audio and video elements might contain additional markup describing the content of the audio and video .
This also helps search engines .
Ideally these would be full transcripts of the content of the audio and video .
For example , Listing 8 shows how you might mark up John F. Kennedy 's inaugural address .
Listing 8 . John F. Kennedy 's inaugural address in HTML 5
< audio src=" kennedyinauguraladdrees.mp3 " > < p > Vice President Johnson , Mr. Speaker , Mr. Chief Justice , President Eisenhower , Vice President Nixon , President Truman , Reverend Clergy , fellow citizens : </ p> < p >
We observe today not a victory of party , but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end , as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal , as well as change .
For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three - quarters ago .
</p> < p >
The world is very different now .
For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life .
And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state , but from the hand of God . </ p> < p > ... </ p> </audio>
Interactivity
HTML 5 also goes under the rubric of Web Applications 1.0 .
Toward that end , several new elements are focused on more interactive experiences for Web pages :
details
datagrid
menu
command
These elements all have the potential to change what is displayed based on user action and choice without loading a new page from the server .
details
The details element represents further information that might not be shown by default .
An optional legend element can summarize the details .
One use for details is for footnotes and endnotes .
For example :
The bill of a Craveri's Murrelet is about 10 % thinner than the bill of a Xantus 's Murrelet . < details > < legend > [ Sibley , 2000 ] </ legend > < p > Sibley , David Allen , The Sibley Guide to Birds , ( New York : Chanticleer Press , 2000 ) p. 247 </ p> </details >
The exact rendering is n't specified .
One browser might use a footnote , another an endnote , and a third a tooltip .
Each details element can have an open attribute .
If it has this attribute , then the details will be initially shown to the reader .
If it does n't have such an attribute , then they will be hidden until the user asks for them .
In either case , the user can click an icon or other indicator to show or hide the details .
datagrid
The datagrid element serves the role of a grid control .
It 's intended for trees , lists , and tables that can be updated by both the user and scripts .
By contrast , traditional tables are mostly intended for static data .
A datagrid gets its initial data from its contents : a table , select , or other group of HTML elements .
For example , Listing 9 shows a datagrid that contains a grade sheet .
In this example , the datagrid is populated from a table .
A simpler one - dimensional datagrid might be populated by a select element .
If other HTML elements are used , then each child element becomes a row in the grid .
Listing 9 .
A grade sheet datagrid
< datagrid > < table > < tr >< td > Jones</td>< td > Allison</td >< td>
A-</td>< td>B+</td>< td>A</td></tr>
< tr>< td > Smith</td>< td> Johnny</td>< td>A</td><td>C+</td><td>A</td></tr>
< tr>< td > Willis</td>< td> Sydney</td >< td>C-</td>< td>D</td>< td>F</td></tr> < tr>< td > Wilson</td >< td > Frank</td >< td>B-</td>< td>B+</td>< td>A</td></tr> </table > </datagrid >
What distinguishes this from a regular table is that the user can select rows , columns , and cells ; collapse rows , columns , and cells ; edit cells ; delete rows , columns , and cells ; sort the grid ; and otherwise interact with the data directly in the browser on the client .
The JavaScript code monitors the updates .
The HTMLDataGridElement ( Listing 10 ) interface is added to the Document Object Model ( DOM ) to support this .
Listing 10 .
HTMLDataGridElement
interface HTMLDataGridElement : HTMLElement { attribute DataGridDataProvider data ; readonly attribute DataGridSelection selection ; attribute boolean multiple ; attribute boolean disabled ; void updateEverything ( ) ; void updateRowsChanged ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long count ) ; void updateRowsInserted ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long count ) ; void updateRowsRemoved ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long count ) ; void updateRowChanged ( in RowSpecification row ) ; void updateColumnChanged ( in unsigned long column ) ; void updateCellChanged ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column ) ; } ;
The DOM can also be used to load data into the grid dynamically .
That is , the datagrid does n't have to have children that provide the initial data .
Instead , it can be set with DataGridDataProvider object , as shown in Listing 11 .
This enables you to load data from databases , XmlHttpRequest , or anything else JavaScript code can talk to .
Listing 11 . DataGridDataProvider
interface DataGridDataProvider { void initialize ( in HTMLDataGridElement datagrid ) ; unsigned long getRowCount ( in RowSpecification row ) ; unsigned long getChildAtPosition ( in RowSpecification parentRow , in unsigned long position ) ; unsigned long getColumnCount ( ) ; DOMString getCaptionText ( in unsigned long column ) ; void getCaptionClasses ( in unsigned long column , in DOMTokenList classes ) ; DOMString getRowImage ( in RowSpecification row ) ; HTMLMenuElement getRowMenu ( in RowSpecification row ) ; void getRowClasses ( in RowSpecification row , in DOMTokenList classes ) ; DOMString getCellData ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column ) ; void getCellClasses ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column , in DOMTokenList classes ) ; void toggleColumnSortState ( in unsigned long column ) ; void setCellCheckedState ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column , in long state ) ; void cycleCell ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column ) ; void editCell ( in RowSpecification row , in unsigned long column , in DOMString data ) ; } ;
menu and command
The menu element has actually been present in HTML since at least version 2 .
It was deprecated in HTML 4 , but it comes roaring back with new significance in HTML 5 .
In HTML 5 , a menu contains command elements , each of which causes an immediate action .
For example , Listing 12 is a menu that pops up alerts .
Listing 12 .
HTML 5 menu
< menu > < command onclick =" alert ( ' first command ' ) " label = " Do 1st Command " /> < command onclick = " alert ( ' second command ' ) " label = " Do 2nd Command " /> < command onclick =" alert ( ' third command ' ) " label = " Do 3rd Command " / > </ menu >
Commands can also be turned into check boxes with a checked =" checked " attribute .
You can turn check boxes into radio buttons by specifying a radiogroup attribute whose value is the name of the group of mutually exclusive buttons .
In addition to simple lists of commands , you can use the menu element to create a toolbar or pop -up context menu by setting the type attribute to toolbar or popup .
For example , Listing 13 shows a toolbar such as you might find in a blog editor like WordPress .
It uses the icon attribute to link to button pictures .
Listing 13 .
HTML 5 toolbar
< menu type =" toolbar " > < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 0 ) ; " label = " strong " icon=" bold.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 1 ) ; " label= " em " icon="italic.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertLink ( buttons , 2 ) ; " label = " link " icon= " link.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 3 ) ; " label= " b- quote " icon= " blockquote.gif " /> < command onclick =" insertTag ( buttons , 4 ) ; " label = " del " icon=" del.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 5 ) ; " label= " ins " icon=" insert.gif " /> < command onclick =" insertImage ( buttons ) ; " label= " img " icon= " image.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 7 ) ; " label= " ul " icon=" bullet.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 8 ) ; " label= " ol " icon=" number.gif " /> < command onclick =" insertTag ( buttons , 9 ) ; " label= " li " icon=" item.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 10 ) ; " label= " code " icon=" code.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 11 ) ; " label= " cite " icon=" cite.gif " /> < command onclick=" insertTag( buttons , 12 ) ; " label = " abbr " icon= " abbr.gif " /> < command onclick= " insertTag( buttons , 13 ) ; " label= " acronym " icon=" acronym.gif " /> </ menu >
The label attribute gives a title for the menu .
For example , Listing 14 might be an Edit menu .
Listing 14 .
HTML 5 Edit menu
< menu type = " popup " label= " Edit " > < command onclick = " undo ( ) " label= " Undo " /> < command onclick = " redo ( ) " label= " Redo " /> < command onclick= " cut ( ) " label= " Cut " /> < command onclick= " copy ( ) " label= " Copy " /> < command onclick = " paste ( ) " label = " Paste " /> < command onclick =" delete ( ) " label = " Clear " / > </ menu >
Menus can be nested inside other menus to create hierarchical menus .
Conclusion
HTML 5 is part of the future of the Web .
Its new elements enable clearer , simpler markup that makes pages more obvious .
Div and span still have their places , but those places are much more restricted than they used to be .
Many pages will no longer need to use them .
Although not all browsers will support these new elements at first , the same has been true for most elements introduced after HTML was first invented : img , table , object , and many more .
Support will come with time .
In the meantime , HTML 's must - ignore behavior for unrecognized elements means that users with legacy browsers will still be able to read HTML 5 pages .
They can do so today .
Users with more modern browsers will get an enhanced experience , but no one will be left out .
Eight years is a long time to wait for new features , especially in the fast - moving world of the Web .
HTML 5 restores some of the excitement of the early days when Netscape , Microsoft , and others were introducing new elements every other week .
At the same time , it takes a much more careful approach to defining these elements so that everyone can use them interoperably .
The future looks bright .

The online organizational efforts of Texas Congressman and presidential hopeful Ron Paul appears to have paid off this week - end at the Ames , Iowa straw poll .
Media reports , the campaign itself , supporters and self - styled pundits all noted both the turnout at the festivities on Saturday as well as his relatively strong showing against his rivals .
A Wall Street Journal postmortem analysis of the poll results called Paul 's fifth placement " impressive , " given his " narrowly - defined " candidacy .
Other reporters on the trail noted throughout the week - end that the fairground was covered in Ron Paul signs .
And one excerpted post on a Paul - supporter libertarian - leaning Web site notes :
" Lastly , Ron Paul , though fifth , showed that he was able to translate his Internet support into votes on the ground in a difficult environment with little name recognition .
That he received approximately 500 more votes than his campaign gave away tickets while only spending a week or two in the state indicates he may be the only Republican candidate that can truthfully claim grassroots support ( the Paul campaign only opened their official Iowa headquarters this past Friday . ) "
Paul had said that he had hoped to place fourth in the poll – nevertheless , his campaign sounded an optimistic note .
" On behalf of Dr. Ron Paul and his wife Carol , and the Ron Paul 2008 campaign staff , I thank our supporters and volunteers in Iowa and throughout the country for the strong showing in the Iowa straw poll .
We are pleased and encouraged by the results , " wrote his campaign chairman Kent Snyder in a note sent out to supporters , and on the campaign Web site .
Paul placed fifth with 1,305 , or 9.1 percent of the votes , behind Congressman Tom Tancredo ( 13.7 percent , ) Kansas Senator Sam Brownback ( 15.3 percent ) and Mike Huckabee ( 18.1 percent ) and Mitt Romney with 31 percent . )
He beat out former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson ( who spent half a million on the Ames campaign , ) unofficial Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson , and front runners New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Arizona Senator John McCain ( none of whom participated in the Saturday speech - making and festivities . )
Like Huckabee , Paul's Ames , Iowa campaign did not provide transportation for supporters .
Volunteers organized their own transportation through Meet - Up , manned phone banks and placed advertisements in newspapers on behalf of their candidate .
Paul campaigned throughout the week in the state , and he also placed television and radio advertisements .

The target of Mr Kissling 's ire is a nondescript house belonging to the region 's Turkish immigrant community .
The basement is a prayer room where hundreds of Muslims gather every week for Friday rites .
And in a case that has gone all the way to Switzerland 's supreme court , setting a keenly watched precedent , the Turks of Wangen have just won the right to erect a six - metre - high minaret .
" We 'll build it by next year .
We 're still deciding what colour and what material , " says Mustafa Karahan , the sole person authorised to speak for Wangen 's Turkish Cultural Association .
" We do n't have any problems .
It 's the other side that has the problems .
We 're not saying anything else until the minaret is built . "
If Ulrich Schlüer has his way the Wangen minaret will be toppled .
An MP from the rightwing Swiss People 's party ( SVP ) , the country 's strongest , Mr Schlüer has launched a crusade to keep his country culturally Christian .
" Unlike other religions , " he argues , " Islam is not only a religion .
It 's an ideology aiming to create a different legal system .
That 's sharia .
That 's a big problem and in a proper democracy it has to be tackled .
If the politicians do n't , the people will . "
Switzerland 's direct democracy rules require referendums if there is enough public support .
Mr Schlüer has launched a petition demanding a new clause in the Swiss constitution stating : " The building of minarets in Switzerland is forbidden . "
He already has 40,000 signatures .
If , as expected , he reaches 100,000 by this time next year a referendum is automatically triggered .
" We 've got nothing against prayer rooms or mosques for the Muslims , " he insists .
" But a minaret is different .
It 's got nothing to do with religion .
It 's a symbol of political power . "
In a country with more than 300,000 Muslims , mainly immigrants from the Balkans , there are only three minarets in Switzerland .
Wangen would be the fourth and the first outside the cities .
Backlash
The native backlash has begun .
And not just in Switzerland .
" It seems our experience here is resonating across Europe , " says a Swiss official in Berne .
" Culture clashes " over Muslim religious buildings have erupted in Italy , Austria , Germany , and the Netherlands .
" Christian fundamentalists are behind this , " says Reinhard Schulze , professor of Islamic studies at Berne University .
" And there 's also a lot of money coming in from the Gulf states . "
From London 's docklands to the rolling hills of Tuscany , from southern Austria to Amsterdam and Cologne , the issue of Islamic architecture and its impact on citadels of " western civilisation " is increasingly contentious .
The far right is making capital from Islamophobia by focusing on the visible symbols of Islam in Europe .
In Switzerland it is the far - right SVP that is setting the terms of the debate .
" This is mainly about Swiss politics , " says Prof Schulze , " a conflict between the right and the left to decide who runs the country ... Islam [ is ] a pretext . "
Next door in Austria the far right leader Jörg Haider is also calling for a ban in his province of Carinthia , even though there are few Muslims and no known plans for mosques .
" Carinthia , " he said , " will be a pioneer in the battle against radical Islam for the protection of our dominant western culture . "
In Italy the mayors of Bologna and Genoa last month cancelled or delayed planning permission for mosques after a vociferous campaign by the far - right Northern League , one of whose leaders , Roberto Calderoli , threatened to stage a " day of pork " to offend Muslims and to take pigs to " defile " the site of the proposed mosque in Bologna .
While the far right makes the running , their noisy campaign is being supported more quietly by mainstream politicians and some Christian leaders .
And on the left pro-secularist and anti-clericalist sentiment is also frequently ambivalent about Islamic building projects .
Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Cologne has voiced his unease over a large new mosque being built for the city 's 120,000 Muslims in the Rhineland Roman Catholic stronghold .
A similar scheme in Munich has also faced local protests .
The Bishop of Graz in Austria has been more emphatic .
" Muslims should not build mosques which dominate town 's skylines in countries like ours , " said Bishop Egon Kapellari .
This opposition is on a collision course with an Islam that is now the fastest - growing religion in Europe and which is clamouring for its places of worship to be given what it sees as a rightful and visible place in west European societies .
" Islam is coming out of the backyards .
It 's a trend you see everywhere in Europe , " says Thomas Schmitt , a Bonn University geographer studying conflicts over mosques in Germany .
Estimated at about 18 million and growing , the Muslims of western Europe have long worshipped in prayer rooms located in homes , disused factories , warehouses or car parks , hidden away from public view .
Their growing self - confidence , though , is reflected in plans for the Abbey Mills mosque , Britain 's biggest , in east London , which is intended to have a capacity of 40,000 .
Last month there were scuffles at the site of the Westermoskee in west Amsterdam .
A Dutch government minister broke ground for building one of the Netherlands ' biggest mosques last year .
But the project is mired in controversy and may not be completed .
Confidence
" The whole idea of having these huge mosques is about being part of Europe while having your religion , " says Thijl Sunier , a Dutch anthropologist .
" You have young Muslims showing their confidence , stating we are part of this society and we want our share .
And you have growing anxiety among many native Europeans . "
In Berne , the Swiss capital , the city authorities have just denied building permission for turning a disused abattoir into Europe 's biggest Islamic cultural centre , a £ 40 m complex with a mosque , a museum on Islam , a hotel , offices and conference halls .
Organisers are looking for an alternative site .
Dr Schmitt says that by hiring leading architects to build impressive mosques that alter the appearance of European cities Muslims are making a commitment to the societies in which they live .
" They are no longer guests .
They are established .
This is a sign of normalisation , of integration , " he says .
But in Wangen , that message falls on deaf ears .
" First it was a cultural centre , then a prayer room , and now a minaret , " says Mr Kissling .
" It 's salami tactics .
The next thing it will be loudspeakers and the calls to prayer will be echoing up and down the valley .
Our children will ask ' what did our fathers do ' , and their answer will be - they did nothing . "
By contrast , the favored American missile - defense radar operates at frequencies 70 times higher .
The advantage of this is that you get 70 times better radar resolution , and thus a far clearer picture of the object .
Clarity is important when it comes to figuring out exactly what sort of a missile you are dealing with and distinguishing an actual warhead from debris .
However , at such high frequencies the amount of radio energy that is reflected back to the radar is very small , typically one one - hundredth or less of that received when using the lower frequencies of the Russian radar .
What all this means is that the Russian radar can quickly and effectively search the sky for missiles , but has little ability to determine exactly what it has found .
The American radar may take longer to find the object , but can carefully observe its structural details .
It should be obvious that when you use two systems with such different strengths and weaknesses in tandem , you will have a much easier time spotting and tracking missiles .
Working together at Azerbaijan , which borders northwestern Iran , has another advantage .
At such short range , the curvature of the Earth has only a small effect on the radar ’s line of sight , so we ’d get a clearer view and much earlier warning .
American radar there could observe the launching of a missile out of Iran and headed toward Washington at least three to four minutes earlier than could the proposed Eastern Europe system .
During these precious extra minutes , tracking data can be accumulated , intercept points calculated , and interceptor missiles launched .
There can be few , if any , technical objections to such cooperation .
Politics , however , is another story .
Those who do not believe that the cold war is over will complain that we cannot trust the Russians to work with us even when it is in our common interests .
Another objection — that President Putin ’s government is hardly a paragon of democracy and human rights — ignores the fact that technical cooperation between the countries is a good way to encourage Russia to be closer with the West .
President Bush told Mr. Putin last month that “ the cold war is over . ”
Cooperating with Russia on missile defense is the perfect way to put those words into action .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Antitrust authorities at the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday warned regulators against imposing “ network neutrality ” regulations that would bar broadband Internet service companies from charging extra to some content providers .
In comments submitted to the Federal Communications Commission , the department said some net neutrality proposals “ could deter broadband Internet providers from upgrading and expanding their networks to reach more Americans . ”
“ Regulators should be careful not to impose regulations that could limit consumer choice and investment in broadband facilities , ” the department ’s antitrust chief , Thomas Barnett , said in a statement .
The concept of net neutrality is being studied by the FCC and has been the subject of much debate in Congress .
Some lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to get net neutrality legislation passed last year .
Network neutrality proposals , backed by Internet content companies like Google Inc and eBay Inc , would bar Internet providers from charging extra fees to guarantee access to the Internet or give priority to some content .
However , the idea has been staunchly opposed by high - speed Internet providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc .
Companies like eBay and Google worry that AT&T and Verizon will charge them more to get access to consumers or make it harder for consumers to get access to unaffiliated content .
The network providers counter that they would not block access to public Internet sites but want to offer private Internet - based services with faster speeds for uses such as downloading movies .
Last year , the FCC approved AT&T ’s purchase of BellSouth Corp after AT&T promised to maintain net neutrality of its high - speed Internet platform for two years .
It was one of several key concessions that AT&T made to ease concerns about competition .
The comments from the Justice Department come on the heels of a report in June by antitrust experts at the Federal Trade Commission that expressed similar views and recommended that regulators “ proceed with caution ” on any such proposals .
The department said proponents of the Internet regulation had failed to show that many consumers had been harmed in a way that would justify government intervention .
It said there was nothing unusual about the practice of setting different levels of service and pricing , citing as an example the various mail options offered by the U.S. Postal Service .
“ These differentiated products respond to market demand and expand consumers ’ choice , ” the department said .
Advocates of the network neutrality idea criticized the department ’s conclusions , saying regulations were needed because many consumers had little or no choice of broadband providers .
“ This lack of competition and consumer choice for broadband access is the reason why ( we support ) preemptive safeguards to ensure that cable and telephone companies do not destroy the Internet as we know it , ” said the Open Internet Coalition , a group comprised of consumer groups and Internet content companies such as Google .
On the other hand , the department ’s comments were met with praise from AT&T .
“ We continue to urge policymakers to focus on the real issue of the broadband era , which is to promote the benefits of broadband services at affordable rates for all consumers , ” AT&T said in a statement .
Governor Carepa said she was shocked at the reports
The governor of the state of Para , where the reported case took place , has promised a full inquiry .
Governor Ana Julia Carepa said the age of the woman , put variously at 15 and 20 , was irrelevant as she should not have been jailed with male prisoners .
Women 's rights groups in Brazil say it is not an isolated case .
According to reports in the Brazilian media , the number of men in the cell with the young woman ranged between 20 and more than 30 .
Public anger
Media reports suggested that the girl was placed in a police cell in the town of Abaetetuba on suspicion of theft .
But human - rights groups say there is uncertainty about what offence the girl was accused of and she was not formally charged .
Whether she was 15 , 20 , or 100 does n't matter .
A woman should never be left in a jail with men
Governor Ana Julia Carepa
Brazil 's notorious prisons
The girl 's father has now alleged that he has been threatened by police who tried to force him to provide a birth certificate showing that the girl was 20 years of age - a document which he said did not exist .
The police are said to have believed at one stage that the girl was not under age .
Public anger
Gov Carepa said the girl 's age did not matter .
" Whether she was 15 , 20 , or 100 does n't matter .
A woman should never be left in a jail with men , " she said .
Jails in Brazil are notorious for overcrowding and appalling conditions , and this is not the first time that there has been a controversy over a female prisoner being detained alongside men .
However , on this occasion , the seriousness of the allegation has caused shock and considerable public anger , the BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says .
Women 's rights groups in Para state quoted by the Globo website say there have been at least three cases of women being put in cells with men .

Five days from today , Iowa voters will caucus and the 2008 Presidential primary season will start .
Five days later , New Hampshire will hold it ’s primary earlier in the year than ever before .
And , then , four weeks later , 20 states will hold primaries on what some pundits are referring to as Super Duper Tuesday .
By the time Super Tuesday is over , more than 50 % of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will have been chosen and it ’s likely that the race will have narrowed to two , maybe three , candidates who have a realistic chance of winning the nomination .
So where does the race stand today ?
If you look at the national polls , Giuliani still leads but Romney is moving up in his rearview mirror :
The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows Rudy Giuliani with 24 % support in the race for the Republican Presidential Nomination .
Four candidates are closely bunched in a battle for second place nationally –Mitt Romney is supported by 15 % John McCain by 14 % , Mike Huckabee at 12 % and Fred Thompson at 11 % .
Ron Paul ’s attracts 5 % of Likely Republican Primary voters nationwide and no other Republican candidate reaches 2 %
Granted , Rasmussen is only one poll , but it ’s the most recent one released and it appears to be consistent with other polls released to date .
In Iowa , it ’s a slightly different story .
Romney has been in the lead for the past several months , but a guy named Mike Huckabee has been sneaking up and may have passed him :
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of the Iowa caucus finds former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee with 28 % of the vote , former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney with 25 % support , and everyone else far behind .
National frontrunner Rudy Giuliani gets just 12 % of the vote in Iowa at this time while former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson is the only other candidate in double digits at 11 %
Polling in Iowa has traditionally been difficult , but this Rasmussen poll is consistent with other Iowa polls and consistent with something we ’ve seen since August —- for better or worse , Mike Huckabee is poised to do well in Iowa .
In New Hampshire the results look like this
Romney — 34 % Giuliani — 20 % McCain — 13 % Paul — 8 % Huckabee — 7 % Thompson — 2 %
Giuliani is apparently planning to make a push in New Hampshire , but its unclear that it would be enough to make up for a lead that Romney has consistently maintained for months .
The more interesting question will be — what happens to Romney if Huckabee beats him in Iowa ?
My guess is that some number of Romney voters will look elsewhere .
Finally , there ’s the Super Tuesday states :
In states holding Primaries or Caucuses on February 5 , the races for the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominations look broadly similar to the competition on a national level .
In the race for the Republican Presidential nomination , Rudy Giuliani attracts 27 % in the February 5 states and holds a double digit lead .
Former Tennessee Senator Fred Thomson and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee are tied for second with 14 % support .
Arizona Senator John McCain is close behind at 11 % while former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney earns the vote from 10 % of Likely Primary Voters in these states .
Texas Congressman Ron Paul is supported by 4 %
Obviously , this is an average of results from 20 states and each state holds its own primary but it shows something very interesting .
While Giuliani remains in the lead , the principal challenge in these primarily southern and western states comes not from Mitt Romney , but from Mike Huckabee , the guy who nobody thought would amount to anything .
As much as it pains me to admit it , his campaign is n’t going away anytime soon .
Based on the above , here ’s my entirely unscientific prediction of where things will stand on February 6 , 2008 in terms of the race for delegates :
In first place , though perhaps not by a large margin —- Rudy Giuliani .
In second place —- Mike Huckabee
Close behind in third —- Mitt Romney
Paul , McCain , and Thompson ( if he ’s still in the race ) will make up the rest of the pack
Feel free to link to this article on February 7th if I ’m proven to be wrong .
This afternoon one of our readers alerted us to some plagiarism of Mashable content .
While seeing Mashable stories re-printed word - for - word on splogs is nothing new , the source here was somewhat surprising : Associated Content .
The company has raised $ 10 million in funding , and counts industry heavyweights like Google VP of Sales Tim Armstrong and investor Ron Conway on its board .
The content in question is under the account of roemverda .
As recently as yesterday , there were more than a dozen Mashable stories , copied word for word and posted to Associated Content .
Here ’s one especially egregious example : Mark ’s feature story “ 12 Things We Want Fixed on the Web , ” which he spent the better part of the afternoon writing , copied exactly to an Associated Content page :
What ’s surprising here is that content submitted to AC supposedly goes to an editor before being published .
I tried it out myself , and indeed submitted content first goes through a review process before being posted .
The following line , which is the first sentence in Mark ’s feature story , should ’ve been an automatic red flag :
“ We here at Mashable have been going back and forth on the things we 'd like to see for Christmas this year … ”
That , and the sheer volume of content a single person was able to produce in one day should ’ve raised some eyebrows at Associated Content , but in this case , it did not .
Meanwhile , Mashable is far from the only victim .
Taking a closer look at roemverda ’s account , there is plagiarized content about all sorts of different topics – estate planning , gift baskets , and day trading are just a few of the other topics he dips into .
Apparently , his incredibly broad array of knowledge also is n’t a red flag for AC .
While the company publicly states that those that infringe copyrights will be banned for life from the site , the loose editorial policy allows content to be published and the company to make oodles of cash from the ads , while they wait for someone to become alerted to the fact their content was stolen .
This policy allows the company to claim “ no foul , ” and in reality , is probably compliant with DMCA .
But it ’s ugly , and not something I would expect those involved to want to have their names associated with .
So what 's really going on here ?
Quick : say the col­or in which each word in this graph­ic is dis­played ( do n’t just read the word ! ) :
Here you have a round - up of some great recent arti­cles on mem­o­ry , aging , and cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties such as self - con­trol :
1 ) How to Boost Your Willpow­er ( New York Times ) .
- “ The video watch­ers were lat­er giv­en a con­cen­tra­tion test in which they were asked to iden­ti­fy the col­or in which words were dis­played .
( Note : now you see why we start­ed with that brain exer­cise … )
The word for instance , might appear in blue ink .
The video watch­ers who had sti­fled their respons­es did the worst on the test , sug­gest­ing that their self - con­trol had already been deplet­ed by the film chal­lenge . ” -
“ Final­ly , some research sug­gests that peo­ple strug­gling with self - con­trol should start small .
A few stud­ies show that peo­ple who were instruct­ed for two weeks to make small changes like improv­ing their pos­ture or brush­ing their teeth with their oppo­site hand improved their scores on lab­o­ra­to­ry tests of self - con­trol .
The data are n’t con­clu­sive , but they do sug­gest that the quest for self - improve­ment should start small .
A vow to stop swear­ing , to make the bed every day or to give up just one food may be a way to strength­en your self - con­trol , giv­ing you more willpow­er reserves for big­ger chal­lenges lat­er . ”
Com­ment : learn­ing , build­ing abil­i­ties , are process­es that require prac­tice and grow­ing lev­els of dif­fi­cul­ty .
Like train­ing our mus­cles in the gym .
So the advice to start small and pro­gres­sive­ly do more makes sense .
Many times the ene­my of learn­ing is the stress and anx­i­ety we pro­voke by try­ing to do too many things at the same time …
2 ) Jog­ging Your Mem­o­ry ( Newsweek ) Thanks Chris for alert­ing us !
- “ No one should expect mir­a­cles soon , if at all .
But the deep­er sci­en­tists peer into the work­ings of mem­o­ry , the bet­ter they under­stand what helps to stave off age - relat­ed declines and the clos­er they come to devis­ing poten­tial drugs to help . ” -
“ That ’s why many sci­en­tists are more inter­est­ed in what we can accom­plish nat­u­ral­ly , with­out drugs .
“ With a rea­son­able amount of effort , you can improve your mem­o­ry 30 to 40 per­cent , ” says Dr. Bar­ry Gor­don , founder of the mem­o­ry clin­ic at Johns Hop­kins .
In the past year , research has shed new light in par­tic­u­lar on the ben­e­fits of both men­tal and phys­i­cal activ­i­ty . ” -
“ That ’s why a pre­sen­ta­tion last month at the Geron­to­log­i­cal Soci­ety of Amer­i­ca seemed so intrigu­ing .
In a study of 524 healthy adults ages 65 and over , those who worked an hour a day for eight weeks on a com­put­er - based learn­ing pro­gram called Brain Fit­ness 2.0 from Posit Sci­ence showed improve­ments in a vari­ety of unre­lat­ed mem­o­ry tasks .
“ The gains were equiv­a­lent to turn­ing back the clock 10 years , ” says lead inves­ti­ga­tor Eliz­a­beth Zelin­s­ki of the Uni­ver­si­ty of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia . ”
Com­ment : we report­ed on the GSA study , have already inter­viewed lead inves­ti­ga­tor Eliz­a­beth Zelin­s­ki , and will be pub­lish­ing it over the next few days so stay tuned .
Good news is the well - tar­get­ed cog­ni­tive exer­cise can help build abil­i­ties , offer­ing a com­ple­ment to oth­er good lifestyle habits such as phys­i­cal exer­cise .
3 ) Men­tal Reserves Keep Brains Agile ( New York Times ) .
Thanks
Tom for the heads up !
- “ Cog­ni­tive reserve , in this the­o­ry , refers to the brain ’s abil­i­ty to devel­op and main­tain extra neu­rons and con­nec­tions between them via axons and den­drites .
Lat­er in life , these con­nec­tions may help com­pen­sate for the rise in demen­tia - relat­ed brain pathol­o­gy that accom­pa­nies nor­mal aging . ” - “ Observ­ing this , Dr. Stern , a neu­ropsy­chol­o­gist , and oth­ers set out to deter­mine how peo­ple can devel­op cog­ni­tive reserve .
They have learned thus far that there is no “ quick fix ” for the aging brain , and lit­tle evi­dence that any one sup­ple­ment or pro­gram or piece of equip­ment can pro­tect or enhance brain func­tion adver­tise­ments for prod­ucts like gink­go bilo­ba to the con­trary . ” - “ Nonethe­less , well - designed stud­ies sug­gest sev­er­al ways to improve the brain ’s via­bil­i­ty .
Though best to start ear­ly to build up cog­ni­tive reserve , there is evi­dence that this account can be replen­ished even late in life . ” -
“ If you ’re doing the same thing over and over again , with­out intro­duc­ing new men­tal chal­lenges , it wo n’t be ben­e­fi­cial , she said in an inter­view .
Thus , as with mus­cles , it ’s “ use it or lose it . ”
The brain requires con­tin­ued stress­es to main­tain or enhance its strength . ”
Com­ment : you can read our in - depth inter­view with Dr. Yaakov
Stern here on how to build our cog­ni­tive reserves .
And this arti­cle that sum­ma­rizes much of the recent research on Ten Impor­tant Truths About Aging .
4 ) I.Q. wars ( The New York­er ) , a superb arti­cle by Mal­colm Glad­well
- “ … if I.Q. varies with habits of mind , which can be adopt­ed or dis­card­ed in a gen­er­a­tion , what , exact­ly , is all the fuss about ? ” -
“ The mind is much more like a mus­cle than we ’ve ever real­ized , Fly­nn said .
“ It needs to get cog­ni­tive exer­cise .
It ’s not some piece of clay on which you put an indeli­ble mark .
The les­son to be drawn from black and white dif­fer­ences was the same as the les­son from the Nether­lands years ago : I.Q. mea­sures not just the qual­i­ty of a per­son­ ’s mind but the qual­i­ty of the world that per­son lives in . ” - “ If I.Q. is innate , it should­ n’t make a dif­fer­ence whether it ’s a mixed - race child ’s moth­er or father who is black .
But it does : chil­dren with a white moth­er and a black father have an eight - point I.Q. advan­tage over those with a black moth­er and a white father . ”
Com­ment :
As we wrote here , genes pre­dis­pose us , but it is the com­bi­na­tion of our envi­ron­ments and our actions that we bet­ter focus on .
This last arti­cle sets the stage very well for why intel­li­gence is not a pure­ly genet­ic attribute , and the pre­vi­ous three arti­cles offer very use­ful sug­ges­tions for becom­ing “ smarter ” and main­tain our men­tal abil­i­ties over time .
What would you add ?
But in his dissent , portions of which he read from the bench , Justice Stephen G. Breyer said there was no compelling reason to overturn a century ’s worth of Supreme Court decisions that had affirmed the prohibition on resale maintenance agreements .
“ The only safe predictions to make about today ’s decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower courts seek to develop workable principles , ” he wrote .
“ I do not believe that the majority has shown new or changed conditions sufficient to warrant overruling a decision of such long standing . ”
During the period from 1937 to 1975 when Congress allowed the states to adopt laws that permitted retail price fixing , economists estimated that such agreements covered about 10 percent of consumer good purchases .
In today ’s dollars , Justice Breyer estimated that the agreements translate to a higher annual average bill for a family of four of roughly $ 750 to $ 1,000 .
The dissent was signed by Justices John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
The case involved an appeal of a judgment of $ 1.2 million against Leegin Creative Leather Products Inc. after it cut off Kay ’s Kloset , a suburban Dallas shop , for refusing to honor Leegin ’s no -discount policy .
The judgment was automatically tripled under antitrust law .
Leegin ’s marketing strategy for finding a niche in the highly competitive world of small leather goods was to sell its “ Brighton ” line of fashion accessories through small boutiques that could offer personalized service .
Retailers were required to accept a no-discounting policy .
After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , in New Orleans , upheld the judgment and said it was bound by Supreme Court precedent , Leegin took the case to the Supreme Court .
Unless it is settled , the case , Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSK Inc. , will now be sent down to a lower court to apply the new standard .
The Supreme Court adopted the flat ban on resale price agreements between manufacturers and retailers in 1911 , when it founded that the Dr. Miles Medical Company had violated the Sherman act .
The company had sought to sell medicine only to distributors who agreed to resell them at set prices .
The court said such agreements benefit only the distributors , not consumers , and set a rule making such agreements unlawful .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - The United States and Russia failed to settle their differences on U.S. plans to place a missile defense shield in Europe on Friday , and Washington rejected a request from Moscow to freeze the project .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ( C ) , Defense Secretary Robert Gates ( L ) and Russia 's President Vladimir Putin meet in the presidential residence in Novo - Ogaryovo outside Moscow October 12 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Pool
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , after talks in Moscow , also clashed publicly on how to tackle Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
Lavrov called Washington ’s tough stance unhelpful .
The talks took place against a backdrop of growing friction between the West and an increasingly assertive Russia seeking to restore its military might that has echoes of the Cold War .
Rice and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates brought new proposals they said were intended to soothe concerns the missile shield threatened Russian security .
The suggestions included the idea that Russia and America could have liaison officers stationed at each other ’s missile defense facilities as part of a broader joint effort to protect against missile attacks , U.S. officials said .
But Lavrov , speaking at a news conference with Rice , Gates and Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov after five hours of talks , said those proposals needed more study and Washington should halt work on the shield in the meantime .
“ We believe that to make the joint work of Russian and U.S. experts most effective , plans on deploying ... ( the missile defense system in Europe ) should be frozen , ” Lavrov said .
Rice said talks with Poland and the Czech Republic on sitting elements of the shield -- a radar station and interceptor missiles -- on their soil would continue .
“ We will work during this time to address Russian concerns ...
We believe that we can address those concerns and we are prepared to do it , ” she said .
Earlier , in remarks to Rice and Gates before the media at his dacha outside Moscow , President Vladimir Putin also urged Washington not to move ahead with its missile shield plans .
Putin kept Gates and Rice waiting for more than half an hour at the dacha before greeting them .
Russian officials said Putin had to take an emergency phone call , according to U.S. officials , who said the meeting was constructive .
“ What you saw playing to the cameras was not indicative of the way the rest of the meeting went , ” Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said .

TREATY WARNING
Putin also said Russia might pull out of the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces ( INF )
Treaty unless it was expanded to include limits on other countries ’ armaments .
The treaty was signed at the end of the Cold War to scrap U.S. and Russian nuclear missiles which , although they did not have the range to cross the Atlantic , could be used for nuclear strikes within Europe .
Pulling out of the treaty would theoretically restore to Russia the capability to strike European targets .
Defense analysts say Russia is reviewing the treaty because it feels threatened by growing arsenals in states such as Iran , India and Pakistan , and wants the missiles to counter that .
Simon Saradzhyan , an independent security analyst in Moscow , said Russia could also use the threat of quitting the treaty as a bargaining chip in its broader jockeying with the United States over security issues .
Putin will travel next week to Tehran , where he is expected to meet Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , suspected by Western powers of trying to develop a nuclear bomb .
Putin says he sees no evidence of a bomb - making program .
Lavrov said the U.S. policy of unilateral sanctions and not ruling out military action was not helping persuade Iran to be open about its nuclear plans .
“ Such unilateral actions contradict our collective efforts and make them less effective , ” he said .
Rice said Washington would continue to impose financial sanctions on Iran that went further than United Nations measures , and would encourage others to follow its lead .
“ The United States does not intend to allow Iran to use the international financial system to pursue ill - gotten gains from proliferation and or terrorism .
Therefore , under American law when we find that Iranian entities or individuals are engaging in such activities , we will sanction them , ” she said .
The Russia and American foreign and defense ministers said they would meet again in six months and aim to reach a joint view of their strategic challenges by that time .
U.S. officials said that may have been the most important achievement .
“ I do n’t think we expected the Russians to agree to these proposals today , ” said one .
“ I think we did make progress . ”
Via Daily Kos :
Huckabee 's opinion on gay marriage is out there , but we should also be publicizing Huckabee 's opinions on heterosexual marriage .
Specifically , what he believes about a women 's role in a marriage .
In August of 1998 , Huckabee was one of 131 signatories to a full page USA Today Ad which declared : " I affirm the statement on the family issued by the 1998 Southern Baptist Convention . "
What was in the family statement from the SBC ?
" A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ . "
Read on ...
The Huckster is trying his best to hide his full gospel , but somehow I doubt this factoid will attract more women to his campaign .
If you needed further proof that this religious extremist will set our country back even further than President Bush has , look no further .
Of course , what do we expect from a man who lobbied to have a convicted serial rapist paroled for political gain .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) BeliefNet has rated Huckabee a perfect 10 on the theocrat scale , but that 's still not enough to win over Family Research Council 's Tony Perkins .
Japan To Consider Fighting For Allies Under Attack
Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe is leaning toward allowing Japan to exercise the right to collective self - defence in four cases - an attack against an ally , such as the US ; when a warship sailing along with a Japanese vessel comes under attack ; when a military unit in a multinational forces are attacked ; in some situations when Japan is working as part of a UN peacekeeping operation .

Tokyo ( AFP ) April 10 , 2007
Japan will consider allowing its military to shoot down a ballistic missile fired at the United States , a report said Saturday , as an exemption from its pacifist constitution .
The constitution , imposed by the United States after its defeat of Japan in World War II , bans the use of force in settling international disputes .
While maintaining that Japan has the right to strict self - defence , successive governments have ruled out as unconstitutional so - called " collective self - defence " in which the country fight for allies under attack .
But Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe is leaning toward allowing Japan to exercise the right to collective self - defence in four cases , Kyodo News reported citing a government source .
These include the use of Japan 's missile defence system against a ballistic missile attack on an allied country , such as the US , Kyodo said .
Abe 's government , reputed for its drive to make Japan a more " assertive " nation proud of its history , is due to set up a panel of experts later this month to define exceptional cases in which Japan can fight for an ally under attack .
The other exceptional cases to be considered would be a counterattack when a warship sailing along with a Japanese vessel comes under attack , or when a military unit in a multinational forces are attacked , and in some situations when Japan is working as part of a UN peacekeeping operation .

present india
it is a blog created ... to share my views with my friends .. about the present india and how much it has changed ... and how much it should change .. for a better india .. and how much it should change to regain its past glory ....
Here , in capsule form , is what the Democrats should about Iran :
It would be unconstitutional for the president to initiate hostilities with Iran without congressional approval .
It would also be folly for us Americans to leave such a decision to a group that has blundered so badly in making such decisions in the past .
Here is a further explication of this two - fold position , with its constitutional and its pragmatic arguments .
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT
First , there 's the constitutional argument .
The Constitution clearly gives Congress the power to declare war .
The United States does not use such declarations any more , it seems , at least not since immediately after Pearl Harbor .
But the meaning of the provision is clear : the decision to initiate armed hostilities with another nation is for the Congress to make .
There 's plenty of documentary evidence regarding the intent of the Framers : they did NOT want the president to make such decisions unilaterally .
The powers of the commander - in - chief may extend to dealing militarily with urgent matters , where the national interest requires immediate action and cannot await congressional deliberation and approval .
But the present issue with Iran is no such matter .
The question whether to go to war to prevent some country from developing nuclear weapons is a long - term , fully premeditated decision .
And the Constitution gives the power to make that decision to the Congress .
As a political strategy , the essence of this constitutional argument is this : make the issue one of presidential over - reaching , not one of national security . "
This approach avoids the necessity for the Democrats to say anything about national security that the Bushite propagandists can use in their usual way : support the president or you 'll die .
And the Bushites are so adamant about the president as dictator -- apparently so constitutionally ( as it were ) incapable of acknowledging the legitimate rights and powers of the other branches of government -- that there 's a good possibility that the entire battle with the regime can be fought on these constitutional grounds .
Not only does focusing on the constitutional issue have the great advantage of avoiding those national security grounds that apparently are so frightening for the Democrats to confront the Bushites on , it also provides grounds that are both advantageous to the Democrats and vital for the country .
In other words , the Bushite beating of the drums of war against Iran provides an important opportunity to dramatize the larger issue -- I would say the largest issue facing America -- of the president 's lawlessness , and of the vital importance of re-establishing such vital American principles as the system of checks and balances , the three co-equal branches of government , and the rule of law .
And if the Republicans refuse to support a resolution along these lines , affirming Congress 's constitutional authority of declaring war , this provides yet another opportunity .
Such a refusal would enable the Democrats to raise to prominence yet another issue :
Did not you Republicans take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution ?
How can you justify putting your loyalty to your partisan president ahead of your sworn oath to defend the Constitution ?
In other words , Republican support for Bush 's usurpations on this issue can be an opening through which the Republicans can be hammered for the larger pattern of their being accessories to the Bushite assault on the Constitution they swore upon the Bible that they would defend .
THE PRACTICAL ARGUMENT
And then thereâ€™s the practical question : would you want to buy another war from the people who manufactured the debacle in which we 're now mired in Iraq ?
If the possibility of war must be faced , why would we want for it to be made by those who , in Iraq , made so many serious misjudgments ?
If war with Iran ever were to occur , would we Americans not be foolish to have it commanded by a group that demonstrated such incompetence in managing their adventure in Iraq ?
Indeed , if we are ever to have to weigh the matter of war and peace with Iran in congressional deliberation , would it not be advantageous to await our having another administration in power , given that the present one dealt so dishonestly and deceptively with both Congress and the American people in manipulating this country into their war of choice in Iraq ?
In other words , just as the war - against - Iran issue provides an opportunity to talk about presidential usurpations , so does it present an opportunity to dramatize the real truth about Iraq : the lies , the blunders , and the huge disaster it has been .
There is no serious analyst Iâ€™ve seen who would disagree with the idea that this Iraq venture has grievously injured American interestsâ€ ” much cost of many kinds , little benefit .
The Iraq debacle has been rightly called the worst international policy disaster in American history , in many ways worse than Viet Nam .
A LARGER TEMPLATE
These thoughts are geared toward the specific problem of Bushite saber - rattling on Iran .
But there is a larger , more general truth to be gained here : with a creative political and rhetorical strategy , each battlefield between the Democrats and the Bushites can be turned into an opportunity to further dramatize the basic dark truths about this regime .

Paramount has become the newest movie studio to make efforts to compete with pirates by offering low - cost , legitimate DVDs in China .
New movie titles will go on sale some two months after their theater debut in the US , and for only $ 3 .
Paramount will also be joining forces with an unlikely partner in order to combat piracy : competitor Warner Bros. , which already has outlets set up in China to sell DVDs .
Time Warner ( parent company to Warner Bros. ) was the first to try to undercut Chinese movie pirates by selling cheap DVDs in mid-2006 .
It formed Warner China as a partnership between Warner Bros. , China Film Group , and Hengdian Group to sell movies just days after theatrical release for rock - bottom prices : just 10 to 12 yuan ( between $ 1.30 and $ 1.60 ) .
Warner was followed by Fox a few months later , which planned to mirror that strategy but at a higher price — about 20 to 25 yuan , which translates to about $ 3 .
The problem with $ 3 is that it 's more than double the typical price for illicit street copies of the same movies .
But Warner Bros. and Paramount , like Fox , hope that the premium wo n't deter customers from buying if they know it 's a real , legal version .
As Fox 's international home - entertainment manager Keith Feldman said last November , " It comes down to our ability as marketers to convince the Chinese consumer it 's worth spending the money . "
Both Warner Bros. and Paramount say that this will be the earliest release date and lowest price that their movies have ever been sold for , worldwide .
And their reason for teaming up with one another is strategic : they are competing against piracy in China , not each other .
The more legit movies that are available in one spot , the more attractive the outlets will become to prospective buyers .
" We 're committed to developing a legitimate market in China , and having two more Hollywood studios gives us more critical mass , " Warner Bros. managing director of China distribution , Tony Vaughan , said in a news conference , according to the Associated Press .
Whatever the price , the studios have come to realize that without affordable offerings in China , they wo n't make any sales , period .
Even just selling a few thousand movies at $ 3 per disc will be better than nothing .
Plus , it helps the studios bolster movie sales numbers , which will be equally important to them while DVD sales in the West continue to go flat .

These are the 10 games so infuriating , their very mention makes the hairs stand up on the back of our necks .
In the old days , you did n't come back to a game again and again for anything as fancy as online multiplayer or user - created content .
No , you came back because the games were freaking impossible .
That was the only way game designers of the Nintendo Entertainment System and SNES days could extend the play time : through mindless , frustrating repetition .
10 Mike Tyson's Punch - Out
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The premise :
A ludicrously undersized boxer makes his way through a swarm of opponents who use the unwise strategy of fighting with a distinctly repeating pattern .
All of this is done for the chance to lose horribly to Mike Tyson .
Why it was worth playing :
The first - person boxing was unique in 1987 ( actually , how often have you seen it since ? ) , unless you count the arcade version of the same game .
It was genuinely fun trying to crack the various exotic underlings that stood between you and the champ .
And , after a tough day , there was something deeply satisfying about mercilessly pounding upon hapless Glass Joe , who always seemed to be in the ring against his will .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Look at him , it 's like he thinks there 's a guy out in the audience with a rifle on him .
Also , in an era when other sports games were occupied by generic placeholders ( not even team logos were represented ) , Tyson 's celebrity endorsement was pretty cool .
Seeing that crazy bastard step into the ring as the final boss really meant something .
Why it was infuriating :
While the early opponents were sometimes challenging , you could still find their weakness ( hmmm ... that inconspicuous ' X ' on his stomach , perhaps ) , and after that it was just a matter of timing your punches .
But , when you finally made it to Tyson ( or " Mr. Dream " if you bought the game after Tyson 's title defeat to Buster Douglas ) , no amount of Rocky - inspired runs through the city were going to save you .
Mac 's punches have about as much effect on the champ as a stiff breeze , which does n't stack up well against his ability to send your teeth flying with little more than a mean thought .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Basically you had to withstand a series of withering blows from Tyson , dodging each with perfect precision ( if any of his punches landed , you were done ) while waiting for a window of opportunity about a quarter - second long to strike back .
Saddest moment :
Watching Mac crash to the mat following a thunderous right hook by Tyson and knowing that it was time for him to " fuck you ' til you love it . "
Then , realizing that to get back there you have to box every fucking one of those guys again .
No saves in this game , boys and girls .

Frankly , the world was n’t 100 percent ready for Windows Vista .
Microsoft Corporate Vice President Mike Sievert , quoted by C|Net
Why no , we were n’t ready .
We were “ ready ” for a rock - solid , innovative operating system with 50 % or more managed code , the transactional WinFS file system , and other compelling features .
And we were ready for it sometime around when you told us to expect it , not two years later .
What were we thinking ?
The lukewarm , apathetic response to the Vista you actually shipped is clearly our fault .
We were not ready .
Thanks for reminding us .
Some of us who examine and discuss environmental matters are constantly puzzled and frustrated by the seeming inability of elected officials , environmental organizations , and environmental and political writers to “ get ” the nature of our ecological plight .
Could it be they ’re simply unaware of the ecological principles which enable one to understand it ?
This is a guest post by John Feeney , Ph.D. Trained as a psychologist , John is today an environmental writer and activist in Boulder , Colorado .
He began investigating environmental issues while fighting destructive residential development in a small Iowa town where he and his family lived for two years .
His research pointed inevitably to the interacting roles played by population growth , the drive for economic growth , and our reliance on fossil energy in fueling the ecological crisis we now face .
His website is called Growth Is Madness .
Since some undoubtedly are getting it , and in light of the warnings in the UN ’s latest report on the state of the global environment , below is a brief list of axioms and observations from population ecology with which everyone should be familiar .
Most are taught in introductory level ecology and environmental science classes .
They appear sequentially , so the reader can step logically through a progression which should make clear the nub of the global ecological challenge before us ...
A finite earth can support only a limited number of humans .
There is therefore a global “ carrying capacity ” for humans .
A basic definition of carrying capacity is “ The maximum number of people , or individuals of a particular species , that a given part of the environment can maintain indefinitely . ”
It is an axiom of ecological science that a population which has grown larger than the carrying capacity of its environment ( e.g. , the global ecosystem ) degrades its environment .
It uses resources faster than they are regenerated by that environment , and produces waste faster than the environment can absorb it without being degraded .
Some definitions of carrying capacity include this element of environmental degradation .
Such a population is said to be in “ overshoot . ”
Al Bartlett sometimes writes , “ A SELF - EVIDENT TRUTH :
If any fraction of the observed global warming can be attributed to the activities of humans , then this constitutes positive proof that the human population , living as we do , has exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth . ”
The same can be said of much of the rest of the extensive and growing human - caused ecological degradation we see today , including the breakdown of the web of life indicated by the ongoing Sixth Extinction .
It is symptomatic of having exceeded the earth ’s capacity to sustain our current numbers for the long term .
It is , in fact , proof that under current conditions we have done so . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
It ’s axiomatic , as well , that a population can only temporarily overshoot carrying capacity .
It will subsequently decline in number , to return to a level at or below carrying capacity .
That is , though a population may grow in size until it is too large for existing resources to sustain it , it must subsequently decline .
Because it degrades it ’s environment , a population in overshoot erodes existing carrying capacity so that fewer members of that species will be supported by that habitat in the future .
Our extraction of nonrenewable resources such as oil and coal has allowed us temporarily to exceed the earth ’s carrying capacity for our species .
As these supplies are drawn down , our numbers continue to increase , and ecological degradation progresses , the number of humans will , of necessity , come down .
Whether we have a hand in voluntarily and humanely bringing them down , or simply let nature manage the whole thing for us , is up to us .
It seems unlikely anyone could fully comprehend the six steps above , and still deny we face a grave , worldwide ecological crisis .
But for some , self gain or political ideology tied closely to self - image might be enough to fuel such denial .
For others , I hope this little essay is informative .
For an in - depth analysis of the same and related issues try William Catton ’s Overshoot .
_______
[ 1 ] Obviously , not all environmental degradation is proof of overshoot .
An individual example of ecological damage may have nothing to do with a species having exceeded carrying capacity .
Those examples , however , which reflect our society - wide ways of living , such as CO2 emissions , overfishing , and habitat destruction , do offer such proof .
[ 2 ]
For humans , carrying capacity varies somewhat as a function of how we live .
Yet no matter how we live , we cannot eliminate carrying capacity constraints .
It seems unlikely , for instance , that even a hypothetical complete switch to renewable energy , as essential as it ultimately is , would , in itself , drop humanity back to within the limits of carrying capacity .
In a time when groundwater depletion , habitat destruction , and the depletion of other non-energy resources constitute a large portion of our ecological challenge , we would likely remain in overshoot due to our sheer numbers .

An amateur cryptographer from Germany has beaten Colossus , the world ’s first programmable digital computer , in a code - breaking challenge .
The original machine was developed at Bletchley Park to crack encrypted German messages during World War II .
After years of painstaking restoration work a recreation of machine returned to action on Thursday to mark the launch of the first part of the fledgling National Museum of Computing .
A recreation of the venerable machine was put up against PCs in a code - breaking challenge on Thursday .
The match is not as unequal as it may first seem as Colossus was a single function device whose speed at breaking codes rivals that of modern PCs , at least in theory .
The rebuilt Colossus Mark II is being put to work deciphering a teleprinter message transmitted by radio from Paderborn in Germany , after it was first encrypted by one of the original Lorenz cipher machines used by the German High Command during the war .
Other amateur code breakers were also invited to join the challenge to intercept the transmission and to try to beat Colossus in cracking the 1938 Lorenz SZ42 encrypted message .
As previously reported , interference hampered the efforts of code - breakers at Bletchley Park to intercept the message on Thursday .
They deliberately used wartime radio equipment to intercept the messages in an effort to make the exercises as authentic as possible .
Bletchley Park was unable to get a good copy of the signal until 4.30 pm on Thursday , about two hours after an amateur cryptographer in Germany had intercepted and decoded the most heavily encrypted of three messages that featured in the challenge .
A spokesman for the National Museum of Computing confirmed early reports on German website Heise that Joachim Schüth of Bonn had won the challenge .
Schüth wrote specialist software in the tricky language of Ada after learning of the challenge in September , allowing him to uncrack the message in the most difficult of the three challenges in less than two hours on Thursday afternoon .
" He 's succeeded in beating Colossus after cracking the hardest challenge .
We are delighted for him , he did a fantastic job , " the spokesman said .
Over at Bletchley Park the team is not expecting a result until Friday lunchtime after loading tape representing the encoded message onto Colossus for deciphering this morning at 9.05 am .
The message itself is about the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Germany , which assisted the National Museum of Computing in running the challenge .
The code - breaking challenge marks the completion of the successful rebuild of Colossus and the start of a major fundraising drive for the fledgling National Museum of Computing .
It 's the first time Colossus has been used since then Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the destruction of the top - secret machine following the end of World War II .
The recreated Colossus is on public display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park , Buckinghamshire , following a 14 - year rebuilding project led by Tony Sale , a founder of the emerging museum .
The trustees of the museum hope to raise £ 6 m in investments in order to fully establish and run the facility .
Donations to this worthy cause can be made online at the Museum 's website here . ®
Updated
The team at Bletchley Park correctly deciphered the message at 1.15 pm on Friday , after a run-time of three hours and 35 minutes ( excluding 45 minutes for an injured valve ) .
The code - challenge marks the first time the rebuilt Colossus was run since a test run on a real German wartime messages , after it was first put together , 18 months ago .
Splendid work , chaps .

At the elite colleges - dim white kids AUTUMN AND a new academic year are upon us , which means that selective colleges are engaged in the annual ritual of singing the praises of their new freshman classes .
Surf the websites of such institutions and you will find press releases boasting that they have increased their black and Hispanic enrollments , admitted bumper crops of National Merit scholars or became the destination of choice for hordes of high school valedictorians .
Many are bragging about the large share of applicants they rejected , as a way of conveying to the world just how popular and selective they are .
What they almost never say is that many of the applicants who were rejected were far more qualified than those accepted .
Moreover , contrary to popular belief , it was not the black and Hispanic beneficiaries of affirmative action , but the rich white kids with cash and connections who elbowed most of the worthier applicants aside .
Researchers with access to closely guarded college admissions data have found that , on the whole , about 15 percent of freshmen enrolled at America 's highly selective colleges are white teens who failed to meet their institutions ' minimum admissions standards .
Five years ago , two researchers working for the Educational Testing Service , Anthony Carnevale and Stephen Rose , took the academic profiles of students admitted into 146 colleges in the top two tiers of Barron 's college guide and matched them up against the institutions ' advertised requirements in terms of high school grade point average , SAT or ACT scores , letters of recommendation , and records of involvement in extracurricular activities .
White students who failed to make the grade on all counts were nearly twice as prevalent on such campuses as black and Hispanic students who received an admissions break based on their ethnicity or race .
Who are these mediocre white students getting into institutions such as Harvard , Wellesley , Notre Dame , Duke , and the University of Virginia ?
A sizable number are recruited athletes who , research has shown , will perform worse on average than other students with similar academic profiles , mainly as a result of the demands their coaches will place on them .
A larger share , however , are students who gained admission through their ties to people the institution wanted to keep happy , with alumni , donors , faculty members , administrators , and politicians topping the list .
Applicants who stood no chance of gaining admission without connections are only the most blatant beneficiaries of such admissions preferences .
Except perhaps at the very summit of the applicant pile - that lofty place occupied by young people too brilliant for anyone in their right mind to turn down - colleges routinely favor those who have connections over those who do n't .
While some applicants gain admission by legitimately beating out their peers , many others get into exclusive colleges the same way people get into trendy night clubs , by knowing the management or flashing cash at the person manning the velvet rope .
Leaders at many selective colleges say they have no choice but to instruct their admissions offices to reward those who financially support their institutions , because keeping donors happy is the only way they can keep the place afloat .
They also say that the money they take in through such admissions preferences helps them provide financial aid to students in need .
But many of the colleges granting such preferences are already well - financed , with huge endowments .
And , in many cases , little of the money they take in goes toward serving the less - advantaged .
A few years ago , The Chronicle of Higher Education looked at colleges with more than $ 500 million in their endowments and found that most served disproportionately few students from families with incomes low enough to qualify for federal Pell Grants .
A separate study of flagship state universities conducted by the Education Trust found that those universities ' enrollments of Pell Grant recipients had been shrinking , even as the number of students qualifying for such grants had gone up .
Just 40 percent of the financial aid money being distributed by public colleges is going to students with documented financial need .
Most such money is being used to offer merit - based scholarships or tuition discounts to potential recruits who can enhance a college 's reputation , or appear likely to cover the rest of their tuition tab and to donate down the road .
Given such trends , is it any wonder that young people from the wealthiest fourth of society are about 25 times as likely as those from the bottom fourth to enroll in a selective college , or that , over the past two decades , the middle class has been steadily getting squeezed out of such institutions by those with more money ?
A degree from a selective college can open many doors for a talented young person from a humble background .
But rather than promoting social mobility , our nation 's selective colleges appear to be thwarting it , by turning away applicants who have excelled given their circumstances and offering second chances to wealthy and connected young people who have squandered many of the advantages life has offered them .
When social mobility goes away , at least two dangerous things can happen .
The privileged class that produces most of our nation 's leaders can become complacent enough to foster mediocrity , and less - fortunate segments of our society can become resigned to the notion that hard work will not get them anywhere .
Given the challenges our nation faces , should n't its citizens be at least a little worried that the most selective public universities - state flagships - dominate the annual Princeton Review rankings of the nation 's best party schools , as measured largely by drug and alcohol consumption and time spent skipping class and ditching the books ?
Should Harvard , which annually turns away about 2,000 valedictorians and has an endowment of nearly $ 35 billion , be in the business of wasting its academic offerings on some students admitted on the basis of pedigree ?

Bullying has been around since the beginning of time .
However , the way that bullying is done today is different than it was 30 years ago .
Cyberbullying exists now because of the internet .
There was a survey taken by the University of Sheffield and the University of Nottingham .
There were 320 people surveyed .
The results showed that 80 percent of the subjects surveyed had been cyberbullied within the past six months .
Reading rude comments online can have a negative impact on a person ’s self - esteem .
It can also lead to depression and anxiety .
Cyberbullying can seem like it is impossible to escape .
Many people take cyberbullying off line .
They may confront the person when they see them .
Online groups are filled with groups of people who make rude comments .
Seeing thousands of people make rude comments can be even more hurtful than hearing a few rude comments in person .
Do n’t retaliate
When many people see a rude comment online , they feel compelled to retaliate .
This will only make the problem worse .
Do not Take the Comments Personally
If someone makes comments about your beliefs and views , then you should not take them personally .
The comments that another person makes is not a reflection of you .
It is a reflection of the person who is making the comments .
Stop Rereading the Comments
If you keep re-reading the comments , then you will only make yourself angrier .
This can also start an obsession .
If you are a part of a group that has people who are making rude comments , then you will need to report the comments to a moderator as soon as possible .
Understand That People Have Different Views
It is a good idea to be open to other people ’s opinions and thoughts .
It is possible for many people to be right .
A comment that may look rude at first may actually just be a different viewpoint .
Follow the 30 - Second Rule
You should wait 30 seconds before you post something on social media .
Put down the phone or computer for 30 seconds .
When you pick up the phone or computer again , you will need to ask yourself if you would like if someone wrote something like this to you .
Take a Break from Technology
You should turn off the computer and phone for the night .
There are several other things that you can do with your time .
You can spend that time taking a warm bath , meditating or cooking a meal .
Technology Does Not Have to Make You A Victim of Cyberbullying
You have to be considerate and mindful of others to make your experience a good one .
Even though bullying has always been around , it does not only happen on the playground anymore .
It happens online , but there are things that you can do about it .
It is important to raise awareness about the issue so that people can know that it is unacceptable .
It is also important for people to stick up to people who have been bullied .

Today , noon , downtown Beijing :
I like the painterly juxtaposition of the splash of red , from the ( ubiquitous ) Olympic poster at lower right , with the chemical gray - brown - ochre of what lies above .
It 's not fog .
I 'll keep taking such pictures but will stop posting them .
The point is made .
But while I 'm at it , a couple more after the jump .
These are both the same general area shown in this shot three days ago .
That is enough from me on this topic , at least for a while .
But , seriously : how is this not an all - out emergency from the Olympic committee 's point of view ?
A true film artist has left us .
Ingmar Bergman has died .
His final film was released in the States last year , a 2003 telefilm titled Saraband .
As one of the few living film masters , Bergman was a rare , consistent revelation and the world of cinema is less without him .

In the Kottke / Hourihan household , much of the past 4 weeks has been spent determining which has the most sensitive built - in accelerometer : an iPhone , a Nintendo Wiimote , or our newborn son .
The iPhone was eliminated fairly quickly … the portrait - to - landscape flip is easy to circumvent if you do it slow enough or at an odd angle .
The Wiimote might be the winner ; it registers small , slow movements with ease , as when executing a drop shot in tennis or tapping in a putt in golf .
Newborns , however , are born with something called the Moro reflex .
When infants feel themselves fall backwards , they startle and throw their arms out to the sides , as illustrated in this video .
Even fast asleep they will do this , often waking up in the process .
So while the Wiimote ’s accelerometer may be more sensitive , the psychological pressure exerted on the parent while lowering a sleeping baby slowly and smoothly enough so as not to wake them with the Moro reflex and thereby squandering 40 minutes of walking - the - baby - to - sleep time is beyond intense and so much greater than any stress one might feel serving for the match in tennis or getting that final strike in bowling .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Agricultural giant Cargill Inc said on Saturday it was recalling more than 1 million pounds of ground beef distributed in the United States because of possible E. coli contamination .

Cargill Meat Solutions said the 1.084 million pounds ( 491,700 kg ) of ground beef was produced at the Wyalusing , Pennsylvania , facility between October 8 and October 11 , and distributed to retailers across the country .
The retail chains that sold the beef include Giant , Shop Rite , Stop & Shop , Wegmans and Weis .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture returned a confirmed positive for the E. coli bacteria on a sample produced on October 8 , the privately owned company said .
USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service said the problem was discovered through follow - up investigation and sampling after a positive E. coli test at another federal establishment .
Symptoms of E. coli 0157:H7 illness , the strain associated with the recall , include potentially severe stomach cramps , diarrhea and dehydration .
Children , the elderly and people with poor immune systems are the must vulnerable .
“ No illnesses have been associated with this product , ” John Keating , president of Cargill Regional Beef , said in a statement .
“ We are working closely with the USDA to remove the product from the marketplace . ”
The recalled products have use / freeze - by dates of October 19 through Nov 3 .
Most will have the USDA establishment number of EST 9400 inside the USDA mark of inspection .
In addition , there are various weights and varieties of ground beef distributed for further processing and repackaging that will not have the same establishment number .
The recall was the second by Minneapolis - based Cargill in a month .
On October 7 the company recalled about 844,812 pounds ( 383,200 kg ) of frozen beef patties produced at a Wisconsin plant .
In September Topps Meat Company LLC recalled 21.7 million pounds of ground beef after a string of E. coli-related illnesses .
It was the fifth - largest meat or poultry recall in U.S. history .
Topps , the biggest U.S. manufacturer of frozen hamburgers , has since gone out of business .

Yet early studies also indicate some of these particles , enabled by the latest in engineering science , can cause cancer .
“ We should recognize that there will be mistakes , and there will be hazards , ” said Professor Harry Kroto , who won the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of a nanoparticle called the Buckminsterfullerene .
“ On the other had , there ’s a possibility that the value of nanotechnology will be overwhelming .
For me , it is the science of the 21st century . ”
Nanotechnology is the science of creating and working with materials about one nanometer wide , or one - billionth of a meter .
A human hair , by contrast , is about 80,000 nanometers across .
Scientists say working with these particles holds the promise of building miniature machines atom by atom , just as every living thing begins with one cell .
“ The big deal here is that we ’re domesticating atoms .
We ’re trying to make the basic building blocks of our world do our bidding , ” said Patrick Lin , director of the Nanoethics Group at California Polytechnic State University .
Some scientists are already using nanotechnology to add small particles of silver , long - known as an antibacterial , to razors , food - storage containers , and “ anti- fungal ” socks .

Others are exploiting unusual properties that appear at the nano - scale .
In the laboratory , for example , normal carbon atoms can be fixed into tube - like shapes , called nanotubes , which are 100 times stronger than steel and only one - sixth its weight .
Such tampering can bring new lighter power to a golf club .
THE HUMAN IMPACT
The problem is that these particles may be harmful to the human body , and scientists say it will be years before they fully understand their effects .
Nanoparticles are small enough to slip unnoticed through a cell membrane but large enough to carry foreign material between strands of DNA .
There are no long - term health studies on the issue , but researchers have seen brain cancer develop in fish that ingest a small number of carbon nanoparticles .
Rats that inhale carbon nanotubes have lung problems similar to those caused by asbestos .
“ There ’s no reason to think that all of these things are going to be harmful , ” said John Balbus , chief health scientist at Environmental Defense , a public policy group .
“ But we should be prudent because of their ability to get into the body and access parts of it that normal chemicals do n’t . ”
Federal funding for nanotechnology research has tripled since 2001 , but environmental groups complain that regulations have not kept pace .
“ We ’re calling on government to invest more money in health , safety , and environmental research so that we can make sure these products are safe , ” said Ian Illuminato , health and environment campaigner at Friends of the Earth .
The Food and Drug Administration announced in July that drugs , cosmetics , or other products manufactured with nanotechnology do not require special regulations or labeling because it said there was no scientific evidence they pose any major safety risks .
Some companies are taking their own steps however .
This year , materials company DuPont agreed to a system -- developed with Environmental Defense -- for evaluating whether to proceed with projects involving nanoparticles .
Terry Medley , the DuPont lead on the project , described the step as “ not only common sense but also good business . ”
“ My chance of surviving prostate cancer — and thank God I was cured of it — in the United States ?
Eighty - two percent , ” says Rudy Giuliani in a new radio ad attacking Democratic plans for universal health care .
“ My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England ?
Only 44 percent , under socialized medicine . ”
It would be a stunning comparison if it were true .
But it is n’t .
And thereby hangs a tale — one of scare tactics , of the character of a man who would be president and , I ’m sorry to say , about what ’s wrong with political news coverage .
Let ’s start with the facts : Mr. Giuliani ’s claim is wrong on multiple levels — bogus numbers wrapped in an invalid comparison embedded in a smear .
Mr. Giuliani got his numbers from a recent article in City Journal , a publication of the conservative Manhattan Institute .
The author gave no source for his numbers on five - year survival rates — the probability that someone diagnosed with prostate cancer would still be alive five years after the diagnosis .
And they ’re just wrong .

A teenage girl lies dead on the ground in a pool of her own blood .
Her once groomed hair is cast across her face like a rag doll 's , her skirt pulled up to complete her humiliation .
In another image , she is seen lying on her side , her face battered and bloodied , barely recognisable .
The concrete block used to smash in her face lies next to her .
Du'a Khalil Aswad was beaten , kicked and stoned for 30 minutes at the hands of a lynch mob before one of her attackers launched a carefully aimed fatal blow .
Scroll down for more ...
The murder was carried out in public , watched by hundreds of men cheering and yelling .
Du'a 's crime ?
To fall in love with a Sunni boy .
Her family practised the Yezidi religion .
The Sunnis and Yezidis hate each other .
When Du'a ran away with her Sunni boyfriend , a sentence of death was passed on her .
This act of medieval savagery took place last month in a town in northern Iraq , in the fledgling ' democracy ' created by Bush and Blair when they invaded the country in 2003 and ' freed ' its people .
Scroll down for more ...
The sickening scenes , which defy belief in every sense , were captured by some of the observers and participants who thought it would be proper to record these harrowing events as some sort of memento .
Perhaps they thought it would serve as a warning to other young people who dared to follow their hearts - not the strictures of a religion which will not brook dissent - and punishes adolescent impetuosity with the most brutal of public murders .
The killing was filmed on a number of mobile phones .
The images were then - all too predictably - posted on the internet .
The Mail takes no pleasure in publishing these pictures .
But we believe our readers should witness the depths of the depravity still being carried out in the 21st century in the name of ' honour ' .
Perhaps , then , something can be done to prevent it happening again .
Of course , anyone who takes even a passing interest in news is all too aware of the tragedy that has engulfed the people of Iraq : the daily bombings , murders and kidnappings .
The subjugation of its women , however , has been largely ignored .
Yet according to cultural observers , the number of so - called ' honour killings ' has increased in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
Campaigners say there is an ' epidemic ' of such killings in the wartorn country .
Autopsy reports in Baghdad often conclude with the verdict : " Killed to wash away her disgrace . "
The filming of Du'a 's death was just one more macabre element of her killing , but it has achieved something those bloodthirsty amateur filmmakers could not have predicted : it has brought such practices into the open and exposed them to the wider world .
It is , of course , too late for Du'a , a strikingly pretty young girl with long auburn hair .
The 17 - year - old must have hoped that the ' liberation ' of her country would afford her opportunities she might otherwise never have had - for her education and a life of happiness free from oppression .
She lived with her family in the town of Bashika , near Mosul .
They were neither rich nor poor .
It is believed Du'a met her Sunni boyfriend - whose name is not known - several months ago .
They had grown up in an environment where hatred against rival factions is the norm .
The Yezidis - a Gnostic sect which combines Islamic teachings with Persian religions - despise the Sunnis ; the Sunnis loathe the Yezidis .
Du'a and her boyfriend would have been all too aware that theirs was a forbidden love .
But like so many teenagers before them , right back to the illicit love of Romeo and Juliet , they could n't help themselves .
For a while , they met in secret .
It was during one such highly charged meeting that they came up with a plan to run away together .
It is not clear whether this desperate measure was a result of their having sought and been refused permission to marry , or if they decided to do it knowing that such permission would never be obtained .
" Her family would never have agreed to such a marriage , " says Diana Nammi , a leading Kurdish women 's rights campaigner .
Some Muslim groups have claimed that Du'a converted to Islam shortly before her murder .
According to other reports , her boyfriend denies this .
They ran away together to an address in Bashika .
The girl 's family alerted the police and Du'a and her boyfriend were found just a few days later .
According to Ms Nammi , who is calling for the girl 's killers to be brought to justice , Du'a was arrested and put into prison .
A few days later , the police apparently received assurances from the leader of her tribe - who Ms Nammi believes is Du'a 's uncle - that the girl would not be harmed .
What happened next is the subject of conflicting reports .
According to some , the house of the tribal leader was stormed by a mob and Du'a dragged out and killed .
Ms Nammi , however , says she has information that it was the tribal leader who betrayed his niece to the mob .
In this man 's eyes , Du'a had committed an unforgiveable crime , punishable by death .
The family 's ' honour ' had been besmirched .
The moment Du'a was placed in his house , her fate was sealed .
On April 7 , Du'a was brought out of the house in a headlock to face the lynch mob .
Hundreds of men were waiting for her - the excited atmosphere is said to have resembled a large sporting event - but no women .
On the video , Du'a 's screams can be heard as she is dragged to the ground .
In a further humiliation , her lower body has been stripped .
Instinctively , Du'a tries to cover herself ; only later was a piece of clothing thrown over her .
She is surrounded by an enormous crowd jockeying for a good view of the ritualistic killing .
About nine men take part in the attack , including , it is thought , members of the girl 's family .
To any father of a daughter , that a helpless girl should be set upon with such cowardly savagery is beyond comprehension .
One can barely imagine her terror .
It is a profoundly disturbing spectacle .
One man kicks her hard between the legs as she screams in agony .
Du'a tries to lift herself up , but someone hurls a concrete block into her face .
Another man stamps on her face .
Someone kicks her in the stomach .
Police officers stand idly by , some of them apparently enjoying the spectacle as much as anyone else .
Meanwhile , some observers film the execution on their mobile phones - the modern world intruding on a spectacle that belongs more in the Roman arena than in an apparently civilised society .
After half an hour of this savagery , Du'a is finally - mercifully , perhaps - dead .
In a final humiliation , a man tries to lift her up , but drops her again , and her bloodied body is rolled face down into a puddle of blood .
The family has had its ' honour ' restored .
According to Ms Nammi , Du'a 's parents did not want her to be stoned , though it is not clear whether they might have agreed for her to be killed in some other way .
After her murder , according to Ms Nammi , two men were arrested by Iraqi police , but she has heard they were subsequently released without charge .
Reports suggest that two of Du'a 's uncles and four other people fled the town as investigators began to search for the culprits .
It is thought these included her brother , who appeared in the video of the murder .
As for Du'a 's boyfriend - who has lost the girl he loved in the most awful circumstances imaginable - he went into hiding for a while , but it is believed that no action has been taken against him .
Du'a was buried in a simple unmarked grave .
Later , says Ms Nammi , her body was exhumed by the Kurdish authorities , who have autonomous control of the region , and sent to the Medico - legal Institute in Mosul .
There her body was examined to find out whether she had been a virgin or not , before being returned to the Sheikh Shams cemetery .
To our Western eyes , this posthumous assault on Du'a 's body is the final insult .
But according to Ms Nammi , it did at least establish that she was still a virgin and innocent of the ' crime ' of which she had been accused .
However , Ms Nammi believes the mere fact that Du'a had run off with a Sunni boy would have been enough to have her sentenced to death .
Meanwhile , the cycle of tit - for - tat murders continues in Iraq .
In this instance , in an apparent act of retaliation for Du'a 's murder , 23 Yezidi workers were attacked and killed two weeks later , apparently by members of an armed Sunni group .
The men were travelling on a bus between Mosul and Bashika when their vehicle was halted by the gunmen , who made them disembark before killing them .
Tomorrow evening , Ms Nammi , founding member of the Iranian and Kurdish Women 's Rights Organisation , will lead a group of women meeting in Shoreditch , East London , to remember Du'a Khalil Aswad and give back to her the dignity torn from her by her violent death .
The women are pledged to campaign against the entrenched beliefs which lead to such senseless deaths - and the fact that the people who commit these crimes are not regarded as murderers , but as heroes of the community .
According to Ms Nammi , there have been an estimated 10,000 cases of honour killings in the Kurdistan region in the past decade .
Under Iraqi law , the punishment for anyone found guilty of an honour killing is just six months in prison .
" Something has to be done to stop this , " says Ms Nammi , who came to Britain in 1996 .
" There is an epidemic of so - called honour killings .
It is almost routine and utterly unacceptable .
" We would greatly appreciate any contribution from the British Government in preventing these murders of women in Iraq . "
Ms Nammi has the support of Amnesty International .
" This young girl 's murder is truly abhorrent and her killers must be brought to justice , " says Kate Allen , Amnesty International UK Director .
" Unless the authorities respond vigorously to this and other reports of crimes in the name of " honour " , we must fear for the future of the women in Iraq . "
For the sake of 17 - year - old Du'a , an innocent girl who simply fell in love with the wrong man , it is all too little , too late .
We zip along at gigahertz speed , not megahertz .
We store gigabytes instead of kilobytes .
Going strictly by the numbers , we 're living in a computing paradise compared with 20 or 30 years ago , when the personal - computer revolution was just beginning .
But there are a few things from the old days that we still cherish .
1. More RAM Than You Can Handle
One early quote often attributed to Bill Gates is that 640 KB -- that 's right , kilobytes -- should be enough for any computer user .
( He vehemently denies saying it . )
We joke about it today , but in 1981 that sentiment would have made sense .
The phenomenally popular Apple II and Commodore 64 computers had 48KB and 64KB of system memory , respectively , and the IBM PC 's basic configuration had a measly 16KB .
Few people complained .
For personal computing 's first decade , none but the seriously hard - core had to push their system beyond the seemingly limitless 640KB .
These days , even 2GB is n't enough to prevent Windows from dipping into the virtual - memory well .
2. Easy , Registry - Free Tweaks
Hey , want to tweak your WordPerfect settings ?
Fire up your favorite text editor and edit the WP.INI file to your heart 's content .
Prior to Windows 95's introduction of the Registry , editing .INI files was the way to customize your experience on a PC .
Sure , some of the parameters seemed arcane , but dealing with them was better than deciphering the enigmatic HKEY_local_machine parameters infesting Windows machines over the last 12 years .
The .INI files were also easy to back up , restore , or swap , and messing one up would n't take down your entire system .
And honestly , did you ever hear of an .INI cleaner ?
I rest my case .
Kos gets some company at Newsweek
Following up on an earlier item , when Newsweek announced it was bringing on Daily Kos’ Markos Moulitsas as a contributor for the 2008 presidential campaign , the magazine vowed to add a conservative to “ balance ” out the prominent progressive netroots leader .
There ’s been quite a bit of scuttlebutt the past couple of days over who would get the gig on the right , and this afternoon , we found out .
Less than three months after leaving the Bush White House , Karl Rove is becoming a member of a community not all that popular with administration officials : the media .
Newsweek has signed the president ’s former deputy chief of staff as a commentator who will turn out several columns on the 2008 campaign through inauguration day .
The move is not likely to prove popular among liberals who believe the mainstream media have been too soft on the Bush administration .
“ We want to give readers a feel for what it ’s like to be on the inside , ” says Newsweek Editor Jon Meacham .
“ Our readers are sophisticated enough to know that what they get from Karl has to be judged in the context of who Karl is …Readers will have to decide if he ’s simply an apologist . ”
I do n’t think this is an unreasonable move on Newsweek ’s part .
I ’d like to think the magazine could find a prominent political conservative analyst who was n’t nearly brought up on criminal charges for his role in outing an undercover CIA agent during a war and then lying about it , but I realize it today ’s GOP , it ’s slim pickings .
That said , Rove ’s hire raises a few pertinent questions .
* Will Rove stop whining about how the media wo n’t give him a fair shake ?
Now he ’s part of the MSM .
* Will guys like Juan Williams , who complained that Markos is n’t a legitimate journalist , and therefore should n’t be offering analysis at Newsweek , be equally critical of the magazine for hiring Rove ?
* On a related note , what will Bill O’Reilly say ?
* Right - wing blogs have been in widespread agreement over the last few days that they should turn Newsweek down if offered the gig .
First , did they really think they were in the running ?
And second , will any of them condemn Rove ?
In the big picture , I think this is actually a good move for the online community in general .
Just last week , Rove was publicly bashing “ nutty ” bloggers , who he sees as undermining democracy .
“ People in the past who have been on the nutty fringe of political life , who were more or less voiceless , have now been given an inexpensive and easily accessible soapbox , a blog , ” Mr. Rove said … .
“ I ’m a fan of many blogs .
I visit them frequently and I learn a lot from them .
But there also blogs written by angry kooks . ”
Mr. Rove cited the results of a study that found that writers and commenters on liberal blogs such as DailyKos.com cursed far more than writers and commenters on conservative Web sites such as FreeRepublic.com .
“ My point is not that liberals swear publicly more often than conservatives .
That may be true , but that ’s not my point , ” Mr. Rove said .
“ It is that the netroots often argue from anger rather than reason , and too often , their object is personal release , not political persuasion . ”
Now , he ’s the counterweight to Daily Kos ’ founder .
It ’s interesting , in a way , to see Rove ’s career trajectory .
He was the Boy Genius , the Architect , and Bush ’s Brain , responsible for reinventing the modern presidential campaign .
Now , he ’s the counterbalance for a blogger he does n’t like .
Hmm .
Mississippi's Trent Lott , the second ranking Republican in the Senate , announced Monday that he would retire by the end of the year , saying , " It 's time to do something else . "
Mr. Lott is the sixth Senate Republican to announce his retirement this year and the first member of the leadership of either chamber to decide to leave by year 's end .
His retirement is a blow to Republicans who are working to overcome the impression that their party will remain in the minority after the 2008 elections .
The announcement surprised political observers , since it came barely a year after Lott won reelection to a six - year term .
Appearing before supporters in Pascagoula , Miss. , the senator said his 35 years in Congress – 16 in the House and 19 in the Senate – were " quite a wild ride , a very enjoyable one . "
The Senate minority whip said , " Let me make it clear .
There are no problems . "
He added , " This is not a negative thing .
There is no malice and no anger . "
In explaining the timing of the decision , Lott said that he and his wife , Tricia , recently attended a service at a Baptist Church in Jackson , Miss .
The preacher cited the verse from Ecclesiastes about there being " a time to every purpose under heaven . "
The senator said , " It seemed to be speaking to me and to us . "
Lott also said that new restrictions on lobbying that take effect Dec. 31 " did n't have a big role " in his decision .
The new regulations extend the " cooling off " period for former members of Congress from one to two years .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , the former chairman of the Republican National Committee , will appoint someone to take Lott 's place until the 2008 elections are held .
Lott 's resignation means the Republicans will be defending 23 seats in next year 's elections , as compared with only 12 for the Democrats .
Arizona Sen . Jon Kyl , chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the third - ranking member of the Republican leadership , announced he would run for the whip position Lott is vacating .
Reporters at the announcement asked Lott if he were in line to be chancellor of the University of Mississippi .
He responded that he " did n't have anything definitely lined up . "
Lott 's election last year as whip was widely seen as a major political rehabilitation .
In 2002 , he was forced out as Republican leader of the Senate in the wake of remarks he made at a birthday party for the late Sen. Strom Thurmond ( R ) of South Carolina .
His comments were interpreted as supporting Thurmond 's earlier segregationist stand .
" I took a few licks , I made some mistakes , " Lott said .
Lott , who wrote a book , " Herding Cats : A Life in Politics , " summed up his political career at Monday 's press conference saying , " I 've loved it and hope I 've made a positive difference . "
As a result , there has been an immense rise in foreign ownership of American securities of all kinds , but especially government bonds .
Foreign ownership of the U.S. federal debt passed the halfway mark in June 2004 .
About a third of corporate bonds are now in foreign hands , as is more than 13 percent of the U.S. stock market .
One analyst has half - seriously calculated that at the current rate of foreign accumulation , the last U.S. Treasury held by an American will be purchased by the People 's Bank of China on Feb. 9 , 2012 .
To those familiar with the Latin American debt crises of the 80's and 90's , there 's a case to be made that the United States is on the road to becoming a Latin American country .
While it is certainly true that our net external debt is now as large in relative terms as some Latin American debts have been in past crises , there 's a difference .
Latin American countries have generally had to borrow in the currency used by their creditors .
A decline in the borrowing country 's currency , say the peso , threatens to send its dollar - denominated debt skyrocketing in peso terms .
But the happy position of the United States is more like that of Britain in the aftermath of World War II , when a substantial part of its war debt was owed in sterling to current or former colonies .
Because Britain borrowed in its own currency , it had control over the unit of account .
As the pound slid from $ 4 to below $ 2 from the 40's to the 70's , its sterling liabilities were reduced by half in terms of the key postwar currency .
Could the dollar follow a similar downward path ?
It has happened before .
Between March 1985 and April 1988 , the dollar depreciated by more than 40 percent against the currencies of America 's trading partners .
As a fiscal strategy , dollar depreciation has much to recommend it .
At a stroke , American exports would regain their competitiveness overseas and Asian imports would become more expensive , leading to at least some contraction — though not an elimination — of the trade deficit .
Foreign creditors would take the hit , finding their dollar assets suddenly worth much less in terms of their own currencies .
So what 's the catch ?
A sudden increase in the dollar price of American imports could stoke inflation in the United States .
There is already some patchy evidence of an upturn in inflation .
Whichever measure you use , prices are certainly rising at a faster rate now than they were two years ago , as are hourly earnings .
As measured by the spread between conventional bonds and inflation - proof bonds , inflation expectations are also up slightly .
But is that really a catch ?
Not necessarily .
Because higher inflation means that the real value of your debt ends up being reduced ( in terms of the purchasing power of the amount that you owe ) — provided , that is , that your debt is not adjustable - rate or index - linked .
Alas , those are two really serious caveats .
It 's a pretty safe bet that if a dollar decline shows signs of boosting inflation , the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates .
The credibility of the new Fed chairman would be on the line .
Even a federal - funds rate above 5 percent might seem too low .
Bear in mind that the federal - funds rate ( the overnight rate at which the Fed lends to the banking system ) has been going up for two years , from its nadir of below 1 percent in June 2004 .
Now ask yourself , Who has been most affected by this monetary tightening ?
Ill - informed Fox anchors spread fears of al Qaeda link to California fires David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 24 , 2007

Print This Email This Questionable 4 - year - old FBI memo presented as new to stoke terror fears Did al Qaeda start the California wildfires ?
As more than a million people escaped the flames , Fox News anchors could n't help speculating about a terrorism link to the blazes ravaging southern California .
" I 've heard some people talk about this a little bit to me , but have you heard anybody suggest that this could be some form of terrorism , " Fox & Friends co-host Steve Doocy asked Wednesday morning .
Correspondent Adam Housley said he 's received " hundreds of comments " from readers of his Fox News blog speculating about a link to terrorism .
Investigators have determined that one 15,000 acre fire in Orange County was deliberately set , and Housley reported that authorities arrested one man who set a hillside on fire .
Causes of most other fires are still being investigated , and there has been little speculation beyond Fox News about a terror plot .
A review of Housley 's blog posts about the fire reveals that his characterization of the terror fears perhaps was inflated .
Of his 15 posts on the fires , just two included speculation from commenters about a terrorism link .
" Is anyone asking how these fires started ?
I see no comments or speculations , " observed " clyde teeter " in response to a post Tuesday .
" Could it be linked to illegal alien misadventure on the border [...]
Terrorism ? ...
If you are a journalist , then these questions need to be asked and investigated .
Your coverage is admirable but the emotional journalism about the loss of peoples homes is not helping to find the causes . "
Fox & Friends co-host Judge Andrew Napolitano tried to serve as the voice of reason .
" That 's a fear , Adam , but is there any evidence of it ? " the judge asked .
Such skepticism could not last , though .
Later Wednesday , Fox anchors returned to fanning the terror fears , digging up a four - year - old FBI memo and presenting it as new information relating to an al Qaeda link to the fires .
In June of 2003 , FBI agents in Denver detailed an al Qaeda detainee 's discussion of a plot to set forest fires around the western United States , although investigators could n't determine whether the detainee was telling the truth , and his plot did not include setting fires in California .
Such small discrepancies in dates and details proved to be no obstacles for Fox anchors , who reported that the memo was from " late June of this year " and " is just popping up this morning . "
The memo was first reported by the Arizona Republic in July 2003 , although a Fox anchor said it was reported " five days ago . "
That confusion seems to stem from an inability to read the date on an Associated Press account of the memo from the time it was first reported .
A July 11 , 2003 , AP story , still available online via USA Today , reported , " The contents of the June 25 memo from the FBI 's Denver office were reported Friday by The Arizona Republic . "
On Fox , that information became , " The June 25 memo from the FBI 's Denver offices was reported three days ago , excuse me five days ago , by the Arizona Republic . "
Further distorting the report , Fox failed to mention a key caveat from the 2003 AP story they appear to have ripped from .
" Rose Davis , a spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise , told The Associated Press that officials there took note of the warning but did n't see a need to act further on it . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on October 23 , 2007 .
Partial Transcript ( via ThinkProgress ) : # DOOCY : You re looking live at pictures from San Diego  Santiago , CA , where the wildfires continue .
We were talking earlier in todays telecast with Adam Housley and apparently police officers in a hovering helicopter saw a guy starting one of these fires .
And Allison Allison Camerota , an FBI memo from late in June of this year is popping up this morning and it is ominous .
CAMEROTA : This actually has happened for many years in the past as well .
An FBI sent out to local law - enforcement said that an al Qaeda detainee had given them some information that the next wave of terrorism could be in the form of setting wild fires .
Adam Housley said lots of people on his block were asking him about it .
Obviously this is something the FBI has looked into .
They will continue to investigate it .
CARLSON : If they have this person in custody it probably wont take long to be able to develop a link if there is one .
KILMEADE : A June 25 memo from the FBIs Denver offices reported three days ago , excuse me , five days ago , by the Arizona Republic , that is a newspaper , they have been carrying the story and they continue to expand upon it .
DOOCY : Brian , the plot they say , according to this detainee , and they dont know if the detainee is telling the truth .
The plot was to set three or four wildfires .
But they dont mention California .
They mention Colorado , Montana , Utah , and Wyoming .
We do know for a fact that a number of the fires in southern California are of a suspicious nature and they are investigating arson . #

Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com .
Lou Dobbs says Americans should become independents and not be taken for fools by Republicans and Democrats .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Pakistan 's President , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , has carried out another coup to preserve the status quo , and the result has been violence and civil unrest .
But chaos is hardly limited to Pakistan .
Some 100,000 Turkish troops are massed on Iraq 's northern border eager to attack Kurdish rebels .
Iran continues to defy the West in its pursuit of nuclear weapons , while supporting Shiite insurgents in Iraq .
More of our troops have been killed this year in Iraq than in any year since the war began , and the war has now lasted longer than World War II .
It is no coincidence that as instability and violence spreads through the Islamic world , and particularly in the Middle East , the price of crude oil is nearing $ 100 a barrel .
The United States also faces critical geopolitical and economic challenges from Russia and China , while the U.S. dollar plummets in world currency markets and our credit markets are racked by a trillion - dollar subprime - mortgage crisis and nearly 2 million home foreclosures .
And , yes , we have a president and a Congress who are held in not only disregard but also contempt by the American people .
Not only are the poll ratings of both President Bush and this Congress at or near historic lows , but the vast majority of Americans also believe our great nation is headed in the wrong direction .
As I say in my new book -- Independents Day : Awakening the American Spirit -- the arrogance of our political leaders now threatens the future of our nation , and their elitist sense of entitlement has reached such heights that our leaders are now openly dismissive of the will of the people .
Working men and women and their families are simply not being represented in Washington .
One year from now , we will have elected a new president .
As eager as I am for that reality , I can't imagine any one of the current candidates for their party 's nomination being chosen by the American people to lead this nation for the next four years .
I believe the person elected a year from now will be an Independent populist , a man or woman who understands the genius of this country lies in the hearts and minds of its people and not in the prerogatives and power of its elites .
As I travel around the country , my feeling about the lack of true candidates is validated by those I talk with :
They are not excited about the candidates seeking their party 's nomination .
The Democratic and Republican Parties have become merely opposite wings of the same bird , and it's the American people who are getting the bird as our elected officials serve their corporate masters and the special interest groups that dominate both parties .
Has anything really changed since the Democrats took office after the 2006 midterm elections ?
Has this Congress passed any real legislation aimed at helping this nation 's middle class versus corporate America and the wealthiest among us ?
Take , for example , the Senate Democrats who for some reason can't decide whether to close the hedge fund tax loophole that allows executives at private equity firms and hedge funds to pay a tax rate of only 15 percent on most of their income .
Closing the loophole would be the best way to reform the alternative minimum tax and provide relief for millions of middle - class families , but these Senate Democrats are being guided by the almighty forces of campaign contributions and lobbying dollars .
These Senate Democrats , like their Republican colleagues , are serving a few wealthy folks at the expense of our working men and women .
The presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle are fighting for campaign contributions and selling themselves to corporate America in the process , and we all know the end result of such practices .
Corporate America is funneling money into both political parties , hedging their bets in the hopes that no matter which candidate is eventually elected , all their political bases are covered .
Donating the maximum $ 2,300 contribution to two candidates whose ideologies are of direct contradiction is now commonplace .
The day will come soon when we 'll have the opportunity to choose new leaders who understand and respect our independence and right of self - determination .
We the people still possess the power to chart the course of our own destiny .
I do n't know who will win the next election , but I doubt that independent Americans will choose any one of the announced candidates now running .
More Americans than ever before are now identifying themselves as independents , and I hope millions of Americans in the day and weeks ahead will drop their party affiliation and become independents , refusing to be taken for granted by these two political parties and refusing to be taken for fools by the candidates they 're putting forward .
I believe that independent Americans will demand a far better choice than any of the candidates now seeking their party 's nomination .
I believe next November 's surprise will be the election of a man or woman of great character , vision and accomplishment , a candidate who has not yet entered the race .

E-mail to a friend
Frank Desena , 55 , of Wayne NJ was murdered Thursday night Nov 1 , during an 11 PM robbery at the just re-opened Straddle Club at 28th and 5th .
I heard about this tragedy from a friend of mine named Steve , who had played poker with Frank at the old Mayfair club in NYC .
Frank was one of the small group of Pot Limit / No Limit players , at a time when Limit Hold - Em was still the game of choice .
Steve remembers Frank as “ a decent and intelligent guy , not one to lament or chirp at the table . ”
This poker tragedy makes me wonder about whether the NYC police deparment has some sort of indirect responsibility .
Their decisions about the tolerance of poker are made on a precint - by - precinct basis , and this leads to inconsistencies in how poker laws are enforced throughout the city .
Might this in part explain why NY state poker clubs operate in a gray legal area , and have gone “ underground , ” where it is less safe and secure ?
As soon as I started thinking about this , I sent the story about Frank to Sean Webb , who is making a documentary film ( “ Underground Home Game ” ) about how the game of poker is under attack in the US , and someone who PokerMoments will be interviewing in the near future .
“ Charity is not a health care system , ” Dr. Dickinson said .
Dentists , of course , are no more obligated to serve the poor than are lawyers or accountants .
But the issue from a public health standpoint , the critics say , is that even as so many patients go untreated , business is booming for most dentists .
They are making more money while working shorter hours , on average , even as the nation ’s number of dentists , per person , has declined .
The lack of dental care is not restricted to the poor and their children , the data shows .
Experts on oral health say about 100 million Americans — including many adults who work and have incomes well above the poverty line — are without access to care .
A federal survey shows that 27 percent of adults without insurance saw a dentist in 2004 , down from 29 percent in 1996 , when dental fees were significantly lower , even after adjusting for inflation .
For adults with private insurance , the rate was virtually unchanged , at 57 percent , up from 56 percent .
Since 1990 , the number of dentists in the United States has been roughly flat , about 150,000 to 160,000 , while the population has risen about 22 percent .
In addition , more dentists are working part time .
Partly as a result , dental fees have risen much faster than inflation .
In real dollars , the cost of the average dental procedure rose 25 percent from 1996 to 2004 .
The average American adult patient now spends roughly $ 600 annually on dental care , with insurance picking up about half the tab .
Dentists ’ incomes have grown faster than that of the typical American and the incomes of medical doctors .
Formerly poor relations to physicians , American dentists in general practice made an average salary of $ 185,000 in 2004 , the most recent data available .
That figure is similar to what non-specialist doctors make , but dentists work far fewer hours .
Dental surgeons and orthodontists average more than $ 300,000 annually .
“ Dentists make more than doctors , ” said Morris M. Kleiner , a University of Minnesota economist .
“ If I had a kid going into the sciences , I ’d tell them to become a dentist . ”
But despite the allure of rising salaries , the shortage of dentists will almost certainly worsen , because the nation has fewer dental schools and fewer dentists in training than a generation ago .
After peaking at 5,750 in 1982 , the number of dental school graduates fell to 4,440 in 2003 , as several big dental schools closed their doors .
The average dentist is now 49 years old , according to the American Dental Association , and for at least the next decade retiring dentists will probably outnumber new ones .
Anni Mall demands fresh water but Little Asia doesnt appreciate the attitude .
It ’s already all a blur . 26 cities .
6 weeks .
2913 attendees .
$ 160,000 . 23 hotels , one Cambridge college , one British library , and a “ Sociëteit Het Meisjeshuis . ” ( “ Gesundheit ! ” )
Somewhere , I do n’t know where , I ’m standing exhausted outside a hotel ballroom right after the umpteenth demo , and someone is giving me some ridiculous objection .
“ Well , it ’s all good and fine what FogBugz does , but we wo n’t use it , because we need PROJECT MANAGEMENT . ”
Excuse me , SIR ?
Do you have some kind of SUDDEN AMNESIA ?
Traumatic HEAD INJURY maybe ?
Did you WATCH the demo ?
( I did n’t really say that . )
While I was trying to think of a nice way to reply , another potential customer , standing right there , says to the guy , “ Why not try it out on a little project ?
Wo n’t cost you anything . ”
A bit flips .
The guy suddenly stops shaking his head and starts nodding it .
“ Yeah , that ’s a good idea .
I ’ll do that , ” he says , smiling .
SOLD .
WTF just happened .
No matter how much I talk , I ’m just one person .
And no matter how much I try to sell people on FogBugz , it ’s all coming from me , so that can only add up to a certain amount of credibility , and it just was n’t passing the credibility threshold for Mr. Amnesia .
It would n’t matter what I said .
He was in “ I object ! ” mode , groping around for some reason not to buy FogBugz , even if he could n’t come up with anything rational .
The minute a second person — his doppelganger !
Same height !
Same grey hair !
Dressed just like him !— said something , BLING !
It was like triangulation .
Oooooh !
Now he ’s seeing it from two different angles .
It ’s 3D .
Must not be an optical illusion .
Social proof , Robert Cialdini calls it .
That gave me an idea .
I knew from the registration forms that in every city , about 30 % of the attendees were already using FogBugz .
I started asking a question at the beginning of the demo : “ How many people here use FogBugz ? ” Hands go up .
That ’s nice .
Everybody looks around .
Wow , they think .
People actually use this software .
It ’s not just some downloadable piece of shareware some guy wrote in his basement .
I started getting comments like , “ I did n’t realize so many people in Austin were already using FogBugz ! ”
The one thing you can say about the 26 public FogBugz demos that I just did is that the first one ( Vancouver ) was pretty weak , and the last one ( Copenhagen ) was much , much better , and it was pretty much continuous improvement along the way .
If you ever have to do a public demo of your software , here are some of those things that I learned .
Biggest turnouts FogBugz World Tour London Toronto Seattle Austin Boston Arlington , VA Amsterdam Vancouver Dublin Denver ( Boulder ) Cambridge , England San Francisco Mountain View , CA Dallas New York Atlanta Copenhagen San Diego Waterloo Emeryville , CA
Picking cities
It ’s a good thing we did a survey to figure out where to go , because the number of attendees in each city was nothing like we expected .
If you can only go to five cities , go to London , Toronto , Seattle , Austin , and Boston .
Notice I did n’t say San Francisco or Silicon Valley .
Those were 12 and 13 on our list , respectively .
I have no explanation for this , other than that the huge tech community in the valley has so many damn opportunities to go to tech demos that they find them boring .
Shown at right are the 20 biggest turnouts we got for the FogBugz demo .
Booking the room
If you have any control whatsoever over the place where the demo is going to take place , here are three things you absolutely have to do .
Get the nicest venue in town .
Big , shiny , sparkly , modern , glass and marble and wood everywhere .
Your prospective customers start out with no visual image to associate with your company .
The demo is the one image that ’s going to stick in their head .
It has to be nice .
We were n’t as careful about this as we should have been , and booked a couple of frightful old relics before we realized what a bad impression we were making .
Before you try hotels , look for libraries , museums , and universities : many of went into debt building beautiful , modern lecture halls and now they ’re trying to rent them out to pay for all that nice blond wood paneling and the 265 built - in powered Bose speakers .
Get a room that is exactly the right size .
You ’d much rather have a packed room with a people standing in the back and the hotel staff rushing to set up a few more rows of chairs .
This is far better than a half - empty room where the audience feels like maybe this is n’t really the hottest tech event ever to hit Kitchener , Ontario .
Most hotel rooms can be set up “ theater style ” ( just rows of chairs ) or “ classroom style ” ( chairs and desks ) .
They can fit in twice as many chairs theater style .
That gives you plenty of flexibility after you book the room to change the layout so the room feels full .
Get a room with very high ceilings .
You ’re going to be doing a demo on screen .
Everyone has to be able to see it .
Usually hotels have two kinds of rooms : smaller meeting rooms , with low ceilings , and ballrooms , with high ceilings .
In the meeting rooms , it ’s impossible to put the screen high enough for everyone to see it .
Do n’t trust the hotel on this .
We were careful to ask every hotel if the screen was going to be visible throughout the room .
They always told us it would .
They were almost always lying .
Just ask for the ceiling height of the room .
They ’re not smart enough to lie about that .
Setting the stage
Serve coffee .
Coffee contains caffeine , which makes people cheerful .
If you ’re lucky , they ’ll attribute their cheeriness to your software instead of the caffeine .
Play upbeat music while you ’re waiting for everyone to arrive .
The kind of popular , upbeat , Margaritaville music Americans love to listen to when they ’re on vacations in warm places .
Give people name tags so they introduce themselves to one another and socialize while they ’re waiting .
Crank up the music so they have to speak loudly .
Loud music and loud conversation and a crowded room adds up to the sensation that this is the hot event .
Cover the place in professionally - produced , high - quality logo stuff .
We had brochures , pens , pads , and big FogBugz banners .
Wall - to - wall kiwis .
Dress exactly one level better than your audience .
Too dressy , and you ’ll look like you think you ’re better than your customers .
Not dressy enough , and the audience will get the feeling that you do n’t really care .
With geeks , it ’s probably enough to put on a nice Banana Republic black jacket over your polo shirt or turtleneck .
Do NOT , for the LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD , wear any clothing with writing on the outside .
I know how much you love your JavaOne T - shirt , with the happy little waving tooth .
Wear that to your wedding or something , not when you ’re on stage .
Lose the sneakers , too .
Set the screen to 800 x 600 .
Make everything as big as possible .
If you ’re demoing an application that needs more than a half million pixels , go back home and redesign the app .
Notice the lights shining on the screen ?
That ’ll be a problem .
Find the guy who can turn them off .
Sometimes there ’s no switch for those particular lights .
Find the guy who will come with a ladder and unscrew them .
Lock the doors until the room is ready .
Otherwise people will start wandering in an hour and a half before the demo is due to start watching you change out of your beloved t- shirt , running around taping cables down on the floor , and putting brochures on every chair .
This makes you look like a gopher and removes some of the authority you ’re going to need to convince people to buy your software .
Bring someone with you to take care of mechanical details : passing out nametags , setting up microphones .
The more people you have with you , the more legit you ’ll look .
Blow them away
A common , but boring , way to design a demo is to start by stating the problem , and then explaining how your magical software solves that problem .
Another boring way to design a demo is with PowerPoint slides and lots of bullet points .
An incredibly boring way to design a demo is to talk about your company and how many employees you have and how many millions of kroner of revenue you make every year .
Nobody cares .
The only interesting way to design a demo is to make it a story .
You have a protagonist , and the protagonist has a problem , and they use the software , and they … almost solve the problem , but not quite , and then everybody is in suspense , while you tell them some boring stuff that does n’t fit anywhere else , but they ’re still listening raptly because they ’re waiting to hear the resolution to the suspenseful story , and then ( ah ! ) you solve the protagonists last problem , and all is well .
There is a reason people have been sitting around telling stories around campfires for the last million years or so : people like stories .
One of the stories from the FogBugz demo :
Your boss asks you when you ’re going to ship , and you look at the EBS report and discover that you only have a 6 % chance of making it on time , so you suggest ditching low priority features , and that does n’t go over very well , so you drill down to the individual developer ’s schedules and … ( pause for long lecture on EBS algorithm ) … you realize that Milton needs some help making his estimates better , and Jane needs to give some of her work to Brandon , and then you can ship on time .
Ta da !
As you go along , be sure to accidentally bump into all the nice little “ fit and finish ” features of your product .
Oh look , that column is halfway off screen .
No problem .
I ’ll just drag it over .
( “ Wha ! ” the audience gasps , “ you dragged a column in HTML ? ” )
Oh , look , this feature is supposed to be done by next Tuesday .
I ’ll type “ next tuesday ” in the due date box .
( “ OMG ! ” they squeal .
You typed “ next tuesday ” and it was replaced with “ 11/20/2007 ” ) .
Those nice little touches you put so much hard work into are not the meat of the demo , so do n’t talk about them , just act nonchalant .
What , does n’t every web app let you resize and drag columns ?
As you go through your speech , make sure you say all the important points two ways .
People tend to daydream a bit .
They may have missed your point the first time .
They might not be native speakers — maybe one of the words or expressions that you used is not in their vocabulary .
Do n’t repeat the exact same sentence twice , which is annoying and pompous .
Word it differently the second time .
If you ’re not an experienced public speaker , watch a videotape of yourself .
Have your colleagues give you brutal and honest feedback .
You may be discover that you ’re doing really annoying things while you speak : fidgeting with a pen , scratching your nose ( on the outside ! ) , whatever .
As you do demos , pay close attention to what works , and what does n’t .
Vary things a little bit every time … you might stumble on better ways of doing things .
The first FogBugz demo in Vancouver started with two ( lame ) jokes .
By the time I got to Copenhagen , I had stumbled on about ten jokes that made the whole audience laugh .
I had better answers to questions .
I even discovered better ways to do things in FogBugz .
As time goes on , if you let the demo evolve , it ’ll get better and better .
You can practice in front of a mirror or your colleagues , and indeed , you should , but that only gets you so far … there ’s nothing like a live audience to refine a demo .
( By the way , that ’s why you still find Jerry Seinfeld showing up unannounced at little hole - in - the - wall comedy clubs in New York .
He ’s testing material . )
Follow up
Ever wonder what the difference is between sales and marketing ?
The official definition is that marketing creates demand , while sales fulfils demand .
Giving demos is marketing , not sales .
You need both the pull of marketing and the push of sales to actually sell products .
It ’s like trying to clean out the inside of an alligator with a rope : one guy has to pull on the rope from the back , the other guy has to feed the rope in the front .
Following up means contacting people who came to the demo , finding out if they have questions , answering their objections , and doing a normal sales process .
It does n’t mean being pushy or slimy .
It ’s just recognizing that even the people who showed up and liked your product might go back to the office and have other things to work on , and weeks might pass and they might forget the warm fuzzy feeling they got from seeing your great thing , and they might never buy it unless you call them and ask for the sale .
I screwed up the sales part .
I did n’t really plan in advance for the dramatic increase in customer interest in FogBugz 6.0 that the world tour drummed up , so right now there are n’t enough people at Fog Creek to follow up with every lead … we ’re struggling to keep our heads above water just answering incoming questions , which have roughly tripled since 6.0 shipped .
We ’re getting thousands of people making FogBugz trials , so while I was in Malmö , Babak and Michael put $ 65,000 worth of new servers on my credit card to handle the demand .
This is what I always told myself would be “ a good problem to have , ” but it ’s a problem , nonetheless .
As a bootstrapped company we did n’t really have the luxury of hiring in advance of anticipated demand , but now that the demand has materialized , we gotta hire some more great people , stat .
If you ’re smart and get things done , please apply for a job at Fog Creek .
Eric S. Broida wants to trade up .
He has been eyeing a multimillion - dollar house near his Pacific Palisades home and thinks it might be a bargain .
Eventually , that is .
The 4,600 - square - foot house has languished on the market for six months .
The sellers have cut the asking price several times , slashing it from $ 4.6 million to $ 3.6 million .
When the price falls by an additional $ 400,000 or so , Broida will be ready to pounce .
“ There is nowhere to go but down from here , ” said Broida , a leasing broker for office space .
“ I know it in my gut . ”
Few would argue .
Southern California home prices have fallen for five straight months , according to data released this month , and are now down 12 % from their peak last spring and summer .
For most of this decade , skyrocketing home values were a frequent topic whenever people gathered along soccer sidelines or at backyard barbecues .
But the conversation has taken an about - face , noted Jeff Vendley , a Ventura mortgage broker who is trying to sell two Oxnard town houses he bought in 2004 and 2005 .
Now , he said , people are wondering , “ How low we can go ? ”
No one knows how severe the slump will be , but economists and real estate experts interviewed by The Times , and who were willing to make predictions , said prices could fall 15 % to 25 % before turning back up .
Most said values would continue falling through at least next year , and some thought the market would n’t reverse course until 2010 .
That could translate to big declines for home buyers who bought at the peak of the market , which various measures place in late 2006 or early 2007 .
For example , a home that sold for $ 800,000 in 2006 could fall to $ 600,000 over the next two years .
Some analysts , including UC Berkeley professor Kenneth Rosen , believe the severity of the downturn will vary by region .
Areas such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire will be the hardest hit , he said , because these attracted a higher percentage of new buyers with shaky credit , and many of them are now defaulting on their loans .
He believes values in these communities could fall by 15 % .
But “ in areas where there is very little new housing , where it ’s hard to build and a lot of wealthy people live , there will be little decline or maybe none at all . ”
So far , the monthly home sales figures appear to bear that out .
Last month , for example , median home values fell 15.1 % in Riverside County but only 3.8 % in Los Angeles County , according to DataQuick Information Services .
Delores A. Conway , director of USC ’s Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast , agrees with Rosen , pointing out that demand remains high in affluent , established areas such as the Westside and Newport Beach .
Because there is limited opportunity for new development in these areas , she said , properties are likely to retain their values .
But others call this wishful thinking , saying low prices eventually work their way to even the most affluent areas .
“ Every place takes the hit in the long run , ” said Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics , a consulting firm in L.A .
If prices in high - end markets do not bend while prices fall in adjacent areas , many buyers will at some point choose the cheaper neighborhood , he said .
“ If the gap between Riverside and Orange County becomes too great , a person will say , ‘ Forget it , I ’m not going to live in Orange County , ’ ” he said .
“ If prices get too high in Beverly Hills , it drives demand to Santa Monica . ”
Such movement eventually drags top - end prices down , he said .
Data gathered by Edward E. Leamer of UCLA ’s Anderson Forecast back that up .
Since 1989 , Leamer has tracked housing prices in the 20 least expensive and 20 most expensive ZIP Codes in Los Angeles County .
He found that all areas fell by about the same percentage when they hit bottom in the 1990s downturn .
Leamer and Thornberg are among the most bearish of analysts , saying the recently ended housing boom pushed prices out of sync with incomes .
Los Angeles County median home prices are about 40 % to 50 % higher than the median income justifies , Thornberg said .
He said the market would settle when prices and incomes became more closely aligned .
“ Southern California prices will fall 25 % from their peak and wo n’t find their bottom until the end of 2009 , ” Thornberg said .
Leamer also sees a drop - off at the high end of the range -- 20 % to 25 % -- and sees the downturn lasting into 2010 .
Leamer said home prices were overheated by an “ investment mentality . ”
Buyers took out loans they could not afford , expecting price gains to allow them to refinance down the road , he said , and lenders issued risky sub - prime loans to people with shaky credit , then unloaded the loans on Wall Streeters who bought them to package as mortgage - backed securities .
Now , foreclosures are rising as homeowners find they can’t keep up with excessive monthly payments , and as speculators stop making payments on properties that have lost value .
Experts believe the problem is likely to worsen as more adjustable mortgages set to higher rates next year .
“ We will get back to a normal market when people buy a home to live in it , not invest in it , ” Leamer said .
Veterans of the last Southland housing slump know that downturns can take years to hit bottom .
Between 1991 and 1997 , amid a broad economic downturn , median home values in Southern California tumbled 19 % , according to DataQuick .
Leslie Appleton - Young , chief economist for the California Assn. of Realtors , cautioned that it was tough to predict how long the current decline would continue because it differed from previous real estate downturns .
The 1990s slump , she said , was exacerbated by the national economic downturn and , in Southern California , by hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the aerospace industry .
“ In the past , the market dipped because of a recession , ” she said .
“ Now we ’re independent of a recession , there ’s still moderate growth . ”
Appleton - Young said prices probably would fall 4 % next year statewide .
( She declined to guess when the market would bottom , and did not have a separate forecast for Southern California . )
But even with a strong economy , there is no avoiding the fallout from years of shaky mortgages , said Michael T. Carney , a Cal Poly Pomona professor who studies Southern California real estate .
“ There will be at least a 15 % decline through 2009 -- that ’s a minimum .
That ’s my opinion at this point , ” he said .
Carney and other analysts said the big wild card was the economy :
If the U.S. falls into a recession , all bets are off .
So far , the housing slowdown has not derailed the economy overall .
But all agree that the weak real estate market has the potential of causing wider damage -- especially in areas where real estate development is a major economic force .
As home sales slow , it creates a snowball effect , triggering job losses at escrow companies , construction firms and other sectors and cutting sales at home improvement stores .
All that helps make Broida of Pacific Palisades believe that prices will keep falling .
“ People tell me I ’m crazy , ” Broida said , “ but that ’s what they told me in 1992 . ”

So , there I was , minding my own business , when my phone rings .
It ’s a number I do n’t recognize , so I ’d normally ignore it , but I went ahead and answered it anyway .
Next thing I know , Mario’s on the phone telling me to come into GameStop tomorrow to pick up my copy of Super Mario Galaxy .
Let me tell you , it was surreal and really hilarious .
It looks like GameStop managed to get Charles Martinet , the voice of Mario , to record a message to send out to people who pre-ordered the new game reminded them of when it comes out .
I guess he ’s been doing that for some other Mario - related releases , but still , it was pretty cool .
I ’m going to be pretty freaked out though if one of the guys from Kane and Lynch gives me a call tomorrow .
You can read a full transcript of the message I got after break .
I assure you , those misspellings are not typos ; that ’s just how it was said , especially the “ woo - hoos . ”
“ Hi , I ’m Charles Martinet , the voice of Mario , and you may know me a little better like this :
Hello , it ’s - a me , Mario .
Woo - hoo !
And I ’m - a calling you because I ’m here at the GameStop where they telling me you pre-ordered my newest and greatest game , Super Mario Galaxy !
Woo - hoo !
It ’s an amazing game , and it ’s - a going to be here tomorrow at your local GameStop .
You can come and pick it up at the GameStop store where you originally reserve you copy .
Whoopee !
I ’m - a ca n’t wait for you to see me flying around in my bumblebee outfit .
I ’m - a out in space trying to rescue the princess .
Ah , she makes my heart go bada - bing - bada - boom - bada - ba .
Oh , and you know what else ?
GameStop will let you bring in your old gameses to trade in for credit .
Yah , credit to help you buy you copy of Super Mario Galaxy , with - a me , Mario .
Oh and if you have any questions make sure you call you local GameStop store where you pre-order my game , and they going to be happy to help you out .
Okey dokey ?
Okey dokey !
Happy holidays !
And thank you very much for buying my new game , Super Mario Galaxy , at the GameStop .
Woo - hoo ! ”
CHICAGO —
Why do so many passengers get off the plane only to discover that their baggage did not make the trip with them ?
American Airlines started asking that question with greater urgency a year ago , and its search for answers led to , among other problems , dirty printer heads .
Workers at American found that printers that produce adhesive tags for bags were often dirty .
That made bar codes hard to read , leading to misdirected bags .
Regular wiping of the printer heads helped , but even with a clean printer , the bar code readers are only about 90 to 92 percent accurate , said Denise P. Wilewski , manager of airport services for American here .
FWe never hit 100 percent — 90 percent is acceptable , ” she said .
Airlines are fond of saying that they have a success rate of more than 99 percent in getting luggage to its destination along with its owner .
And every big airline has stepped up efforts to improve its operations .
Make tiny decisions Jason 18 comments Latest by Ben Saunders
The fear of making the wrong decision can be paralyzing .
It ’s often what causes people and projects to stagnate .
Everyone is afraid of making that big wrong decision .
That ’s how mediocrity creeps in .
Instead of making a few big decisions , make a bunch of tiny decisions .
Make your decisions small enough that they ’re effectively temporary .
Making a bunch of small decisions lowers your cost of change .
Being able to afford the change when you need to make a change is invaluable .
The bigger the decision the more costly that decision .
The more costly that decision the less likely you ’ll change it in the future if it ’s proven out to be the wrong decision .
When you have too much invested in any one decision you ’re unlikely to be objective about when you most need to be .
That ’s dangerous .
So try to shatter that big decision into a bunch of tiny ones .
If you make a wrong big decision today it ’s likely you ’ll be living with it for a long time .
If you make a wrong tiny decision today it ’s no big deal to make the right tiny decision tomorrow .
A shader compiler for VirtualDub
For a while now I 've been wishing that I had some nicer way to write video filters .
I 've been working on VirtualDub long enough that the actions necessary to create a new video filter , write the callbacks , write the pixel processing routines , etc. are mostly second nature .
However , it 's still a lot of work to toss out a quick video filter .
An example was a person who emailed me a while back asking for a YCbCr - to - RGB video filter , because he had the interesting situation of trying to record YPbPr component outputs connected to the RGB component inputs of a video capture card .
In the end , it took me a couple of hours to bang out a test filter that ideally should have only taken a few minutes .
It would have been nice to come up with a language to write quick filters in , even though it might be slower than straight C++ code :
Well , a couple of weeks ago I sat down and starting banging out such a system .
Presenting VDShader :
http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/vdshader-1.0.zip
http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/vdshader-1.0-src.zip
You need VirtualDub to process video with it ( I tested it with 1.6.19 and 1.7.2 ) , but if you just want to play with the editor and compiler , you can run the shader editor as follows :
rundll32 vdshader.vdf , OpenEditor
The VDShader video filter is probably the most complex video filter for VirtualDub that I 've ever written , because it consists of :
A shader compiler .
A shader bytecode interpreter .
A shader bytecode x86 JIT engine .
A text editor .
There are still a lot of things missing from the filter , particularly a lot of primitives in the language , but to give you some idea of what a shader looks like , here 's the convert - to - grayscale example shader :
sampler src ; float4 PS ( float2 uv : TEXCOORD0 ) : COLOR0 { float4 px ; return dot( tex2D ( src , uv) .rgb , float3 ( 0.30 , 0.59 , 0.11 ) ) ; }
technique { pass { PixelShader = compile ps_3_0 PS ( ) ; } }
The shader language parsed by the filter is similar to a subset of the kinds of vector processing languages processed by NVIDIA 's Cg compiler and Microsoft 's High Level Shader Language ( HLSL ) .
I chose a similar syntax because I 'm familiar with HLSL and this style of syntax is the most fluid syntax I 've seen so far for working with colors and vectors .
The idea is that if someone wants to try a really quick image processing operation , like scaling green by 80 % , it can be expressed in this filter by shader code as simple as ( pixel.g * 0.8 ) .
( Details about the internals after the click . )
I had made a previous attempt at something like this with my earlier " Filter Factory " filter , but that had several shortcomings .
The main one is that it worked in fixed point , which made it hard to use .
Second , it had non-standard syntax .
Third , it only had an interpreter , so it was slow .
Fourth , I never really documented the language .
The killer , though , was that the compiler had a ton of bugs in it , so it never really worked right .
Part of the reason the compiler was so bad was that I 'd written Filter Factory a long time ago , and had less experience in writing compilers , or even parsers / lexers .
Another reason , though , is that Filter Factory built a tree from the code and then compiled that , which meant rather complex control flow during the compilation process , and meant that I spent a lot more time whacking tree nodes instead of actually generating code .
The parser and lexer were n't very hard to write , since I 've written enough of them by now .
If you 're just starting out , you might be tempted to try lex / yacc ( flex / bison for free software ) .
They 're good to bang something out quickly , but if you 're trying to learn , I 'd recommend ditching them and writing the lexer and parser yourself .
Most programming languages with C - like syntax do n't need a full regular expression based lexer or LALR ( 1 ) table - based parser -- they can be parsed fine with a simple scanner and a hand - written parser .
I 've found that it 's a lot easier to deal with attribute passing and error handling with a hand - written recursive descent parser than to try to push everything in and out of a yacc - based state machine parser .
I 'm pretty sure that Visual C++ uses a parser of this type , and I think GCC also switched from a generated parser to a hand - written parser ( which probably explains its lowered tendency to just report " parse error " ) .
What I typically use now is a hybrid parser , with recursive descent for structures and operator - precedence for expressions .
Operator - precedence avoids having to write zillions of routines for every precedence level , like ParseAdditiveExpression ( ) and ParseMultiplicativeExpression ( ) .
( I think Avisynth 's expression parser works this way . )
I 've also evolved a fashion of error handling which does n't require exceptions , which is to have every parse routine return a bool and propagate up false return values , have the set error routine always return false , and just return the result of the error routine :
if ( ! ParseExpression ( &value ) ) return false ; ... return lexer .
SetErrorF ( " Cannot convert from type ' %s ' to type ' %s ' " , GetTypeName ( vA.mType ) , GetTypeName ( vB.mType ) ) ;
This is nice for when you 're in an environment that does n't have C++ exception support .
The compiler , this time , is structured as a bottom - up compiler , meaning that it generates shader instructions on the fly as it parses the source .
Variables get allocated registers on the spot , and operations on them immediately emit arithmetic instructions .
This is a simpler type of compiler to write , but not building an abstract syntax tree ( AST ) makes some types of high - level transformations difficult or impossible .
For instance , algebraic identities are difficult to apply to the assembly output , since complex operations like matrix multiplication are already exploded in the parser .
On the other hand , the optimizer turned out to perform better than I had expected , especially given that it only does copy propagation and dead store elimination .
Copy propagation detects when copies of values are used and replaces references to the copy with the original , so that given this set of instructions :
mov r0 , c0 add r1 , r1 , r0
... the compiler detects that r0 ( temp 0 ) is a copy of c0 ( constant 0 ) , and changes the ADD instruction to use c0 directly :
mov r0 , c0 add r1 , r1 , c0
The dead store elimination ( a form of dead code elimination ) pass then detects that r0 is never used , and deletes the MOV instruction , producing a better result :
add r1 , r1 , c0
A factor that made these optimizations easier to implement is that the bottom - up compiler naturally generates code in single static assignment ( SSA ) form .
The old Filter Factory compiler reused registers , which made it really difficult to apply such optimizations because full register life information would have been needed .
With SSA , there 's only one instruction that writes to a virtual register , meaning that you only need to check if that register is used at all and then kill the instruction that writes it if not .
It also helps that I do n't support looping or branching , although branching is the easier of the two ( it can be handled with a merge instruction , which in the case of a pixel shader would be something like cmp or cnd ) .
The RGB to YUV shader thus produces the following assembly :
def c0 , 0.5 , 0.299 , - 0.1687 , 0 def c1 , - 0.4187 , 0.587 , - 0.3313 , 0 def c2 , -0.0813 , 0.114 , 0.5 , 0 def c3 , 0.501961 , 0 , 0.501961 , 0 texld r1 , r0 , s0 mul r2.xyz , r1.x , c0 mad r3.xyz , r1.y , c1 , r2 mad r4.xyz , r1.z , c2 , r3 add r5.xyz , r4 , c3 mov r6.xyz , r5 mov r6.w , r1.w mov o0 , r6
This is n't too bad , especially considering that the unoptimized assembly is usually horrible , with as much as ~ 80 % being useless register - to - register moves , and gets really bad whenever the compiler inlines a function call .
For comparison , this is what the Microsoft HLSL compiler generates from the same source ( fxc / Tfx_2_0 rgb2yuv.fx ) :
ps_3_0 def c0 , 0.5 , -0.41870001 , -0.0812999979 , 0 def c1 , 0.298999995 , 0.587000012 , 0.114 , 0 def c2 , -0.168699995 , -0.33129999 , 0.5 , 0 def c3 , 0.501960814 , 0 , 0 , 0 dcl_texcoord v0.xy dcl_2d s0 texld r0 , v0 , s0 dp3 r1.x , r0 , c0 dp3 r1.y , r0 , c1 dp3 r1.z , r0 , c2 mov oC0.w , r0.w add oC0.xyz , r1 , c3.xyxw
The main problem I 've noticed is that my compiler is unable to deal with splitting or merging instructions as necessary to eliminate redundant mov instructions .
You might also have noticed that I have n't bothered yet to make the output of my compiler actually valid D3D assembly , since I do n't actually ever try running the shader on hardware ( there is n't a vertex shader anyway ) .
Following this , the code goes through a vector - to - scalar recompiler , which takes all of the vector instructions -- which process as many as four values in parallel -- and recompiles them to individual scalar instructions which only handle one component at a time .
The result then goes through similar copy propagation and dead store elimination routines .
This catches a lot of the redundancy that the vector compiler is unable to eliminate .
In the case of the above , this is the result :
def c0 , 0.5 def c1 , 0.299 def c2 , - 0.1687 def c3 , -0.4187 def c4 , 0.587 def c5 , -0.3313 def c6 , -0.0813 def c7 , 0.114 def c8 , 0.5 def c9 , 0.501961 def c10 , 0 def c11 , 0.501961 def c 12 , 0 def c13 , 0 def c14 , 0 def c15 , 0 texld r0 , c12 , c13 unpackr r1 , r0 unpackg r2 , r0 unpackb r3 , r0 unpacka r0 , r0 mul r4 , r1 , c0 mul r5 , r1 , c1 mul r1 , r1 , c2 mul r6 , r2 , c3 add r4 , r6 , r4 mul r6 , r2 , c4 add r5 , r6 , r5 mul r2 , r2 , c5 add r1 , r2 , r1 mul r2 , r3 , c6 add r4 , r2 , r4 mul r2 , r3 , c7 add r5 , r2 , r5 mul r3 , r3 , c8 add r1 , r3 , r1 add r4 , r4 , c9 add r5 , r5 , c10 add r1 , r1 , c11 end c0 , c0 , c0
There do tend to be a lot of useless constants in the result , since they do n't really hurt ( I have no limit , unlike real hardware ) .
One big optimization that is missing is constant folding , which would compile out useless operations on only constants , like ADD r0 , c0 , c1 .
In vector languages , it 's common to do operations like ( vec * float 3 ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 0.4 ) ) , because a vector operation is the same cost as a scalar operation and there 's no cost for the useless multiply of green by 1.0 .
When recompiling to scalar code , however , the compiler could recognize that one of the factors is 1.0 and replace the multiply with a move , which would then get dropped out by copy propagation .
Following this , the x86 JIT compiler kicks in to compile the shader to machine code .
I 'll freely admit that my JIT compiler sucks , because it does n't even try to do register caching -- if you look at the disassembly that appears , you 'll see a ton of useless loads and stores .
I wo n't even bother pasting it here because it 's too long .
However , it turns out that 's not the biggest problem .
JITting turned out to help a lot less than I 'd expected because the biggest bottleneck right now is n't the shader code itself , but the texture sampling , because right now it 's a brute force bilinear sampling routine .
Because the shader uses x87 floating point , I can't use MMX in that routine and thus it 's quite slow at the moment .
I 'm probably going to try writing an SSE2 version , but the main thing I need to do is finish the sampler support in the compiler so that you can switch the filtering mode to POINT , which would eliminate the need for the bilinear sampling entirely in many shaders .
The last bit of code that I 'd decided to write from scratch is the text editor .
Truth be told , I had n't expected or wanted to write a custom text editor for this , but I ended up doing so because I had grown tired of repeatedly having to work around shortcomings and bugs in the Microsoft Rich Edit control , such as :
You can't append text to the control using window messages without scrolling it , since you have to move the cursor to do it .
The Text Object Model ( TOM ) interfaces almost let you insert without scrolling , except that it does so anyway if the insertion position is visible and the window is scrolled to a partial line .
Oh , and it sometimes ends up with the caret displayed on the wrong line afterward .
You can get and set the scrolling position at a pixel resolution , but it always aligns the window vertically to a whole line when you set it , so you can't perfectly restore it .
You can tell the rich edit control to use either plain text or rich text , but you can't tell it to display rich text while only allowing entry of plain text .
So much for syntax highlighting .
You can't set the tab size .
You only set tab stops on existing text , but only in twips ( twentieths of an inch ) , not in monospace characters .
Oh , and you can't set the tab size after the fixed tab stops , or the tab stops for new text .
Did I mention that you can't set the tab size ???
Searching up is just broken -- I was able to get searching down to wrap with extra logic , but could n't ever get RichEdit to search up properly from the bottom with the cursor at the top .
The docs are FUBARed too , with EM_FINDTEXTEX saying that the search always happens from the current selection , but the FINDTEXTEX structure contains a " chrg " field that " specifies the range of characters to search . "
I could n't figure out how this field actually works , because it seems that sometimes the control uses it and sometimes it does n't .
After I 'd had enough of this I decided to rip RichEdit out and bang out a new text editor over the weekend .
It 's not the greatest editor in the world , particularly since it does n't support Undo / Redo right now , but at least syntax highlighting was a lot easier to implement and did n't require stupid workarounds .
It also only works on 8 - bit text right now , so it wo n't pass Michael Kaplan 's " buttload of diacritics " test , but given that this is a source code editor I did n't worry about localization .
Besides , converting it to Unicode at least would n't be too bad .
One of the toughest features to work out turned out to be caret positioning in word wrap mode -- I 'd originally written it using iterators stored as ( paragraph , char offset ) , but discovered that it led to the undesirable behavior that you could n't place the caret at the end of a wrapped line , because that was the same character position as the start of the next .
I ended up rewriting the editor to use ( paragraph , line , char offset ) instead , which turned out to work better and was actually simpler in some ways .
I 'm also proud of the fact that the editor does n't use any fixed size line buffers anywhere , so it does n't have any line length limitations , like the 2048 character limitation in Visual C++ 6.0 .
Anyway , if you run into bugs in the filter , feel free to drop me a line .
This has been somewhat of a research project , so I do n't know how much more time I 'll be putting into it , but I figure it'd at least get it to a useful enough point that simple filters could be written without the need for a real compiler .
“ There ’s no question John Edwards is different now than he was in 2004 , ” said Peter Scher , whom Mr. Kerry recruited to run Mr. Edwards ’s vice - presidential campaign .
“ There ’s a great deal more confidence in his own instincts and his own judgment .
You see much less reliance on consultants and pollsters and media advisers , and more of a willingness to say what he believes and let the chips fall where they may . ”
Image John Kerry and John Edwards , running mates but never really friends , ended 2004 in recrimination and regrets .

Kerry loyalists , meanwhile , seethe as they watch his new aggressiveness .
Stephanie Cutter , who was Mr. Kerry ’s communications director , said , “ A lot of what I ’m seeing now , I wish I ’d seen in 2004 . ”
Mr. Edwards defends his change in tone , calling it the result of “ a maturing process . ”
“ I believe that presidential candidates actually have a responsibility to point out substantive differences , to point out perspectives that are different , ” he said in an interview .
“ I ’m totally comfortable doing it . ”
Unlikely Pair
John Edwards began campaigning to be John Kerry ’s running mate as soon as his own presidential run collapsed when he failed to win any of the Super Tuesday primaries in March 2004 .
He appeared at rallies for Mr. Kerry .
He dispatched emissaries to party officials and Kerry aides , promising that he could raise $ 20 million and help win his home state , North Carolina , and others the campaign hoped to turn to blue from red .
And , as an experienced trial lawyer , he could take on Mr. Cheney .
Mr. Kerry remained hesitant .
He had not really known Mr. Edwards in the Senate , and on the primary trail , small resentments had built up .
Mr. Kerry wondered why Mr. Edwards thought he could be president before even finishing his first Senate term ; Mr. Edwards thought Mr. Kerry did not know how to talk to rural and Southern voters and could not win without them .
He bristled at Mr. Kerry ’s presumption : when Mr. Kerry said in a debate how he would take on President Bush , Mr. Edwards rebuked him , “ Not so fast , John Kerry . ”
The two men could hardly have been more different .
Mr. Kerry was the craggy Brahmin raised in privilege , Mr. Edwards , smiling , Southern and self - made .
Mr. Kerry had all the gravitas Mr. Edwards was often accused of lacking , but Mr. Edwards charmed colleagues and connected with voters in a way that Mr. Kerry could only envy .
Mr. Kerry had spent a career in the Senate , where success depends on accommodating all sides of an issue ; he called friends ceaselessly to solicit different points of view until aides seized his cellphone .
Mr. Edwards had built his career by choosing a side and not relenting ; he was well known for turning down big settlement offers because he was confident he could win his case .
The children who swallowed the beads have now recovered
A total of five children were taken to hospital after swallowing tiny beads known as Bindeez in Australia and Aqua Dots in the US .
The beads were coated in chemicals which transformed into the banned drug when swallowed .
It is the latest in a series of safety scares over products made in China .
US toy maker Mattel has recalled more than 20 million Chinese - made toys this year .
Coloured beads
The toy has proved extremely popular in both countries .
In 2007 , Bindeez was named Australia 's Toy of the Year .
The toy consists of hundreds of brightly - coloured beads that can be arranged into a piece of art and sprayed with water to set .
The beads are meant to be coated in a non-toxic glue , but a batch in Australia was found to be covered with a substance that did not match the approved formula .
In Australia , two children in New South Wales and one child in Queensland have been hospitalised in the past two weeks after swallowing the beads .
All three have now recovered , but all of the country 's states and territories have now banned the toy .
In the US , two children were affected , the Consumer Product Safety Commission warned .
They slipped into comas , but later recovered .
About 4.2 million units of the toy will be recalled in the US , officials said , and about one million in Australia .
Australian - based manufacturer Moose Enterprises said the toys were made at a factory in southern China 's Guangdong province .
The firm said Bindeez beads would in future be covered with a " foul - tasting ingredient " to try to ensure children would not eat them .
The fair trading minister in Australia 's New South Wales , Linda Burney , said an investigation was under way to determine how batches of the Chinese - made beads failed to match the approved formula .
Nov. 6 , 2007  --
The day after Ron Paul shattered fundraising records by raising $ 4.3 million in 24 hours -- $ 4 million of it online , more money online than any other Republican has ever raised -- the candidate told ABC News he was pleasantly surprised by the historic financial boost .
" To me it 's pretty remarkable and pleasantly surprising , " the Texas Republican told ABC News ' Sam Donaldson and ABC News ' Political Director David Chalian on " Politics Live " airing daily on ABC News ' 24 - hour digital network .
" Now we 'll have the money to advertise in a major sort of way in South Carolina , in Nevada , as well to beef up our organization in Iowa , " he said .
Paul 's Haul Puts Primaries in Play
With minimal help from Paul 's campaign , his supporters helped to raise the money through a Web site called ThisNovember5th.com — a reference to the day the British commemorate the thwarted bombing of the Parliament by anti-Protestant rebel Guy Fawkes .
Many fans of Paul know of the day primarily because of the movie " V for Vendetta " — in which a terrorist modeled after Fawkes battles a draconian government that has taken over Britain .
" It was a mystery and something I 'm learning about , " said Paul , who said he has n't seen the movie .
" They just used this as a way to symbolize one individual trying to stand up to the abuses of the state .
[ Of ] course the movie ended a lot better than did the history , " Paul said , careful to note that the organizers of this fundraiser and his campaign advocate changing the government peacefully .
" Everybody that 's coming together is sick and tired of big government and they do n't trust the major parties and the leadership of the major parties right now , " he said .
With more money in the bank now than several Republican rivals including Arizona Sen .
John McCain , Paul said the campaign will use the money to buy radio and television advertising in key primary states .
" Just in the last week or two we 've spent about a million and a half buying television and radio and we 're going into New Hampshire , which is a really ripe state for us because there are a lot of independents , " he said .
Reconsidering the ' Revolution '
The fundraising bombshell put Paul headlines in publications that have typically ignored the Texas congressman and libertarian Republican — also putting Paul on the radar of potential supporters and rivals .
" I have been thinking about Ron Paul .
I know that he is a Republican , but I was thinking more towards a constitutional thinker and getting more towards , back to our constitutional rights , " Tom Caoranic of Medina , Ohio , told ABC News ' Kate Snow on the campaign trail one year before the election in November .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , also campaigning for the Republican nod , stopped by the Carolina Hope Christian Adoption agency in Greenville , S.C. , today and did not exactly extend congratulations to Paul and his online army .
" Let 's see , " Romney said when asked about the fundraising haul , " he 's getting close to what I raised in our first day .
So , I 'm delighted that he 's been able to raise what he needs to raise to go forward .
It 's only two thirds as much , a little less than that than we raised in our first day . "
Romney said he received $ 6.4 million in donations and pledges the first day of his campaign , but campaign finance reports make it difficult to ascertain exactly how much of that amount actually ended up in his campaign coffers .
Reports indicate Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , raised $ 6.2 million on a single day this summer , but not all of that amount came online .
However Paul 's campaign staffers -- adamant that they shattered fundraising records -- held a news conference Tuesday to refute the Romney and Clinton numbers .
" Yesterday was the largest primary fundraising day in the history of political campaigns and it was the largest GOP online day in GOP history , " said Ron Paul fundraising director Jonathan Bydlak .
" According to the FEC , that number is inaccurate , " Bydlak said about Romney 's reported $ 6.4 million one - day haul .
Inspired Paul supporters are already plotting new fundraising plots .
" There are a lot of ideas floating around right now , " said Trevor Lyman .
" Dec. 15 is Bill of Rights Day and the 16th is the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party , so maybe it will be a weekend thing . "
Lyman , the organizer of the independent Web site that coordinated the fundraising drive , was happy with the results , even if the campaign did not raise the $ 10 million originally envisioned .
He and other Paul supporters are already looking to new symbolic dates for fundraising drives .
" In the Boston Tea Party they were protesting taxes on tea with the Boston Tea Party and so maybe we will protest the inflation tax on our money by dumping it into his campaign . "
Who 's Giving Money ?
Most of Paul 's support at campaign rallies has seemed to emanate from college campuses and online from a dedicated legion of Web - savvy followers .
But financially , his support seems to come from a broader base .
The names online contributors flash across Paul 's Web site .
One of those names , pulled at random and contacted by ABC News , is Ed Kirkpatrick , of Mulkeytown , Ill .
Kirkpatrick , 53 , was actually online at Paul 's Web site when we reached him , though he said Mulkeytown is not exactly the modern world and the best he can get is a slow dial - up connection .
He said he had intended to give Paul money for some time , but the coordination of supporters to all give money on Nov. 5 put him over the edge .
Kirkpatrick , who is on disability with back problems after a career as a quality control inspector , gave $ 100 .
" He 's a breath of fresh air , " Kirkpatrick said of Paul .
" He is representing what no other candidate represents in my opinion — back to the basics and back to what this country was founded on .
He 'll say what 's on his mind .
I do n't see anything wishy washy about him and he 'll say what he thinks instead of him telling me what I want to hear . "
To that end , Kirkpatrick , who voted for George W. Bush in 2004 but has not given money to any presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan , said he does n't agree with Paul on everything , though " disagree might be a bit of a stretch . "
As a libertarian Republican , Paul would allow the use of medical marijuana and even broke with the Republican Party back in the ' 80s over the so - called war on drugs .
" It would be interesting to see [ legalizing ] drugs works out , " Kirkpatrick said .
He also pointed to Paul 's disengagement ideas for foreign policy that could have " interesting " consequences , but Kirkpatrick thinks Paul would not be able to pull troops out of Iraq as quickly as everyone thinks .
" I know that him saying that does n't mean it would happen immediately even if he was elected .
The media try to make him sound like a bloomin ' idiot up there .
Everything would happen tomorrow .
But it takes time .
He knows that .
I know that .
Anybody who thinks about it knows it . "
Internet Politics
Political watchers say Paul 's haul points to the fact that the Internet is alive and well as a legitimate fundraising tool .
" One of the things that the campaign has been doing well is that they have n't tried in any way to co-opt all of this activity and force it onto Ron Paul 's own Web site .
They 've kind of let people do their own thing , " said Julie Germany of The Institute for Politics Democracy & the Internet at The George Washington University in Washington , D.C .
" Clinton , Obama , Edwards , McCain , Giuliani — all of the other big candidates really try to force people to take actions onto their own site and they also try to funnel all of that online activity through their own channel so that they can control it , so that they can observe what is going on , so that they can keep a handle on things , " she added .
Paul said his online fundraising prowess has boosted his credibility on the campaign trail and in Washington , though he has yet to get even one endorsement from a member of Congress .
" But , boy , I sure get a lot of friendly handshakes lately and a lot of congratulations , and so I think there 's a shift of attitude even here in the Congress , " Paul said .
" Something is really astir .
I think we 've gotten the attention not only of the American people , but the politicians here in Washington as well . "
Turing and the Halting Problem November 26 , 2007
New York , N.Y .
What is wrong with the following passage ?
Turing found that he could phrase his version of the question in terms of the problem of deciding whether or not the nth Turing machine would actually ever stop when acting on the number m .
This problem was referred to as the halting problem .
— Roger Penrose , The Emperor 's New Mind ( Oxford University Press , 1989 ) , pg. 57
The association of Turing with the " halting problem " is an anachronism .
Turing 's original conception in his 1936 paper " On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem " was of machines that compute real numbers .
Because real numbers ( in general ) have an infinite number of digits , these machines run forever .
A machine that gets into a non-printing loop , or which enters a configuration that does n't exist , will no longer compute digits of the real number and hence ( in Turing 's terms ) is " unsatisfactory . "
Even when Turing later lets his machines compute functions — in a sense , the Universal Machine performs a function , but in § 10 of his paper , Turing describes machines that explicitly implement number - theoretic functions — the machines still run forever .
The function machine calculates the function for an argument of 0 , then 1 , then 2 , and so forth , encoding the integral results as runs of 1's separated by 0's , but still running forever .
As the concept of the Turing Machine was later generalized and applied to problems of computability , it became convenient to reformulate the machine .
Instead of computing real numbers , these reformulated machines calculate a single value of a number - theoretic function and then halt .
The satisfactory and unsatisfactory machines were swapped :
In this new concept , machines that halted were " good " machines and machines that did n't halt were not .
According to Stephen Kleene , he reformulated the Turing Machine in this way in lectures he gave at the University of Wisconsin begnning in 1941 .
While fully honoring Turing 's conception of what his machines could do , I was skeptical that his was the easiest way to apply them in the computation of number - theoretic functions .
— S.C. Kleene , " Origins of Recursive Function Theory , " Annals of the History of Computing , Vol. 3 , No. 1 ( Jan. 1981 ) , pg. 61
Kleene 's reformulation first appeared in print in Chapter XIII of his book Introduction to Metamathematics ( Van Nostrand , 1952 ) .
Martin Davis believes that he first started using the term " halting problem " in connection with a similar reformulation of Turing Machines in lectures at the University of Illinois beginning in 1952 .
[ B. Jack Copeland , The Essential Turing ( Clarendon Press , 2004 ) , pg. 40 , footnote 61 ]
The term was released into the wider world in Davis 's book Computability and Unsolvability ( McGraw - Hill , 1958 ) :
Theorem 2.2 .
There exists a Turing machine whose halting problem is recursively unsolvable . [ pg. 70 ]
It would be best for people writing about the Turing Machine to exercise a little more clarity in referring to Turing 's original conception of his machines and these later formulations .
One of the hopes I have for my forthcoming book The Annotated Turing is to make Turing 's original conception better known .
We can then appreciate the richness of the history behind the Turing Machine and how it has subsequently influenced ideas about mathematics , computability , the consciousness , and cosmology .
How would you like to pick up this newspaper one day and get a free CD or an MP3 file of new music from one of your favorite musicians ?
Earlier this month England�s Mail on Sunday and Prince — two symbols of two embattled businesses — stuck their big toes into the future , a future that has looked increasingly bleak for both the record industry and the newspaper business .
In a move that sent shock waves across the British music business , the country�s leading tabloid distributed 2.9 million free copies of Prince�s new " Planet Earth " CD with its Sunday paper , reaping a publicity bonanza and a big bump in advertising as well .
But the real winner was Prince .
In an era where record sales are plummeting , Prince got his new music into the hands of millions of fans while pocketing a reported $ 500,000 payment from the paper .
Most record store owners in England have protested by refusing to carry the artist�s new CD while his record company , Sony , has suspended its release in England .
But Prince , who seems to have as much brilliance as an entrepreneur as an artist , is laughing all the way to the bank .
Like most artists his age , Prince , 49 , doesn�t top the charts anymore .
His last album , " 3121 , " sold roughly 80,000 copies in the UK .
He makes most of his money through touring — his last major tour , in 2004 , sold $ 87.4 million in tickets , dwarfing anything he could make from CD sales .
For him , giving away his record free — as he is for anyone who buys a ticket to one of his UK concerts , most of which have already sold out — is a way of creating exposure and excitement .
That transfers into concert sales , which is how most artists , outside of a few pop stars , make the vast majority of their money these days .
What older artists need today is a marketing partner , not a record company .
The Eagles have Wal - Mart , Paul McCartney has Starbucks and now Prince has the Mail on Sunday .
Amazingly , much of the media coverage of the giveaway treated the event as a PR stunt .
After all , the anti-gay , anti-immigration Mail is hardly natural Prince territory — in Harry Potter , the paper is favorite reading material for Vernon Dursley .
But the strange alliance offers a striking example of how two struggling businesses could reinvent themselves .
In fact , I have to admit that my professional assessment of the giveaway quickly gave way to a much more personal reaction .
Why couldn�t my newspaper do that ?
Newspapers , as you may have heard , are in deep doo - doo .
While the Times still is a profitable business , our revenue was down 10 % in the second quarter while our cash flow was down , as our publisher put it the other day , a " whopping 27 % , making it one of the worst quarters ever experienced . "
Times are so hard at the Times that the publisher has proposed putting ads on the front page to generate new revenue .
So far we�ve made little headway developing imaginative strategies to bring back lost readers — or compete for younger readers who get their information from the Internet .
The record business has been just as slow to provide fans online with new , convenient ways to hear music — the only visionary idea , Steve Jobs� iTunes store , came from outside the business .
Unless you are a mainstream pop artist , it�s hard to see how the old - fashioned record company model benefits your career anymore .
If you �re a respected older performer — known in industry parlance as a heritage artist — your biggest challenge is finding a way to get your music heard .
That �s where the newspaper comes in .
As the Mail on Sunday has shown , newspapers remain a formidable distribution machine .
My paper has roughly 1.1 million Sunday subscribers and generates 65 million page views each month .
If you �re a heritage artist looking for exposure with an audience that might appreciate your work and has proven by reading a newspaper that it�s curious about the outside world , what could be a better starting point than the Times ?
Here�s how it might work .
The Times would start a free - music series , offering music ( either on a CD or via downloads ) from respected artists willing to think outside the box — meaning anyone from Elvis Costello , Beck and Ryan Addams to Ry Cooder , Steve Earle and Lucinda Williams .
Instead of paying the artist a fat fee , we�d recruit advertising sponsors who�d be delighted to be associated with classy artists and the imprint of the Times .
If you haven�t noticed , music has a powerful mojo for advertisers .
TV commercials have used pop songs to sell product for years .
Lexus currently has a series of TV ads featuring Costello and John Legend seated in a Lexus , simply talking about their favorite music ( Elvis sings the praises of Beethoven ) .
But what they �re really selling is coolness by association .
The same association could apply to us via a giveaway series .
It would encourage readers to see the paper in a new light , as not just a news - gathering organization but a cultural engine .
If we surrounded the music with news , reviews and features from our staff , it could also expose new visitors to our formidable music critics and reporters .
Could this really work ?
For a reality check , I called Jim Guerinot , an industry free - thinker who manages Nine Inch Nails , Gwen Stefani and Social Distortion .
" Are you kidding — that �s a great idea , " he says .
" There are tons of these Hall - of - Fame quality heritage artists who don�t sell records anymore .
It would be a real coup for them to reach their target demo through the newspaper and have the cachet of being an artist of the week or month . "
Having the Times showcase new music would do more than attract advertising — it would help transform the image of the paper .
" It could redefine the paper by making it a destination site for music fans , " says Guerinot .
" On the net , the big challenge is always about providing a filter for people .
It would make the Times , with its critical voice , into a gatekeeper .
People are looking for someone to show them the way — why shouldn�t it be the L.A. Times ? "
Newspapers don�t just need new readers , we need new ways to serve them .
So why shouldn�t we use one of our core strengths — our entertainment coverage — as a way to transform our web site�s pop music page into a place where you wouldn�t just find us writing about music , but find the music itself ?
It not only makes the paper feel more relevant , but it would create a new income stream that might be less intrusive than putting ads on the front page .
" What you�d be doing is turning the paper into a recommendation engine , " says Fred Goldring , a leading industry attorney .
" Everywhere you look , from car ads to the NBA , music is a big part of everything that sells .
You wouldn�t just be giving away music , you�d be doing something no one else does better educating the consumer . "
I can�t guarantee that my bosses will instantly embrace this idea — they don�t often look to columnists for business acumen .
And there are plenty of naysayers .
Retail outlets could punish artists that give away music by refusing to carry their new CDs , as they did in England with Prince .
Cliff Burnstein , who manages the Red Hot Chili Peppers , believes music giveaways work better in England where " pop music is a national sport and the audience is a lot less fragmented than in the U.S. "
But Prince�s gambit won�t be a one - shot deal .
The British ska group Madness is considering a similar newspaper giveaway for its next album .
One of Burnstein�s bands , Snow Patrol , is touring Australia in September .
Since few fans bought its first album there , the group is mailing the first album free to anyone who buys concert tickets , bumping up the ticket price to pay for it , figuring the fans will enjoy the concerts more if they �re more familiar with the band�s earlier music .
Giving music away doesn�t mean it has lost its value , just that its value is no longer moored to the price of a CD .
Like it or not , the CD is dying , as is the culture of newsprint .
People want their music — and their news — in new ways .
It �s time we embraced change instead of always worrying if some brash new idea — like giving away music — would tarnish our sober minded image .
When businesses are faced with radical change , they are usually forced to ask — is it a threat or an opportunity ?
Guess which choice is the right annswer .

Commemorating Independence Day !
In celebration of The 4th of July , 2007 you are invited - even urged - to flex your independence with the Volunteer Network 's ' secret weapon ' - the Ron Paul Dollar bringing new meaning to the U.S. Mint 's " Presidential Dollars " and symbolizing the Congressman 's values .
WOW !
Now the Internet 's favorite Presidential candidate has his own money to help turbo- charge his shot at the White House .
Impossible , you think ?
Long shot ?
Dark horse ?
Think again .
This election is different .
Want to stand this Presidential election on its head ?
Well guess what ?
As utterly amazing as it may seem , we the people , could actually get Ron Paul nominated .
Why ?
Because there are so many Republican liars running for President and the field is so fractionized , that a classic dark house candidate could win .
And that is amazing !
Yes , we all know that politicians are pathological liars .
And this campaign has an unusually large number of liars .
Fortunately , Congressman Ron Paul speaks the truth .
He speaks the truth about the government , about money and about the war .
Ron Paul is dedicated to the truth and a government as defined by the US Constitution .
But Truth without action ... dies .
The great American experiment is already dying .
You can see signs of it everywhere .
The federal empire is destroying America .
And as it grows , we the people lose our purchasing power , our liberties and even our hope for a prosperous future .
Please do n't let the Truth die .
Nothing happens without you taking action .
The Liberty Dollar cannot cure our country 's monetary ills without YOU .
Congressman Ron Paul cannot be elected without YOU .
You are the most important person in this election .
So the Volunteer Network created a ' secret weapon ' - the Ron Paul Dollar .
Available in pure $ 1 Copper , $ 20 Silver , and $ 1000 Gold Ron Paul Dollars .
It was specifically designed to popularize Ron Paul 's campaign , put more real money in the people 's hands , attract more media attention and political memorabilia collectors .
" The Ron Paul Dollar is certainly different , " said Jeff Kotchounian , a collector in Michigan .
" For me , it 's a great way to popularize Ron Paul and get him elected ! "
Von NotHaus , the fiery " freemarketeer " behind the Ron Paul Dollar , observes , " It will be interesting to see if enough people are fed up with politics , Bush regime , and the war to take Congressman Paul seriously .
Certainly the Ron Paul Dollar is as unique as the Candidate and the election itself .
Do the majority of Americans really want to change Washington ?
Time will tell . "
Von NotHaus stresses urgency as the political parties have moved up the primary elections , squeezing campaigning time to only eight more months .
If people want to change things , they must make a donation to Ron 's campaign , get a Ron Paul Dollar and support him right now .
All this will be a big surprise to Dr. Paul .
As Liberty Dollar 's legal counsel pointed out , if Ron Paul 's campaign was informed before the launch date , the Federal Election Commission could require profits in excess of $ 2,300 ( the maximum individual donation allowed ) to be distributed to the Republican Party !
So the Ron Paul Dollar was created as an " independent contribution " and is distributed through the grassroots Volunteer Network .
As von NotHaus explains , " Even though I know and respect Ron Paul for his free market philosophy , I did not take his campaign seriously until our mutual friend G. Edward Griffin mentioned his support .
It got me thinking about how I could support Ron 's campaign , then Nic Leobold suggested a Ron Paul Dollar and the project took off . "

Thanks !
The Ron Paul Dollar is not only the most valuable and daring secret weapon against the big lies of big money and their big party politics .
It is an honest campaign tool that can put an honest man in the White House .... for a change .
It is time to return our country to the values that made it great .
It is time for Constitutionalism !
Please take action .

Google launched a location service for mobile users on Wednesday that does n't rely on GPS .
Google Maps with My Location , currently in beta , locates users who do n't have GPS - enabled phones based on their location to nearby cell towers .
The result is n't as accurate as GPS ( Global Positioning System ) but works for people who lack the positioning technology in their phones .
" It helps users speed up search by showing the general neighborhood they 're in , " said Steve Lee , product manager at Google for the service .
Without the location service , users must type in their address or neighborhood in order to find nearby businesses using Google Maps .
Google Maps with My Location will use GPS data to locate the user if the phone has the capability .
But even for users of GPS - enabled phones , the cell location service might be useful , Lee said .
That 's because the cell tower feature works better indoors than GPS , it does n't drain the phone battery as quickly and can bring up a result quicker , he said .
The service could be useful to a person who might be traveling in an unfamiliar city and looking for restaurants or other businesses .
A user pulls up Google Maps and hits the zero key on the phone .
A blue dot will appear on the map in the user 's location .
If the service used GPS in the phone , the blue dot will be solid .
If the service used cell towers to determine the location , the blue dot will have a halo around it , indicating that the location is n't precise .
The user can then search for nearby businesses .
Google says the cell tower technique will locate the user within about 1000 meters .
It does n't use triangulation , which calculates a user location based on the user 's distance to three nearby towers .
Instead , it essentially shows the range of the tower that the user 's phone is connecting to .
But the accuracy should improve as more people use the service , Lee said .
That 's because Google is keeping a database of location queries , minus any personal information like individual phone numbers or names .
That will allow Google to learn more precise information about the range of each tower , so that it can deliver a more accurate location area to users .
The coverage area of cell towers can vary from about a quarter of a mile to several miles based on whether the tower is in an urban or rural area .
For now , Google Maps with My Location does n't feature any advertising , but it could in the future .
" This product makes a lot of sense for advertising , " Lee said .
In order to use the service , phone owners must download a free application from Google .
The application will work on BlackBerry , Windows Mobile and Symbian phones as well as many phones that support Java .
A few notable exceptions include the Samsung Blackjack , Moto Q and Palm Treo 700W , which do n't support the APIs ( application programming interfaces )
Google requires to find cell towers , Lee said .

Did US spies let bin Laden slip through their grasp again ?
A US spy plane picked up some " tantalizing " clues last month indicating where terror leader Osama bin Laden or his deputy might be hiding , but intelligence officials were unable to move quickly enough to capture or kill the al Qaeda mastermind , NBC News reported Thursday .
" The sighting came in the rugged mountain passes of Tora Bora , " NBC correspondent Jim Miklaszewski reported on the Today Show .
An unmanned spy plane spotted a large security contingent similar in size to one that would guard bin Laden or his No. 2 , Ayman al - Zawahiri , although intelligence officials were unable to positively identify either of the top terrorists .
The intelligence gathered launched the largest military operation in Afghanistan in five years , Miklaszewski reported .
Some intelligence and military officials " believed there was a high probability " bin Laden or Zawahiri were there , despite the lack of a positive ID .
US forces spent three days and nights pounding the al Qaeda hideout , killing 19 al Qaeda and Taliban officials , but missing bin Laden .
Some officials told NBC that the mission was not swift enough to capture or kill America 's No. 1 enemy in the war on terror .
" They were just too slow , too cumbersome , too risk averse , " Mike Sheehan , an NBC terrorism analyst said .
" And again we 've missed him . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on September 27 .

Iowans for Tax Relief and Iowa Christian Alliance will host a presidential candidates forum on Saturday , June 30th in Des Moines .
Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney , Sam Brownback , Jim Gilmore , Mike Huckabee , Tommy Thompson , and Tom Tancredo will participate .
Ron Paul , however , will not participate .
Why ?
Because he was n’t invited .
We heard about this forum from numerous supporters in Iowa who asked why Dr. Paul was not going to participate .
Those supporters assumed that Dr. Paul was invited .
The campaign office had not received an invitation so we called this morning ; thinking we might have misplaced the invitation or simply overlooked it .
Lew Moore , our campaign manager , called Mr. Edward Failor , an officer of Iowans for Tax Relief , to ask about it .
To our shock , Mr. Failor told us Dr. Paul was not invited ; he was not going to be invited ; and he would not be allowed to participate .
And when asked why , Mr. Failor refused to explain .
The call ended .
Lew then called Mr. Steve Sheffler , president of the Iowa Christian Alliance , to talk with him .
Mr. Sheffler did not answer so Lew left a message .
He has yet to respond .
Why are the Iowans for Tax Relief and the Iowa Christian Alliance excluding the one Republican candidate who scored at the top of every online poll taken after the MSNBC , Fox News , and CNN debates ?
Why are they denying Iowans the opportunity to hear from the Republican presidential candidate whose popularity is growing by the day ?
We could n’t get answers to these questions from Messrs .
Failor and Sheffler .
Maybe you ’ll have better luck .
Their contact information is below .
It 's ironic that on the same day we learned the Iowans for Tax Relief and the Iowa Christian Alliance excluded Dr. Paul from their candidates forum , we received a call from ABC News confirming Dr. Paul ’s participation in its nationally broadcast August 5th debate to be held in Des Moines .

Major time imbalances pointed to in CNN - moderated Democratic debate
Michael Roston
Published : Sunday June 3 , 2007 Print This Email This
A chart published by the Presidential campaign of Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) indicated a major imbalance in the time allotted to different Democratic hopefuls by CNN broadcaster Wolf Blitzer , who moderated tonight 's two hour debate at St. Anselm College in Manchester , New Hampshire .
The ' Talk Clock ' showed that Senator Barack Obama came out in front , with 16 minutes of air - time .
Former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel received only about a third of Obama 's air - time at 5 minutes , 37 seconds .
Senators Joe Biden ( D - DE ) and Dodd both finished behind Rep. Dennis Kucinich , the Ohio Democrat who has distinguished himself in the field of candidates with a foreign policy built around principles of non-violence .
Kucinich had 9 minutes to answer questions , with Dodd getting about 8 1/2 minutes , and approximately 8 minutes for Biden .
In the post - debate analysis , Blitzer was clearly conscious of the lack of time received by some candidates .
" Everybody thinks they deserve more time ... but you do the best you can , " the CNN news host said .
" There 'll be more debates down the road , and hopefully it 'll balance out over time . "
Blitzer himself spent close to 13 1/2 minutes asking questions and following up with the answers .
" You know , you could put Mario in just about anything , and it would be awesome . "
That statement , made by ScrewAttack.com 's Craig Skistimas , might not be far from the truth .
Take a look at the numbers :
Appearing in over 200 games to date , Mario has gone above and beyond his roots as a turtle - stompin ' plumber tearing through the Mushroom Kingdom .
Since his arcade debut in 1981 , Mario has played tennis , soccer and baseball ; baked cookies and cured diseases ; worked a demolition crew ; snowboarded ; and taught children how to type .
He 's been a lasting mainstay of the industry for 25 years , and while the industry around him has changed dramatically , the character has remained largely the same .
The debates over Mario 's appeal and market viability often return to the same core argument , nostalgia vs. gameplay , and which of the two keep gamers coming back .
Within these discussions lies another question : How would Mario fare if he were introduced in 2007 ?
Super Mario Bros. was certainly fantastic , as evidenced by the leagues of imitators it spawned and the standards it set for platformers .
How accepting would audiences be of the character and the surrounding universe if the primer - Super Mario Bros .
and its successors - were n't woven into the very fabric of gaming history ?
Let 's assume Super Mario Galaxy would be the first Mario game on the market .
There 'd be questions , and lots of 'em , from the media and the public alike ; the sort of questions you expect to be asked when a new property is in development .
What 's with the overalls ?
Why the fascination with stars , coins ?
Where does he come from , and what is his reason for hopping around planets and kicking the crap out of this league of ne'er - do - wells ?
What 's with the exaggerated , cartoonish and stereotypical Italian accent ?
You got something against Italians ?
Wake thy lawyers , it 's on !
It 's no easy task to pick apart such a character .
As an icon , Mario is inseparable from the medium he represents , a name practically synonymous with the pastime , and like other creations brought about in gaming 's infancy , absolutely absurd .
Stare too long and you realize he's an overweight , mustachioed Italian stereotype who battles sentient turtles and grows to immense proportions when he comes in contact with mushrooms .
But these are conventions of a universe that we 've had over 20 years to become familiar with .
Why does the mushroom make Mario big ?
Because it 's a super mushroom .
Duh .
It 's adorable , it 's blue — no , wait , it 's adorable and blue !
It 's the Pivo 2 , complete with robotic agent and powered by Lithium-ion batteries .
Now , when we first revealed the new Pivo 2 concept car this morning , we saw it as nothing more than a more bubbly version of the old Pivo .
Now that we 've seen this video of the Pivo 2 swallowing its gal pal whole and then watching the robotic agent in action , we totally want one .
If only so we can have highly enlightened conversations in both Japanese and English with our new blue friend .
Nissan better hide the keys so we do n't steal it at the official reveal at the Tokyo Auto Show later this month .

Where does the truth lie ?
A full review of CERA's and other UK oil production forecasts are dicussed under the fold .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) in March 2006 presented a model for UK oil production capacity showing around 2,350,000 bpd for the UK in 2006 .
That 's around 700,000 bpd higher than the actual production figure .
Central to the Peak Oil debate , is the ability of individuals to forecast the future , based upon information that is available to them today .
Different people and organisations come up with different forecasts based on the same data .
So how does anyone know who to believe ?
One problem with forecasting World Peak Oil is the poor quality of data that is available from certain key areas such as the Middle East .
Another problem , however , is the fact that industry professionals are able to draw quite different conclusions from the same data sets .
I therefore feel that it is time to examine the forecasting records of some leading industry commentators .
Whilst there may be a fog swirling around the oil production and reserves data in certain parts of the world , this is not the case in the UK which has a comprehenisve production data set for all fields that is available on line .
You may think therefore , that there might be a high degree of concordance between UK oil production forecasts for the coming years .
This is not the case .
Forecasts for 2008 oil production - that 's just 2 years away - vary by up to 500,000 bpd .
Last week , I presented a detailed analysis of the history of UK oil production together with a forecast of future production to 2012 ( Mearns2 ) .
So lets get down to the nitty gritty and see how forward production models recently presented by CERA , Kemp , Koppelaar and the UK Department of Trade and Industry compare with Mearns2 and the historic production data .
Summary of UK oil production models
Figure 1 . Oil production models and forecasts for the UK .
See here for further details .
Other forecasts are discussed below .

Figure 1 summarises oil production models for the UK .
I refer to these as models as the data from CERA and Kemp are lifted from conference presentations which cannot necessarily be viewed as formal forecasts .
The thick red line represents actual UK oil production ( crude+condensate + NGL ) , BP data 1999 to 2005 .
The actual 2006 figure is compiled from monthly DTI figures found here and here ( XL spread sheet ) and include figures from January to September .
The foundation of the Mearns2 forecast was discussed at length in my post last week and this is used as a benchmark against which the other forecasts are compared .
It is of course possible that Mearns2 falls wide of the mark , but if you wish to query the validity of Mearns2 , please read the foundation article first .
A draft of this article was sent to Dr Peter Jackson ( a Director of CERA ) , Professor Alex Kemp at the University of Aberdeen and to Rembrandt Koppelaar inviting them to comment .
Jackson and Koppelaar responded and I have tried to incorporate their comments .
Kemp did not reply .
CERA
In correspondence with Peter Jackson , he brought to my attention the fact that their UK oil forecast that was presented at the APPEX conference in London on 8th March 2006 had been revised in October and he sent me a copy ( not for publication ) .
One of the first points Jackson wanted to make was that CERA forecast " productive capacity " and not actual production .
" we are not projecting production but productive capacity - which will be a little higher than production in most cases .
In the UK production gyrates with the maintenance season and we look at capacity as being nearer the winter ' production ' highs . "
" we include crude plus condensate and NGL's in the outlook . "
And he then went on to say :
" I agree we were optimistic about the UK and this was dealt with in our last update in October .
The UK declined rather more quickly than we expected last year - because of above and below ground factors . "
" Overall our outlook will give a slightly optimistic view relative to absolute ' production ' - we do n't take account of some of the big ( high risk ) above ground risks that will impact production such as hurricanes and geopolitics -"
" Our numbers are calibrated against activity in a very detailed manner - for example we have a database of 400 + new projects expected onstream by 2010 and more generally we have access to IHS data .
So we believe that the capacity trends we calculate are robust and that the absolute numbers are sound . "
The CERA1 data are read from the chart shown in Figure 2 that was presented to the APPEX conference in a presentation titled " Factors Driving the Global Liquids Capacity Surge " .
The CERA2 data are read from a chart with the title " United Kingdom - struggling to stay still " .
Figure 2 . Oil production capacity model for the UK presented by Peter Jackson of CERA to the APEX conference in London earlier this year .
Figure 2 shows how the CERA forecasts are constructed from four basic elements :
FIP - fields in production
FUD - fields under development
FUA - fields under appraisal
YTF - yet to find
In order to disentangle all the lines shown in Figure 1 , The CERA1 and 2 data are re-plotted in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 . CERA1 and CERA2 compared .
The approximate consumption line is discussed here .
Some key observations :
CERA plot productive capacity
The CERA1&2 productive capacity data are concordant with actual production from 2001 to 2003 but track above it from 2004
The CERA1&2 curves are concordant with each other until 2004 , thereafter they diverge significantly before converging again in 2010 .
The 2006 productive capacity figure was adjusted down from around 2,260,000 to 1,850,000 bpd between March and October this year .
The CERA1&2 productive capacity forecasts track well above the Mearns2 forecast .
By 2010 they are both around 560,000 bpd higher .
UK daily oil consumption , discussed here , is around 1,750,000 bpd , a fundamental difference , therefore between the CERA1&2 forecasts and Merans2 is that the former project to UK oil self - sufficiency until 2010 whilst the latter points to rising imports .
This is no trivial matter for the UK .
So how is it possible for CERA and I to reach such different conclusions ?
CERA no doubt may point to the detail and " 400 projects " included in their forecast .
The claim of " very detailed " analysis needs to be considered in the context of their March forecast being around 700,000 bpd too high for this year .
CERA themselves have acknowledged this problem and have revised their forecast downwards by 18 % for the current year .
In a general sense , I see three main problems with how the CERA forecasts are constructed :
The fields under development band runs at around 400,000 bpd in the interval 2007 to 2010 - and this is an appropriate figure .
However , beyond 2010 these new fields will probably start to decline more rapidly than shown .
Fields under appraisal are not yet scheduled to produce oil .
When they become scheduled for production they become " Fields Under Development " and should in my opinion be shown as a continuation of FUD and not stacked on top .
The same applies to Yet to Find .
Once found , new fields will first be appraised before being developed .
YTF should also in my opinion be shown as a continuation of FUD .
The CERA2 model shows around 200,000 bpd in the YTF class by 2010 .
This simply does not look feasible .
When you consider that the already found Rosebank / Lochnager field , west of Shetland is unlikely to see first oil before 2010 , it looks wholly inconceivable that 200,000 bpd of productive capacity could be built by 2010 for fields that have not yet been found .
Finally , I have a very substantial problem with the CERA2 forecast .
The large downwards revision in October 2006 is in my opinion a significant step in the right direction .
However , by 2010 , the CERA1 and CERA2 forecasts are the same .
In 2006 CERA2 has a much lower starting point than CERA1 .
Therefore , to reach the same point by 2010 , CERA2 must be " more bullish " than CERA1 .
So let 's recall why CERA1 was revised downwards to CERA2 in the first place :
" I agree we were optimistic about the UK and this was dealt with in our last update in October .
The UK declined rather more quickly than we expected last year - because of above and below ground factors . "
Surely , the next logical step from here is to be more bearish about future prospects - not more bullish ?
I 've not managed to look in detail at how CERA get from 1 to 2 but I have compared the underlying decline - that is the projection of Fields in Production - and this is shown in Figure 4 .
The underlying decline rate for CERA1&2 are the same up until 2005 , but from that point onwards they start to diverge ( remember that the data are read from charts ) .
Figure 4 . Comparison of the underlying rates of decline between CERA1 and CERA2 .
The data are read from charts .
CERA2 uses a lower rate of underlying decline than CERA1 .
The FUD , FUA and YTF bands in CERA1 and CERA2 look roughly the same - but these are stacked on top of a lower underlying decline rate .
So , having just learned that the UK has declined more rapidly than expected , CERA then proceed to reduce and not increase the projection of that underlying decline .
Kemp
Alex Kemp is Professor of Petroleum Economics at the University of Aberdeen , and is highly respected and influential in this field .
Strange then that his oil production model for 2007 , is running at right angles to the oil production trend of the last six years ( Figure 1 ) .
At the Oil Depletion Conference , hosted by the Energy Institute in London , November 2006 , Professor Kemp presented a variety of oil , gas and total hydrocarbon models based on different economic assumptions .
The one I have chosen for comparative purposes here is the $ 40 / bbl oil model ( Figure 5 ) - conservative in today 's terms .
Figure 5 .
One of several oil production models presented by Kemp to The Oil Depletion conference in London earlier this year ( pdf of presentation )
In discussion at this conference Professor Kemp dismissed what he called " single line " forecasts , referring to Hubbert linearisation and depletion analysis and scoffed at the notion of peak oil .
He seemed to view the current low level of UK oil production as due to unscheduled maintenance shut downs .
What 's OK with the Kemp model ?
The 2006 production number lies close to the actual figure - though as already mentioned Kemp 's trend is going up , while the actual trend is going down .
The underlying decline rate from 2009 to 2012 averages 16 % , which if anything would lead to underestimation of future production .
What 's wrong with the Kemp model ?
In 2004 , 2005 , the Kemp trend lies parallel to the actual production trend , but is displaced about 200,000 bpd below it - this looks odd .
Kemp shows a massive reversal in the underlying decline from the actual figure which is minus 13 % per annum for the last 6 years to underlying growth of +15.6 % from 2006 to 2007 .
This combined with " incremental growth " points to 2007 UK production of 2.0 million bpd .
This is over 300,000 bpd higher than the Mearns2 forecast and sets the scene for forward inflation of UK oil production which in my opinion is never likely to occur .
From 2007 onwards there are multiple layers of " Potential Oil Production " such as " incremental ; future incremental ; technical reserves and new exploration " that are built upon the underlying decline curve .
The net result is that by 2012 , Kemp has 600,000 bpd more production than Mearns2 ( that is 60 % higher ) .
As already mentioned , the Kemp production line falls close to actual for 2006 , and this makes it difficult to simply dismiss the Kemp model - he is after all the recognised expert in the field of UK oil and gas forecasting .
And so we will need to wait a year or so to see if Kemp 's model is validated .
Some of Kemp 's forecasts are presented and discussed on the DTI web site and for those who are interested I have been invited to present the Mearns2 forecast to the same forum next month .
If UK oil production comes anywhere near to 2 million bpd average in 2007 then I will accept that I have been wrong , offer my appologies to those who I have criticised and will resign as an Oil Drum contributor .
This will be a clear signal that forecasts of an imminent peak in global oil production are unfounded and I will seek gainful employment else where .

Koppelaar
Rembrandt Koppelaar , Chairman of ASPO Netherlands and TOD Europe contributor sent me his preliminary UK oil forecast which is shown in Figure 6 .
Note that Koppelaars preliminary forecast has been updated since the summary chart I presented last week was prepared .
The main difference is that the underlying decline has been raised from 9 to 11.5 % .
Figure 6 . Forecast from Rembrandt Koppelaar .
The blue slice representing new fileds under development are the same fields used to develop the Mearns2 forecast .
Koppelaar 's preliminary forecast falls close to , but just above Mearns2 .
This is not surprising since I used Koppelaars data base of new field developments to compile Mearns2 .
Koppelaar tracks above Mearns2 because the underlying decline rate I used was 13 % as opposed to Koppelars 11.5 %
There is little material difference between these two forecasts .
Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI )
The DTI forecasts were the subject of an earlier post and I do not intend to go into detailed discussion here .
It suffices to say that the DTI provide a forecast range that is based on data returned to them by the operating companies .
The upper forecast falls between CERA and Kemp and therefore in my opinion is a gross overestimate of what is likely to come to pass based on assessment of current data .
The lower forecast falls close to Mearns2 and not surprisngly is in my opinion rooted in the reality of oil production decline that is partialy offset by sparse new field developments .
The $ value difference between the upper and lower DTI forecasts at $ 60 / bbl is $ 68 billion between 2006 and 2011 .
Mearns2
The ink on Mearns2 is barely dry but it is already in danger of looking over - optimistic .
September oil production is up from the August lows but the prospect of reaching 1.67 mmbpd in 2006 , the starting point for Mearns2 , is looking increasingly remote .
Several commentators ( the DTI , Chris Skrebowski and Rembrandt Koppelaar ) have all pointed out that the Rosebank / Lochanager project is not likely to start before 2010 - the likelihood of delays were noted in my earlier post , and this would further reduce forecast production between 2008 - 2010 .
To offset possible delays with Rosebank / Lochnager , a good friend and senior industry advisor suggested that a growing number of small projects may provide a significant boost in the years ahead .
Khebab has pointed out I should use logistic and not exponential decline - next time maybe .
Hubbert linearisation
For those not familiar with Hubbert Linearisation ( HL ) it is a technique that uses historical production data to indicate the ultimate recoverable oil reserves ( URR ) for a country or sedimentary basin .
This technique has been discussed at length on TOD by Khebab , Stuart Staniford and others .
A brief overview is provided by Wolf at the Door .
The UK has an unusual production history with twin production peaks giving rise to two linear decline legs to the HL .
The projection to URR provided by the Mearns2 and Kemp forecasts are shown in Figures 7 and 8 .
I have not shown the CERA2 forecast because HL is only applicable to real production and not to productive capacity .
Nevertheless , performing HL on CERA2 provides a similar conclusion to Kemp .
Figure 7 . HL forecast for Mearns2 points to a URR above 28 Gb but probably less that 30Gb
Figure 8 . HL forecast for Kemp points to a URR well over 35Gb
As of the end of 2005 , UK cummulative production was around 24 Gb .
By 2012 , the Mearns2 shows cummulative production of 27.4Gb and this would suggest that the UK North Sea would be reaching the end of its productive life based on URR less than 30 Gb .
Kemp shows 28.4 Gb cummulative production with over 7 billion barrels still to go based on URR over 35 Gb .
Impact of oil price and economics
Certain observers seem to be bemused by the fact that high oil price and high activity levels in the North Sea have not managed to stem the oil production decline in the UK and Norway .
They fail to recognise that high oil prices are caused by falling production in mature areas like the North Sea .
In London , Kemp was keen to promote the role of economics in production forecasting .
So here 's a couple of economics observations .
Thanks to Nick Rouse , who pointed out here , that massive rises in oil industry expenditure over the past 5 years have by and large been swallowed by rising costs .
This issue was recently covered by Dave Cohen in his post on Investment in Oil Exploration and Production - An above ground factor .
With respect to the ability to massively increase drilling activities , this article in the Canadian Globe and Mail digs out of the biannual IEA report that the vast increase in the money invested by the international oil and gas companies over the last 5 years , $ 340 billion , a 70 % increase , has resulted in only a 5 % increase in real terms , the rest being swallowed up by inflation .
This increase in drilling only yielded a 2 % increase in production .
It is also important to note that since the $ 10 / bbl oil price lows of 1998 , the UK rig count has been tracking sideways .
$ 78 / bbl for oil earlier this year has not significantly influenced the number of drilling rigs operating in the UK North Sea .
Figure 9 . UK oil rig count from Baker Hughes .
Since the oil price low of 1998 , the number of oil rigs operating in the North Sea has been tracking sideways
The reason for this I believe is straightforward .
The oil price is high everywhere , the UK and Norway are past peak production , and oil companies are drawn to areas where both exploration and production growth prospects are better than in the North Sea .
In this respect , high oil prices may in fact have worked against the North Sea , with new rigs being attracted to more prospective areas while oil prices and drilling costs have soared .
Decommissioning
Finally , it is worth looking at this rather sobering chart from the DTI that shows planned decommissioning activity in the UK North Sea .
Thanks once again to Nick Rouse for bringing this to my attention .
Figure 10 .
Decommissioning schedule for the North Sea as published by the DTI .
It has to be expected that continued high oil price may delay this decommissiong schedule .
The emphasis here is on delay as with ageing infrastructure and falling production , the sun has begun to set on the North Sea .
Summary
The UK oil production forecasts discussed here fall into two groups .
One group comprising Mearns2 , Koppelaar and the " DTI lower " are very similar to each other and point to UK oil production continuing to decline in the years ahead and the UK importing increasing amounts of oil .
The other group comprising CERA2 , Kemp and the " DTI upper " , sees UK oil production increasing in the years ahead and the UK remaining more or less self sufficient in oil .
One final comment from Peter Jackson
" anyone who thinks they can get this kind of work accurate to +/- 50 kbd is dreaming and when you go out 5 years there are so many variables that a deteministic approach has to be couched in a description of the uncertainties "
I happen to agree with that , there are many uncertainties in this world today .
I will nevertheless revisit this subject around every 6 months to see how the various forecasts stand the test of time .

“ NEMESIS ” was the word The Economist printed on its front cover four years ago , when jubilant Iraqis , aided by American soldiers , hauled down the big statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad 's Firdos Square .
For a moment it looked as though all the fears that had accompanied the build - up to the American - led invasion had been groundless .
The defeat of Iraq 's army in three weeks turned out to be exactly the “ cakewalk ” that some of the war 's boosters predicted .
And in many places Iraqis did indeed greet the American soldiers as liberators , just as Ahmed Chalabi , Iraq 's best - known politician - in - exile , had promised they would .
How different it looks four years on .
The invasion has been George Bush 's nemesis as well as Saddam's .
The lightning conquest was followed by a guerrilla and then a civil war .
Talk of victory has given way to talk about how to limit a disaster .
The debacle has cut short the careers of Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair , poisoned the Bush presidency and greatly damaged the Republican Party ( see article ) .
More important , it has inflicted fear , misery and death on its intended beneficiaries .
“ It is hard to imagine any post - war dispensation that could leave Iraqis less free or more miserable than they were under Mr Hussein , ” we said four years ago .
Our imagination failed .
One of the men who took a hammer to Saddam 's statue told the world 's media this week that although Saddam was like Stalin , the occupation is worse .
What went wrong ?
The most popular answer of the American neoconservatives who argued loudest for the war is that it was a good idea badly executed .
Kenneth Adelman , he of the “ cakewalk ” , has since called the Bush national - security team “ among the most incompetent ” of the post - war era .
Others also blame the Iraqis for their inability to accept America 's gift of freedom .
“ We have given the Iraqis a republic and they do not appear able to keep it , ” lamented Charles Krauthammer , a columnist for the Washington Post .
That excuse is too convenient by half : it is what the apologists for communism said too .
But there can be no denying that the project was bungled from the start .
Western intelligence failed to discover that Saddam had destroyed all his weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) , the removal of which was the main rationale for the war .
However , the incompetence went beyond this .
The war was launched by a divided administration that had no settled notion of how to run Iraq after the conquest .
The general who warned Congress that stabilising the country would require several hundred thousand troops was sacked for his prescience .
Mr Rumsfeld 's one big idea seemed to be that it was not the job of the armed forces he was “ transforming ” to become policemen , social workers or nation - builders .
As a result , he sent too few and they did nothing to prevent looters from picking clean all Iraq 's public buildings the moment the regime collapsed .
“ Stuff happens , ” was the defence secretary 's comment , a phrase used later as the title of an anti-war play in London 's West End .
America 's plans for Iraq 's political transition were also rudimentary , to the extent that they existed at all .
The Pentagon wanted Mr Chalabi and his fellow exiles put swiftly in charge .
The State Department thought an American administration would have to be installed .
State had organised a pre-invasion Future of Iraq project , but the Pentagon declined to adopt its ideas .
Several knowledgeable State Department Arabists were prevented from going to Iraq because they were deemed ideologically unsound .
Jay Garner , an amiable general called in from retirement to manage the transition under an understaffed ad hoc body known as the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance , received no intelligible instructions from Washington , and baffled the liberated Iraqis in his turn .
“ You 're in charge , ” he told a gathering of 300 or so mystified tribal leaders and exiles who attended a conference soon after his arrival , hoping to discover what the future held under Iraq 's new rulers .
When the Americans discovered the obvious — that Iraqis could not take charge of a state whose institutions had collapsed — the amiable General Garner was called home and replaced by a viceroy .
Paul Bremer set up his Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) inside one of Saddam 's Baghdad palaces , at the heart of a fortified “ green zone ” cut off by tall blast walls from the life of the city .
Unlike his predecessor he had firm views about what needed to be done , views which in short order produced big mistakes .
He disbanded the Iraqi army and so put tens of thousands of resentful , jobless men with military training on the streets .
And he turfed thousands of Baath Party members out of the bureaucracy , thereby depriving many ministries of their only trained staff .
In the end , the Americans did preside over a political transition of sorts .
The CPA handed sovereignty to an interim government under Iyad Allawi , selected on the advice of the United Nations .
Then , in 2005 , came a year of elections .
In January Iraqis voted in their first free election for a new National Assembly ; they voted again in October in a referendum on a new constitution ; and they voted in December to elect yet another new National Assembly under the new constitution 's rules .
If democratic politics were about nothing more than casting votes , Iraq would have the hang of it by now .
Unfortunately , few things are more useless than a government that cannot govern .
And Iraq 's government can't .
For although Iraqis voted in high numbers , they voted along ethnic lines , and this produced an impasse .
The outnumbered Sunnis feel locked out of a new Iraq dominated by Shias .
The victorious Shia block , the United Iraqi Alliance , is itself so divided that it took its factions five months after the election of December 2005 to choose a prime minister .
And his authority is limited .
Nuri al - Maliki depends for a majority on members loyal to Muqtada al - Sadr , a radical anti-American Shia cleric , with a powerful militia at his disposal .
The prime minister can deploy patronage , but this has made his administration into little more than a spoils system in which the individual parties , many with their own militias , use control of government ministries to extract resources for themselves .
The main reason for the government 's inability to govern , however , is that it cannot stem a tidal wave of criminal and political violence .
The Kurds are doing nicely in their northern enclave and much of the south is calm enough .
But Baghdad and central Iraq are tangled in multiple conflicts .
Many Sunnis have taken up arms against the new Shia - dominated order .
Al - Qaeda is running a jihad against the Americans and Shias alike .
By killing Shias , especially after blowing up their Askariyah shrine last February , al - Qaeda has succeeded in provoking a torrent of revenge killings .
In places , in the name of “ resistance ” or Islam , Shia militias also attack American soldiers .
A poll this week found that half of all Iraqis consider such attacks acceptable ( see table ) .
It seems extraordinary , till you remember how at a stroke the scandal of Abu Ghraib prison turned the liberators into torturers in the eyes of Iraqis .
The prevalence of violence and the absence of law erodes the legitimacy of the elected government and makes it almost impossible to rebuild an economy that even before the war had been prostrated by a dozen years of UN sanctions .
What now ?
It took a long time for the White House to acknowledge the bleak reality .
But December 's report to the new Democrat - controlled Congress of the Iraq Study Group , a bipartisan committee chaired by James Baker and Lee Hamilton , forced a change .
Its succinct first sentence —
“ The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating ” — made it impossible for Mr Bush to keep on saying with jutted jaw that fortitude alone could retrieve the situation .
Nor , however , could he accept the group 's recommendation to begin to withdraw troops and launch “ a robust diplomatic effort ” .
That would look too much like declaring defeat and going cap in hand to America 's regional enemies , Iran and Syria , to sue for peace .
So instead of bringing the boys home , Mr Bush decided to send more .
What to make of the “ surge ” now starting in Baghdad ?
It is reasonable for sceptics to argue that Mr Bush is merely clinging to existing policy until he leaves office , when a new president will have to clean up the mess he has made .
On its own , adding between 20,000 and 30,000 American troops to the 130,000 already there hardly seems likely to turn Iraq around .
All the same , some of the military architects of the surge are true believers .
This is not just reinforcement , they say , but a long - overdue reversal of the whole flawed post- invasion strategy Mr Rumsfeld left behind .
From the start , the former defence secretary was convinced that the job of securing and rebuilding Iraq belonged to Iraqis .
Even after his grudging acceptance that a widespread Sunni insurgency was indeed under way , American troops concentrated on minimising their own casualties while training Iraq 's ragged new army to put it down .
This was well beyond its ability .
In recent months , since it has become clearer that parts of Mr Maliki's Shia - dominated coalition as well as parts of the police are themselves responsible for murdering many Sunnis , the strategy has made even less sense .
In such circumstances , arming a government can be tantamount to taking sides in a civil war — and reducing the incentive of the side you back to make concessions for peace .
Henceforth , say the surgers , American troops will do what they should have been doing all along according to classic counter - insurgency theory .
Under the direction of an energetic new commander , General David Petraeus , they will leave their bases and plant themselves in the heart of Baghdad 's neighbourhoods in order to give Iraqis the security they crave .
And security , they argue , is the key to everything else .
Only when the killing declines will Iraq 's new government be able to buttress its legitimacy , suck support away from the militias and rebuild the economy .
A few weeks into the surge , it is too early to assess the validity of this beguiling hypothesis .
The number of ethnic killings by Shia gangs is reported to be falling , but Sunni car - and suicide - bombers are still killing Baghdadis in their mosques and markets .
The obvious difficulty , however , is that even if the Americans have at last lighted on the right approach , General Petraeus may not be given the time to see the job through .
That will almost certainly be the case if politics in both Washington and Baghdad continue to move against him .
The Democrats in Congress do not want to be seen pulling the rug from under a successful new commander .
But nor are they eager to squander more lives and money on a war that many voters think America has already lost .
The mood in Washington might be changed by evidence of political progress in Baghdad : the point of the surge is to stabilise the capital and so buy time for Iraq 's politicians to reach a power - sharing agreement that might suck some poison out of the sectarian war .
But are they capable of making such a deal ?
Do they even want to ?
Iraq 's cabinet agreed last month on how to share oil revenues between the regions .
In public utterances Mr Maliki is careful to say all the right things about national reconciliation .
These are encouraging pointers .
The trouble is that Americans who listen in to his government 's internal chatter are horrified by what they hear .
Some conclude that the Shias have no real intention to share power , only to string America along while using its firepower to destroy rivals and entrench their own dominion .
It is also uncertain whether the politicians who claim to speak for the Sunnis in the National Assembly are close enough to the insurgents to make them stop fighting even in the event of a political settlement .
In short , time may show that the democratic structure the Americans worked so hard to install can neither run Iraq nor reconcile its warring clans .
That would mark Mr Bush 's final failure
The chief reason he gave for the invasion of 2003 ( and the only one this newspaper accepted ) was fear of Iraq 's WMD .
But this , admitted Paul Wolfowitz , then Mr Rumsfeld 's deputy , was only “ the one issue that everyone could agree on ” .
Others included a feeling after September 11th 2001 that America should vanquish any enemy that dared to defy it , and a belief that by turning Iraq into a democracy America could transform the Middle East , ending the rule of the autocrats , draining the swamp in which terrorism festered and promoting an Arab peace with Israel .
What next ?
When the WMD turned out not to exist , Mr Bush inflated this “ freedom agenda ” .
In his inauguration speech in 2005 , after his re-election , he connected Iraq to America 's “ great liberating tradition ” in foreign policy .
Free elections had been held not only in Iraq but also in Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories .
The “ Cedar Revolution ” turfed Syria 's army out of Lebanon and American nagging resulted in an Egyptian presidential election that looked marginally less rigged than usual .
But 2005 was the high point .
It is now absurd to expect Iraq to serve as a democratic inspiration — it has done more to inspire jihad .
As for proving American might , the overstretched superpower looks increasingly like a supplicant , less prone to lecture Arabs on governance than to seek help from former enemies once consigned like Syria and Iran to the “ axis of evil ” .
Mr Bush 's rejection of the Baker - Hamilton report should not have been a surprise .
Transparently admitting defeat would have forced America to negotiate from weakness .
The surge , in contrast , may turn out to be a case of sauter pour mieux reculer : a way to strengthen America 's hand before Mr Bush , or more probably his successor , co-ordinates an eventual exit with Iraq and its neighbours .

Into an unsafe future
The surge in Iraq has coincided with tougher action against Iran .
America has sent an extra carrier to the Gulf and is helping to pilot a second sanctions resolution against Iran through the UN Security Council .
But it is at the same time putting machinery in place that could be used to make a bargain .
Officials from the two countries talked early this month in Baghdad and more senior ones expect to get together at a follow - up next month .
It seems odd after more than quarter of a century of rivalry for America to expect any help from Iran .
The Islamic Republic is the big winner from Mr Bush 's war .
But neither Iran nor any regional power apart from al - Qaeda has an interest in the complete collapse of Iraq .
The Iranians in particular worry about what the Americans might do in such a circumstance .
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former president , calls America “ a wounded tiger ” , all the more dangerous for its sudden weakness .
Such has been Mr Bush 's failure that the autocrats of the Middle East say that they are trying to rescue Iraq from America and America from itself .
It really is a debacle .
If only
It is not enough to say with the neocons that this was a good idea executed badly .
Their own ideas are partly to blame .
Too many people in Washington were fixated on proving an ideological point : that America 's values were universal and would be digested effortlessly by people a world away .
But plonking an American army in the heart of the Arab world was always a gamble .
It demanded the highest seriousness and careful planning .
Messrs Bush and Rumsfeld chose instead to send less than half the needed soldiers and gave no proper thought to the aftermath .
What a waste .
Most Iraqis rejoiced in the toppling of Saddam .
They trooped in their millions to vote .
What would Iraq be like now if America had approached its perilous , monumentally controversial undertaking with humility , honesty and courage ?
Thanks to the almost criminal negligence of Mr Bush 's administration nobody , now , will ever know .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton heads into tonight ’s Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas with an opportunity : to try to erase the unflattering image that her chief rivals , and her own mistakes , have helped create .
Yesterday , in an attempt to neutralize one possible threat at the debate , her campaign announced that Mrs. Clinton would not support driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants as president .
It is the latest formulation of her position , which has shifted since it became a tripping point in the last televised debate on Oct. 30 .
Her advisers say they hope the matter will now be off the table , but Mrs. Clinton ’s top rivals made clear that they would continue to press the argument they have been making in recent weeks , that she is inconsistent and overly political .
“ When it takes two weeks and six different positions to answer one question on immigration , it ’s easier to understand why the Clinton campaign would rather plant their questions than answer them , ” said Bill Burton , a spokesman for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , a rival in the race for the nomination .

2.1 Installing git on your system
Prebuilt binary packages of git are available for many popular operating systems .
These make it easy to start using git on your computer immediately .
2.1.1 Linux
Because each Linux distribution has its own packaging tools , policies , and rate of development , it ’s difficult to give a comprehensive set of instructions on how to install git binaries .
The version of git that you will end up with can vary depending on how active the person is who maintains the package for your distribution .
To keep things simple , I will focus on installing git from the command line under the most popular Linux distributions .
Most of these distributions provide graphical package managers that will let you install git with a single click .
The package name to look for is often git , but is sometimes git-core , ( due to an unfortunate name with git , meaning GNU Interactive Tools ) .
Debian apt - get install git-core
Fedora
Core yum install git
Gentoo emerge dev-util / git
OpenSUSE yum install git
Ubuntu apt - get install git-core
2.1.2 Mac OS X
A git -core package is available through macports .
Once macports is enabled , the command to install git is :
port install git-core
2.1.3 Windows
Git has long been available as part of cygwin , and works reasonably well in that environment .
Some people find cygwin a particularly inelegant approach to running git and would prefer a " native " solution .
To this end , the msysgit project is rapidly putting together a solution including various packages with full installers .
These include GitMe , a package to install the entire development environment necessary to work on improving the msysgit port of git , and WinGit , a package for installing just git itself without the development environment , ( still in Alpha as of September 2007 ) .
2.2 Getting started
To begin , we ’ll use the “ git version ” command to find out whether git is actually installed properly .
Versions 1.5 and newer of git are much more friendly to new users than versions 1.4 and older .
If you are n't yet running version 1.5 or newer , it 's highly recommended that you upgrade .
$ git version git version 1.5.3.2
2.2.1 Built - in help
Git provides a built - in help system .
This is invaluable for those times when you find yourself stuck trying to remember how to run a command .
If you are completely stuck , simply run “ git help ” ; it will print a brief list of commonly - used commands , along with a description of what each does .
If you ask for help on a specific command ( such as " git help init " ) , it prints more detailed information .
This command expects the " man " program to be available and for the git man pages to be installed .
[ XXX : The original hgbook includes the complete output of " hg help init " at this point .
I 'm not including the corresponding " git help init " output as it would be excessively long .
The description alone is quite reasonable , ( other than a not - too - helpful aside about the obsolete git - init - db command ) , but it only comes after a full screen 's worth of options details .
Might it make sense to have a more summarized help output for " git help < foo > " than all of the documentation available for git -< foo > ?
And perhaps also provide a " git - v help " similar to " hg - v help " for more ? ]
2.3 Working with a repository
In git , everything happens inside a repository .
The repository for a project contains all of the files that “ belong to ” that project , along with a historical record of the project ’s files .
There ’s nothing particularly magical about a repository ; it is simply a directory tree in your filesystem that git treats as special .
You can rename or delete a repository any time you like , using either the command line or your file browser .
2.3.1 Creating a copy of a remote repository
The " git clone " command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository .
This is generally the first git operation you will use when beginning to work with an existing project .
We 've assembled a simple repository that will be used in the examples throughout this chapter .
Go ahead and clone this repository now so that you will be able to follow along :
$ git clone git://cworth.org/git/hello
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/hello/.git/ remote : Generating pack ... remote : Done counting 15 objects .
remote : Deltifying 15 objects ... remote : 100 % ( 15/15 ) done remote : Total 15 ( delta 2 ) , reused 15 ( delta remote : 2 ) Indexing 15 objects ... 100 % ( 15/15 ) done Resolving 2 deltas ...
100 % ( 2/2 ) done
If for some reason you are prevented from talking on the git : port , then there is also the capability to clone a repository ( less efficiently ) over http :
$ git clone http://cworth.org/git/hello
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/hello/.git/
Getting alternates list for http://cworth.org/git/hello
Getting pack list for http://cworth.org/git/hello
Getting index for pack 04ecb061314ecbd60fa0610ecf55a1cbf85ea294 Getting pack 04ecb061314ecbd60fa0610ecf55a1cbf85ea294 which contains a1a0e8b392b17caf50325498df54802fe3c03710 walk a1a0e8b392b17caf50325498df54802fe3c03710 walk 72d4f10e4a27dbb09ace1503c20dbac1912ee451 walk 13ed136b983a9c439eddeea8a1c2076cffbb685f walk 0a633bf58b45fcf1a8299d3c82cd1fd26d3f48f2 walk db7117a9dd9a6e57e8632ea5848e1101eee0fbde
If our clone succeeded , we should now have a local directory called hello .
This directory will contain some files .
$ ls -l total 4 drwxr - xr-x 3 cworth cworth 4096 2007 - 09 - 27 16:40 hello $ ls hello hello .c
Makefile
These files have the same contents and history in our repository as they do in the repository we cloned .
Every git repository is complete , self - contained , and independent .
It contains its own private copy of a project ’s files and history .
A cloned repository remembers the location of the repository it was cloned from , but it does not communicate with that repository , or any other , unless you tell it to .
What this means for now is that we ’re free to experiment with our repository , safe in the knowledge that it ’s a private “ sandbox ” that wo n’t affect anyone else .
2.3.2 Creating copy of a local repository
As mentioned above , a repository can be copied through normal file - copying commands .
But it 's useful to use " git clone " even when just making a local copy of a repository .
Using " git clone " will be much faster and will use much less space than a normal copy .
In fact , local clones are impressively fast .
Go ahead and make a local clone now as follows :
$ git clone hello hello - clone Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/ hello-clone/.git/ 0 blocks [ XXX Git says " empty " here , ( presumably from the git - init part ) , but should n't the command also report the succesful clone which makes it non-empty ?
And what the heck does " 0 blocks " mean ?
This is not friendly output . ]
In fact , let 's make a couple more clones at the same time .
This is n't just to drive home the speed and storage benefits of local clones , but we 'll use each of these cloned repositories in Section 2.8 when discussing how to move commits between repositories :
$ git clone hello hello - pull $ git clone hello hello - fetch $ git clone hello hello - remote
2.3.3
What ’s in a repository ?
When we take a more detailed look inside a repository , we can see that it contains a directory named .git .
This is where git keeps all of its metadata for the repository .
$ cd hello $ ls - a . .. . git hello.c Makefile
The contents of the .git directory and its subdirectories are private to git .
Every other file and directory in the repository is yours to do with as you please .
To introduce a little terminology , the .git directory is the “ real ” repository , and all of the files and directories that coexist with it are said to live in the working directory .
An easy way to remember the distinction is that the repository contains the history of your project , while the working directory contains a snapshot of your project at a particular point in history .
2.4 A tour through history
One of the first things we might want to do with a new , unfamiliar repository is understand its history .
The “ git log ” command gives us a view of history .

Create a standard " hello , world " program
This command prints a record of output for each change to the project that was recorded .
In git terminology , we call each of these recorded events a commit .
The default fields in a record of output from “ git log ” are as follows .
commit
This field consists of a string of 40 hexadecimal characters .
This is a unique identifier for referring to particular commits .
Author
The identity of the person who authored the commit .
This field consist of two sub-fields for the user 's name and email address , ( or at least an email - like idenitifer ) .
Note that git also stores a separate " Committer " field for the person who commited the change , ( since often an author will email a change to a maintainer that commits it ) .
See below for how to instruct " git log " to display it as well .
Date
The date and time on which the commit was authored , ( again stored separately from the date the change was committed ) .
timezone in which it was created .
( The date and time are displayed in the timezone of the person who created the commit . )
commit message
The text message that the creator of the commit entered to describe the commit , ( generally a one - line summary followed by more supporting text ) .
The output of the " git log " command can be made more or less verbose by means of the -- pretty option .
For example , with " git log -- pretty=short " the commit identifier will be omitted and only the first line of each commit message will be shown .
And with " git log -- pretty=fuller " , ( the name ' fuller ' is in contrast to the default -- pretty=full ) , the committer name and dates will be printed in addition to the author name and dates .
2.4.1 Commits , revisions , and talking to other people
As English is a notoriously sloppy language , and computer science has a hallowed history of terminological confusion ( why use one term when four will do ? ) , revision control has a variety of words and phrases that mean the same thing .
If you are talking about git history with other people , you will find that what we have called a “ commit ” is often called a " revision " .
In other systems , a similar notion is referred to as a " changeset " .
You might even see abbreviations of these terms such as " rev " , " change " , or even " cset " .
While it may not matter much what word you use to refer to the concept of “ a commit ” , it 's important to know how to name “ a specific commit ” .
We have already seen one means of referring to a particular commit , the 40 - character hexadecimal string shown by " git log " .
These commit identifiers are powerful because they are permanent , unique identifiers that always identify the same commit in any copy of a repository .
If two users are examining a working directory associated with the same commit identifier , then those two users have precisely the same contents in all files , and exactly the same history leading to that commit .
So there are places where it is often important to archive the complete commit identifier , ( perhaps in bug - tracking systems to indicate a specific commit that fixes a bug , for example ) .
But often , in more casual settings , it 's more convenient to use abbreviated commit identifiers .
Git accepts any unique prefix of a commit identifier , ( and for reasonably - sized projects the first 8 or 10 characters are almost always unique ) .
And unlike the permanent commit identifiers , git also provides transient means of identifying commits .
In fact , in day - to - day use of git , you will probably use these names more than commit identifiers .
One example is branch names , ( such as the default " master " branch in any git repository ) , or any project - specific branch names such as " stable " , " experimental " , or " crazy - insane - changes " .
Git also provides a special name " HEAD " which always refers to the current branch .
2.4.2 Naming related commits
Git offers simple ways to name revisions that are related to particular revisions in the history .
One syntax is the ~ suffix which refers to the parent of a commit , or if followed by a number , to the Nth parent .
For example , since " HEAD " refers to the most recent commit in the current branch , " HEAD~ " , refers to the previous commit , and " HEAD ~ 2 " refers to two commits back in the history .
Another useful syntax is .. which can be used to specify a range of commits .
So " origin..master " specifies everything that has been committed to master since it diverged from origin .
2.4.3 Viewing specific revisions
You can use " git log " to explore the range syntax just introduced .
For example , to see a list of the most recent 3 revisions you can use " HEAD ~ 3.. " , ( the destination of the range is implicitly HEAD in this case ) :
$ git log HEAD ~ 3.. commit a1a0e8b392b17caf50325498df54802fe3c03710 Author : Bryan O'Sullivan < bos@serpentine.com >

2.4.4
Other log filters
Besides filtering by commit identifiers , git allows you to easily filter the log output according to which files ( or directories ) are modified by listing them after " - -" which is necessary to distinguish commit names from file names :
$ git log -- Makefile commit 72d4f10e4a27dbb09ace1503c20dbac1912ee451 Author : Bryan O'Sullivan < bos@serpentine.com >

Date : Fri Aug 26 01:21:28 2005 - 0700 Create a makefile
And " git log " can also filter based on the dates at which commits were created :
$ git log -- since = " 2 weeks ago " -- until= " yesterday " [ XXX :
By default , " git log " displays author dates as " Date " but then uses commit dates when given a -- since option .
That seems like broken defaults to me .
Why the inconsistency ? ]
Another useful option is -n or -- max - count which , unsurprisingly , limits the maximum number of commits to be displayed .
2.4.5 More detailed information
While the default information printed by “ git log ” is useful if you already know what you ’re looking for , you may need to see more details of the change , such as the " diffstat " information with -- stat :
$ git log -- stat --max-count=3 commit a1a0e8b392b17caf50325498df54802fe3c03710 Author : Bryan O'Sullivan < bos@serpentine.com >

Introduce a typo into hello.c. hello.c | 2 +- 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-)
Or perhaps you 'd like to see the actual patch content of each change , which you can get with - p .
That commit with the word typo in its name looks suspicious , so let 's take a closer look .
Remember that we can name it as master ~3 , HEAD~3 , or any prefix of its commit identifier , ( such as 13ed136 b ) :
$ git log -p -n 1 13ed136 b commit 13ed136b983a9c439eddeea8a1c2076cffbb685f Author : Bryan O'Sullivan < bos@serpentine.com >

" ) ; + printf ( " hello , world ! \ " ) ; return 0 ; }
Of course , wanting to see all this information for a single commit is such a common operation that it 's given its own name in git , " git show " .
So " git show 13ed 136b " is a much easier way to get exactly the same output :
$ git show 13ed136 b commit 13ed136b983a9c439eddeea8a1c2076cffbb685f Author : Bryan O'Sullivan < bos@serpentine.com >

" ) ; + printf ( " hello , world ! \ " ) ; return 0 ; }
2.5 All about command options
Let ’s take a brief break from exploring git commands to discuss a pattern in the way that they work ; you may find this useful to keep in mind as we continue our tour .
Git has a consistent and straightforward approach to dealing with the options that you can pass to commands .
It follows the conventions for options that are common to modern Linux and Unix systems .
Most options have long names .
For example , as we ’ve already seen , the “ git log " command accepts a - - max - count = < number > option .
option .
Some options have short , single - character names .
Often these are aliases for long commands , ( such as -n < number > instead of -- max - count= < number > ) , but sometimes the option exists in short - form with no long - form equivalent , ( such as - p ) . [ XXX :
It would n't hurt to fix this by adding -- patch , etc. right ? ]
instead of ) , but sometimes the option exists in short - form with no long - form equivalent , ( such as ) .
[ XXX :
It would n't hurt to fix this by adding , etc. right ? ]
Long options start with two dashes ( e.g. -- max - count ) , while short options start with one ( e.g. - n ) .
Option naming and usage is consistent across commands .
For example , every command that lets you specify a commit identifier or range will accept the same expressions , ( HEAD~3 , origin .. master , 72d4f10e , etc ) , while any command that can be limited by paths will accept the same expressions ( " -- doc/ some - file.c " ) , etc .
Many commands that print output of some kind can be made more quiet by passing the -q or -- quiet options .
2.6 Making and reviewing changes
Now that we have a grasp of viewing history in git , let ’s take a look at making some changes and examining them .
You should be working within the " hello " directory that we originally cloned .
In the repository , we have a file hello.c that contains the classic “ hello , world ” program .
But this program currently has a syntax error and wo n't compile , ( there 's a missing ' n ' between the ' \ ' and the ' " ' on the line containing printf ) .
Let 's fix that now .
You can use a text editor to correct the file , or you can copy - and - paste the sed command below :
$ sed - i ' / printf/s/\\ " / \
" /' hello. c
After you 've made that change , the “ git status ” command will tell you what git knows about the files in the repository .
$ ls hello .c Makefile $ git status #
On branch master # Changed but not updated : # ( use " git add < file > ... " to update what will be committed ) # # modified : hello.c # no changes added to commit ( use " git add " and / or " git commit - a " )
First " git status " tells us that the current branch is " master " .
This means that the master branch is what will be updated when we create a new commit .
Note :
In git a branch is a very simple notion --- it 's simply a name that points to a particular commit , ( literally nothing more than a pointer --- look at the contents of . git / refs / heads / master if you 're curious ) .
The fact that a branch is so light is what makes the creation of new branches an instantaneous operation in git .
Together with the ease of merging , git makes branches a joy to work with .
But we 'll delay talk of branching and merging to a future chapter .
Next “ git status ” prints a line with " modified " for each modified file --- in this case just hello .c .
The “ git status ” command will not print any output for files that have not been modified .
Notice that we did n’t need to inform git that we were going to modify the file before we started , or that we had modified the file after we were done ; it was able to figure this out itself .
It ’s a little bit helpful to know that we ’ve modified hello.c , but we might prefer to know exactly what changes we ’ve made to it .
To do this , we use the “ git diff ” command .
$ git diff diff -- git a /hello.c b/hello.c index 9a3ff79..ea364d3 100644 --- a/hello.c +++ b/hello.c @@ - 7,6 +7,6 @@ int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { - printf ( " hello , world ! \ " ) ; + printf ( " hello , world !
" ) ; return 0 ; }
2.7 Recording changes in a new commit
We can modify files , build and test our changes , and use “ git status ” and “ git diff ” to review our changes , until we ’re satisfied with what we ’ve done and arrive at a natural stopping point where we want to record our work in a new commit .
If you 'd like , go ahead and build the program now with " make " and run it to ensure it works .
Everything should look good so we 're just about ready to make a commit .
Unsurprisingly , we 'll be using " git commit " to do this .
2.7.1 Introducing yourself to git
Before you run " git commit " though , you should introduce yourself to git .
Git records your name and email address with each change that you commit , ( as both author and committer unless you tell it otherwise ) , so that you and others will later be able to tell who made each change .
Git tries to automatically figure out a sensible name and address to attribute to both author and committer if you have n't explicitly told it a name and address .
And it tries a lot , ( detailed below ) .
If you 're not interested in these details , you might want to skip to the next section which explains how to avoid all this guesswork and tell git what your name and email address are .
Here is a list of all the guessing that git will attempt .
It will attempt each of the following methods , in order , ( stopping for each of the author and committer name and email as soon as a value is found ) :
If you specify a -- author option to the “ git commit ” command on the command line , followed by a " Real Name < email@example.com > " string , then this name and addresss will be used for the author fields .
The committer fields will still be determined as below .
This option is very helpful for when applying a commit originally authored by someone other than yourself .
If any of the GIT_AUTHOR_NAME , GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL , GIT_COMMITTER _NAME , or GIT_COMMITER_EMAIL
environment variables are set , then those values will be used for the corresponding fields .
If you have a file in your home directory called .gitconfig , with name or email settings in the [ user ] section , then these values will be used to set any remaining author and committer fields .
For more details on the contents of this file , refer to section 2.7.1 below .
If you have a file in the local repository called . git / config , again with name or email settings in the [ user ] section , then these values will be used to set any remaining author and committer fields .
If you have set the EMAIL environment variable , this will be used to set author and committer email addresses if still unset .
git will query your system to find out your real name from available GECOS field and your username , hostname , and domain to construct an email address , ( or at least an identifier resembling an email address ) .
If all of these mechanisms fail , " git commit " will fail , printing an error message instructing you how to use " git config " to tell git your name and email address .
You should think of the GIT_AUTHOR / COMMITER_NAME / EMAIL environment variables and the -- author option to the “ git commit ” command as ways to override git ’s default selection .
For normal use , the simplest and most robust way to set your information is by creating a . gitconfig file , ( either manually or with the " git config " command ) ; see below for details .
Creating a git configuration file
To set your name and email address , just use the following commands :
git config -- global user.name " Your Name " git config -- global user.email " you@example.com "
The -- global option means that this command will set global information , ( affecting all repositories on this machine ) , in the .gitconfig file in your home directory .
Alternately , you could omit the -- global which would make the change take effect only in the local repository .
This is convenient if you want to have different email addresses associated with different projects , for example .
Of course , git 's configuration file is a simple - to - edit plain - text file , so instead of using the above commands , you can also just edit the files directly .
Use your favorite editor to create a file called .
gitconfig in your home directory , ( or if you ran the above commands then it will be there already ) .
The initial contents of your .gitconfig should look like this .
# This is a git configuration file .
[ user ] name = Your Name email = you@example.com
Similarly , you can make a repository - specific configuration by editing . git / config in the local repository .
It will already have some sections present , ( created by the " git clone " ) , just add a [ user ] section as above .
The “ [ user ] ” line begins a section of the config file , so you can read the “ name = ... ” line as meaning “ set the value of the name item in the user section ” .
This is the same notion expressed with the " user.name " syntax on the git - config command line .
A section continues until a new section begins , or the end of the file .
Git ignores empty lines and treats any text from “ # ” to the end of a line as a comment .
Choosing your name and email
You can use any text you like as the value of the name and email configuration items , since this information is for reading by other people , not for interpreting by git .
It is conventional to use your actual name as well as a valid email address .
But some people , ( notably Linus Torvalds , the original author of git ) , actually like the default username@hostname convention that git falls back on without any additional information about an email address .
There 's no requirement that the email address actually be valid , and perhaps it 's useful to be reminded which machine was used to create particular commits .
So choose the name and email you wish , or follow a particular project 's conventions .
2.7.2 Writing a commit message
When we commit a change , git drops us into a text editor to enter a message that will describe the modifications we ’ve made in this commit .
This is called the commit message .
It will be a record for readers of what we did and why , and it will be printed by “ git log ” after we ’ve finished committing .
$ git commit -a
Note :
The - a on the command - line instructs git to commit the new content of all tracked files that have been modified .
This is a convenience over explicitly listing filenames to be committed on the git commit command line .
It is useful to use git commit < files > when there is a need to commit only some subset of the files that have been modified .
If new files need to be committed for the first time , just use git add < file > before git commit - a .
If a file needs to be removed , just remove it as normal before committing and git commit - a will notice that --- it does not need to be explicitly told about the removal .
The editor that the git commit command drops us into will contain an empty line , followed by a number of lines starting with “ # ” .
These lines contain the same information as seen in git status before :
empty line #
Please enter the commit message for your changes .
# ( Comment lines starting with ' # ' will not be included ) #
On branch master # Changes to be committed : # ( use " git reset HEAD < file > ... " to unstage ) # # modified : hello.c # # Untracked files : # ( use " git add < file > ... " to include in what will be committed ) # # hello # hello.o
Notice that two untracked files ( hello and hello .o ) have now appeared from the build process .
Git is reminding us of these in case we intended to commit them as well , ( in which case we would need to " git add " them ) .
We do n't actually want to commit these files so we will ignore them for now , ( and we could tell git to ignore them as well by listing them in a .gitignore file ) .
Git will ignore all lines in the commit message that start with “ # ” ; it uses them only to give us information on the commit .
Modifying or deleting these lines has no effect .
2.7.3 Writing a good commit message
A good commit message will generally have a single line that summarizes the commit , a blank line , and then one or more paragraphs with supporting detail .
Since many tools only print the first line of a commit message by default , it ’s important that the first line stands alone .
One example of a first - line - only viewer is " git log -- pretty=short " .
Other examples include graphical history viewers such as gitk and gitview , and web - based viewers such as gitweb and cgit .
Here ’s a real example of a commit message that does n’t follow this guideline , and hence has a summary that is not readable .
$ git log -- pretty=short commit 3ef5535144da88a854f7930503845cd44506c2e2 Author : Censored Person < censored.person@example.org > include buildmeister / commondefs .
Add an exports and install
As far as the remainder of the contents of the commit message are concerned , there are no hard - and - fast rules .
git itself does n’t interpret or care about the contents of the commit message , though your project may have policies that dictate a certain kind of formatting .
My personal preference is for short , but informative , commit messages that tell me something that I can’t figure out with a quick glance at the output of " git log -- stat " or “ git log - p " , ( so repeating the list of all modified files is not useful , for example ) .
To follow along with the example here , go ahead and type something like the following sentence into the editor .
The misspelling here is intentional .
You 'll see how to fix that up after the fact in just a moment :
Fixed the typo so the program actuall complies now .
Then save the file , and exit from the editor .
When you do that , git will create the commit .
2.7.4 Aborting a commit
If you decide that you do n’t want to commit while in the middle of editing a commit message , simply exit from your editor without saving the file that it ’s editing .
This will cause nothing to happen to either the repository or the working directory .
2.7.5 Admiring our new handiwork
Once we ’ve finished the commit , we can use the “ git show ” command to display the commit we just created .
As discussed previously , this command produces output that is identical to “ git log - p ” , but for only a single revision , ( and the most recent revision by default ) :
$ git show commit fd21e5d6c5eedee70137229ebf348c25181812 ab Author : Carl Worth < cworth@cworth.org >
Date : Fri Sep 28 12:50:16 2007 - 0700
Fixed the typo so the program actuall complies now .
diff -- git a/hello.c b/hello.c index 9a3ff79..ea364d3 100644 --- a/hello.c +++ b/hello.c @@ - 7,6 +7,6 @@ int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { - printf ( " hello , world ! \ " ) ; + printf ( " hello , world !
" ) ; return 0 ; }
Note that you will not see the same commit identifier for your commit , even if the change you made is identical to mine .
The commit identifier incorporates not only the contents of the files , but commit message , the author and committer names and emails , and the author and commit dates .
( OK , so now you probably know enough to be able to guess the right command to produce a commit with exactly the commit identifier shown above .
Can you do it ? )
2.7.6 Fixing up a broken commit ( before anyone else sees it )
So now that we 've cloned a local repository , made a change to the code , setup our name and email address , and made a careful commit , we 're just about ready to share our change with the world .
But wait , that commit message has that embarrassing misspelling in it .
Would n't it be nice to touch that up before we post this commit with a never - to - be - changed again commit identifier ?
This is the exact situation for which " git commit -- amend " was invented .
So you can just run that now and fix the broken commit message in the editor :
$ git commit -- amend
Here 's the final result :
$ git show commit 3c54ac672ec1130b36837f1b708054a7a1d402de Author : Carl Worth < cworth@cworth.org >
Date : Fri Sep 28 12:50:16 2007 - 0700
Fixed the typo so the program actually compiles now .
diff -- git a/hello.c b/hello.c index 9a3ff79..ea364d3 100644 --- a/hello.c +++ b/hello.c @@ - 7,6 +7,6 @@ int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { - printf ( " hello , world ! \ " ) ; + printf ( " hello , world !
" ) ; return 0 ; }
Note that we did n't use " commit - a " this time .
This means that " git commit -- amend " will amend only the commit message and not any of the actual files being tracked , ( even if some of them had been modified between the commits ) .
It 's also possible to use " git commit - a -- amend " to similarly fix up mistakes noticed in code .
That will replace the most recent commit with a different commit based on any new changes to files .
I do feel a little hesitant to mention " git commit - a -- amend " .
It 's a handy command for fixing up something like a misspelling in a comment in the code .
But if there is anything more significant than that , then it would generally be better to create an additional commit rather than amending an existing commit .
This is important for several reasons :
The amend operation will destroy a state that was previously saved in a commit .
If it 's just the commit message being changed , then that 's no big deal .
But if the contents are being amended , then a mistake could eliminate something valuable .
All commits should be logically independent and as small as possible .
Abusing " git commit - a -- amend " can cause a small commit to grow and acquire unrelated changes .
It 's worth emphasizing the value of minimal , independent commits .
The smaller the changes are the more useful the history will be when actually using the history , not just viewing it .
This is particularly important when doing " git bisect " --- that 's a powerful tool for isolating a single commit that introduces a bug .
And it 's much more helpful when the commit it isolates is as small as possible .
One advantage of using git over some other systems is that the commit speed is blazingly fast .
The tool does n't punish you at all for committing every time your project is in a state worth saving .
" Commit early , commit often " is a well - supported mode of operation with git .
2.8 Sharing changes
We mentioned earlier that repositories in git are self - contained .
This means that the commit we just created exists only in our hello repository .
Let ’s look at a few ways that we can propagate this change into other repositories .
2.8.1 Pulling changes from the original repository
Recall that in Section 2.3.2 we made several local clones of the hello repository before we made any commits .
This allows us to simulate what happens when upstream changes have been committed after you originally cloned .
The simplest , ( and quite common ) , scenario is that you inherently trust any changes in the original repository and you want to pull these directly into your clone .
This might be the case if you are using git simply to track the progress of a project without making any changes .
In this case , the operation is as simple as just calling " git pull " :
$ cd ../ hello- pull $ git pull remote : Generating pack ...
Unpacking 3 objects ... 100 % ( 3/3 ) done remote : Done counting 5 objects .
Result has 3 objects .
Deltifying 3 objects ... 100 % remote : ( 3/3 ) done Total 3 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) * refs / remotes / origin / master : fast forward to branch ' master ' of /tmp/hello old..new : a1a0e8b..3c54ac6 Updating a1a0e8b..3c54ac6
Fast forward hello.c | 2 +- 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-)
XXX : Git is fairly noisy here , but a user has little need to care about the several stages of operation involved here .
As a tutorial writer I 'd like to say " ignore all that progress stuff , and look at where the stat information starts " but it 's hard for a new user to even be able to understand that .
I think it would be ideal if all of the progress - tracking spew were reduced to a single line .
Something like " Computing ( 100 % ) Transferring ( 100 % ) " or whatever .
After ( lots ! ) of progress indication , git gives a report of which files were modified , ( which is very useful for getting a quick feel for what happened ) .
If you would like more details on what changes came in , git provides a range that is perfect for examining .
Let 's take a look ( again , the commit identifiers will be different for you --- just copy - and - paste the range that git prints ) :
$ git log a1a0e8b..3c54ac6 commit 3c54ac672ec1130b36837f1b708054a7a1d402de Author : Carl Worth < cworth@cworth.org >
Date : Fri Sep 28 12:50:16 2007 - 0700
Fixed the typo so the program actually compiles now .
As expected , we received just the one commit .
So that 's all that 's needed in the common case .
Just run " git pull " everytime you want to pull in new changes that have landed in the upstream repository .
Note : Mercurial users who are reading this might wonder if there 's a need for the equivalent of " hg update " after doing a " git pull " .
And the answer is no .
Unlike mercurial , " git pull " , ( and " git merge " ) will automatically update the working - directory files as necessary .
2.8.2 Using fetch and merge separately to pull
Sometimes you may not know if you want to pull in the changes from the remote repository or not .
It 's useful to be able to examine them before accepting them into our branch .
The " git pull " command shown in the previous section is conceptually the combination of two commands , " git fetch " and " git merge " .
We can use these commands separately to examine the change before accepting it .
So let 's do that within the hello - fetch clone we made earlier .
First we will do the fetch :
$ cd ../ hello - fetch $ git fetch remote : Generating pack ...
Unpacking 3 objects ... remote : Done counting 5 objects .
Result has 3 objects .
Deltifying 3 objects ... 100 % remote : ( 3/3 ) done Total 3 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) 100 % ( 3/3 ) done * refs / remotes / origin / master : fast forward to branch ' master ' of /tmp/hello / old..new : a1a0e8b..3c54ac6
You may notice that the output here looks very much like the first portion of the output from " git pull " .
This is no coincidence .
The new changes have been " fetched " into the current repository and are stored into " origin / master " and have not been into the current " master " branch .
Remember that " master " is our current branch .
So now , " origin / master " is the state of the master branch that exists in the " origin " repository , ( the one we cloned from ) .
The most convenient way to examine the fetched changes is with the " master..origin " range notation :
$ git log master ..origin commit 3c54ac672ec1130b36837f1b708054a7a1d402de Author : Carl Worth < cworth@cworth.org >
Date : Fri Sep 28 12:50:16 2007 - 0700
Fixed the typo so the program actually compiles now .
Another helpful way of visualizing what happened with " git fetch " here is to run " gitk -- all " , which gives a graphical representation of all branches .
Here is what it would look like :
Notice that origin / master points to a single commit that was committed on top of the state pointed to by the " master " branch .
Let 's assume we are happy with the changes and we want to include them into our master branch .
To do this we simply run " git merge origin " :
$ git merge origin Updating a1a0e8b..3c54ac6
Fast forward hello.c | 2 +- 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-)
Again , you 'll see that this precisely matches the final portion of the output from " git pull " .
Using " git fetch " and " git merge " let us achieve exactly what " git pull " did , but we were able to stop in the middle to examine the situation , ( and we could have decided to reject the changes and not merge them --- leaving our master branch unchanged ) .
On merges and " fast forward "
You 'll notice that we 've been seeing the phrase " fast forward " several times .
This is a special - case operation performed by " git merge " where a branch can be advanced along a linear sequence .
This happens whenever you pull changes that build directly on top of the same commit you have as your most recent commit .
In other words , there was never any divergence or simultaneous commits created in parallel in multiple repositories .
If there had been parallel commits , then " git merge " would actually introduce a new merge commit to tie the two commits together .
When a non -fast - forward merge occurs , there is always the possibility that a conflict occurs .
In this case , " git merge " will leave conflict markers in the files and instruct you to resolve the conflicts .
When you are finished , you would issue a " git commit - a " to create the merge commit .
2.8.3 Using " git remote " to pull changes from other repositories
We 've already described how " git pull " will pull in changes from the repository which was the origin of the clone operation .
Git also provides excellent support for pulling changes from any other repository as well , ( distributed , rather than centralized development ) .
If you have a situation where you want to pull a single time from some repository , then you can simply give the path or URL of the repository on the " git pull " command line .
However , it 's often the case that if you want to pull changes from a repository once , you 'll want to pull changes from that same repository again in the future .
This is where the " git remote " notion is extremely useful --- it allows you to associate simple names , ( and behaviors ) , with remote repository URLs
We 've already seen one instance of " git remote " which is the creation of the " origin " remote which happens automatically during " git clone " .
Let 's now create another .
Let 's assume you are going to be working in the hello - remote repository and you 'd like to pull changes from the hello - pull repository , where your friend " fred " has been making changes .
Here 's how to setup the new remote :
$ cd ../ hello - remote $ git remote add fred ../hello-pull
So that 's a " git remote add " command line followed by an arbitrary name you 'd like for the new remote ( fred ) and the URL of the remote (../ hello- pull ) .
Obviously , the URL could be a git:// URL or any other git- supported URL in addition to a local path .
The " git remote " command is really just a helper for adding some entries to the .git / config file .
You might find it more convenient to edit that file directly once you get comfortable with things .
At this point the name " fred " will work much like the name " origin " has worked in previous examples .
For example , we can fetch the changes fred has made with " git fetch fred " :
$ git fetch fred remote : Generating pack ...
Unpacking 3 objects ... remote : Done counting 5 objects .
Result has 3 objects .
Deltifying 3 objects ... 100 % remote : ( 3/3 ) done Total 3 ( delta 1 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) 100 % ( 3/3 ) done * refs / remotes / fred / master : storing branch ' master ' of ../ hello-pull commit : 3c54ac6
Notice that this command - line only differs from the " git fetch " we did previously by explicitly naming which remote should be fetched .
We could have explicitly said " git fetch origin " earlier .
We can also list all known remote - tracking branches with " git branch - r " :
$ git branch -r fred / master origin / HEAD origin / master
These remote - tracking branches make it very easy to collaborate with people as they are working on experimental features not yet ready for upstream inclusion .
For example , if fred 's latest code is still trashing filesystems then he might not want to push it out to the project 's primary repository .
But he may still want my help with it .
So he can push it to a branch in his own repository for which I 've got a remote .
Then on my next " git fetch fred " I might notice a new branch called fred / trashes - filesystems and I can examine his code with a command such as " git log ..fred/trashed - filesystems " .
So lots of side collaboration can go on easily , and people working only with the primary repository never even have to see this dangerous code .
It 's distributed development at its finest .
2.8.4 Checking out previous revisions
It 's often useful to examine the working - tree state of some specific revision other than the tip of some branch .
For example , maybe you would like to build a particular tagged version , or maybe you 'd like to test the behavior of the code before a particular change was introduced .
To do this , use " git checkout " and pass it the name of any revision , ( with a branch name , a tag name , or any other commit identifier ) .
For example , to examine our project before the original typo was introduced :
$ git checkout 0a633bf5 Note : moving to " 0a633bf5 " which is n't a local branch
If you want to create a new branch from this checkout , you may do so ( now or later ) by using -b with the checkout command again .
Example : git checkout - b < new_branch_name > HEAD is now at 0a633 bf ...
Create a makefile
The note that git gives us is to indicate that we are checking out a non -branch revision .
This is perfectly fine if we are just exploring history , but if we actually wanted to use this revision as the basis for new commits , we would first have to create a new branch name as it describes .
If we were to use " git checkout " with a branch name , then that would change the current branch , ( meaning that any new commits would advance that branch pointer ) .
For now , let 's return back to the tip of the master branch by just checking it out again :
$ git checkout master Previous HEAD position was 0a633 bf ...
Create a makefile Switched to branch " master "
2.8.5 Pushing changes to another repository
As an unsurprising parallel to " git pull " , git also provides " git push " for pushing changes to another repository .
Now , generally the purpose of pushing to a repository is to have some " collaboration point " where potentially multiple people might be pushing or pulling .
Because there might be multiple people pushing into the repository at any point , it would n't make sense to have a working - directory associated with this repository .
For this , git has the notion of a " bare " repository , which is simply a repository with no working directory .
Let 's create a new bare repository and push some changes into it :
$ cd .. $ mkdir hello - bare $ cd hello - bare $ git -- bare init -- shared
The -- shared option sets up the necessary group file permissions so that other users in my group will be able to push into this repository as well .
Now lets return to our hello repository and push some changes to this new repository .
Since this is our very first push into this repository we need to tell git which branches to push .
The easiest way to do this is to use -- all to indicate all branches :
$ cd ../ hello $ git push ../ hello-bare -- all updating ' refs/heads/master ' from 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 to 3c54ac672ec1130b36837f1b708054a7a1d402de
Generating pack ...
Done counting 18 objects .
Deltifying 18 objects ... 100 % ( 18/18 ) done Writing 18 objects ... 100 % ( 18/18 ) done Total 18 ( delta 3 ) , reused 15 ( delta 2 ) Unpacking 18 objects ... 100 % ( 18/18 ) done refs/ heads / master : 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -> 3c54ac672ec1130b36837f1b708054a7a1d402de
For subsequent pushes we do n't need to specify -- all as " git push " by default pushes all branches that exist in both the local and remote repositories .
Also , as with pull , instead of explicitly specifying a URL , you may also specify a remote to push to .
And by default , after cloning a repository , " git push " with no other arguments will attempt to push back to the same origin repository .
As this is often exactly what is wanted , you may find that " git push " alone is often exactly what you need .
What happens if we try to pull or push changes and the receiving repository already has those changes ?
Nothing too exciting .
$ git push ../ hello - bare Everything up - to - date

Is there any point other than public relations in dispatching emergency field hospitals knowing they wo n't arrive in time to save lives that are in emergency situations ?
International donors want aid based on local needs but if only one third of needs assessments contain information about the local population or their health needs , is the humanitarian aid being applied effectively ?
The first academic thesis in Sweden on international health assistance in disaster zones shows that international assistance is often sent to disaster areas without any prior needs assessment having been made of the affected population .
Dr Johan von Schreeb has carried out needs assessments in a number of disaster situations .
He examined the need for international medical assistance after the terrorist action in a school in Beslan , Russia , in 2004 , and the low - intensity conflict in the Palestinian territories in 2002 .
He also studied the use of Foreign Field Hospitals in the natural ( sudden impact ) disaster zones of Bam ( Iran ) in 2003 , Haiti and Aceh ( Indonesia ) in 2004 and Pakistan ( Kashmir ) 2005 .
What he discovered was a lack of understanding of people ’s needs subsequent to the disaster and that international assistance takes inadequate account of existing resources .
International field hospitals specializing in life - saving trauma care were dispatched to four areas of natural disaster .
Not one arrived within the 48 hours in which lives could still be saved .
If appropriate assistance is to be provided , organizers need access to information about the disaster , the affected area , the size of the population , the socio-economic situation and the available local and regional resources .
International donors of humanitarian assistance have jointly decided to distribute the money on the basis of local needs .
There are well - described methods of making needs assessments , but the results are too rarely used .
One of Dr von Schreeb ’s sub-studies examined the extent to which Sida took account of needs assessments in its decisions to fund humanitarian health projects in 2003 .
Only one third of these decisions contained information about the size of the population to be helped or other factors reflecting their health needs .
“ My interpretation of this is that it ’s difficult to provide funding on the basis of needs , ” says Dr von Schreeb .
” Other procedures are needed for having needs govern funding decisions . ”
During his time as medical coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors without Borders ) in Kashmir , Dr von Schreeb was able to test a new rapid method of gathering needs assessment data in a disaster area .
After the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir , he interviewed people at health facilities .
His interviewees were geographically representative of the studied population , and the early estimated death and injury toll compared well with the results of a later study in which everyone living in the area was interviewed .
“ The interviews gave a good , immediate idea of what people needed – in this case to have their houses repaired before the winter , ” says Dr von Schreeb .

End view of the DZero detector , looking along the Tevatron beamline .
The event is highly likely to be from a single - top - quark decay to a W boson and b quark .
The W boson decayed to the muon and a neutrino , which escaped the detector without interacting , leaving an imbalance of the remaining energy ( shown as missing transverse energy ) .
The b quark produced one of the particle jets .
The second jet is from another particle produced at the same time as the top quark .

A group of 50 international physicists , led by UC Riverside ’s Ann Heinson , has detected for the first time a subatomic particle , the top quark , produced without the simultaneous production of its antimatter partner – an extremely rare event .
The discovery of the single top quark could help scientists better explain how the universe works and how objects acquire their mass , thereby assisting human understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe .
The heaviest known elementary particle , the top quark has the same mass as a gold atom and is one of the fundamental building blocks of nature .
Understood to be an ingredient of the nuclear soup just after the Big Bang , today the top quark does not occur naturally but must be created experimentally in a high - energy particle accelerator , an instrument capable of recreating the conditions of the early universe .
“ We ’ve been looking for single top quarks for 12 years , and until now no one had seen them , ” said Heinson , a research physicist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy .
“ The detection of single top quarks – we detected 62 in total – will allow us to study the properties of top quarks in ways not accessible before .
We are now able to study how the top quark is produced and how it decays .
Do these happen as theory says they should ?
Are new particles affecting what we see ?
We 're now better positioned to answer such questions . ”
This figure shows the total single top - quark production cross section measured by each of the three different analysis techniques applied to the DZero data sample .
The red dots indicate the measured values and the red lines represent the uncertainty on each measurement .
The blue band is the value predicted by the Standard Model .

The detection of the top quark on its own was the outcome of a time - consuming process involving hundreds of scientists who constitute the “ DZero ” collaboration , a team of experimenters studying the top quark in particle collisions .
For its part , Heinson ’s team first collected data from collision experiments conducted between 2002 and 2005 at the Tevatron Collider , the world ’s highest energy particle accelerator that is comprised of a four - mile long underground ring at the Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill .
The collisions recorded were those between protons and antiprotons ( the antimatter counterparts of protons ) .
Next , Heinson and her colleagues analyzed the record of high - energy collisions using powerful computers that helped the researchers determine which types of particles resulted from the collisions .
When a proton smashes head - on into an antiproton at nearly the speed of light , the collision occasionally produces a top quark .
This heavy , unstable particle exists , however , for only a tiny fraction of a second before it decays into lighter particles , thereby complicating its detection .
Physicists therefore must look at the top quark 's descendents to identify it .
“ We detected the top quark using the electronic signature of its decay products , ” said Heinson , the primary author of a research paper on the single top quark ’s detection that her group will submit to Physical Review Letters .
“ We measured the position of charged particles using a silicon vertex detector , which is an instrument – first encountered by the particles after the collision – that can precisely reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles .
Since theory predicts single top quark production , we knew what to look for .
It was extremely difficult , however , to find . ”
In the near future , Heinson ’s team plans to analyze more data generated by the Tevatron and also work with a new particle accelerator – the Large Hadron Collider – being built on the outskirts of Geneva , Switzerland , and scheduled to begin operation at the end of 2007 .

" While some have protested the international broadband penetration rankings , " Adelstein said , alluding to some of his colleagues at the Commission , " the fact is the U.S. has dropped year - after - year .
This downward trend and the lack of broadband value illustrate the sobering point that when it comes to giving our citizens affordable access to state - of the - art communications , the U.S. has fallen behind its global competitors . "
Copps called the lack of a national broadband policy " tantamount to playing Russian roulette with our future . "
" Each and every citizen of this great country should have access to the wonders of communications , " Copps said .
" I 'm not talking about doing all these people some kind of feel - good , do - gooder favor by including them .
I 'm talking about doing America a favor .
I 'm talking about making certain our citizens can compete here at home and around the world with those who are already using broadband in all aspects of their lives . "
I 've been telling everyone who will listen to buy Google -- it 's up 140 points since I wrote about it a month ago -- because it is more than an investment , it is a paradigm shift .
The quote , " what hath God wrought " comes from Numbers 23:23 , about the Israelites , but it was popularized by Samuel Morse when he sent it as the first message over the telegraph .
Others have described the typical fears of a Google world -- boiled down , essentially , to " everything gets saved , and everything can be searched . "
While true , there are nuances missing that are worth describing explicitly .
Buckle up .
First , four basics :
1. Google is more than search ; Adsense is much more than ads .
Google records every search you make -- time , date , which links you chose , time between clicks , etc .
It 's a relatively simple matter to piece together a profile of the user , even without knowing the identity of the user , which Google knows anyway .
But Google also has a general ability to know what websites you visit , independent of search .
See those Google Adsense ads ?
They 're javascript : every time the webpage loads , a request is sent to Google for the immediate creation of an ad , based on the contents of that page .
If that page sends a request , then Google knows that you are there , at that moment ; when you came , how long you stay , where you went next , etc .
And yes , the information is recorded without you clicking on the ad .
It is a technically easy process to follow an IP address across the internet , as it hits Adsense pages .
2. Google is the default backup of the internet .
Read that again .
Every page Google 's bots crawls is cached on their servers .
In other words , they have a copy of most pages on the internet .
You may try to delete something from the internet , but once Google saw it , it 's on their servers forever .
There is also considerable redundancy : if you upload a pic to your site , it is in Google 's cache , but also Google 's cache of anyone else who used your pic .
Here 's an example : there 's a story about a woman upset because the Google van ( which takes street level photos for use with their maps ) caught a picture of her cat in the window .
She wanted the picture removed .
Removed ?
From where ?
She does n't get it , she thinks Google has the photo paperclipped to the inside of a manila folder .
You can't remove it , it 's not a possession , you can't take it back -- it 's like the spoken word and the spent arrow , it is past tense .
It 's not just at Google Maps ; it is at BoingBoing , and at Google 's cache of BoingBoing ...
You know all those closed circuit cameras ?
Some of them are online .
Look , here are some , live .
Guess what ?
Now they 're on Google , too .
3a . Google is an accidental monopoly ...
People complained that Microsoft forced people to use their products by linking them with other products .
For example , Internet Explorer was the browser because it came with Windows .
Google , however , can't help being the end product of the internet .
Consider email : you can choose to use Yahoo !
Mail and not GMail because you are worried that Google keeps all Gmails .
Fine ; but if you email to someone with GMail , Google stores a copy and knows what you wrote , but now also knows your IP and email address ; consequently , it knows other sites you 've visited .
Etc .
Imagine the post office copied every letter it handled , and could cross reference the contents of those letters with other databases : calendar ; credit card / online purchases , physical location , etc. Scary ?
Now imagine that the post office housed those databases .
3b. ... that can not die .
Everyone worries about Google 's growth , but who is worrying about its demise ?
Google has so much data that it actually takes up real estate all over the world .
Let 's say Google goes out of business .
Who gets all those servers ?
All that data ?
Who gets a copy of the world , on the cheap ?
Whoever it is does n't have to give us satellite photos anymore .
What can you do with satellite photos that no one else has ?
Who gets to decide how to control all that data ?
4. Do n't Be Evil .
Well , okay , that 's good advice , I guess , but what happens when the subpoenas come ?
Or the Russians invade ?
Or the Chinese commandeer / hack Google servers -- some of which are actually in China ?
Discussions about the legal aspects of privacy aside , if something exists , it can be found .
Even if it 's just a disgruntled organ donor at the Googleplex who decides to fork over terabytes of data to the highest bidder .
An organization -- a security organization -- is only as strong as the weakest person .
Go to the Googleplex and park your car .
Do you see any potential weak links ?
I sure do .
As a quick example of how crippling this information can be : Google has recorded the surfing habits of every employee of Microsoft , including Bill Gates .
And of two Presidents .
And the Pope .
The Missing Piece
The above three are well known , if maybe a little paranoid .
But what is so important , and never discussed , is this : Google will be around for another 100 years .
At least .
So when I say that it knows everything , it knows everything across time .
It does n't just have insights into your character ; it has insights into your character as you age , and the character of your family line .
Social Ramifications :
Used to be , " on the internet , no one knows you 're a dog . "
Well , now everyone knows .
But worse , there 's no hierarchy of identity .
You may think you 're Chariman of Oncology who occasionally played World of Warcraft 7 years ago .
But if a Google search reveals 10 hits about WoW , and only one of being a doctor , then guess what ?
You 're a nut .
The narcissism I always refer to is characterized by a vital need to self - identify .
You want to pick an identity , and you want others to accept it even in the absence of facts or behavior .
" I read Hegel , I 'm an intellectual . "
No , you 're a coffeehouse agitator .
I can tell by the undershirt .
What Google has done is to make this self - identification impossible .
Before , you could be exposed only if someone took the time and effort to background check you .
Soon -- hell , now -- it will require no effort .
When the brooding artist - type you met at Starbucks calls you up to deride romantic comedies , inauthentic japanese food , and Ambercrombie and Fitch , but your cell phone shows you a picture of his ( read : parent 's ) house in Irvine , well , that pretty much ends that , does n't it ?
Apparently , incoming college freshmen already know their future classmates through Facebook .
Worse : the parents know their kids ' future classmates .
Remember the clean start college gave you ?
Well , forget it .
Parenting :
The focus is on who is monitoring our children .
What are they up to ?
Well , think about this : your kids are investigating you .
Remember that time when your mom was 19 and she was in that wet t- shirt contest ?
No ?
Well , your kids will get to remember yours in AVI format .
Oh , and that DUI conviction ?
Remember that vapid comment you posted on the Daily Kos ?
( Hint : ten years from now a high school freshman will cringe at its inanity . )
And , lo , the IP address search .
How did your IP end up on pornotron.org ?
( Yes , the non-profit . )
Did you realize that your future daughter in law will be checking you out ?
" Billy , did you know eight years ago your Dad ...? "
This did n't occur to you ?
Then I guess it did n't occur to you that your son's reply will be , " Sigh .
Yeah .
I knew . "
( As an aside , the very fact that you are surprised by the possibility that your kids are googling you is evidence of the cultural narcissism I 'm always referring to .
You are the parent , your child is yours , you monitor and control it -- it does n't occur to you that they can exert the same power over you . )
Parenting has always required a degree of acting .
You can't be an effective parent if there is not at least the illusion of moral superiority ; children rely on an unchanging moral stance to be able to test limits and to establish a superego .
While it is n't a disaster that your kid knows you smoked pot in high school , it does n't help .
But it is a far worse when your kid learns it without your contextualization .
Consider : " Son , I smoked pot , but ... " vs. reading an email when you were 20 where you recommend it to a girl you 're trying to bed ...
Google compresses time .
What you did might feel like it was a long time ago , but your kids " experience " that memory immediately .
Additionally , they are raised in a world where the past never disappears , so they do not connect with your language of " a long time ago . "
For this reason , identity will be fixed at an earlier age .
Look deeply into your childrens ' faces .
You will never remember them as well , as accurately , as they remember you .
Medicine :
It 's beyond me that no one else has mentioned this .
Google wants to set up a system for online medical records , so that they can be " transported " -- accessed by all the various medical providers in your life .
This is not even great in theory .
First , does anyone remember the Seinfeld episode where Elaine gets labeled in the chart as a problem patient ?
And every time she tries to change doctors , the chart follows her , and she can't get anyone to work with her ?
Let me assure you that in psychiatry this already happens even without the chart .
If you want to ensure a two tiered system of medicine , enact medical record portability .
Next , medical records will thus be searchable , like GMail .
See all those Zoloft ads ?
Guess why .
Think drug reps know too much about doctors prescribing habits ?
How about how they will know the demographic characteristics -- diagnoses x epidemiology x financial status x etc -- of the patients he treats ?
But the worst is this : genomics .
It 's not too far away that doctors will be running genetic tests as often as they run CBCs .
Where is that going to be recorded ?
Imagine that your DNA can be cross referenced with your surfing habits .
And your kids ' DNA with your surfing habits .
Imagine the preposterous world where Google " Adsense " predicts what products your kids might be interested in based on your life cycle ... ( Update : 23andMe . )
Here 's a scary , sad , non-porn example : " Mom , why am I getting so many ads for breast cancer prevention ? "
Think how good a Google search is using only a few keywords .
There is no reason why Google can't suggest to you state of the art , or at least evidence based , treatments , tailored as well as possible to the information in your medical records .
So much for doctors .
At best they retain their importance as diagnosticians .
( Oh , and how much more accurate if the Google medical records happen to link up to your numerous emails that begin , " oh my God , I was so wasted last night ... " )
Look , people , I 'm not saying Google will do it ; I 'm saying that it is no additional effort at all to do it .
Memory
You know the hippocampus ?
You wo n't need it where we 're going .
Memory takes practice .
I can remember the phone number of almost everyone I meet , because I practiced that skill .
Most people are the opposite , however , because they directly dial much less often .
Same with my calendar ( in my head vs. PDA . )
And if you do n't remember someone 's phone or address , you can always google him .
I do n't know anyone who quotes whole passages from books anymore .
Very few even know any poems .
Pretty soon , we wo n't be so great at memorizing 10 digits at a time ; or directions ; or names .
This is n't a bad or good thing , but it will be different .
Factual memory will be less important than " feeling , " " experience . "
" That was an awesome party . "
Yeah , who was at it ?
" Hold on a second , I 'll tell you exactly ... "
Soon , you wo n't need to remember anything about " him . "
You want to call him ?
Say , " call that guy , red hair , worked at the gas station ... " and he 'll answer .
Here 's a crazy idea : that guy walking towards you that you do n't remember ?
His " device " -- cell phone / PDA / GPS / brain implant signals your device , and instantly not only do you now remember who he is , but you know a lot of other stuff about him you did n't know before .
Solid .
General facts will no longer be rehearsed , learned , because they can be immediately accessed .
I do n't mean go - to - your - laptop - and - search immediately , I mean wristwatch , or earpiece , or contact lens immediately .
( A propos of testing : multiple choice has to vanish .
All education now has to be essay . )
Not just that , but access will be faster .
Question : how important is it to prevent memory loss in dementia , when they can access the memory instantly ?
So recall ( e.g. Ach ? ) wo n't be important : processing skills ( DA and Glut ? ) will be important .
Maybe that 's a good thing .
Mobile Search
I know , it 's about target ads .
Ok .
What do you have when you have infinite storage capabilities , and voice recognition search software ( e.g. , Google 411 ) ?
You have a permanent database of everyone 's voice .
Across time , under different circumstances .
Across generations .
And always tagged with all your other information .
So when Google hears your voice through someone else 's phone while on vacation in France , or on a CCTV , or whatever -- it can helpfully say , " oh , that 's Bill , he likes cooking and Asian porn , let me send him some targeted ads ! "
It 's Taking Over The World , You May As Well Profit From It
A lot of people think Google , at 620 , is overvalued .
They 're not just wrong , they are casualties .
It has a $ 200 b market cap ; it has $ 13 b in cash , and no debt .
It grosses $ 6 b in profits a year , margins of 30 % , and it 's growing at 30 % a year .
It has time on its side .
I 've long argued we are moving towards feudalism , away from national governments .
Google is already gunning for the top spot .
Oh , I know , Google is just a big advertising company .
That has satellite photos of the entire world that they artificially worsen because the U.S. Government does n't think you should be allowed to have it .
What saves us , today , is that Google is a relatively small company run , really , by three people .
But if it grows too big - if it becomes like an oil company , with tentacles into politics and world affairs and everything else -- in other words , if it becomes a lord -- you can just change the motto from " Do n't Be Evil " to " Do n't Be a Sucker . "
And then look out .
( long GOOG , obviously . )
Here is my fifth entry in my series on US Cities .
Using 2000 Census data I have mapped % of people living in poverty in the Seattle metropolitan area .
you can find the original interactive map at Social Explorer Choose " Poverty " from the second drop down , then select the magnifying glass to zoom in on Seattle .
For reference , I am including a Google map of Seattle .
You can use this map just like the regular Google map and close the white message box .
Competitors from across the country and the United States tested their nimble fingers at the inaugural Rubik 's Cube Canadian Open tournament .
More than 50 twisted participants squared off at the " speed cubing " event at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto on Saturday .
A 19 - year - old student from the University of Southern California broke a world record by solving the Rubik 's Cube in one minute and 15 seconds -- while blindfolded .
The Canadian record for solving the classic three - by - three cube is just 11.15 seconds .
Dave Campbell is the current record holder for one - handed cubing , having solved one in just 24 seconds .
The Canadian who solved the multi-coloured coloured cube in the fastest time on Saturday will represent the nation at the world Rubik 's Cube championship in Budapest , Hungary , in October .
That person is Harris Chan , 13 , who said the world - famous puzzle is addictive .
" Once I get home and tried , I just kept on doing it , " the Thornhill resident said .
Actually , there 's a Cube - a - Holics Anonymous group to help such people .
If Chan was n't addicted , however , he might not have been able to solve the three - by - three cube in 14.21 seconds .
The Lau sisters of Toronto also competed for finger - flying supremacy .
" We do that instead of studying , which is n't the best idea , but it 's definitely really addictive , " said Kristen , 19 .
" She was interested in the cubing and then she got me cubing , so I 'm interested in it as well , " said younger sister Janice , 16 .
Kristen , a physics and math major at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y. , said solving the cube is n't about how smart you are , " it 's just how your recognition ( is ) . "
Added Janice : " And how fast your fingers are . "
Both say that perseverance is another important quality in successful cubers .
Hungarian professor Erno Rubik invented the cube in 1974 as a teaching aid for his design classes .
The Rubik 's Cube was first commercially launched in 1980 .
It is the best - selling toy or game ever , with more than 300 million cubes sold worldwide .

In 1987 , Canadian photographer Robin Collyer began documenting houses that are n't houses at all – they 're architecturally - disguised electrical substations , complete with windows , blinds , and bourgeois landscaping .
" During the 1950s and 1960s , " Collyer explains in a recent issue of Cabinet Magazine , " the Hydro - Electric public utilities in the metropolitan region of Toronto built structures known as ' Bungalow - Style Substations . '
These stations , which have transforming and switching functions , were constructed in a manner that mimics the style and character of the different neighborhoods . " [ Images : Robin Collyer ] .
Simulacra meant to reflect how it looks to be domestic and Canadian , " there are about 100 of these structures located on residential streets in the central and the suburban parts of the greater Toronto area . "
Pictured here are only five of them .
So if you live in suburban Toronto and your neighbor 's house is humming – perhaps now you know what 's really going on inside .
Meanwhile , the address 555 Spadina – i.e. the third image , above – shows up in this list of 322 properties owned by the city of Toronto .
If anyone out there knows something about the other 321 buildings , be in touch !

Sen . Joseph Lieberman , chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee , says that he has no intention of investigating Blackwater USA and other government contractors who have been accused of criminal action .
Lieberman said he gets “ angry when I hear about fraud or corruption in the spending of American dollars , ” but “ You ’ve got to set your own priorities , and it was clear to me that other committees were going to pick this up . ”
Where I come from , the alleged murder of seventeen people is not classified as “ fraud ” or “ corruption , ” but Lieberman sees it another way .
His counterpart in the House of Representatives , Rep. Henry Waxman , is holding hearings on the Blackwater incident .
“ LET ’S start with Act IV , No. 51 , ” Leon Botstein , the conductor , says after bringing the rehearsal to order .
“ The happy ending . ”
He lifts his hand , and mournful violin notes begin , signaling Romeo ’s arrival at Juliet ’s grave and his glimpse of her seemingly lifeless body .
But soon a slow pulsing of harp and strings is heard — inhalations and exhalations — as Juliet starts to breathe .
A melody that accompanied her first appearance , carried by the glockenspiel and flute , returns , followed by the silvery sound of tinkling bells and shimmering chimes that land like a sprinkle of fairy dust .
The pace then quickens in a joyful scherzo with clicking castanets and plucked strings , as Romeo and Juliet embrace and go off together .
A happy ending , for real .
The members of the American Symphony Orchestra who were in the south hall of Riverside Church on a recent crisp autumn afternoon had gathered not only for a rehearsal but also for a premiere of sorts .
The score — the original version of “ Romeo and Juliet ” that Sergei Prokofiev wrote in 1935 , just as Stalin ’s Great Purge was gaining momentum — had never before been performed .
“ It ’s a great thrill , ” Erica Kiesewetter , the concertmaster of the American Symphony and a member of the American Ballet Theater orchestra , said during a break .
The heady buzz of revealing an unknown masterwork has infected everyone , she said .
ABC investigates veterans charities that mostly enrich their owners David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Since the start of the Iraq War , the number of charity groups promising to help injured veterans has mushroomed , but not all of them actually fulfill those promises .
According to ABC News , Americans have so far donated $ 475 million to veterans charities that get a failing grade from the American Institute of Philanthropy .
Institute President Daniel Borochoff told ABC , " Under 35 % of your budget on actual bona fide charitable programs will get you an F grade . "
Thirteen out of 27 military and veterans charities reviewed by the Institute did not meet that standard , and one was found to spend as little as 2 % of its receipts on program services .
Meanwhile , some of the people running the F - rated charities are getting rich .
For example , Roger Chapin , founder of Help Hospitalized Veterans , pays himself and his wife more than $ 500,000 a year , while only 31 % of the $ 70 million he took in last year actually went to help hospitalized veterans .
Chapin , described by Daniel Borochoff as " a charity entrepreneur , " has founded more than a dozen such charities over the past three decades .
Paul Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America told ABC , " Veterans are not a place to make a buck .
...
If you 're not serious about being in the business of helping veterans , go find something else to do . "
Republican Sen. Charles
Grassley is also outraged and is looking for some way to crack down on these groups .
Forbes Magazine has looked more deeply into Chapin 's operations and recently revealed that his " campaign was orchestrated by firms associated with political operative and longtime Chapin buddy Richard Viguerie . "
Viguerie is the grandfather of all such direct - mail fundraising operations , going back to his activities on behalf of right - wing causes in the 1960's , and has mentored many of those who have gone into the business since .
These operations have periodically come under scrutiny because of their use of emotionally - charged appeals , lack of public accountability , and tendency to spend a large percentage of their receipts on fundraising and administration , leaving little to benefit the people or causes in whose name they operate .
However , they remain not only legal but unregulated , leaving watchdog groups like Borochoff 's to fill the gap .

From my experience , people who attack libertarians such as Ron Paul are often not serious about ideas .
I have noticed the individuals who deride Dr. Paul do so mostly with shallow and dishonest attacks .
Take the various socialists and welfare - statists who attack Ron Paul .
I understand they support nationalizing healthcare while generally being against the occupation of Iraq .
Because they oppose the occupation , they should find a powerful ally in someone as principally opposed to it as Ron Paul .
Take also the neoconservatives in the mass ( minded ) media such as Faux News who attack and omit Dr. Paul .
I understand they support the occupation of the Middle East but also believe government should be strictly limited in accordance with traditional conservative ideas ( right ? right ??? ) .
In Ron Paul , they have a great opportunity to highlight these at least rhetorical parallels while simultaneously expressing reasonable disagreements .
Because of these considerations , I believe it reasonable to expect a certain amount of give and take among the three camps , if only for practical reasons .
What I have experienced instead has been a surreal and dishonest two - front attack against Ron Paul .
No argument seems to be too trivial or irrelevant for the anti-Paulians to make .
They seem to be bringing up every possible issue ( real or imagined ) against Ron Paul in the hopes something — anything — will stick .
Consider :
While the President gets dictatorial power to spy on and indefinitely kidnap innocent Americans , socialists and neocons speculate wildly about Ron Paul supporters “ spamming ” internet polls .
While thousands of men , women , and children violently die in Iraq and Afghanistan , socialists and neocons misrepresent Ron Paul ’s refusal to fund stem cell research .
While the Bush administration plots to drop nuclear weapons on Iran , socialists and neocons spin every single Ron Paul victory to be meaningless or nonexistent .
While people suffer without healthcare because government intervention makes it unaffordable to the poor , socialists and neocons distort a decade - old mishap Ron Paul had with one of his previous ghostwriters .
Where they manage to attack Dr. Paul 's ideas directly , they do so with increasingly ineffective arguments .
Consider further :
While the Constitution is trashed and mocked by all three branches , socialists and neocons talk about how Ron Paul ’s message of rule of law is anachronistic .
While government at all levels rob the people blind , socialists and neocons sneer at Ron Paul 's suggestion to get rid of the Federal income tax .
While the American economy further implodes due to the boom and bust cycle created by the Federal Reserve , socialists and neocons talk about how Ron Paul ’s anti-Fed proposals are “ irrelevant . "
While the prices of essential goods dramatically increase via inflation , socialists and neocons talk about how Ron Paul ’s hard - money ideas are unrealistic .
While Ron Paul educates Americans on economics , socialists and neocons spread discredited Keynesian and Marxist myths which undermine liberty and prosperity .
While Ron Paul plans to help reintegrate America with the world through peaceful trade and foreign policy , socialists and neocons smear him as “ isolationist . "
While Ron Paul gains more supporters every day , socialists and neocons criticize his lack of name recognition in land - line phone polling — yet at the same time groan about how fanatical and pervasive his supporters are …
Something is n’t right .
There is honest disagreement , and then there is demagoguery .
There is mutual respect , and then there is mud-slinging .
I cannot name one person who Dr. Paul has disparaged as badly as most of his critics see fit to disparage him .
This says a lot about all said parties involved .
What is it then about Ron Paul that inspires such fevered attacks ?
I will say what I believe .
I believe the battle for freedom takes place not only in the upcoming election , but also in the arena of ideas .
In this arena , I believe Ron Paul 's message is more powerful than any political shenanigans that can be put against him .
I believe also the embittered detractors have good reason to be up in arms .
With every Ron Paul victory , they have found their intellectual weaponry to be unexpectedly brittle and ineffective against the message of freedom .

Consensus is an equilibrium statement , but equilibrium is non-existent in reality .
There is the obvious problem of new information constantly disrupting the market .
More importantly , the market contains a hidden , complex structure of players :
The observations below represents Shunyata 's opinions based on his study of commodity derivatives to protect his personal interests .
Commodity derivatives are exceedingly complicated , and his direct expertise is with respect to financial derivatives .
This post is not intended to represent investment advice .
This is a guest post by Shunyata .
Shunyata is a manager of financial derivatives with training in financial engineering , actuarial science , statistics , and mechanical engineering .
While he does not work directly with commodity markets , his background in financial engineering gives him insight into the operation of oil markets that may be helpful .
The existence of discrete blocks of players who act in different trading volumes executed over different time scales guarantees that prices will deviate significantly from fundamentals and suffer unexpected corrections .
From a theoretical standpoint , you can find these ideas in Sornette , Why Markets Crash : Critical Events in Complex Financial Systems .
From an eminently pragmatic standpoint you can find these ideas in Taleb , Dynamic Hedging : Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options
Even in equilibrium market consensus does not hold for derivatives .
Futures Contracts - Introduction
A common derivative is the futures contract where , loosely speaking , we agree that at a specified future date you will give me one unit of something ( a unit of the S& P500 , a barrel of oil , etc. ) at the ‘ future ’ price we set today .
Because this agreement deals with a specific date , we talk of a ‘ futures curve ’ that shows the exchange price people are agreeing to for exchanges occurring today ( this is also called the spot price ) , one or three months from now ( this is also called the front contract ) , six months from now , etc .
And , being standardized contracts , futures are typically defined only out to five or ten years .
( Savvy readers will note there is a bit of hand - waving here but the intuition reasonable .
For a more complete discussion of commodity futures contracts and quoting conventions see Geman , Commodities and Commodity Derivatives ) .
Replication Cost as a Driver of Futures Costs
Stepping away from the complexity of commodities for a minute , consider the agreement to exchange one unit of the S&P500 on a specific day three months from now at a specified ‘ futures ’ price .
Interestingly , the price of this transaction has virtually nothing to do with the consensus expectation of S&P500 levels three - months from now !
Why ?
I can borrow money , buy the item today , hand it over tomorrow , and use the money you give me to pay off my loan .
I just need to make sure the future price we agree to pays off my loan .
Then the whole thing is a zero - sum game .
( Clearly this is theory .
In reality the smaller fish lose a little bit every time . )
This mechanic is called market replication and replication cost is a pivotal driver in any future or derivative price .
( See Baxter and Rennie , Financial Calculus : An Introduction to Derivative Pricing for an approachable introduction to the theory of replication .
But be forewarned that there is a lot of artistic praxis involved as well . )
If we think through this mechanic , we can see that futures should be more expensive than the current spot price because that loan has to be paid back with interest .
In fact , you can see this lock - step replication cost linkage between today ’s S&P500 level and the price of S&P500 futures .
Figure 1 : Mechanical Link Between Spot and Futures Price for S&P 500
In short , the ability to replicate derivatives ( the work of so - called Wall Street Rocket Scientists ) guarantees that all prices are self - consistent , and perhaps all equally delusional .
Put another way , replication works to keep RELATIVE prices all self - consistent , but the ABSOLUTE LEVEL of prices is completely driven by fear / greed , supply / demand , etc .
It is n’t anchored by anything except willingness or unwillingness to speculate .
Couple that with the market structure issues noted above and any notion of consensus is out the window .
Difference Between Commodity Futures and Financial Futures
As if all of this were n’t complicated enough , commodities such as oil are significantly different from securities like stock shares , and it is very important to remember this .
Commodities are consumables ; new units of commodities are produced , delivered to the marketplace for exchange , and then destroyed ( hopefully to produce something of value ) .
This creates an entirely different dynamic than a stock market where the same pot of IBM shares is effectively around today and five years from now .
A commodity futures contract is an agreement involving a unit that may not even exist today !
Consensus Oil Price
It is important to understand that nationalized corporations and government entities control much of the world ’s oil production ( think Aramco , Pemex , etc. ) and consumption ( think the Air Force , strategic petroleum reserve , etc. ) .
This means that there can be sudden and profound upsets to the production / consumption flow of the dynamic pot of commodity units .
As such it seems that oil futures might be more linked to consensus - but consensus about what ?
There are three elements here :
• Cost to produce ,
• Ability to deliver , and
• Demand for the product .
Who exactly is controlling the production / consumption flow ?
And who , therefore , is controlling the price ?
1. Historically , the cost to ‘ stick a straw in the ground ’ has been quite low so oil prices have been quite low .
However , as more straws are required , are harder to stick in , or harder to locate , we should expect futures prices to rise .
2. Commodities are exchanged at specific physical locations .
Bottlenecks getting material into and / or out of these specific locations can cause counter - intuitive price dislocations for contracts specifying exchange at these locations .
( This is why we talk about Brent Crude , WTI Crude , etc .
And obviously physical bottlenecks are n’t a problem for an electronically designated share of IBM stock . )
These distribution bottlenecks are part of the reason why Cushing ( Oklahoma ) oil has historically traded at a premium to Brent ( UK ) .
Infrastructure restrictions made it difficult to move desired quantities through the system so that local buyers were forced to pay a premium to obtain the availably supply .
For a discussion of this see this article .
3 . Finally , if substitutes are available , significant price increases can create permanent alterations in demand .
This will tend to hold futures prices lower .
Replication cost is also a consideration , but historically it has been much more expensive to purchase oil today , store it securely , and deliver it at the settlement date compared to producing it and directly delivering .
When replication is n’t practically feasible , then consensus has the ability to drive price .
We just need to figure out whether production , distribution , or consumption is in control .
( In the future , however , if lower levels of production are more proportionate to storage capacity and cost , replication cost may become more important and moderate the impact of consensus . )
How Do Oil Futures Actually Behave ?
So how do futures prices actually behave in the market ?
Can we tell who is driving the price and what does this tell us about our spot on the Peak Oil timeline ?
Of course no one really knows and the trinity of supply , delivery , and demand makes it difficult to decipher what is driving futures prices .
Furthermore , our ability to construct a posteriori explanations is limitless , rather like seeing animals , faces , etc. in cloud patterns .
Nonetheless , let ’s see what we can divine .
Oil futures prices are usually LOWER than today ’s purchase price .
Sellers usually agree to sell their oil tomorrow for less than it is selling today .
This situation is called ‘ backwardation ’ of futures prices .
This pattern is shown in Figure 2 below .
Prices tend to decline between early contract dates and later contract dates .
Figure 2 : West Texas Intermediate Oil Futures Curve as of August 31 , 2007
So why should future production generally trade at a discount to today ’s oil ?
Does n’t this imply that oil will be MORE plentiful in the future ?
The most common speculation is that the futures market is driven by producers who are willing to pay an ‘ insurance premium ’ to guarantee future revenue .
Presumably producers have been worried about prices dropping below current levels , or even below their production costs , and have been eager to “ pre-sell ” at acceptable prices negotiated today .
And there is some historical evidence that this view has historically controlled prices .
If prices drop sufficiently below production costs , then buying oil and delivering later is feasible , replication should dominate prices , and futures should trade at a premium to current price .
This is exactly what we see historically .
Upward sloping futures curves only occur at the deepest dips in oil prices .
This is illustrated from in Figure 9.6 from Geman , Commodities and Commodity Derivatives .
Interestingly , the market level at which dips trigger upward sloping yields curves has risen over time .
It would be interesting to know what linkage there is between these increasing levels and increasing production cost .
Perhaps some readers have this information at their disposal ?
Oil Futures Prices Under Peak Oil
Under peak oil , we would expect to see more upward sloping futures prices ( sometimes called contango ) , even when there are not price dips .
Under peak oil , the market will probably be driven by the demand side so that prices will tend to stay far above production costs ( unless governments begin interfering too heavily , insisting upon affordability and protecting economic growth ) .
And consequently discounted futures prices ( backwardation ) suggest that the producers are in control and all is well with the world … unless production costs are rising faster than the overall price of oil .
Then producers would still seek “ insurance ” even as oil costs went through the roof and we should be worried indeed .
On the other hand , upward sloping futures curves ( contango ) clearly indicate that the producers are out of control -- the condition we would expect to see with Peak Oil .
In 2004 /2005 the futures curve became very steeply backwardated implying that market that producers were willing to pay a large premium to lock in pricing .
Subsequently , however , the curve has flattened out dramatically even as we reach new spot price highs .
Since production costs have n’t been coming down and market volatility has n’t been coming down ( so that producers are no longer concerned about buying insurance ) , we have a strong indication that demand is beginning to rule the roost .
Of course we do n’t know whether demand is getting the upper hand due to demand growth or supply contraction .
But I ’m not sure I care .
Being the hedonistic type , Peak Availability to Me Personally is all that matters – and it looks as if it is here .
It will be interesting to see whether the price of long dated futures continues its trend toward contango and confirms my fears .
Hedging
So what can I do to protect myself over the long term ?
For non-commodity derivatives we showed that the replication concept is like a traffic cop keeping spot prices and futures prices in a fairly consistent pattern of relationships ( … except when they occasionally depart dramatically and we seem surprised ) .
And in this setup , hedging is quite feasible because I know the value of my futures portfolio will move in lock - step with current prices .
( The discerning reader will note a slight gloss - over here but the intuition is accurate . )
For commodities , however , this self - enforced consistency is much weaker , and hedging is a more tenuous prospect unless one is content only hedging the next three months of consumption .
The linkage between long - dated futures and spot prices is erratic indeed .
As an individual , I may be willing to commit my capital to erratic , long - dated futures just so I have the insurance .
For corporations , however , this noise makes quarterly earnings reports messy and no one is interested in that .
Instead they buy their insurance one quarter at a time .
And like the homeowner who waits until he smells smoke to purchase insurance ( he pays a hefty premium ) , corporations will find themselves completely exposed when the conflagration gets really underway .
A useful introduction to energy hedging may be found in Eydeland and Wolyniec , Energy and Power Risk Management : New Developments in Modeling , Pricing , and Hedging , although the presentation tends toward the academic side .
Figure 3 shows volume for Oct. 3 , 2007 by contract date to December 2012 using data from barchart.com .
( There is also a small volume of contracts to 2015 , not shown on this graph . )
There is virtually no trading volume for settlement dates beyond 2008 !
The Role of Hedge Funds in Oil Futures
There has been a lot of speculation about the role of hedge funds on futures prices .
The presence of hedge funds and other speculative buyers will tend to drive large scale cycles of buying and selling , and create increased market volatility , irrespective of the commodity itself .
It seems to me , though , that the level of today ’s oil is largely governed by production and use rather than speculation - volatility levels just have n’t increased all that much .
If so , then either production costs are near $ 70 or demand for oil significantly outstrips available supply ( or some combination thereof ) .
In either case peak oil , global modernization , and population growth should force oil to continue its current upward trend until there is significant demand destruction ( recession , the poor stop buying , pandemic , etc. ) or an alternative is found ( the Physics is rather stacked against this ) .
It would be nice to back up the hedge fund picture with hard data .
To the best of my knowledge , however , this data is unavailable and any analysis is largely anecdotal .
Hedge funds are extremely secretive and go to great lengths to hide their trading activity .
An entertaining view into this world may be found in Lowenstein , When Genius Failed : The Rise and Fall of Long - Term Capital Management .
Impact of Peak Oil Availability on Other Markets
We should say something about the cross - linkage between oil and all other economic activity .
Cell phones and iPods and did n’t arise solely from someone ’s good idea ; they arise from plastics , metals , and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes – all of which require vast amounts of energy to produce and function .
And we are n’t just talking about luxury items .
The energy density of ammonia fertilizer is roughly 50 % greater than gasoline !
( Do you remember the Oklahoma City bombing ? )
If energy supply is curtailed , agriculture is horribly exposed and Malthus will have the last laugh .
Finally , as we seek substitutes for fossil energy , we have linked the price of corn and sugar ( and by displacement beef , milk , and all non-corn crops ) directly to oil .
I am reminded of the trader ’s rule of thumb - in a blowup all correlations go to unity .
This means that once Peak Availability hits , there can be no safe haven .
No wonder I sleep so poorly …
It turns out that supermodel Gisele Bundchen is n't siding with Warren Buffett as a U.S. dollar bear after all , her manager tells CNBC .
This morning a Bloomberg story got picked up by several news outlets , including Warren Buffett Watch , reporting that Bundchen had asking to be paid in euros rather than dollars due to uncertainty about the U.S. currency 's future .
That would have put her in the same camp as Buffett , who 's been bearish on the dollar for awhile now .
But just a few minutes ago , CNBC Squawk Box producer Stephanie Landsman spoke by telephone with Anne Nelson , Bundchen 's manager .
Nelson tells us reports that Gisele wants to be paid in euros are " false . "
Nelson 's take : " Some idiot in Brazil reported something just to make news . "
Nelson points out that Gisele lives in New York City , and thus needs U.S. dollars for her big-city lifestyle .
Of course , anyone who disagrees with Warren Buffett 's investment wisdom does so at their own risk .
But we have to think Gisele gets enough U.S. dollars that she can absorb any potential weakness against the Euro and avoid giving the unfortunate impression that she is negative about the United States in any way .
After all , even Warren Buffett would n't turn down U.S. dollars , if there are enough of them .

So when indignant officials at the Dutch foreign ministry received an email from a group of Israeli journalists that began , " Helloh bud , enclosed five of the questions in honor of the foreign minister :
The mother your visit in Israel is a sleep to the favor or to the bed your mind on the conflict are Israeli Palestinian , " they might perhaps have guessed what had happened .
Sadly , they did not .
Nor did the follow - up questions ( " Why we did not heard on mutual visits of main the states of Israel and Holland , this is in the country of this " and " What in your opinion needs to do opposite the awful the Iranian of Israel " ) enlighten them .
And now , according to the Jerusalem Post , the aforementioned journalists ' planned fact - finding trip to the Netherlands as guests of the Dutch government is in jeopardy .
" How could this email possibly have been sent ? " an anguished Israeli diplomat asked the paper .
" These journalists have sparked a major , major incident . "
Blame Babel Fish , bud : it mistakes the Hebrew word for " if " ( ha'im ) for the Hebrew word for " mother " ( ha'ima ) , and reckons " the Dome of the Rock " can reasonably be rendered in English as " bandages of the knitted domes " .
So let that be a lesson to you .
Or , as Babel Fish would have it in German , " Lassen Sie so einfach , daß eine Lektion zu Ihnen seien Sie . "
Which apparently means : " Leave so simple that a lesson to you are you . "
Amazing , the internet .

Global inequality in consumption , while reducing , is still high .
Using latest figures available , in 2005 , the wealthiest 20 % of the world accounted for 76.6 % of total private consumption .
The poorest fifth just 1.5 % : Breaking that down slightly further , the poorest 10 % accounted for just 0.5 % and the wealthiest 10 % accounted for 59 % of all the consumption :
In 1995 , the inequality in consumption was wider , but the United Nations also provided some eye - opening statistics ( which do not appear available , yet , for the later years ) worth noting here :
Today ’s consumption is undermining the environmental resource base .
It is exacerbating inequalities .
And the dynamics of the consumption - poverty - inequality - environment nexus are accelerating .
If the trends continue without change — not redistributing from high - income to low - income consumers , not shifting from polluting to cleaner goods and production technologies , not promoting goods that empower poor producers , not shifting priority from consumption for conspicuous display to meeting basic needs — today ’s problems of consumption and human development will worsen . …
The real issue is not consumption itself but its patterns and effects .
…
Inequalities in consumption are stark .
Globally , the 20 % of the world ’s people in the highest - income countries account for 86 % of total private consumption expenditures — the poorest 20 % a minuscule 1.3 % .
More specifically , the richest fifth : Consume 45 % of all meat and fish , the poorest fifth 5 %
Consume 58 % of total energy , the poorest fifth less than 4 %
Have 74 % of all telephone lines , the poorest fifth 1.5 %
Consume 84 % of all paper , the poorest fifth 1.1 %
Own 87 % of the world ’s vehicle fleet , the poorest fifth less than 1 % Runaway growth in consumption in the past 50 years is putting strains on the environment never before seen .
Human Development Report 1998 Overview , United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) — Emphasis Added .
Figures quoted use data from 1995
If they were available , it would likely be that the breakdowns shown for the 1995 figures will not be as wide in 2005 .
However , they are likely to still show wide inequalities in consumption .
Furthermore , as a few developing countries continue to develop and help make the numbers show a narrowing gap , there are at least two further issues :
Generalized figures hide extreme poverty and inequality of consumption on the whole ( for example , between 1995 and 2005 , the inequality in consumption for the poorest fifth of humanity has hardly changed )
If emerging nations follow the same path as today ’s rich countries , their consumption patterns will also be damaging to the environment
And consider the following , reflecting world priorities : Global Priority $ U.S. Billions Cosmetics in the United States 8 Ice cream in Europe 11 Perfumes in Europe and the United States 12 Pet foods in Europe and the United States 17 Business entertainment in Japan 35 Cigarettes in Europe 50 Alcoholic drinks in Europe 105 Narcotics drugs in the world 400 Military spending in the world 780
And compare that to what was estimated as additional costs to achieve universal access to basic social services in all developing countries : Global Priority $ U.S. Billions Basic education for all 6 Water and sanitation for all 9 Reproductive health for all women 12 Basic health and nutrition 13 ( Source :

We consume a variety of resources and products today having moved beyond basic needs to include luxury items and technological innovations to try to improve efficiency .
Such consumption beyond minimal and basic needs is not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself , as throughout history we have always sought to find ways to make our lives a bit easier to live .
However , increasingly , there are important issues around consumerism that need to be understood .
For example :
How are the products and resources we consume actually produced ?
What are the impacts of that process of production on the environment , society , on individuals ?
What are the impacts of certain forms of consumption on the environment , on society , on individuals ?
Which actors influence our choices of consumption ?
Which actors influence how and why things are produced or not ?
What is a necessity and what is a luxury ?
How do demands on items affect the requirements placed upon the environment ?
How do consumption habits change as societies change ?
Businesses and advertising are major engines in promoting the consumption of products so that they may survive .
How much of what we consume is influenced by their needs versus our needs ?
Also influential is the very culture of today in many countries , as well as the media and the political institutions themselves .
What is the impact on poorer nations and people on the demands of the wealthier nations and people that are able to afford to consume more ?
How do material values influence our relationships with other people ?
What impact does that have on our personal values ?
And so on .
Just from these questions , we can likely think of numerous others as well .
We can additionally , see that consumerism and consumption are at the core of many , if not most societies .
The impacts of consumerism , positive and negative are very significant to all aspects of our lives , as well as our planet .
But equally important to bear in mind in discussing consumption patterns is the underlying system that promotes certain types of consumption and not other types .
Inherent in today ’s global economic system is the wasteful use of resources , labor and capital .
These need to be addressed .
Waste is not only things like via not recycling etc ; it is deep within the system .
The U.N. statistics above are hard hitting , highlight one of the major impacts of today ’s form of corporate - led globalization .
Over population is usually blamed as the major cause of environmental degradation , but the above statistics strongly suggests otherwise .
As we will see , consumption patterns today are not to meet everyone ’s needs .
The system that drives these consumption patterns also contribute to inequality of consumption patterns too .
This section of the globalissues.org web site will attempt to provide an introductory look at various aspects of what we consume and how .
We will see possible hidden costs of convenient items to society , the environment and individuals , as well as the relationship with various sociopolitical and economic effects on those who do consume , and those who are unable to consume as much ( due to poverty and so on ) .
costs of convenient items to society , the environment and individuals , as well as the relationship with various sociopolitical and economic effects on those who do consume , and those who are unable to consume as much ( due to poverty and so on ) .
We will look at how some luxuries were turned into necessities in order to increase profits .
This section goes beyond the do n’t buy this product type of conclusion to the deeper issues and ramifications .
type of conclusion to the deeper issues and ramifications .
We will see just a hint at how wasteful all this is on resources , society and capital .
The roots of such disparities in consumption are inextricably linked to the roots of poverty .
There is such enormous waste in the way we consume that an incredible amount of resources is wasted as well .
Furthermore , the processes that lead to such disparities in unequal consumption are themselves wasteful and is structured deep into the system itself .
Economic efficiency is for making profits , not necessarily for social good ( which is treated as a side effect ) .
The waste in the economic system is , as a result , deep .
Eliminating the causes of this type of waste are related to the elimination of poverty and bringing rights to all .
Eliminating the waste also allows for further equitable consumption for all , as well as a decent standard of consumption .
So these issues go beyond just consumption , and this section only begins to highlight the enormous waste in our economy which is not measured as such .
A further bold conclusion is also made that elimination of so much wasted capital would actually require a reduction of people ’s workweek .
This is because the elimination of such waste means entire industries are halved in size in some cases .
So much labor redundancy cannot be tolerated , and hence the answer is therefore to share the remaining productive jobs , which means reducing the workweek !
We will see therefore , that political causes of poverty are very much related to political issues and roots of consumerism .
Hence solutions to things like hunger , environmental degradation , poverty and other problems have many commonalities that would need to be addressed .
Entire volumes of research can be written on this topic so these pages provide just an insight to these issues !

Creating the Consumer Last updated Wednesday , May 14 , 2003 .
This section looks at the rise of the consumer and the development of the mass consumer society .
While consumption has of course been a part of our history , in the last 100 years or so , the level of mass consumption beyond basics has been exponential and is now a fundamental part of many economies .
Luxuries that had to be turned into necessities and how entire cultural habits had to be transformed for this consumption is introduced here .

Children as Consumers Last updated Sunday , November 21 , 2010 .
The market for children ’s products and food is enormous .
Parents on the one hand have a hard time raising children the way they want to , while on the other hand , kids are being increasingly influenced by commercialism that often goes against what parents are trying to do .

Effects of Consumerism Last updated Wednesday , August 10 , 2005 .
Because consumption is so central to many economies , and even to the current forms of globalization , its effects are also seen around the world .
How we consume , and for what purposes drives how we extract resources , create products and produce pollution and waste .
Issues relating to consumption hence also affect environmental degradation , poverty , hunger , and even the rise in obesity that is nearing levels similar to the official global poverty levels .
Political and economic systems that are currently promoted and pushed around the world in part to increase consumption also lead to immense poverty and exploitation .
Much of the world cannot and do not consume at the levels that the wealthier in the world do .
Indeed , the above U.N. statistics highlight that very sharply .
In fact , the inequality structured within the system is such that as Richard Robbins says , some one has to pay for the way the wealthier in the world consume .

Tobacco Last updated Sunday , January 05 , 2014 .
It is well known that tobacco smoking kills millions .
But it also exacerbates poverty , contributes to world hunger by diverting prime land away from food production , damages the environment and reduces economic productivity .
Second hand smoking also affects other people ’s lives .
Despite many attempts to prevent it , a global tobacco control treaty became international law in 2005 .
However , challenges still remain as tobacco companies try to hit back , for example , by targeting developing nations , increasing advertising at children and women , attempting to undermine global treaties and influence trade talks , etc. Read “ Tobacco ” to learn more .
Obesity Last updated Sunday , November 21 , 2010 .
Obesity typically results from over - eating ( especially an unhealthy diet ) and lack of enough exercise .
In our modern world with increasingly cheap , high calorie food ( example , fast food — or junk food ) , prepared foods that are high in things like salt , sugars or fat , combined with our increasingly sedentary lifestyles , increasing urbanization and changing modes of transportation , it is no wonder that obesity has rapidly increased in the last few decades , around the world .
The number of people overweight or obese is now rivaling the number of people suffering from hunger around the world .
Obese people were thought to be mainly from richer countries or wealthier segments of society , but poor people can also suffer as the food industry supplies cheaper food of poorer quality .
Environmental , societal and life - style factors all have an impact on obesity and health .
While individuals are responsible for their choices , other actors such as the food industry are also part of the problem , and solution .
Unfortunately , the food industry appears reluctant to take too many measures that could affect their bottom line , preferring to solely blame individuals instead .

Sugar Last updated Friday , April 25 , 2003 .
In this section , we look at the example of sugar consumption ; how it has arisen ( as it was once a luxury , now turned into a necessity ) .
We look at things like how it affects the environment ; the political and economic drivers in producing sugar ( for example , historically , sugar plantations encouraged slavery ) ; its health effects today ; its relation to world hunger ( as land used to grow sugar and related support , for export , could be used to grow food for local consumption ) ; and so on .
As we will also see , it is an example of a wasteful industry .
That is , so many resources go into this industry compared to what might be needed .
This wastes labor , wastes capital and uses up many resources .

Beef Last updated Sunday , August 22 , 2010 .
Beef , like sugar , is another vivid example of using resources wastefully , degrading the environment , contributing to hunger , poor health and more .
More than one third of the world ’s grain harvest is used to feed livestock .
Some 70 to 80 % of grain produced in the United States is fed to livestock .
A lot of rainforest in the Amazon and elsewhere are cleared for raising cattle — not so much for local consumption , but for fast food restaurants elsewhere .
There are enormous related costs of what is an inefficient process when considered as a whole .
Subsidies in farming in the US and elsewhere end up encouraging unhealthy foods to be cheaper than healthy foods .
Just factoring in the cost of water alone , a more realistic estimate of the real cost of common hamburger meat would be $ 35 a pound !
As with sugar , beef was a luxury turned into an everyday item .
Like sugar , it is also an example of how people ’s tastes are influenced and how demands can be created ( or very much expanded ) , rather than meeting some natural demand .

Bananas Posted Friday , September 07 , 2001 .
The banana industry in Latin America and the Caribbean also touches many other issues .
Rainforest destruction is one effect of the banana industry .
Dependent economies is another , where bananas are grown not to feed local people and meet their demands , but to create exports for Europe and America .
The recent trade disputes between those two regions have received the most attention .
However , the focus of the debate is limited .
It continues to leave both dependent Latin American nations , and the Caribbean nations in poverty and hunger , while Latin American nations , large multinational American banana corporations and the American government seek to destroy the Caribbean banana economy , via the World Trade Organization , in order to gain dominant access to the European markets .
So many resources are poured into the banana industry , and like the sugar and beef examples , there is a lot of unnecessary use of resources that could otherwise be freed up to help local people in a way that is also less degrading to the surrounding environment .

Wasted Wealth , Capital , Labor and Resources Last updated Sunday , September 23 , 2001 .
We are beginning to get just a hint of how wasteful our societies are .
Sugar , beef , and bananas are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of examples of wasted industry and waste structured within the current system .
Not only are certain wasteful job functions unnecessary as a result , but the capital that employs this labor is therefore a wasteful use of capital .
As a result , we see waste and misuse of the environment , as well as social and environmental degradation increasing .
Our industries may be efficient for accumulating capital and making profits , but that does not automatically mean that it is efficient for society .
However , with such wasted labor what do we do ?
We ca n’t have such an enormous idle labor force , right ?
Well , as J.W. Smith points out , we should share the remaining jobs .
This would also reduce our workweek .
Something technocrats have kept promising us in rhetoric only !

Mathematics of Wasted Labor — an Example Posted Friday , September 07 , 2001 .
With kind permission from J.W. Smith , a part of the conclusion to Part I of World ’s Wasted Wealth II ( Institute for Economic Democracy , 1994 ) has been reproduced on this page .
That part is titled The Mathematics of Wasted Labor .
It is a vivid example of wasted and unnecessary labor using the United States as the case study .
While the book was written back in 1994 and the numbers , facts and estimates are hence based on data from the early 1990s , the pattern and examples shown here are still very valid .
His calculations suggest that with the elimination of wasted labor in the U.S. and sharing the remaining productive jobs between all those who can work , workers would need to work just 2.4 days per week !

Energy Security Last updated Sunday , May 15 , 2011 .
Energy security is a growing concern for rich and emerging nations alike .
The past drive for fossil fuel energy has led to wars , overthrow of democratically elected leaders , and puppet governments and dictatorships .
Leading nations admit we are addicted to oil , but investment into alternatives has been lacking , or little in comparison to fossil fuel investments .
As the global financial crisis takes hold and awareness of climate change increases , more nations and companies are trying to invest in alternatives .
But will the geopolitics remain the same ?

Illicit Drugs Posted Sunday , March 30 , 2008 .
The global illicit drugs market is enormous , estimated at some $ 320 billion .
This makes it one of the largest businesses in the world .
Some believe in strong prohibition enforcement .
Others argue for decriminalization to minimize the crime and health effects associated with the market being controlled by criminals .
Are there merits to each approach ?

Pineapples Posted Sunday , October 03 , 2010 .
Pineapples are nutritious and popular .
But the cheap fruit comes at a high cost .
Health and environmental degradation has affected both workers and local communities .
Price cuts in European supermarkets has led to wage cuts for workers already earning very little .

So the news came out that the Half Life movie directed by Quentin Tarantino is destined to join the list of the greatest science fiction movies that were never actually filmed .
It has damned good company ...
10 The " Real " Alien 3
The most excited I 've ever been about a movie was the moment I saw the first Alien 3 " teaser " trailer in 1991 ( Teasers are shot well before the movie itself is finished filming . ) .
It 's the one that promised the aliens were coming to freaking Earth .

No , I did n't dream it .
They really did show that trailer ( they even have a copy of it HERE ) , having sent it to theaters before they had even started production on the movie .
Visions of awesomeness flashed through my head , a Blade Runner -ish Earth with sprawling , filthy buildings , huge , flashing billboards with giant Asian women on them , eat - up flying cars whooshing by and steam always rising from the streets for some reason .
Then , the aliens start breeding in the sewers until the creatures come boiling up out of manholes by the hundreds , to be cut to pieces by Marines with pulse rifles and maybe in the climax , the Army has to nuke the city ...

" This movie can't possibly not be awesome ! " I said to my little friend John at the time .
" This is gonna make Aliens look like ET !
I hope it 's directed by the guy who will in the future direct Fight Club ! "
A year and 30 fucking screenplays later ( including this rejected script by William Gibson ) , they came up with the movie that killed the franchise , then squatted over the face of the corpse and farted .
They had stumbled through concept after concept , built sets , torn them down , filmed scenes , thrown them away , fired directors and fired crew .
When Sigourney Weaver held out for more money , they wrote scripts without her , when she came back , they did rewrites to cram her back into the story .
Very late in the game , they brought in a young director named David Fincher - - whose only experience was with Madonna videos -- to start shooting after most of the budget had already been scattered to the wind like parade confetti .

What squeezed out the other end of the development 's digestive tract was a movie that , just seconds in , meaninglessly kills off the three characters Ripley spent the last film saving .
The hundreds of aliens were replaced with one small alien dog .
The vast , futuristic landscape was replaced by one dim , dirty building .
The frantic gunfights were replaced by scenes of identical , bald cast members staring quietly at the wall .
The main character commits suicide at the end .
So what happened ?
Budget , mostly .
My Alien 3 would have cost twice what Aliens did , with its sprawling sets and swarms of animatronic creatures ( remember CGI effects were new and still very expensive in 1991 ) .
At the end of all that I 'd have an R - rated sci - fi film with almost no chance of making back its budget ( Aliens only made about $ 85 million , $ 150 million if you adjust for inflation ) .

So , they settled for this stripped - down version on a budget of $ 50 million , filmed in an abandoned lead factory .
Then , they watched as fanboys like me piled into the theater on opening day anyway .
This is why they 're rich film executives , and I live in my car .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said he considers his rival Mitt Romney ’s Mormon faith a religion , not a cult , but questioned whether Mormons believe “ Jesus and the devil are brothers . ”
Republican presidential candidate , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , speaks during the Republican Party of Florida and Univision Spanish channel debate at the University of Miami in Miami , Florida December 9 , 2007 .

Huckabee raised the question on his own in an interview to appear in The New York Times magazine on Sunday , and ignited a new flap in the up - for - grabs race to be the Republican Party ’s nominee in the November 2008 presidential election .
Huckabee was asked if he considered Mormonism a cult or a religion .
“ I think it ’s a religion , ” he said in the interview , published on the newspaper ’s Web site on Wednesday .
“ I really do n’t know much about it . ”
Then he asked : “ Do n’t Mormons believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers ? ”
Romney , who has tried to dispel conservative Christians ’ worries about the Mormon faith , responded on NBC ’s “ Today ” show on Wednesday .
“ I think attacking someone ’s religion is really going too far .
It ’s just not the American way .
and I think people will reject that , ” the former Massachusetts governor said .
“ That ’s been something that ’s been leveled at our church over many many years and of course that ’s been set straight now , ” he added .
Huckabee , a Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor , has surged in public opinion polls and is now ahead of Romney in polls in Iowa , which holds its caucus , the first test of the U.S. state - by - state nominating season , on Jan 3 .
He made the comment before Romney gave a major speech last week trying to dispel fears about his church , known formally as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , particularly among conservative Christians , an important voting bloc .
Romney said he believes Jesus Christ is the son of God and savior of mankind , and that his White House would not be controlled by his church .
Romney responded with a sharp attack on Huckabee ’s positions on issues such as immigration and taxing and spending .
“ I think Mike was desperately hoping we would get through this without people taking a close look at his positions and his record , ” he said .
The cold sore virus has been linked to Alzheimer 's disease
In lab tests , Manchester University found brains infected with the herpes simplex virus , HSV - 1 , saw a rise in a protein linked to Alzheimer's .
Scientists believe the discovery could pave the way for a vaccine that may help prevent the brain disorder , New Scientist magazine reported .
But such a breakthrough was a long - time off , experts said .
We need to carry out much more work into this , but the problem is people are quite sceptical of a viral link
Dr Ruth Itzhaki , of Manchester University
The researchers infected cultures of human brain cells with the virus and found a " dramatic " increase in levels of the beta amyloid protein - the building blocks of deposits , or plaques , which form in the brains of people with Alzheimer's .
A similar increase was seen in the brains of mice infected with HSV - 1 .
In a separate experiment , the team stained brain slices taken from dead Alzheimer 's patients and found DNA from HSV - 1 attached to the plaques .
Gene interaction
Previous research has established that HSV - 1 is found in the brains of up to 70 % of people with Alzheimer's .
And a team from the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York found that it was more likely to cause a problem in people who carry a mutant version of a specific gene called ApoE4 , which is involved in the breakdown of fats by the body .
They found the vast majority of Alzheimer 's patients they examined carried the gene - and suspect that it works to make HSV - 1 more active .
Scientists have still to establish a direct link between the virus and the disease , but the Manchester team believe the findings offer hope for the future .
Lead researcher Dr Ruth Itzhaki said : " Alzheimer 's is a multi- factorial disease , there are many different causes .
" But our work implies that for some a mixture of the gene variant and the virus could be contributing to it .
" In the future - although it is a long way off - people could even be immunised against the virus which could help protect people against Alzheimer's . "
" We need to carry out much more work into this , but the problem is people are quite sceptical of a viral link . "
Professor Clive Ballard , director of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " A link between the virus and Alzheimer 's disease was first suggested ten years ago . "
But he added : " More research is needed before we can establish how relevant it may be to the treatment of people with Alzheimer 's disease . "
自宅を出たら、自宅アクセスポイントから十分離れて接続しなくなった時点で、一度電源を入れる。
それ以降は、そ のSSID で のprobe requestはブロードキャストされない。（電源を切って入れ直しても。）
「 インターネットブラウザ 」 の「 接続設定 」 で「手動選択」に設定（上記の通り）しておき、アクセス時に出る接続先の選択画面「利用する接続を選択してください」で、自宅SSIDを選ばないように気をつける。
「 ネットワーク接続」画面で「利用する接続を選択してください」と出た場合は、ここで選択した接続先のSSIDを1秒間ほどprobe requestとしてブロードキャストする。
それはあまりに不便なので、自宅SSIDを「登録済み」接続先リストの下の方に設定しておき、上の方に勤務先やその他のアクセスポイントを登録しておき、電源を入れ無線LANをオンにしたときに、自宅への接続が試みられる前に中止する。
各接続先について、接続できない間、そのSSIDをprobe requestとして30秒間ほどブロードキャストする。
接続できるアクセスポイントのある場所では、自宅から持ってきて最初に電源を入れた瞬間に、周囲で自宅SSIDを傍受され得る。
それに接続できないときは、過去に接続した各SSIDについて同様にブロードキャストする。
自宅を出たら、自宅アクセスポイントから十分離れて接続しなくなった時点で、スリープから復帰させ、キーチェインから当該SSIDを削除してから、目的の場所に向かう。
接続できるアクセスポイントのある場所（勤務先等）では、自宅から持ってきて最初にスリープから復帰させた際の約10秒間、周囲で自宅SSIDを傍受され得る。
しかし、消しても、また接続すると、次にスリープから復帰した時点でブロードキャストされてしまう。
その後、接続が安定している限りprobe requestは送信されないっぽい。
それに接続できない場合、その前に接続していたSSIDについて同様にブロードキャストする。それに接続できない場合はさらに前に接続していたSSIDについて同様に、と、すべての覚えているSSIDについて続く。
Windows XPでは、デフォルト設定では、「自動」接続設定されたアクセスポイントの各SSIDを常時ブロードキャスト、つまり周囲に撒き散らしているので、SSIDのプライバシー性が特に重大だった。では、他の無線LAN対応機器はどうか。いくつか調べてみた。
無線LAN の 「 SSID 」は、どれが自分の使ってよいアクセスポイントなのかを人間が見分けるための名前でもあるのだから、本来、覚えやすい名前にしておくべきものではないだろうか。
これは、接続の設定をするときだけの話ではなく、今どこにつながっているかを確認する癖を付けるという意味でも重要ではないか。ゲーム機やiPod touchのように持ち運ぶ機器が無線LAN接続をするのが普通になってきたからだ。
昨今の無 線LANアクセスポイント製品は、デフォルト設定が覚えられないような番号になっていたりするが、隣の家のSSIDを自分の家のものだと間違えてしまうことがありそうだ。もちろん、逆に、ご近所がみな同じ「YBBUser」というのも困る。
セキュリティの半可通が 、「 SSID は予測困難なランダムな文字列にしておくのが常識」などと「キリッ」とした顔で言うかもしれないが、それは無視してよい。WPAによる暗号化さえ正しく設定（これは元々必須）しておけば、SSIDを知られたところでセキュリティ上の問題はない。そもそも、元々SSIDは電波に載って飛んでいるので隠すことは不可能だ（ステルス機能でも隠し切れない）。
SSID の名前をランダムにしないことに問題があるとすれば、プライバシーの観点からだろう。家庭の無線LANのSSIDにふさわしい名前の要件を列挙すると、こんな感じだろうか。
家族が覚えやすい名前 例：動物の名前、食べ物の名前、星の名前、芸能人の愛称、子供向けアニメの名前、思い出の旅行先の名前など。 ご近所に知られても恥ずかしくない名前 （ SSID は ご近所にも見える） 例：大人向けアニメの名前を避けるなど。 ご近所とダブらない名前 （ SSID は ご近所にも届く） 例：メーカー名を避け る
。1桁程度の番号を加えるとよいかも。 家の近くを通りすがる人に見られても問題のない名前
（ SSID は通りすがりの人が見る） 例：興味をそそるような名前を避け、平凡な名前に。子供がいることを知られたくなければ、子供が好きそうなものの名前を避ける。 勤務先の人や知人などに知られても問題のない名前 （接続機器が外出先 でSSID を出す） 例：自宅の場所や出身地等を知られたくないなら、地名を避ける。 電車内などで赤の他人に知られても問題のない名前 （接続機器が外出先 でSSID を出す） 例：氏名を知られたくないなら、氏名を避ける。興味をそそるような名前を避け、平凡な名前に。
そして、無線LANクライアント側では、セキュリティの観点から、次の点に注意する。
暗号化なしのアクセスポイントに自動接続の設定をしないこと。
自分の家 のSSIDと同じ名前のアクセスポイントが、暗号化なしで利用可能になっていても、接続しないこと。
うーん、本当にこれでいいのか？

7 Memory Performance Tools
A wide variety of tools is available to help programmers understand the cache and memory use of a program .
Modern processors have performance monitoring hardware that can be used .
Some events are hard to measure exactly , so there is also room for simulation .
When it comes to higher - level functionality , there are special tools to monitor the execution of a process .
We will introduce a set of commonly used tools available on most Linux systems .
7.1 Memory Operation Profiling
Profiling memory operations requires collaboration from the hardware .
It is possible to gather some information in software alone , but this is either coarse - grained or merely a simulation .
Examples of simulation will be shown in Section 7.2 and Section 7.5 .
Here we will concentrate on measurable memory effects .
Access to performance monitoring hardware on Linux is provided by oprofile .
Oprofile provides continuous profiling capabilities as first described in [ continuous ] ; it performs statistical , system - wide profiling with an easy - to - use interface .
Oprofile is by no means the only way the performance measurement functionality of processors can be used ; Linux developers are working on pfmon which might at some point be sufficiently widely deployed to warrant being described here , too .
The interface oprofile provides is simple and minimal but also pretty low - level , even if the optional GUI is used .
The user has to select among the events the processor can record .
The architecture manuals for the processors describe the events but , oftentimes , it requires extensive knowledge about the processors themselves to interpret the data .
Another problem is the interpretation of the collected data .
The performance measurement counters are absolute values and can grow arbitrarily .
How high is too high for a given counter ?
A partial answer to this problem is to avoid looking at the absolute values and , instead , relate multiple counters to each other .
Processors can monitor more than one event ; the ratio of the collected absolute values can then be examined .
This gives nice , comparable results .
Often the divisor is a measure of processing time , the number of clock cycles or the number of instructions .
As an initial stab at program performance , relating just these two numbers by themselves is useful .
Figure 7.1 : Cycles per Instruction ( Follow Random )
Figure 7.1 shows the Cycles Per Instruction ( CPI ) for the simple random  Follow  test case for the various working set sizes .
The names of the events to collect this information for most Intel processor are CPU_CLK_UNHALTED and INST_RETIRED .
As the names suggest , the former counts the clock cycles of the CPU and the latter the number of instructions .
We see a picture similar to the cycles per list element measurements we used .
For small working set sizes the ratio is 1.0 or even lower .
These measurements were made on a Intel Core 2 processor , which is multi-scalar and can work on several instructions at once .
For a program which is not limited by memory bandwidth , the ratio can be significantly below 1.0 but , in this case , 1.0 is pretty good .
Once the L1d is no longer large enough to hold the working set , the CPI jumps to just below 3.0 .
Note that the CPI ratio averages the penalties for accessing L2 over all instructions , not just the memory instructions .
Using the cycles for list element data , it can be worked out how many instructions per list element are needed .
If even the L2 cache is not sufficient , the CPI ratio jumps to more than 20 .
These are expected results .
But the performance measurement counters are supposed to give more insight into what is going on in the processor .
For this we need to think about processor implementations .
In this document , we are concerned with cache handling details , so we have to look at events related to the caches .
These events , their names , and what they count , are processor - specific .
This is where oprofile is currently hard to use , irrespective of the simple user interface : the user has to figure out the performance counter details by her / himself .
In Section 10 we will see details about some processors .
For the Core 2 processor the events to look for are L1D_REPL , DTLB_MISSES , and L2_LINES_IN .
The latter can measure both all misses and misses caused by instructions instead of hardware prefetching .
The results for the random  Follow test can be seen in Figure 7.2 .
Figure 7.2 : Measured Cache Misses ( Follow Random )
All ratios are computed using the number of retired instructions ( INST_RETIRED ) .
This means that instructions not touching memory are also counted , which , in turn , means that the number of instructions which do touch memory and which suffer a cache miss is even higher than shown in the graph .
The L1d misses tower over all the others since an L2 miss implies , for Intel processors , an L1d miss due to the use of inclusive caches .
The processor has 32 k of L1d and so we see , as expected , the L1d rate go up from zero at about that working set size ( there are other uses of the cache beside the list data structure , which means the increase happens between the 16 k and 32 k mark ) .
It is interesting to see that the hardware prefetching can keep the miss rate at 1 % for a working set size up to and including 64 k .
After that the L1d rate skyrockets .
The L2 miss rate stays zero until the L2 is exhausted ; the few misses due to other uses of L2 do not influence the numbers much .
Once the size of L2 ( 221 bytes ) is exceeded , the miss rates rise .
It is important to notice that the L2 demand miss rate is nonzero .
This indicates that the hardware prefetcher does not load all the cache lines needed by instructions later .
This is expected , the randomness of the accesses prevents perfect prefetching .
Compare this with the data for the sequential read in Figure 7.3 .
Figure 7.3 : Measured Cache Misses ( Follow Sequential )
In this graph we can see that the L2 demand miss rate is basically zero ( note the scale of this graph is different from Figure 7.2 ) .
For the sequential access case , the hardware prefetcher works perfectly : almost all L2 cache misses are caused by the prefetcher .
The fact that the L1d and L2 miss rates are the same shows that all L1d cache misses are handled by the L2 cache without further delays .
This is the ideal case for all programs but it is , of course , hardly ever achievable .
The fourth line in both graphs is the DTLB miss rate ( Intel has separate TLBs for code and data , DTLB is the data TLB ) .
For the random access case , the DTLB miss rate is significant and contributes to the delays .
What is interesting is that the DTLB penalties set in before the L2 misses .
For the sequential access case the DTLB costs are basically zero .
Going back to the matrix multiplication example in Section 6.2.1 and the example code in Section 9.1 , we can make use of three more counters .
The SSE_PRE_MISS , SSE_PRE_EXEC , and LOAD_HIT_PRE counters can be used to see how effective the software prefetching is .
If the code in Section 9.1 is run we get the following results :
Description Ratio Useful NTA prefetches 2.84 % Late NTA prefetches 2.65 %
The low useful NTA ( non-temporal aligned ) prefetch ratio indicates that many prefetch instructions are executed for cache lines which are already loaded , so no work is needed .
This means the processor wastes time to decode the prefetch instruction and look up the cache .
One cannot judge the code too harshly , though .
Much depends on the size of the caches of the processor used ; the hardware prefetcher also plays a role .
The low late NTA prefetch ratio is misleading .
The ratio means that 2.65 % of all prefetch instructions are issued too late .
The instruction which needs the data is executed before the data could be prefetched into the cache .
It must be kept in mind that only 2.84%+2.65 %=5.5 % of the prefetch instructions were of any use .
Of the NTA prefetch instructions which are useful , 48 % did not finish in time .
The code therefore can be optimized further :
most of the prefetch instructions are not needed .
the use of the prefetch instruction can be adjusted to match the hardware better .
It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine the best solution for the available hardware .
The exact hardware specification plays a big role .
On Core 2 processors the latency of the SSE arithmetic operations is 1 cycle .
Older versions had a latency of 2 cycles , meaning that the hardware prefetcher and the prefetch instructions had more time to bring in the data .
To determine where prefetches might be needed — or are unnecessary — one can use the opannotate program .
It lists the source or assembler code of the program and shows the instructions where the event was recognized .
Note that there are two sources of vagueness :
Oprofile performs stochastic profiling .
Only every Nth event ( where N is a per-event threshold with an enforced minimum ) is recorded to avoid slowing down operation of the system too much .
There might be lines which cause 100 events and yet they might not show up in the report .
Not all events are recorded accurately .
For example , the instruction counter at the time a specific event was recorded might be incorrect .
Processors being multi-scalar makes it hard to give a 100 % correct answer .
A few events on some processors are exact , though .
The annotated listings are useful for more than determining the prefetching information .
Every event is recorded with the instruction pointer ; it is therefore also possible to pinpoint other hot spots in the program .
Locations which are the source of many INST_RETIRED events are executed frequently and deserve to be tuned .
Locations where many cache misses are reported might warrant a prefetch instruction to avoid the cache miss .
One type of event which can be measured without hardware support is page faults .
The OS is responsible for resolving page faults and , on those occasions , it also counts them .
It distinguishes two kinds of page faults :
Minor Page Faults
These are page faults for anonymous ( i.e. , not file - backed ) pages which have not been used so far , for copy - on - write pages , and for other pages whose content is already in memory somewhere .
Major Page Faults
Resolving them requires access to disk to retrieve the file - backed ( or swapped - out ) data .
Obviously , major page faults are significantly more expensive than minor page faults .
But the latter are not cheap either .
In either case an entry into the kernel is necessary , a new page must be found , the page must be cleared or populated with the appropriate data , and the page table tree must be modified accordingly .
The last step requires synchronization with other tasks reading or modifying the page table tree , which might introduce further delays .
The easiest way to retrieve information about the page fault counts is to use the time tool .
Note : use the real tool , not the shell builtin .
The output can be seen in Figure 7.4 .
{ The leading backslash prevents the use of the built - in command .}
$ \time ls /etc [...]
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.02elapsed 17%CPU ( 0avgtext+0avgdata 0 maxresident ) k 0inputs+0outputs ( 1major+335minor ) pagefaults 0swaps Figure 7.4 : Output of the time utility
The interesting part here is the last line .
The time tool reports one major and 335 minor page faults .
The exact numbers vary ; in particular , repeating the run immediately will likely show that there are now no major page faults at all .
If the program performs the same action , and nothing changes in the environment , the total page fault count will be stable .
An especially sensitive phase with respect to page faults is program start - up .
Each page which is used will produce a page fault ; the visible effect ( especially for GUI applications ) is that the more pages that are used , the longer it takes for the program to start working .
In Section 7.5 we will see a tool to measure this effect specifically .
Under the hood , the time tool uses the rusage functionality .
The wait4 system call fills in a struct rusage object when the parent waits for a child to terminate ; that is exactly what is needed for the time tool .
But it is also possible for a process to request information about its own resource usage ( that is where the name rusage comes from ) or the resource usage of its terminated children .
#include < sys/resource .h> int getrusage ( __rusage_who_t who , struct rusage * usage )
The who parameter specifies which process the information is requested for .
Currently , RUSAGE_SELF and RUSAGE_CHILDREN are defined .
The resource usage of the child processes is accumulated when each child terminates .
It is a total value , not the usage of an individual child process .
Proposals to allow requesting thread - specific information exist , so it is likely that we will see RUSAGE_THREAD in the near future .
The rusage structure is defined to contain all kinds of metrics , including execution time , the number of IPC messages sent and memory used , and the number of page faults .
The latter information is available in the ru_minflt and ru_majflt members of the structure .
A programmer who tries to determine where her program loses performance due to page faults could regularly request the information and then compare the returned values with the previous results .
From the outside , the information is also visible if the requester has the necessary privileges .
The pseudo file / proc / < PID >/ stat , where < PID > is the process ID of the process we are interested in , contains the page fault numbers in the tenth to fourteenth fields .
They are pairs of the process 's and its childrens ' cumulative minor and major page faults , respectively .
7.2 Simulating CPU Caches
While the technical description of how a cache works is relatively easy to understand , it is not so easy to see how an actual program behaves with respect to cache .
Programmers are not directly concerned with the values of addresses , be they absolute nor relative .
Addresses are determined , in part , by the linker and , in part , at runtime by the dynamic linker and the kernel .
The generated assembly code is expected to work with all possible addresses and , in the source language , there is not even a hint of absolute address values left .
So it can be quite difficult to get a sense for how a program is making use of memory .
{ When programming close to the hardware this might be different , but this is of no concern to normal programming and , in any case , is only possible for special addresses such as memory - mapped devices .}
CPU - level profiling tools such as oprofile ( as described in Section 7.1 ) can help to understand the cache use .
The resulting data corresponds to the actual hardware , and it can be collected relatively quickly if fine - grained collection is not needed .
As soon as more fine - grained data is needed , oprofile is not usable anymore ; the thread would have to be interrupted too often .
Furthermore , to see the memory behavior of the program on different processors , one actually has to have such machines and execute the program on them .
This is sometimes ( often ) not possible .
One example is the data from Figure 3.8 .
To collect such data with oprofile one would have to have 24 different machines , many of which do not exist .
The data in that graph was collected using a cache simulator .
This program , cachegrind , uses the valgrind framework , which was initially developed to check for memory handling related problems in a program .
The valgrind framework simulates the execution of a program and , while doing this , it allows various extensions , such as cachegrind , to hook into the execution framework .
The cachegrind tool uses this to intercept all uses of memory addresses ; it then simulates the operation of L1i , L1d , and L2 caches with a given size , cache line size , and associativity .
To use the tool a program must be run using valgrind as a wrapper :
valgrind -- tool =cachegrind command arg
In this simplest form the program command is executed with the parameter arg while simulating the three caches using sizes and associativity corresponding to that of the processor it is running on .
One part of the output is printed to standard error when the program is running ; it consists of statistics of the total cache use as can be seen in Figure 7.5 .
==19645= = I refs : 152,653,497 ==19645== I1 misses : 25,833 ==19645== L2i misses : 2,475 ==19645== I1 miss rate : 0.01 % ==19645== L2i miss rate : 0.00 % ==19645== ==19645== D refs : 56,857,129 ( 35,838,721 rd +

The total number of instructions and memory references is given , along with the number of misses they produce for the L1i / L1d and L2 cache , the miss rates , etc .
The tool is even able to split the L2 accesses into instruction and data accesses , and all data cache uses are split in read and write accesses .
It becomes even more interesting when the details of the simulated caches are changed and the results compared .
Through the use of the — I1 , — D1 , and — L2 parameters , cachegrind can be instructed to disregard the processor 's cache layout and use that specified on the command line .
For example :
valgrind --tool=cachegrind --L2=8388608,8,64 command arg
would simulate an 8 MB L2 cache with 8 - way set associativity and 64 byte cache line size .
Note that the — L2 option appears on the command line before the name of the program which is simulated .
This is not all cachegrind can do .
Before the process exits cachegrind writes out a file named cachegrind .
out .
XXXXX where XXXXX is the PID of the process .
This file contains the summary information and detailed information about the cache use in each function and source file .
The data can be viewed using the cg_annotate program .
The output this program produces contains the cache use summary which was printed when the process terminated , along with a detailed summary of the cache line use in each function of the program .
Generating this per-function data requires that cg_annotate is able to match addresses to functions .
This means debug information should be available for best results .
Failing that , the ELF symbol tables can help a bit but , since internal symbols are not listed in the dynamic symbol table , the results are not complete .
Figure 7.6 shows part of the output for the same program run as Figure 7.5 .

Figure 7.6 : cg_annotate Output
The Ir , Dr , and Dw columns show the total cache use , not cache misses , which are shown in the following two columns .
This data can be used to identify the code which produces the most cache misses .
First , one probably would concentrate on L2 cache misses , then proceed to optimizing L1i / L1d cache misses .
cg_annotate can provide the data in more detail .
If the name of a source file is given , it also annotates ( hence the program 's name ) each line of the source file with the number of cache hits and misses corresponding to that line .
This information allows the programmer to drill down to the exact line where cache misses are a problem .
The program interface is a bit raw : as of this writing , the cachegrind data file and the source file must be in the same directory .
It should , at this point , be noted again : cachegrind is a simulator which does not use measurements from the processor .
The actual cache implementation in the processor might very well be quite different .
cachegrind simulates Least Recently Used ( LRU ) eviction , which is likely to be too expensive for caches with large associativity .
Furthermore , the simulation does not take context switches and system calls into account , both of which can destroy large parts of L2 and must flush L1i and L1d .
This causes the total number of cache misses to be lower than experienced in reality .
Nevertheless , cachegrind is a nice tool to learn about a program 's memory use and its problems with memory .
7.3 Measuring Memory Usage
Knowing how much memory a program allocates and possibly where the allocation happens is the first step to optimizing its memory use
There are , fortunately , some easy - to - use programs available which do not even require that the program be recompiled or specifically modified .
For the first tool , called massif , it is sufficient to not strip the debug information which the compiler can automatically generate .
It provides an overview of the accumulated memory use over time .
Figure 7.7 shows an example of the generated output .
Figure 7.7 : Massif Output
Like cachegrind ( Section 7.2 ) , massif is a tool using the valgrind infrastructure .
It is started using
valgrind -- tool =massif command arg
where command arg is the program which is observed and its parameter (s ) ,
The program will be simulated and all calls to memory allocation functions are recognized .
The call site is recorded along with a timestamp value ; the new allocation size is added to both the whole - program total and total for the specific call site .
The same applies to the functions which free memory where , obviously , the size of the freed block is subtracted from the appropriated sums .
This information can then be used to create a graph showing the memory use over the lifetime of the program , splitting each time value according to the location which requested the allocation .
Before the process is terminated massif creates two files : massif.XXXXX.txt and massif .XXXXX.ps , where XXXXX in both cases is the PID of the process .
The . txt file is a summary of the memory use for all call sites and the .ps is what can be seen in Figure 7.7 .
Massif can also record the program 's stack usage , which can be useful to determine the total memory footprint of an application .
But this is not always possible .
In some situations ( some thread stacks or when signaltstack is used ) the valgrind runtime cannot know about the limits of the stack .
In these situations , it also does not make much sense to add these stacks ' sizes to the total .
There are several other situations where it makes no sense .
If a program is affected by this , massif should be started with the addition option — stacks=no .
Note , this is an option for valgrind and therefore must come before the name of the program which is being observed .
Some programs provide their own memory allocation functions or wrapper functions around the system 's allocation functions .
In the first case , allocations are normally missed ; in the second case , the recorded call sites hide information , since only the address of the call in the wrapper function is recorded .
For this reason , it is possible to add additional functions to the list of allocation functions .
The — alloc - fn=xmalloc parameter would specify that the function xmalloc is also an allocation function , which is often the case in GNU programs .
Calls to xmalloc are recorded , but not the allocation calls made from within xmalloc .
The second tool is called memusage ; it is part of the GNU C library .
It is a simplified version of massif ( but existed a long time before massif ) .
It only records the total memory use for heap ( including possible calls to mmap etc. if the - m option is given ) and , optionally , the stack .
The results can be shown as a graph of the total memory use over time or , alternatively , linearly over the calls made to allocation functions .
The graphs are created separately by the memusage script which , just as with valgrind , has to be used to start the application :
memusage command arg
The -p IMGFILE option must be used to specify that the graph should be generated in the file IMGFILE , which will be a PNG file .
The code to collect the data is run in the actual program itself , it is not an simulation like valgrind .
This means memusage is much faster than massif and usable in situations where massif would be not useful .
Besides total memory consumption , the code also records allocation sizes and , on program termination , it shows a histogram of the used allocation sizes .
This information is written to standard error .
Sometimes it is not possible ( or feasible ) to call the program which is supposed to be observed directly .
An example is the compiler stage of gcc , which is started by the gcc driver program .
In this case the name of the program which should be observed must be provided to the memusage script using the -n NAME parameter .
This parameter is also useful if the program which is observed starts other programs .
If no program name is specified all started programs will be profiled .
Both programs , massif and memusage , have additional options .
A programmer finding herself in the position needing more functionality should first consult the manual or help messages to make sure the additional functionality is not already implemented .
Now that we know how the data about memory allocation can be captured , it is necessary to discuss how this data can be interpreted in the context of memory and cache use .
The main aspects of efficient dynamic memory allocation are linear allocation and compactness of the used portion .
This goes back to making prefetching efficient and reducing cache misses .
A program which has to read in an arbitrary amount of data for later processing could do this by creating a list where each of the list elements contains a new data item .
The overhead for this allocation method might be minimal ( one pointer for a single - linked list ) but the cache effects when using the data can reduce the performance dramatically .
One problem is , for instance , that there is no guarantee that sequentially allocated memory is laid out sequentially in memory .
There are many possible reasons for this :
memory blocks inside a large memory chunk administrated by the memory allocator are actually returned from the back to the front ;
a memory chunk is exhausted and a new one is started in a different part of the address space ;
the allocation requests are for different sizes which are served from different memory pools ;
the interleaving of allocations in the various threads of multi- threaded programs .
If data must be allocated up front for later processing , the linked - list approach is clearly a bad idea .
There is no guarantee ( or even likelihood ) that the consecutive elements in the list are laid out consecutively in memory .
To ensure contiguous allocations , that memory must not be allocated in small chunks .
Another layer of memory handling must be used ; it can easily be implemented by the programmer .
An alternative is to use the obstack implementation available in the GNU C library .
This allocator requests large blocks of memory from the system 's allocator and then hands arbitrarily large or small blocks of memory out .
These allocations are always sequential unless the large memory chunk is exhausted , which is , depending on the requested allocation sizes , pretty rare .
Obstacks are not a complete replacement for a memory allocator , they have limited abilities to free objects .
See the GNU C library manual for details .
So , how can a situation where the use of obstacks ( or similar techniques ) is advisable be recognized from the graphs ?
Without consulting the source , possible candidates for the changes cannot be identified , but the graph can provide an entry point for the search .
If many allocations are made from the same location , this could mean that allocation in bulk might help .
In Figure 7.7 , we can see such a possible candidate in the allocations at address 0x4c0e7d5 .
From about 800 ms into the run until 1,800 ms into the run this is the only area ( except the top , green one ) which grows .
Moreover , the slope is not steep , which means we have a large number of relatively small allocations .
This is , indeed , a candidate for the use of obstacks or similar techniques .
Another problem the graphs can show is when the total number of allocations is high .
This is especially easy to see if the graph is not drawn linearly over time but , instead , linearly over the number of calls ( the default with memusage ) .
In that case , a gentle slope in the graph means a lot of small allocations .
memusage will not say where the allocations took place , but the comparison with massif 's output can say that , or the programmer might recognize it right away .
Many small allocations should be consolidated to achieve linear memory use .
But there is another , equally important , aspect to this latter class of cases : many allocations also means higher overhead in administrative data .
This by itself might not be that problematic .
The red area named heap - admin represents this overhead in the massif graph and it is quite small .
But , depending on the malloc implementation , this administrative data is allocated along with the data blocks , in the same memory .
For the current malloc implementation in the GNU C library , this is the case : every allocated block has at least a 2 - word header ( 8 bytes for 32 - bit platforms , 16 bytes for 64 - bit platforms ) .
In addition , block sizes are often a bit larger than necessary due to the way memory is administrated ( rounding up block sizes to specific multiples ) .
This all means that memory used by the program is interspersed with memory only used by the allocator for administrative purposes .
We might see something like this :
Each block represents one memory word and , in this small region of memory , we have four allocated blocks .
The overhead due to the block header and padding is 50 % .
Due to the placement of the header , this automatically means that the effective prefetch rate of the processor is lowered by up to 50 % as well .
If the blocks were be processed sequentially ( to take maximum advantage of prefetching ) , the processor would read all the header and padding words into the cache , even though they are never supposed to be read from or written to by the application itself .
Only the runtime uses the header words , and the runtime only comes into play when the block is freed .
Now , one could argue that the implementation should be changed to put the administrative data somewhere else .
This is indeed done in some implementations , and it might prove to be a good idea .
There are many aspects to be kept in mind , though , security not being the least of them .
Regardless of whether we might see a change in the future , the padding issue will never go away ( amounting to 16 % of the data in the example , when ignoring the headers ) .
Only if the programmer directly takes control of allocations can this be avoided .
When alignment requirements come into play there might still be holes , but this is also something under control of the programmer .
7.4 Improving Branch Prediction
In Section 6.2.2 , two methods to improve L1i use through branch prediction and block reordering were mentioned : static prediction through __builtin_expect and profile guided optimization ( PGO ) .
Correct branch prediction has performance impacts , but here we are interested in the memory usage improvements .
The use of __builtin_expect ( or better the likely and unlikely macros ) is simple .
The definitions are placed in a central header and the compiler takes care of the rest .
There is a little problem , though : it is easy enough for a programmer to use likely when really unlikely was meant and vice versa .
Even if somebody uses a tool like oprofile to measure incorrect branch predictions and L1i misses these problems are hard to detect .
There is one easy method , though .
The code in Section 9.2 shows an alternative definition of the likely and unlikely macros which measure actively , at runtime , whether the static predictions are correct or not .
The results can then be examined by the programmer or tester and adjustments can be made .
The measurements do not actually take the performance of the program into account , they simply test the static assumptions made by the programmer .
More details can be found , along with the code , in the section referenced above .
PGO is quite easy to use with gcc these days .
It is a three - step process , though , and certain requirements must be fulfilled .
First , all source files must be compiled with the additional - fprofile - generate option .
This option must be passed to all compiler runs and to the command which links the program .
Mixing object files compiled with and without this option is possible , but PGO will not do any good for those that do not have it enabled .
The compiler generates a binary which behaves normally except that it is significantly larger and slower since it records ( and emits ) all kinds of information about branches taken or not .
The compiler also emits a file with the extension . gcno for each input file .
This file contains information related to the branches in the code .
It must be preserved for later .
Once the program binary is available , it should be used to run a representative set of workloads .
Whatever workload is used , the final binary will be optimized to do this task well .
Consecutive runs of the program are possible and , in general necessary ; all the runs will contribute to the same output file .
Before the program terminates , the data collected during the program run is written out into files with the extension .gcda .
These files are created in the directory which contains the source file .
The program can be executed from any directory , and the binary can be copied , but the directory with the sources must be available and writable .
Again , one output file is created for each input source file .
If the program is run multiple times , it is important that the .gcda files of the previous run are found in the source directories since otherwise the data of the runs cannot be accumulated in one file .
When a representative set of tests has been run , it is time to recompile the application .
The compiler has to be able to find the .gcda files in the same directory which holds the source files .
The files cannot be moved since the compiler would not find them and the embedded checksum for the files would not match anymore .
For the recompilation , replace the - fprofile - generate parameter with - fprofile - use .
It is essential that the sources do not change in any way that would change the generated code .
That means : it is OK to change white spaces and edit comments , but adding more branches or basic blocks invalidates the collected data and the compilation will fail .
This is all the programmer has to do ; it is a fairly simple process .
The most important thing to get right is the selection of representative tests to perform the measurements .
If the test workload does not match the way the program is actually used , the performed optimizations might actually do more harm than good .
For this reason , is it often hard to use PGO for libraries .
Libraries can be used in many — sometimes widely different — scenarios .
Unless the use cases are indeed similar , it is usually better to rely exclusively on static branch prediction using __builtin_expect .
A few words on the .gcno and .gcda files .
These are binary files which are not immediately usable for inspection .
It is possible , though , to use the gcov tool , which is also part of the gcc package , to examine them .
This tool is mainly used for coverage analysis ( hence the name ) but the file format used is the same as for PGO .
The gcov tool generates output files with the extension .gcov for each source file with executed code ( this might include system headers ) .
The files are source listings which are annotated , according to the parameters given to gcov , with branch counter , probabilities , etc .
7.5 Page Fault Optimization
On demand - paged operating systems like Linux , an mmap call only modifies the page tables .
It makes sure that , for file - backed pages , the underlying data can be found and , for anonymous memory , that , on access , pages initialized with zeros are provided .
No actual memory is allocated at the time of the mmap call .
{ If you want to say  Wrong !  wait a second , it will be qualified later that there are exceptions .}
The allocation part happens when a memory page is first accessed , either by reading or writing data , or by executing code .
In response to the ensuing page fault , the kernel takes control and determines , using the page table tree , the data which has to be present on the page .
This resolution of the page fault is not cheap , but it happens for every single page which is used by a process .
To minimize the cost of page faults , the total number of used pages has to be reduced .
Optimizing the code for size will help with this .
To reduce the cost of a specific code path ( for instance , the start - up code ) , it is also possible to rearrange code so that , in that code path , the number of touched pages is minimized .
It is not easy to determine the right order , though .
The author wrote a tool , based on the valgrind toolset , to measure page faults as they happen .
Not the number of page faults , but the reason why they happen .
The pagein tool emits information about the order and timing of page faults .
The output , written to a file named pagein . < PID > , looks as in Figure 7.8 .
0 0x3000000000 C 0 0x3000000B50 : ( within /lib64/ld-2.5.so ) 1 0x 7FF000000 D 3320 0x3000000B53 : ( within /lib64/ld-2.5.so ) 2 0x3000001000 C 58270 0x3000001080 : _dl_start ( in /lib64/ld-2.5.so ) 3 0x3000219000 D 128020 0x30000010 AE : _dl_start ( in /lib64/ld-2.5.so ) 4 0x300021A000 D 132170 0x30000010

The second column specifies the address of the page which is paged - in .
Whether it is a code or data page is indicated in the third column , which contains ` C ' or ` D ' respectively .
The fourth column specifies the number of cycles which passed since the first page fault .
The rest of the line is valgrind 's attempt to find a name for the address which caused the page fault .
The address value itself is correct but the name is not always accurate if no debug information is available .
In the example in Figure 7.8 , execution starts at address 0x3000000B50 , which forces the page at address 0x3000000000 to be paged in .
Shortly after that , the page after this is also brought in ; the function called on that page is _dl_start .
The initial code accesses a variable on page 0x7FF000000 .
This happens just 3,320 cycles after the first page fault and is most likely the second instruction of the program ( just three bytes after the first instruction ) .
If one looks at the program , one will notice that there is something peculiar about this memory access .
The instruction in question is a call instruction , which does not explicitly load or store data .
It does store the return address on the stack , though , and this is exactly what happens here .
This is not the official stack of the process , though , it is valgrind 's internal stack of the application .
This means when interpreting the results of pagein it is important to keep in mind that valgrind introduces some artifacts .
The output of pagein can be used to determine which code sequences should ideally be adjacent in the program code .
A quick look at the / lib64/ ld - 2.5.so code shows that the first instructions immediately call the function _dl_start , and that these two places are on different pages .
Rearranging the code to move the code sequences onto the same page can avoid — or at least delay — a page fault .
It is , so far , a cumbersome process to determine what the optimal code layout should be .
Since the second use of a page is , by design , not recorded , one needs to use trial and error to see the effects of a change .
Using call graph analysis , it is possible to guess about possible call sequences ; this might help speed up the process of sorting the functions and variables .
At a very coarse level , the call sequences can be seen by looking a the object files making up the executable or DSO .
Starting with one or more entry points ( i.e. , function names ) , the chain of dependencies can be computed .
Without much effort this works well at the object file level .
In each round , determine which object files contain needed functions and variables .
The seed set has to be specified explicitly .
Then determine all undefined references in those object files and add them to the set of needed symbols .
Repeat until the set is stable .
The second step in the process is to determine an order .
The various object files have to be grouped together to fill as few pages as possible .
As an added bonus , no function should cross over a page boundary .
A complication in all this is that , to best arrange the object files , it has to be known what the linker will do later .
The important fact here is that the linker will put the object files into the executable or DSO in the same order in which they appear in the input files ( e.g. , archives ) , and on the command line .
This gives the programmer sufficient control .
For those who are willing to invest a bit more time , there have been successful attempts at reordering made using automatic call tracing via the __cyg_profile_func_enter and __cyg_profile_func_exit hooks gcc inserts when called with the - finstrument - functions option [ oooreorder ] .
See the gcc manual for more information on these __cyg_* interfaces .
By creating a trace of the program execution , the programmer can more accurately determine the call chains .
The results in [ oooreorder ] are a 5 % decrease in start - up costs , just through reordering of the functions .
The main benefit is the reduced number of page faults , but the TLB cache also plays a role — an increasingly important role given that , in virtualized environments , TLB misses become significantly more expensive .
By combining the analysis of the pagein tool with the call sequence information , it should be possible to optimize certain phases of the program ( such as start - up ) to minimize the number of page faults .
The Linux kernel provides two additional mechanisms to avoid page faults .
The first one is a flag for mmap which instructs the kernel to not only modify the page table but , in fact , to pre-fault all the pages in the mapped area .
This is achieved by simply adding the MAP_POPULATE flag to the fourth parameter of the mmap call .
This will cause the mmap call to be significantly more expensive , but , if all pages which are mapped by the call are being used right away , the benefits can be large .
Instead of having a number of page faults , which each are pretty expensive due to the overhead incurred by synchronization requirements etc. , the program would have one , more expensive , mmap call .
The use of this flag has disadvantages , though , in cases where a large portion of the mapped pages are not used soon ( or ever ) after the call .
Mapped , unused pages are obviously a waste of time and memory .
Pages which are immediately pre-faulted and only much later used also can clog up the system .
The memory is allocated before it is used and this might lead to shortages of memory in the meantime .
On the other hand , in the worst case , the page is simply reused for a new purpose ( since it has not been modified yet ) , which is not that expensive but still , together with the allocation , adds some cost .
The granularity of MAP_POPULATE is simply too coarse .
And there is a second possible problem : this is an optimization ; it is not critical that all pages are , indeed , mapped in .
If the system is too busy to perform the operation the pre-faulting can be dropped .
Once the page is really used the program takes the page fault , but this is not worse than artificially creating resource scarcity .
An alternative is to use the POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED advice with the posix_madvise function .
This is a hint to the operating system that , in the near future , the program will need the page described in the call .
The kernel is free to ignore the advice , but it also can pre-fault pages .
The advantage here is that the granularity is finer .
Individual pages or page ranges in any mapped address space area can be pre-faulted .
For memory - mapped files which contain a lot of data which is not used at runtime , this can have huge advantages over using MAP_POPULATE .
Beside these active approaches to minimizing the number of page faults , it is also possible to take a more passive approach which is popular with the hardware designers .
A DSO occupies neighboring pages in the address space , one range of pages each for the code and the data .
The smaller the page size , the more pages are needed to hold the DSO .
This , in turn , means more page faults , too .
Important here is that the opposite is also true .
For larger page sizes , the number of necessary pages for the mapping ( or anonymous memory ) is reduced ; with it falls the number of page faults .
Most architectures support page sizes of 4 k .
On IA - 64 and PPC64 , page sizes of 64 k are also popular .
That means the smallest unit in which memory is given out is 64 k .
The value has to be specified when compiling the kernel and cannot be changed dynamically ( at least not at the moment ) .
The ABIs of the multiple - page - size architectures are designed to allow running an application with either page size .
The runtime will make the necessary adjustments , and a correctly - written program will not notice a thing .
Larger page sizes mean more waste through partially - used pages , but , in some situations , this is OK .
Most architectures also support very large page sizes of 1 MB or more .
Such pages are useful in some situations , too , but it makes no sense to have all memory given out in units that large .
The waste of physical RAM would simply be too large .
But very large pages have their advantages : if huge data sets are used , storing them in 2 MB pages on x86 - 64 would require 511 fewer page faults ( per large page ) than using the same amount of memory with 4 k pages .
This can make a big difference .
The solution is to selectively request memory allocation which , just for the requested address range , uses huge memory pages and , for all the other mappings in the same process , uses the normal page size .
Huge page sizes come with a price , though .
Since the physical memory used for large pages must be continuous , it might , after a while , not be possible to allocate such pages due to memory fragmentation .
prevent this .
People are working on memory defragmentation and fragmentation avoidance , but it is very complicated .
For large pages of , say , 2MB the necessary 512 consecutive pages are always hard to come by , except at one time : when the system boots up .
This is why the current solution for large pages requires the use of a special filesystem , hugetlbfs .
This pseudo filesystem is allocated on request by the system administrator by writing the number of huge pages which should be reserved to
/ proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
the number of huge pages which should be reserved .
This operation might fail if not enough continuous memory can be located .
The situation gets especially interesting if virtualization is used .
A system virtualized using the VMM model does not directly access physical memory and , therefore , cannot by itself allocate the hugetlbfs .
It has to rely on the VMM , and this feature is not guaranteed to be supported .
For the KVM model , the Linux kernel running the KVM module can perform the hugetlbfs allocation and possibly pass a subset of the pages thus allocated on to one of the guest domains .
Later , when a program needs a large page , there are multiple possibilities :
the program can use System V shared memory with the SHM_HUGETLB flag .
flag .
the hugetlbfs filesystem can actually be mounted and the program can then create a file under the mount point and use mmap to map one or more pages as anonymous memory .
In the first case , the hugetlbfs need not be mounted .
Code requesting one or more large pages could look like this :
key_t k = ftok ( " / some /key / file " , 42 ) ; int id = shmget (k , LENGTH , SHM_HUGETLB|IPC_CREAT|SHM_R|SHM_W ) ; void * a = shmat ( id , NULL , 0 ) ;
The critical parts of this code sequence are the use of the SHM_HUGETLB flag and the choice of the right value for LENGTH , which must be a multiple of the huge page size for the system .
Different architectures have different values .
The use of the System V shared memory interface has the nasty problem of depending on the key argument to differentiate ( or share ) mappings .
The ftok interface can easily produce conflicts which is why , if possible , it is better to use other mechanisms .
If the requirement to mount the hugetlbfs filesystem is not a problem , it is better to use it instead of System V shared memory .
The only real problems with using the special filesystem are that the kernel must support it , and that there is no standardized mount point yet .
Once the filesystem is mounted , for instance at / dev/ hugetlb , a program can make easy use of it :
int fd = open ( " / dev/hugetlb / file1 " , O_RDWR|O_CREAT , 0700 ) ; void * a = mmap( NULL , LENGTH , PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE , fd , 0 ) ;
By using the same file name in the open call , multiple processes can share the same huge pages and collaborate .
It is also possible to make the pages executable , in which case the PROT_EXEC flag must also be set in the mmap call .
As in the System V shared memory example , the value of LENGTH must be a multiple of the system 's huge page size .
A defensively - written program ( as all programs should be ) can determine the mount point at runtime using a function like this :
char * hugetlbfs_mntpoint( void ) { char * result = NULL ; FILE * fp = setmntent ( _PATH_MOUNTED , " r " ) ; if ( fp != NULL ) { struct mntent * m ; while ( ( m = getmntent ( fp ) ) != NULL ) if ( strcmp ( m -> mnt_fsname , " hugetlbfs " ) == 0 ) { result = strdup ( m -> mnt_dir ) ; break ; } endmntent ( fp ) ; } return result ; }
More information for both these cases can be found in the hugetlbpage .
txt file which comes as part of the kernel source tree .
The file also describes the special handling needed for IA - 64 .
Figure 7.9 : Follow with Huge Pages , NPAD=0
To illustrate the advantages of huge pages , Figure 7.9 shows the results of running the random Follow test for NPAD =0 .
This is the same data shown in Figure 3.15 , but , this time , we measure the data also with memory allocated in huge pages .
As can be seen the performance advantage can be huge .
For 220 bytes the test using huge pages is 57 % faster .
This is due to the fact that this size still fits completely into one single 2MB page and , therefore , no DTLB misses occur .
After this point , the winnings are initially smaller but grow again with increasing working set size .
The huge pages test is 38 % faster for the 512MB working set size .
The curve for the huge page test has a plateau at around 250 cycles .
Beyond working sets of 227 bytes , the numbers rise significantly again .
The reason for the plateau is that 64 TLB entries for 2 MB pages cover 227 bytes .
As these numbers show , a large part of the costs of using large working set sizes comes from TLB misses .
Using the interfaces described in this section can pay off big - time .
The numbers in the graph are , most likely , upper limits , but even real - world programs show a significant speed - up .
Databases , since they use large amounts of data , are among the programs which use huge pages today .
There is currently no way to use large pages to map file - backed data .
There is interest in implementing this capability , but the proposals made so far all involve explicitly using large pages , and they rely on the hugetlbfs filesystem .
This is not acceptable : large page use in this case must be transparent .
The kernel can easily determine which mappings are large and automatically use large pages .
A big problem is that the kernel does not always know about the use pattern .
If the memory , which could be mapped as a large page , later requires 4k - page granularity ( for instance , because the protection of parts of the memory range is changed using mprotect ) a lot of precious resources , in particular the linear physical memory , will have been wasted .
So it will certainly be some more time before such an approach is successfully implemented .

The Bank of England expects economic growth to slow
In its quarterly Inflation Report , the Bank forecast the economy would slow in 2008 and inflation would accelerate .
However , it added that even if interest rates fell by half a percentage point , it would still hit inflation targets .
Analysts said that this signals that interest rates should dip next year from their current level of 5.75 % .
The pound fell to a four year - low against the euro as investors bet that UK interest rates would be cut before their European counterparts .
Investors typically look for markets with higher interest rates as they offer better rates of return .
The pound also fell against the US dollar , though analysts pointed out that sterling had previously been trading at its highest levels against the greenback since the start of the 1980s .
" November 's Inflation Report gives a clear signal that a series of interest rate cuts lies ahead , " said Vicky Redwood , an economist at Capital Economics .
Uncertainty
The Bank warned , however , that there was a lot of uncertainty over the outlook for the economy , particularly as the world financial system was still vulnerable to further shocks from factors such as surging energy prices .
It noted there were some signs of a softening in house prices , but said that the link between the housing market and consumer spending was a complex one .
The Bank has n't ruled out some rather unpleasant scenarios ...
Evan Davis ,
BBC economics editor

At the same time , it warned that stock markets , which have rallied this year , risked a fall that could hurt the global economy .
" It 's very striking that despite developments we 've seen in the last three months , equity prices are on average higher now than they were in August , " said Mervyn King , the bank 's governor .
" There must be some downside risks there .
That 's factored into our projections .
That 's the bigger risk to the global economy , " King said .
Rate impact
In its report , the Bank forecast that growth was expected to ease as the impact of five rate rises in 15 months , the current strength of the pound and the recent uncertainty in financial markets slows the economy .

The Bank cut its 2008 economic growth forecasts to around 2.2 % , following a similar downgrade by the Treasury .
But the Bank also expects inflation to rise in the short - term as higher energy prices begin to bite .
" Today 's report appears to point to an easing in monetary policy in the months ahead to accommodate the Bank 's weaker projections for gross domestic production growth in 2008 , " said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York .
" But then somewhat higher inflation for 2008 could well prove a hindrance to the Bank 's designs on policy , " he added .
The report marks the first formal assessment of the impact of the credit crunch that has gripped markets .
All possible military initiatives to avoid those possibilities are daunting .
With 160 million people , Pakistan is more than five times the size of Iraq .
It would take a long time to move large numbers of American forces halfway across the world .
And unless we had precise information about the location of all of Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons and materials , we could not rely on bombing or using Special Forces to destroy them .
The task of stabilizing a collapsed Pakistan is beyond the means of the United States and its allies .
Rule - of - thumb estimates suggest that a force of more than a million troops would be required for a country of this size .
Thus , if we have any hope of success , we would have to act before a complete government collapse , and we would need the cooperation of moderate Pakistani forces .
One possible plan would be a Special Forces operation with the limited goal of preventing Pakistan ’s nuclear materials and warheads from getting into the wrong hands .
Given the degree to which Pakistani nationalists cherish these assets , it is unlikely the United States would get permission to destroy them .
Somehow , American forces would have to team with Pakistanis to secure critical sites and possibly to move the material to a safer place .
For the United States , the safest bet would be shipping the material to someplace like New Mexico ; but even pro-American Pakistanis would be unlikely to cooperate .
More likely , we would have to settle for establishing a remote redoubt within Pakistan , with the nuclear technology guarded by elite Pakistani forces backed up ( and watched over ) by crack international troops .
It is realistic to think that such a mission might be undertaken within days of a decision to act .
The price for rapid action and secrecy , however , would probably be a very small international coalition .
A second , broader option would involve supporting the core of the Pakistani armed forces as they sought to hold the country together in the face of an ineffective government , seceding border regions and Al Qaeda and Taliban assassination attempts against the leadership .
This would require a sizable combat force — not only from the United States , but ideally also other Western powers and moderate Muslim nations .
I AM surprised to discover that Kevin Rudd , Australia 's prime minister - elect , delivered a fairly in - depth lecture on Friedrich Hayek [ pdf ] about this time last year at the Centre for Independent Studies , a classical - liberal think tank in Sydney .
I find that fact truly amazing .
I cannot for the life of me imagine the circumstances under which , say , Hillary Clinton would end up giving a learned lecture on , say , Milton Friedman at the Cato Institute .
It 's a bit like that .
So I 'm pretty impressed .
That said , I am not surprised to discover that the leader of the Australian Labor Party is no fan of Hayek .
Nor am I surprised , though I am a bit disappointed , to see what appears to be either an ignorant or willfully erroneous intepretation of the great man 's thought .
For example , Rudd sayeth :
Hayek argues that human beings ’ altruism is a hangover from their primitive tribal experience , reinforced by religion , and must be purged if we are to optimise our individual liberty through rational self - centred participation in the market .
This is nonsense .
Hayek does not think altruism must be purged .
Hayek says , correctly , that in wealthy , advanced societies we have made a great transition from a system of personal exchange -- based on kinship ties , group solidarity , and local reputation from repeated interaction -- to an " extended order " of impersonal exchange .
Crossing the chasm from personal to impersonal exchange is the great accomplishment of civilisation enabling the health , wealth , and prosperity enjoyed in the modern world .
( This is one of the great themes in Vernon Smith 's Nobel Prize lecture , and in the recent work [ pdf ] of Nobelist Douglass North . )
However , this transition does not come about due to altruistic regard for others .
It comes about by creating impersonal substitutes for the personal trust extended to family and well - known community members .
This is a damnably hard problem we 're still struggling to understand , which is one reason development economics remains a failure .
As Mr North put it :
A lot of economic historians have spent much time considering the way in which the western world , in the last six , seven centuries , evolved a set of institutions that made cooperation in impersonal exchange worthwhile .
That is , these institutions changed the payoff so that impersonal exchange paid off and the economies of scale associated with large scale production made possible the world of relative abundance we now observe .
And Hayek 's point is that altruism is not what makes these institutions work , and so is not what is responsible for the abundance we enjoy .
But Hayek is crystal clear that altruism , fellow feeling , solidarity , etc. are what makes families and small communities work , and he specifically instructs us not to apply the artificial habits of the market to hearth and home lest we make a hash of it .
But , likewise , if we attempt to run an extended order according to our homey sentiments , we 'll trash it .
This seems to be the idea that offends the sentimental Mr Rudd .
One of Hayek 's great stengths is that he understands that the habits and mores that undergird the market order are not natural .
That 's why human beings have always been poor , except for the last couple hundred years .
Which is just to say that our incredible health , wealth , and longevity rest on a foundation of cultivated artifice that we take care to preserve .
Mr Rudd completely mangles the interpretation of Hayek on this point .
Here 's Hayek :
Rational behaviour is not a premise of economic theory , though it is often presented as such .
The basic contention of theory is rather that competition will make it necessary for people to act rationally in order to maintain themselves .
Competition is as much a method for breeding certain types of mind as anything else …
And here is Mr Rudd 's commentary on this passage :
In other words , Hayek sees the market not just as a natural expression of a pre-existing self - interested human nature – but as a mechanism for actually developing the “ selfish gene ” and liberating it from outdated moral constraints focussed on the wellbeing of others .
Huh ?
I do n't believe there is anything here about genes .
Interestingly enough , though , Hayek actually disbelieves the selfish gene hypothesis and argues that group selection is responsible for our altruistic instincts .
Anyway , the larger point is simply that the institutions that have saved us from hunger , disease , and early death require the emergence of a certain kind of culture -- certain types of mind .
If one really cares about the wellbeing of others , then one will seek to preserve this cultural endowment .
A social - democratic Care Bear stare will not do it .
Rudd 's lecture is mostly tendentious silliness , which is no surprise .
He 's a politician .
I certainly would n't expect Mrs Clinton to get Milton Friedman right , either .
But like watching a dog dancing on its hind legs , it 's pretty entertaining watching politicians discuss serious ideas at all .
Those highly motivated can find other critiques of Rudd on Hayek here and here .
Even though I understand the reasoning , my mind just wo n't accept a scenario in which billions die .
And I would add that I think some people toss those scenarios around pretty casually , without really reflecting on the horror of what it would mean if a billion plus people died of starvation .
Look at your family , imagine them starving , and then imagine this playing out on a horrific scale .
That is the reality of a billion - plus population reduction ; a reality that I honestly do n't believe our brains are equipped to handle .
We know the horror stories : Billions dead as oil depletes .
Chaos .
The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina played out on a worldwide scale .
Many rational people are anticipating this scenario .
( In case you are completely unfamiliar with the massive die - off arguments , spend some time at Die Off or Life after the Oil Crash ) .
Whether Peak Oil is on top of us now , or we have a few more years before the downturn , I think it is a problem that we will soon face .
I believe that those born in the 1990's and beyond - like my kids - will grow up in a world of declining energy resources .
And because like most parents I am deeply concerned about my children 's futures , I am deeply concerned about the ramifications of Peak Oil .
Not a day goes by that I am not thinking about how this is all going to play out .
A lot of variables are going to come into play .
How much time do we have ?
Will our political leaders ever pass energy legislation that truly helps to mitigate falling production ?
Will production plateau for a few years and then decline , or will it peak sharply and decline at 5 % or more each year ?
Will we see a totally unanticipated technology breakthrough ?
But for me , I think the most important question is :
How fast can we change ?
Powering Down
I drive a car that gets 50 mpg , and I do n't drive it that many miles a year .
My family will tell you that I keep the house too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter .
In fact , I almost always wear a jacket in the house during the winter .
I am obsessive over our programmable thermostat ; I do n't want energy wasted when nobody is home .
My direct fossil fuel usage is maybe 25 % of the average usage for the U.S. , and well less than the average for the U.K .
( Indirect usage - like fossil fuels to produce the food I eat - is much harder to estimate , but one way I minimize this is by minimizing the meat in my diet ) .
I do n't behave like this because I am cheap .
( Do n't ask my wife about that ) .
I try to minimize my fossil fuel usage because 1 ) .
I want to be prepared to make do with less in the near future ; 2 ) .
I want to know just how low I can reasonably go if things get really bad ; 3 ) .
I am aware of the negative environmental externalities of using fossil fuels ; and 4 ) .
I want to set a good example .
But if the stakes were high , could I cut my direct fossil fuel usage even more than I already have ?
Yes , I think I could still cut it in half .
I have given a lot of thought to what I would do if the gas stations were out of fuel tomorrow .
It would n't be a fun exercise .
But I do n't think it would be immediately life - threatening either .
So , if I have identified areas that I can still cut if I have to - and conservation is already very important to me - then I imagine the average person has a lot of consumption that they can cut .
Those long commutes ?
If you had to cut your gasoline usage in half , you would search hard for a car pool or public transportation .
In the longer term you would get the most fuel efficient car you could get .
You would start cutting out unnecessary trips .
At home , you would start to adjust your thermostat and be more aware of lights and TVs that are habitually left on .
Do n't get me wrong .
I do n't expect this to be a picnic .
I do n't expect technology to save us , but I also do n't expect this to be the end of civilization .
On the other hand , I do n't completely discount the worst - case scenarios .
I do allow for the possibility .
But I think what we are likely to see is that people will start to Power Down when supplies start to shrink and fossil fuels become much more expensive .
The best possible situation in my opinion is for Peak Lite to play out for several years before true peak .
This will provide for a less rapid loss of available supplies , and would give us a better chance at managing a Power Down .
Conclusion : Planning for the Worst
My personal plans do involve preparing for the possibility that I could be wrong .
You do n't prepare for a disaster only if you know there is going to be a disaster .
You try to plan for worst case scenarios that have a reasonable probability of occurring .
( I have no plan for a Texas - sized asteroid impact ) .
So this is what I have attempted to do .
I have no debt .
My savings are protected against both energy inflation and a collapsing dollar .
The value of my profession should increase as energy supplies become tighter .
My family has a fair amount of farmland , and I also have my eye on farmland in several locations that I think would fare well if things go sour .
I have a decent amount of food in storage .
But I am hopeful that I never have to put my plans into action .
If we can change fast enough , I do n't think I will have to .
Governments could play a huge role here by getting serious about a long - term energy strategy .
But on this point , I do n't hold out much hope as it would require that the public is asked to sacrifice - usually not something that will make you popular when running for reelection .
It would also require that the rosy scenarios painted by the EIA are discounted for more conservative assumptions about future supplies .
I think our next best hope is for Peak Oil to soon be widely recognized as a serious threat , and then we have a plateau or slow decline so that governments have some time to get their acts together .
But I think this is going to require a few more price spikes ( $ 100 oil ? ) before Peak Oil becomes conventional wisdom .
Note
I posted this essay first on my blog , and several commented that it was uncharacteristically dark for me .
It certainly was n't intended to be .
Rather , I am trying to share the constant internal debate that I go through regarding Peak Oil .
Where I am at is that I am optimistic , because we do have great capacity for change .
On the other hand , I am an optimist by nature , and I recognize this .
So I am able to step into the role of pessimist and take the worst - case scenarios seriously enough to have contingency plans .
Coming Soon
As I wrote in the March 4 , 2007 Drumbeat :
So , count me among those who still do n't think Saudi has peaked .
If fact , I think you will see their decline stop by summer , and if demand picks up you will see their production head back up .
If that happens , I suspect a lot of people around here are suddenly going to develop amnesia regarding all the predictions that have been made .
I took a lot of flack ( to put it mildly ) earlier in the year regarding my arguments on Saudi , but it is about time to revisit those involuntary decline scenarios that were so popular in early 2007 - when I was predicting the decline would soon stop .
Those who favored the involuntary decline hypothesis may want to go back and look at where Saudi production was predicted to be in late 2007 based on assumptions of no spare production and an involuntary production decline .
Even if we discount Saudi 's recent announcements that they will raise production , steady production is inconsistent with involuntary decline and no spare capacity .
While this does n't settle the question of whether Saudi has peaked , their steady production is in the process of falsifying those declining trendlines that were predicting 8 million bpd or lower by year end .
Earlier this year I allowed myself to get dragged into endless debates over this issue , when it clearly would not be illuminated until later in the year .
Well , later in the year is here , and Saudi production has been constant since February .
At the latest , I will take a look back in a year - end post in which I will also discuss the results - win or lose - of the $ 1000 bet on oil prices ; a bet that I made because of my confidence that Saudi was voluntarily reducing production to keep prices high , and that they were sitting on some spare capacity .
The collapsing dollar has made this interesting , but I still think we will end up closer to my predicted year end of $ 73.50 than $ 100 .

For the last couple of years , I ’ve been working with mid-size and large UK bookmakers , trying to introduce agile development practices into those environments on several projects .
Although for most of the readers of this blog using agile practices is no longer a question , agile development is fairly rare when it comes to databases , and all these systems were heavily database - centric .
About a year ago , I finally found the right formula to do agile development on top of big legacy databases .
I presented my experiences at XpDay 07 in London , on a session called “ Fighting the monster - agile development on top of legacy databases ” .
This is the content from that presentation .
Just so that nobody gets offended , I ’m not talking about legacy as in “ end of lifecycle ” .
These products are still heavily developed and will stay in production for the years to come .
My rule of thumb to decide if something is legacy or not is whether the design can easily be fixed .
If you spot an obvious design problem , know how to improve that , but the thought about consequences gives you a stomach ache - you are facing a legacy system .
Fighting the legacy
There are two recurring patterns with legacy databases that slow down development .
One is that the legacy databases will typically have inconsistent interfaces with a lot of overhead , due to organic growth over the years .
As the application blocks are being developed , redundant procedures , parameters and database objects are being put into the database .
Because there is no refactoring implemented in these systems , old interfaces stay there as well as new ones .
A single conceptual entity , like a customer , might be split into three tables with three different identifiers .
This slows down the development because you often need to talk to the original author of the code in order to use it .
The second recurring problem is that the legacy code could change and break compatibility without any warnings .
Although the system is hard to change , there are other teams working on it and other projects going on .
They might change a seemingly unrelated part of the system and your code just stops working one day , with no obvious reason .
So the first best practice to work with legacy databases is Build a solid foundation .
While developing the stuff that ’s really needed , build a foundation to clean up the interfaces in parallel - like a facade to the underlying functions of the system .
For example , when there are multiple customer identifiers in the system , you can select one type of identifier and use it consistently , then convert between that one and other types in the facade .
So the code that is really part of our project does not talk to legacy structures directly , but talks to an interface layer in the database , which then talks to the rest of the system .
What ’s interesting with this layer and tests is that you are bound to find bugs in the underlying system from time to time .
If they can get fixed in real - time , then it might be worth waiting for a proper fix .
If not , then a workaround must be developed in that facade layer and wait for the proper fix to come out .
All in all , that part of the code is not really something nice to see , but it keeps the rest of the system clean .
And that ’s where all the unexpected changes coming from the core had to stop .
In the language of domain - driven design , this kind of structure is called an “ anti-corruption layer ” , to point out that one of its main goals is to prevent problems from propagating from the core .
For this anti-corruption system to work , something has to raise the flag when there is a change ( and believe me it is when , not if ) .
In normal projects , that something are typically tests , so this thing should be covered with tests particularly well .
However , this leaves us with a problem of writing database tests , which is easier said than done .
Database testing is hard
Agile practices and databases do not often go hand in hand .
For start , most of the innovation today is in the object - oriented and web space , so database tools are a bit behind .
Compared to say Idea or Eclipse , the best IDE available for Oracle PL / SQL development is still in ice age .
In Java we are used to having the flexibility of using automated refactoring tools and unit tests and most people take them for granted now .
In the database world , support for those practices is either very basic or non existent .
The other major problem with agile and databases is that the database code is inherently hard to test .
Integrity constraints and triggers prevent you from doing things in isolation .
So forget about mocks .
And as the code in the database revolves around data manipulation , it is quite often data driven and requires a lot of data set - up for proper testing .
I mentioned that I tried to introduce agile practices into this environment several times .
I have noticed that the database developers typically did a bit of manual validations , but generally waited for the front - end guys to finish their work and then for QA test the underlying DB code through the front - end .
I was amazed how this thing could work at all , and of course it did not .
So the first thing I tried to do is to sit down with one of the database developers and start writing unit tests with JUnit , calling DB code .
We started flushing out bugs and had some unit test coverage , which was a step in the right direction .
However , it was not an easy win , and the testing did not take hold as I expected .
Database developers could not really write tests on their own , they needed someone with Java knowledge to do that .
So the feedback loop increases , and you really need it to be quick for unit tests to be effective .
Writing those tests was really , really painful because of all the boilerplate code and the fact that Java was not designed to play with relational models .
We started looking for PL / SQL tools for unit testing and found two , but that did not help .
The test code was so ugly that no one wanted to write it .
Writing tests was simply seen as a too big overhead .
When I looked away , they were no longer doing it .
At that time , I did not realise the core of the problem : OO tools and OO - like testing are not good for relational models .
All the buzz about object - relational mismatch over the last few years was mostly about relational models getting in the way of object development .
Now I was on the other side of the problem , with object tools getting in the way of relational testing .
When there is no good support for unit tests , all other agile practices are pretty hard to implement .
That is why database developers often discard agile practices altogether as something that does not apply to databases .
However , agile ideas make as much sense for database code as for anything else , they are just harder to implement .
Fighting the attitude
Because there are no automated tests , an implicit code ownership system typically develops .
Code ownership inhibits change and slows you down , so it has to be abandoned .
But it is not easy to change the way people work , especially when you try to attack something that is established as deeply as code ownership typically is .
The problem here is not to teach people how to use a new tool , but to fight the conservative attitude .
In order to make such a big step , you need people who are enthusiastic about the change , not just compliant .
If they are just compliant , then they will continue working as they were when you look away – like in my attempt with xUnit tests .
From my experience , one of the easiest ways to get developers enthusiastic about something is to reduce the amount of dull work they have to do .
Luckily for us , test - driven development has that effect on people .
It helps to provide the focus for development , because tests are a target for the code that you are about to write .
It also helps flush out bugs earlier , and reduce the effort people have to spend on support .
But in order to get the benefits of TDD , I still had to solve the problem of database developers not being able to write unit tests effectively .
FIT +FitNesse+DbFit=good
DB unit test tool
FIT seemed like a very good start .
FIT is an acceptance testing framework developed by Ward Cunningam , which is customer oriented and has nothing to do with database unit tests whatsoever .
But FIT tests are described as tables , which is much more like the relational model than Java code .
FIT also has a nice Web - wiki front - end called FitNesse , which allows DB developers to write tests on their own , without help from Java or .NET developers .
The only problem is that support for executing database code directly from FitNesse was very basic .
So I set down one friday evening and wrote a simple interface to execute stored procedures and run queries directly from FitNesse over the weekend .
In order for people to use this , testing stored procedures had to be easier then basic manual verifications in PL / SQL .
So I made it to automatically do whatever it can - read types and sizes from the meta - data , manage transactions , cursors and other stuff .
People did not have to declare variables , specify column sizes , compare values by hand - it was easier to write a test then do a manual validation .
So that reduced the dull work .
I called that library DbFit .
It took a few weeks for this to settle down , but this time , with completely different results .
People from other projects started coming to see how this testing thing was working .
I set up a FitNesse server for people to play with , and occasionally you could see a new group of tests popping up there for something completely unrelated to my project .
The project was published under GPL in March this year .
It was picked up by InfoQ , then other folks started sending in their requests and contributions .
The project is now hosted on Sourceforge , supports MySQL , SQLServer and Oracle , and Java /.NET integration tests .
Introducing DbFit
With DbFit , writing a database unit test became easier than doing a manual validation .
Here is what it looks like .
That is a test for a stored procedure that concatenates strings .
Fit tests are essentially tables , that have both test parameters and expected outcomes .
To execute a stored procedure , the table should be called Execute Procedure , with the procedure to call specified in second column .
Input and output parameters are listed in the second row .
Notice that the third parameter has a question mark , meaning that it is an output parameter - so the table specifies an expected value here .
We can stack up several parameter combinations in one table , just by appending columns .
When we run the test , DbFit will call the procedure for every combination of input parameters , and verify that output parameter values match what we expected .
This may be a basic example , but if you have ever tried to write a similar unit test in PL / SQL , the code for that would have been at least 20 lines long and very ugly .
Because of the tabular view , it is also easy to spot eventual problems .
This also works on tables and views .
The Insert command puts in data .
Again , second row lists the table structure , then comes the data .
We can test this by running a Query , which is a similar table but extracts data out .
If the Query returns different data , the tabular format makes it very easy to see what ’s wrong .
Insert and Query can be used to prepare data for a Java or .NET integration test , and verify the results after .
In that case , we typically need to fetch an autogenerated ID , and then use that ID in further tests .
DbFit makes it easy to pull out data by using FitNesse symbols – which are global variables .
The syntax is really simple >> variable reads data out , << uses the variable .
DbFit makes those symbols automatically available as bound variables for queries .
Behind the scenes DbFit looks at the database metadata to set all those parameters correctly .
It also manages transactions so tests are repeatable automatically - notice that there was no rollback anywhere in the tests .
The data is set up and verified in a tabular form , so you can set up quite a lot easily .
There is one more trick , very useful for legacy databases .
Because results are in the same form as tests , we can write a test without expected results , run it to make it fail , copy the results into notepad , and with a bit of clean up copy back into FitNesse as a test .
So regression tests can be written very efficiently .
Fight against duplication
One of the most important principles for effective development is Do n’t repeat yourself , or DRY .
When databases come into play , this relates to avoiding to replicate the definition of a single entity in several places - in the database scripts , the live database and object code .
Most folks today are now excited about Rails migrations and similar code management techniques , as a way to avoid the duplication .
It ’s an idea to use your active database as an authoritative source on the structures and objects , and maintain the upgrade scripts for incremental versions .
That ’s all nice when you have one version of the database , but when multiple versions come into play , especially after several years of development , this fails .
The DRY principle here asks for the binary database to be an authoritative source , but binary versions are hard to keep in sync with the version control system , especially when your database is a 50G bunch of binary tablespaces .
There is no simple way to track changes , so the whole version control system becomes pointless .
But there is a different approach .
With a database - centric system , like it or not , the database is your master source .
But it does not have to be the binary one .
You can keep to the DRY principle - but maintain just the files .
Text files , so they are easy to tag , diff , and can be kept along with the .NET and Java source files in the same repository .
There are two choices – “ create ” files or “ upgrade ” files .
Upgrade scripts are no good when you want to find out a definition of an object , because you have to look through partial change files .
“ Create ” files are a much better choice , because they contain the complete definition , can be diffed , tagged and nicely fit into the version control .
The only problem with “ Create ” scripts is that you cannot deliver them – rollouts to customers have to be incremental .
But the updates are produced only when you release , and then are frozen in time .
With a bit of smart file organisation , “ create ” files can be converted into “ update ” files easily .
That ’s a completely different topic , but if you are interested in that , contact me and I ’ll be happy to help you set it up .
On the end , we have not made it completely automated , but we brought manual work down to about one hour before each release , which was good enough .
What you also definitely want to do with a legacy database is to take DRY principle a bit further and generate all the glue code between layers – especially between the database and object code .
Tools like ANLTR and Velocity can be used to build .NET and Java wrappers for stored procedures from DB metadata .
This should build all the boilerplate code we really do not want to write all the time and synchronise with the database .
With that system in place , automated build process can regenerate classes from PL / SQL code , and that practically gives us compile - time checking from the DB upwards to client objects to Java and .NET - this is really invaluable .
If someone changes the signature of a stored procedure , automated build will break the Java code straight away .
Without such a system , problems caused by DB changes might not get caught until deployment to the client ’s site .
Going for the kill
With those tools in place , everything starts coming together .
“ Create ” scripts enable us easily to build the database , and glue code generators then rebuild Java /.NET code .
FitNesse and DbFit tests can then verify the functionality .
Because FitNesse is already integrated with CruiseControl , the whole process can easily run from a continuous integration server .
Conclusions
Agile practices make as much sense for the database as for anything else , they are just ( a bit ) harder to implement
To change the way people work , you need to get them enthusiastic , not compliant .
In order to get developers enthusiastic , focus on reducing dull work
DbFit solves two major problems with TDD of DB code : object - relational mismatch and DB specialists not being to write tests efficiently .
Here is a summary of best practices for developing on top of a legacy database :
Build a reliable foundation
Simplify legacy APIs
Kill code ownership
Use version - control friendly files
Generate glue between layers

Half of Americans now say Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when the United States invaded the country in 2003 — up from 36 percent last year , a Harris poll finds .
Pollsters deemed the increase both “ substantial ” and “ surprising ” in light of persistent press reports to the contrary in recent years .
The survey did not speculate on what caused the shift in opinion , which supports President Bush ’s original rationale for going to war .
Respondents were questioned in early July after the release of a Defense Department intelligence report that revealed coalition forces recovered 500 aging chemical weapons containing mustard or sarin gas nerve agents in Iraq .
“ Filled and unfilled pre-Gulf War chemical munitions are assessed to still exist , ” said Sen . Rick Santorum , Pennsylvania Republican , during a June 21 press conference detailing the newly declassified information .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra , chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , who shared the podium , said , “ Iraq was not a WMD - free zone . ”
In recent weeks , the Michigan Republican has recommended that more material confiscated since the invasion be declassified and made public , including a 1998 standing order to Iraqi officials to hide or destroy weapons and thus evade inspectors from the United Nations .
Meanwhile , the Harris poll offered some positive feedback on Iraq .
Seventy - two percent of respondents said the Iraqi people are better off now than under Saddam Hussein ’s regime — a figure similar to that of 2004 , when it stood at 76 percent .
In addition , 64 percent say Saddam had “ strong links ” with al Qaeda , up from 62 percent in October 2004 .
Fifty - five percent said that “ history will give the U.S. credit for bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq . ”
And although the response is tepid , American confidence in the Iraqis has improved : 37 percent said Iraq would succeed in creating a stable democracy , up five points since November .
Americans remain in touch with the realities of Iraq : 61 percent said the conflict has motivated more Islamic terrorists to attack the U.S. — a number that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004 .
An additional 41 percent say the war has reduced the threat of another major terrorist attack in the United States , a sentiment also unchanged in the past two years .
The financial burden of the war may be less keenly felt .
The poll found that 56 percent said spending “ huge amounts ” for ongoing military efforts in Iraq means less funds are available to protect Americans at home .
The figure was 62 percent last year , but 51 percent in 2004 .
Has the war earned respect for the U.S. overseas ?
Sixty - eight percent said “ no , ” the same as last year .
The figure stood at 62 percent in 2004 .
The poll of 1,020 adults was conducted July 5 to 11 and has a margin of error of three percentage points .

The consequences of Giuliani’s ‘ 9/11 Tourette’s ’
About a month ago , at one of the debates for Republican presidential candidates , Rudy Giuliani said , “ The reality is that I ’m not running on what I did on September 11th . ”
He managed to say it with a straight face .
It seemed like an amusing comment , of course , given how often the former mayor cites the 9/11 attacks , seemingly in response to every question .
Jon Stewart recently described it as “ 9/11 Tourette’s . ”
But is it really as bad as Giuliani ’s critics suggest ?
The New York Daily News ’ Helen Kennedy took a look at how the candidate has incorporated the attacks into various unrelated matters .
And when I say “ various , ” I mean “ every . ”
* Explaining his flip - flop on gun control : “ There are some major intervening events – Sept. 11 – which cast somewhat of a different light on the Second Amendment . ”
* Explaining why he interrupts speeches to take calls from his wife : “ Since Sept. 11 , most of the time when we get on a plane we talk to each other and just reaffirm the fact that we love each other . ”
* Defending his support for a wall along the Mexican border : “ I support security at the borders .
I think security is enormously important in the post - Sept. 11 period .
I think we have to know who ’s coming into this country . ”
* Explaining why he wears an American flag lapel pin : “ Each time I wear it , it reminds me of Sept. 11 . ”
* Responding to a question about funding AIDS drugs : “ I do n’t want to promise you the federal government will take over the role .
My general experience has been that the federal government works best when it helps and assists and encourages and sets guidelines on a state - by - state , locality - by - locality basis .
It ’s no different from the way I look at homeland security .
Maybe having been mayor of the city , I know that your first defense against terrorist attack is that local police station , or that local firehouse . ”
* Responding to a question about his religiosity : “ I need God ’s help for everything , and I probably feel that the most when I ’m in crisis and under pressure , like Sept. 11 , when I was dealing with prostate cancer , or when I ’m trying to explain death to people . ”
* Explaining why he chastises Democrats : “ They do not seem to get the fact that there are people – terrorists in this world , really dangerous people – that want to come here and kill us .
That in fact they did come here and kill us . ”
* Responding to a question about his scandalous personal life : “ You can judge me on my public record .
I ’ve had a long one .
I ’ve had an intense one .
I ’ve been under enormous pressure , took over a city that was the crime capital of America , had to handle the city at the very end , when it was part of the worst attack on America . ”
A month ago today , Giuliani told a Florida audience , “ For me , every day is an anniversary of Sept. 11 . ”
If only that were an exaggeration .
I ’m delighted and honored to welcome Dr. Trita Parsi as a guest columnist at Rootless Cosmopolitan .
Following the escalating tension between Iran and the West over the past two years , I ’ve found Trita to be a singular voice of sanity in the proverbial world gone mad .
As both a scholar and as president of the National Iranian - American Council , he has dedicated himself to promoting dialogue and peace , and he had a particularly important role in bringing to light the 2003 proposal sent from the leadership in Tehran to the Bush Administration , offering a grand bargain in which Iran would address all U.S. concerns — a proposal that was sharply rebuffed by the Bush Administration , under the sway of neocons determined to prevent any rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran .
Trita ’s new book Treacherous Alliance – the Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran and the United States , ( Yale University Press , 2007 ) is an absolute must - read , precisely because it cuts so decisively through the rhetoric and obfuscation that fills media coverage of the issue , and makes clear that the relationship is managed on an unsentimental , national - interests basis by all sides .
The tributes alone tell you this is an important book , welcomed by such diverse players as former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben Ami , John Mearshimer ( as in Mearsheimer and Walt , whose Israel lobby book quotes extensively from Trita ’s work ) , Francis Fukuyama and Zbigniew Brezinski .
In other words , it could just as easily have been subtitled “ A grownup guide to the Iran - Israel - U.S. relationship . ”
Trita interviewed 130 key players in the strategic decision - making echelon in Iran , Israel and the U.S. — a unique achievement in itself — to produce a fascinating account of the sober national - interest considerations that have driven , and continue to drive both the alliances and the tensions between those three .
To anyone following the Iran - Contra affair in the 1980s , it ought to have been very clear that Israel was not unduly worried about Ayatollah Khomeini ’s revolutionary Iran being a “ new Nazi Germany , ” as today ’s rhetoric would have it — after all , Israel was actually delivering weapons to Iran on behalf of the Reagan Administration .
The fact that today , these two countries that share a strategic rivalry with the Arab world are , rhetorically at least , at one another ’s throats is also based on each side ’s reading of its strategic interest : Israel began talking up an Iran threat in the early ’90s in order to maintain its privileged position in U.S. national security policy in the wake of the Gulf War ; Iran began championing the Palestinian cause , and Palestinian rejectionism , as a way of pressuring Arab governments to counter its potential isolation in the region during the post - Gulf War period .
And as Trita explains here , Benjamin Netanyahu had a most unexpected take on the matter .
Read on — it ’s the first ever Rootless Cosmopolitan piece with footnotes ! — and , more importantly , buy this book !
Iran , the Inflatable Bogey
By Dr. Trita Parsi
Benjamin Netanyahu would like Americans and Israelis to believe that it ’s 1938 all over again : Iran , he tells us , is Nazi Germany ; President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is Hitler .
And , of course , that means that anyone who advocates diplomacy and engagement with Tehran is simply reprising the tragic appeasement politics of Neville Chamberlain , even as the clock ticks towards catastrophe .
The 1938 analogy is entirely fallacious , but no less powerful because of it – by at once terrifying people and negating the alternatives to confrontation , it paints war as a necessary evil forced on the West by a foe as deranged and implacable as Hitler was .
If Iran is , as Netanyahu and his allies in the U.S. suggest , irrationally aggressive , prone to a suicidal desire for apocalyptic confrontation , then both diplomacy and deterrence and containment are ruled out as policy options for Washington .
The “ Mad Mullahs , ” as the neocons call them , are not capable of traditional balance of power realism .
In the arguments of Netanyahu and such fellow travelers as Norman Podhortez and Newt Gingrich , to imagine that war against the regime in Tehran is avoidable is to be as naïve as Chamberlain was in 1938 .
However , as I discovered in the course of researching my book Treacherous Alliance – the Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran and the United States , not only does Netanyahu ’s characterization of Iran have little relationship to reality ; Netanyahu himself knows this better than most .
Outside of the realm of cynical posturing by politicians , most Israeli strategists recognize that Iran represents a strategic challenge to the favorable balance of power enjoyed by Israel and the U.S. in the Middle East over the past 15 years , but it is no existential threat to the Israel , the U.S. or the Arab regimes .
And that was the view embraced by the Likud leader himself during his last term as prime minister of Israel .
In the course of dozens of interviews with key players in the Israeli strategic establishment , a fascinating picture emerged of Netanyahu strongly pushing back against the orthodoxy of his Labor Party predecessors , Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , which treated Iran as one of Israel ’s primary enemies .
Not only that , he initiated an extensive discreet program of reaching out to the Islamic Republic .
When he took office in June of 1996 , the U.S. - educated Likud leader sought not only to undo the peace process with the PLO and the land - for - peace formula ; he also sought a return to Israel ’s longstanding strategic doctrine of the periphery – the idea that the Jewish State ’s security was best achieved by forming secret or not - so - secret alliances with the non-Arab states in the periphery of the Middle East – primarily Turkey and Iran – in order to balance the Arabs in Israel ’s vicinity .
Such a shift required efforts to undo Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin ’s rhetoric on Iran – deemed “ exaggerated and self - defeating ” by many in Israel at the time – as well as attempts to quietly reach out to Tehran . [ 1 ]
Unlike his Labor predecessors , Netanyahu chose to follow the recommendations of an internal Israeli government report on how to address the Iranian challenge , which had concluded that Labor ’s inflammatory rhetoric had only attracted Iran ’s attention and strengthened Iran ’s perception of an Israeli threat , which in turn had made Israel less rather than more secure . [ 2 ]
( Even though Israeli intelligence discovered the existence of an Iranian missile program in late 1994 , there was widespread recognition in Israel that Iran ’s rearming , its missile program and even its potential nuclear program were not aimed at Israel . [ 3 ] )
One of Netanyahu ’s first orders of business as Prime Minister was to request an intelligence assessment of Israel ’s security environment from both the Mossad and the military intelligence .
The debate between these agencies was the same as in the 1980s – did Iran or Iraq constitute the greatest threat to Israel ?
And could Iran be relied upon to balance Iraq ?
The assessments were presented at a full cabinet meeting .
Major General Amos Gilad represented the military and Uzi Arad , the Director of Intelligence of the Mossad , argued on behalf of the intelligence services .
While the debate was heated and passionate – as all cabinet discussions were in the Netanyahu government – the outcome was unprecedented .
Gilad argued that Iran had replaced Iraq as an existential threat to Israel .
First , the Iranian regime was hostile to Israel and determined to destroy the Jewish State .
Gilad dismissed the notion that moderates would get the upper hand in Iran and argued for the opposite scenario .
“ I presented a tough line that claimed that Iran would be dominated by the conservatives . …
This was at the level of strategic intentions , ” the Major General explained to me .
Second , the Iranian capabilities had grown , particularly through Tehran ’s missile program .
Gilad asserted that the Iranians would have Israel within reach of their missiles by 1999 .
The third component was Iran ’s nuclear development program .
“ Even one primitive device is enough to destroy Israel , ” Gilad maintained .
“ Altogether , it seemed that ideologically and strategically , Iran [ was ] determined to destroy Israel , ” Gilad concluded . [ 4 ]
Arad presented a radically different perspective .
He argued that Iran ’s rearmament was defensive and primarily aimed at deterring Saddam Hussein .
Iran needed to rearm due to the natural continuation of its enmity with the Arab states ; after all , Iran and Iraq had yet to sign a conclusive peace treaty .
Furthermore , Iran was in debt , the internal political situation was unstable , and oil prices were low .
All of this reduced Iran ’s ability to pose a threat , Arad argued , whereas Iraq – with its existing Scud missiles , of which 39 had been fired at Israel during the Persian Gulf War – was a proven danger . [ 5 ]
In fact , the Arabs ’ perception of Iran as a threat could give life to the periphery doctrine again , leading to an Israeli - Iranian re-alignment to counter the common Arab threat .
The heart of Arad ’s argument was that Israel had a choice : it could either make itself Iran ’s prime enemy by continuing Peres and Rabin ’s belligerent rhetoric , or it could ease off the pressure and allow the Iranians to feel a greater threat from other regional actors .
( At the time , Iran had the hated Saddam regime to the West and a mortal enemy in the Taliban to the East , the latter together with Pakistan both being clients of the Saudi regime that had backed Saddam in his war against Iran . )
“ There are enough bad guys around them ; we do n’t have to single out ourselves as the enemy , ” went Arad ’s argument . [ 6 ]
Israel should remain cautious and pursue a policy of wait and see whether Iran ’s ambitions went beyond its legitimate defense needs . [ 7 ]
Most importantly , Israel should avoid continuing the pattern of rhetorical escalation with Iran that had characterized the stance of the previous two Labor governments .
“ We needed to tone down , ” said Shlomo Brom , who was a member of the original Iran committee . [ 8 ]
Netanyahu listened carefully as the two sides fought it out .
Gilad spoke with great confidence , knowing very well that no Prime Minister had ever dismissed the findings of the military ’s National Intelligence Assessment .
And with the Israeli tendency to embrace doomsday scenarios and treat nuanced and slightly optimistic assessments with great suspicion , the odds were on his side .
But Netanyahu ’s response left Gilad baffled .
In an unprecedented move , the Prime Minister rejected the National Intelligence Assessment and instead adopted Arad ’s recommendation of reducing tensions with Iran . [ 9 ]
Much to Gilad ’s frustration , Netanyahu focused on Arafat and the Palestinian threat instead of Iran and put a complete end to Israel ’s confrontational rhetoric against Tehran .
It was a major policy shift that affected all levels of Israel ’s planning vis-à - vis Iran .
“ Until the Netanyahu government , there was a proliferation of Israeli statements trying to deter Iran , warning Iran , the long arm of the Israeli air force etc .
That was stopped , to his credit , by Netanyahu , ” Ehud Yaari of Israel ’s Channel 2 explains . [ 10 ]
Israeli media sympathetic to the Likud government ’s shift on Iran argued that the previous Labor government was to blame for the escalation with Iran , citing the efforts of Uri Lubrani , Israel ’s former head of mission to Iran during the 1970s , to convince the Clinton Administration to finance a coup d’état in Iran in the early 1990s .
The publication of the Labor initiative had “ caused huge damage to Israel , ” unnamed Israeli intelligence officials told Israel ’s Channel 2 .
The Netanyahu government viewed these statements as counterproductive and sought to avoid such entanglement with the Iranians .
“ He [ Netanyahu ] did n’t want to use rhetoric that would just antagonize them [ the Iranians ] for no reason , ” Dore Gold , foreign policy advisor to Netanyahu and Israel ’s UN Ambassador explains . [ 11 ]
But Netanyahu went beyond just lowering the rhetoric .
He tried to reach an understanding with Iran though the help of prominent Iranian Jews [ 12 ] , he stopped Israeli attacks on Iran within international organizations [ 13 ]
, he arranged for meetings between Iranian and Israeli representatives at European think tanks [ 14 ]
, and he encouraged Israeli parliamentarians to reach out to their Iranian counterparts at meetings of the Inter - Parliamentarian Union .
At one point , he even sought Kazakh and Russian mediation between Iran and Israel .
In December 1996 , Kazakhstan ’soil minister , Nurlen Balgimbaev , who enjoyed excellent ties with Tehran , visited Israel for medical treatment and was approached about arranging a dialogue with Iran to discuss ways to reduce tensions between the two countries . [ 15 ]
None of his efforts bore any fruit , though .
Iran ’s dismissal of Israel ’s conciliatory signals convinced the Netanyahu government that just like in the Iran Contra affair , Tehran only wanted to mend fences with the U.S. and had no real interest in rebuilding its ties with Israel .
Therein , of course , lay the real threat from Iran .
The Israelis saw danger in a rapprochement between Tehran and Washington , believing this would inevitably see the U.S. sacrifice some of its support for Israel in order to find a larger accommodation with Iran , in pursuit of U.S. strategic interests in the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea .
Iran would become emboldened and the U.S. would no longer seek to contain its growth .
The balance of power would shift from Israel towards Iran and the Jewish State would no longer be able rely on Washington to control Tehran .
“ The Great Satan will make up with Iran and forget about Israel , ” Gerald Steinberg of Bar Ilan University in Israel noted . [ 16 ]
Israel ’s relative regional importance to the U.S. would decline with a warming of ties between Washington and Tehran .
So , after nine months of courting Tehran , Netanyahu gave up and reverted back to the Peres - Rabin policy of vilifying Iran and seeking its international isolation .
Today , Israel is facing a similar situation , but with one big difference .
Iran is far more powerful than it was in 1996 , while the power of the U.S. to impose its will in the Middle East has diminished considerably .
The difficulties confronting the U.S. in Iraq and technological progress in Iran ’s nuclear program may compel Washington to recognize that its best interests lie in a grand bargain with Tehran .
But the general view in Israel today is the notion that such negotiations must be prevented , because all potential outcomes of a U.S. - Iran negotiation are perceived to be less optimal for Israel than the status quo of intense U.S. - Iran enmity that threatens to boil over into a military clash .
It ’s precisely to prevent such engagement between Washington and Tehran that Netanyahu and company are pressing the 1938 analogy .
( In Treacherous Alliance , I explain how Israel ’s fear of a U.S. - Iran dialogue is misplaced and that it actually is through a U.S. - Iran rapprochement that the Jewish state best can secure its interest and change Iran ’s aggressive behavior towards Israel . )

The type of board and connector used for RAM in desktop computers has evolved over the past few years .
The first types were proprietary , meaning that different computer manufacturers developed memory boards that would only work with their specific systems .
Then came SIMM , which stands for single in - line memory module .
This memory board used a 30 - pin connector and was about 3.5 x .75 inches in size ( about 9 x 2 cm ) .
In most computers , you had to install SIMMs in pairs of equal capacity and speed .
This is because the width of the bus is more than a single SIMM .
For example , you would install two 8 - megabyte ( MB ) SIMMs to get 16 megabytes total RAM .
Each SIMM could send 8 bits of data at one time , while the system bus could handle 16 bits at a time .
Later SIMM boards , slightly larger at 4.25 x 1 inch ( about 11 x 2.5 cm ) , used a 72 - pin connector for increased bandwidth and allowed for up to 256 MB of RAM .
As processors grew in speed and bandwidth capability , the industry adopted a new standard in dual in - line memory module ( DIMM ) .
With a whopping 168 - pin or 184 - pin connector and a size of 5.4 x 1 inch ( about 14 x 2.5 cm ) , DIMMs range in capacity from 8 MB to 1 GB per module and can be installed singly instead of in pairs .
Most PC memory modules and the modules for the Mac G5 systems operate at 2.5 volts , while older Mac G4 systems typically use 3.3 volts .
Another standard , Rambus in - line memory module ( RIMM ) , is comparable in size and pin configuration to DIMM but uses a special memory bus to greatly increase speed .

Many brands of notebook computers use proprietary memory modules , but several manufacturers use RAM based on the small outline dual in - line memory module ( SODIMM ) configuration .
SODIMM cards are small , about 2 x 1 inch ( 5 x 2.5 cm ) , and have 144 or 200 pins .
Capacity ranges from 16 MB to 1 GB per module .
To conserve space , the Apple iMac desktop computer uses SODIMMs instead of the traditional DIMMs .
Sub -notebook computers use even smaller DIMMs , known as MicroDIMMs , which have either 144 pins or 172 pins .
Most memory available today is highly reliable .
Most systems simply have the memory controller check for errors at start - up and rely on that .
Memory chips with built - in error - checking typically use a method known as parity to check for errors .
Parity chips have an extra bit for every 8 bits of data .
The way parity works is simple .
Let 's look at even parity first .
When the 8 bits in a byte receive data , the chip adds up the total number of 1s .
If the total number of 1s is odd , the parity bit is set to 1 .
If the total is even , the parity bit is set to 0 .
When the data is read back out of the bits , the total is added up again and compared to the parity bit .
If the total is odd and the parity bit is 1 , then the data is assumed to be valid and is sent to the CPU .
But if the total is odd and the parity bit is 0 , the chip knows that there is an error somewhere in the 8 bits and dumps the data .
Odd parity works the same way , but the parity bit is set to 1 when the total number of 1s in the byte are even .
The problem with parity is that it discovers errors but does nothing to correct them .
If a byte of data does not match its parity bit , then the data are discarded and the system tries again .
Computers in critical positions need a higher level of fault tolerance .
High - end servers often have a form of error - checking known as error - correction code ( ECC ) .
Like parity , ECC uses additional bits to monitor the data in each byte .
The difference is that ECC uses several bits for error checking -- how many depends on the width of the bus -- instead of one .
ECC memory uses a special algorithm not only to detect single bit errors , but actually correct them as well .
ECC memory will also detect instances when more than one bit of data in a byte fails .
Such failures are very rare , and they are not correctable , even with ECC .
The majority of computers sold today use nonparity memory chips .
These chips do not provide any type of built - in error checking , but instead rely on the memory controller for error detection .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 28 — In July 1969 , while the world was spellbound by the Apollo 11 mission to the moon , President Richard M. Nixon and his close advisers were quietly fretting about a possible nuclear arms race in the Middle East .
Their main worry was not a potential enemy of the United States , but one of America ’s closest friends .
“ The Israelis , who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened , are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons , ” Henry A. Kissinger , the national security adviser , warned President Nixon in a memorandum dated July 19 , 1969 .
Israel ’s nuclear arms program was believed to have begun at least several years before , but it was causing special fallout for the young Nixon administration .
For one thing , President Nixon was getting ready for a visit by Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel , who was also in her first year in office and whose toughness was already legendary .
Should Washington insist that Israel rein in its development of nuclear weapons ?
What would the United States do if Israel refused ?
Perhaps the solution lay in deliberate ambiguity , or simply pretending that America did not know what Israel was up to .
These were some of the options that Mr. Kissinger laid out for President Nixon on that day before men first walked on the moon .
Using a customized microscope , Princeton scientists have mapped the strength of current - carrying electron pairs as they form in a ceramic superconductor .
From the top left , the images show the same 30 - nanometer square region of the ceramic at successively cooler temperatures .
Red areas indicate the presence of superconducting pairs .
Even at 10 degrees Celsius above Tc , the temperature at which the entire sample exhibits superconductivity , the electron pairs still exist in localized regions ( top left image ) .
Recent discoveries regarding the physics of ceramic superconductors may help improve scientists ' understanding of resistance - free electrical power .
Tiny , isolated patches of superconductivity exist within these substances at higher temperatures than previously were known , according to a paper by Princeton scientists , who have developed new techniques to image superconducting behavior at the nanoscale .
Superconductivity , the ability to carry electrical current without resistance , could revolutionize electrical power transmission if the property ever appeared in a material at close to room temperature .
Even the so - called high - temperature ceramic superconductors discovered two decades ago must be cooled to more than minus 100 degrees Celsius to function .
Using a special customized microscope , the Princeton team has discovered that traces of superconductivity remain present inside these ceramic materials even when they are warmed up above the critical temperature where they lose their resistance .
Though the entire sample is too warm to exhibit superconductivity , disconnected regions within it possess Cooper pairs -- the coupled electrons that carry current through a superconductor -- which previously were only known to appear below the critical temperature at which a material superconducts .
The regions are only a few nanometers wide , but they appear in some materials at up to 50 degrees above the critical temperature .
Ali Yazdani , senior author of the research paper , said that understanding why these minuscule patches of superconductivity exist at higher temperatures -- and how to create a material that exhibits the property everywhere -- may be the key to enhancing superconductivity .
" Our measurements show that Cooper pairs survive in local patches of the material at temperatures far above the critical temperature , " said Yazdani , a professor of physics at Princeton .
" Within these tiny regions , there are particular arrangements of atoms that favor formation of electron pairs at very high temperatures .
These patches are a precursor to superconductivity and important to enhancing it . "
The paper appears in the May 31 edition of Nature .
Other members of the research group are Princeton graduate students Kenjiro Gomes and Aakash Pushp and postdoctoral fellow Abhay Pasupathy , as well as Shimpei Ono and Yoichi Ando of the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry in Tokyo .
For more than two decades , scientists have worked to explain and enhance the performance of copper - oxide based ceramics , which two decades ago were discovered to superconduct at temperatures far warmer than any other known materials -- though still requiring temperatures that are quite chilly by human standards .
High - temperature superconductivity in ceramics has defied a widely accepted explanation and is considered one of the major puzzles in physics .
The key to the puzzle is to determine how electrons , which are negatively charged and normally repel one another , mysteriously change their attitude toward each other and form Cooper pairs .
Below the critical temperature , the pairs form everywhere in a material , and can then act in concert as a " superfluid " to carry electric current through it without resistance .
" In lower temperature superconductors , electrons pair up and form a superfluid at the critical temperature -- end of story , " Yazdani said .
" In ceramics , however , our team is finding that electron pairing occurs over a wide range of temperatures , and their pairing is a function of highly localized chemistry in the sample , often in patches only a few atoms wide . "
Investigation on this tiny scale was made possible by a state - of - the - art scanning tunneling microscope the Princeton team designed especially to map superconducting properties on the scale of single atoms while they changed the temperature .
The team was able to apply their technique systematically to a large number of high quality copper - oxide superconducting samples .
Unlike an optical microscope that uses light to magnify , the scanning tunneling microscope uses a beam of electrons from a sharp tip to image the sample .
The beam served a double purpose for the experiments :
Not only does it provide images of a sample down to scales of just a few atoms wide , the beam also is capable of breaking apart electron pairs if it is energetic enough .
By varying the energy of the electron beam , the team was able to determine whether pairs had formed in a given spot within the material .
" We spent about two and a half years looking at many different samples at different temperatures to decipher the story , " Yazdani said .
" We were motivated to search for pairing at high temperatures because of the work of others , most notably that of my colleague Phuan Ong . "
The researchers hope to use their experimental results to shed light on what controls the pairing temperature on the atomic scale in ceramic superconductors , and also to determine what limits the Cooper pairs ' ability to get their act together to superconduct .
" This type of precision experiment performed while varying temperature gives us a new window into the complex problem of ceramic superconductors , " Yazdani said .
" If we can figure out the details of what is happening at these local patches within the samples , it might be possible to construct a material that performs better overall . "
Such an accomplishment might revolutionize technology for the power industry , said Mike Norman , a physicist in Argonne National Laboratory 's Materials Science Division , who was not affiliated with the research .
" If we could raise the critical temperature by making the sample more homogeneous , then superconductivity 's application to day - to - day technologies , such as power grids , becomes much more realistic , " Norman said .
" The nice thing with superconductors is that there is no power loss , so they could be a major player in ' green ' and ' efficient ' technologies for power transmission . "

A cartoon related to 666 from
The Far Side ® by Gary Larson :
The scene shows a devil scowling at a painter and
the number 999 painted over a doorway in Hell .
The painter looks at a piece of paper and says ,
" Well , I 'll be ... I must 've been holding
the dang work order like this ! "
Unfortunately , Mr. Larson does not permit
any of his cartoons to be displayed online ;
but you can find this one in
The Chickens Are Restless ( p. 37 )
or The Far Side Gallery 5 ( p. 39 ) .
Addendum : Internet Users Beware !
In the ancient Hebrew practice of gematria ( assigning numerical values to letters ) ,
the letter " waw " is equivalent to the number " six . "
So WWW is also equivalent to 666 !!!
( or is it really ? )

The More Serious , Biblical , Academic Stuff
Who or What Is the Beast ?
The answer to this nearly 2000 - year - old question depends on how you choose to interpret the Book of Revelation ( a.k.a. the Apocalypse ) , the last book of the New Testament .
Near the middle of this highly symbolic book are descriptions of several strange creatures :
First , " a great red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and seven diadems on his heads " ; it is described further after being defeated by Michael and his angels in a battle in heaven :
" The great dragon was thrown down , that ancient serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world - - he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him " ( Rev 12:3- 18 ) ;
, with seven heads and ten horns , and seven diadems on his heads " ; it is described further after being defeated by Michael and his angels in a battle in heaven :
" The great dragon was thrown down , that ancient serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world - - he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him " ( Rev 12:3 - 18 ) ; Second , " a beast rising out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads ; and on its horns were ten diadems , and on its heads were blasphemous names ... [ it ] was like a leopard , its feet were like a bear 's , and its mouth was like a lion 's mouth .
And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority ... " ( Rev 13:1-10 ) ;
having ten horns and seven heads ; and on its horns were ten diadems , and on its heads were blasphemous names ... [ it ] was like a leopard , its feet were like a bear 's , and its mouth was like a lion 's mouth .
And the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority ... " ( Rev 13:1-10 ) ; Third , " another beast that rose out of the earth ; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon .
It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf , and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast ... " ( Rev 13:11 - 18 ) .
At the end of the paragraph about this third beast , the author challenges the reader with an intriguing puzzle : " This calls for wisdom : let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a person .
Its number is six hundred sixty - six . " ( 13:18 ) .
In order to understand this text , one must know that ancient Hebrew ( like Greek and other ancient languages ) did not have a separate set of characters to indicate numbers , but simply used the letters of its alphabet to represent numbers .
This fact provides the basis for the ancient practice of " gematria , " in which numerical equivalents of words and names are calculated ( still a popular game today ! ) .
The basic idea is that every word has a number associated with it , obtained by adding up the numerical equivalent of each letter in the word .
This is mostly commonly done with names ; thus every person has a number , the numerical value of his or her name .
There are several different ways of assigning numbers to the twenty - two letters of the Hebrew alphabet , but the system most commonly used is this :
alef = 1 ; bet = 2 ; gimel = 3 ; dalet = 4 ; hey = 5 ; waw = 6 ; zayin = 7 ; chet = 8 ; tet = 9 ; yod = 10 ; kaf = 20 ; lamed = 30 ; mem = 40 ; nun = 50 ; samek = 60 ; ayin = 70 ; pey = 80 ; tsadeh = 90 ; qof = 100 ; resh = 200 ; shin = 300 ; taw = 400 .
For example , the name " David " has a value of 14 in Hebrew ( since it is written dalet - waw - dalet , which is 4+6+4 ) ; see Matthew 1:17 .
= 1 ; = 2 ; = 3 ; = 4 ; = 5 ; = 6 ; = 7 ; = 8 ; = 9 ; = 10 ; = 20 ; = 30 ; = 40 ; = 50 ; = 60 ; = 70 ; = 80 ; = 90 ; = 100 ; = 200 ; = 300 ; = 400 .
The same game can be played in any language by assigning numerical values to each letter of the alphabet :
In English , for example , we could have
a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 3 , d = 4 , e = 5 , f = 6 , g = 7 , h = 8 , i = 9 , j = 10 ,
k = 20 , l = 30 , m = 40 , n = 50 , o = 60 , p = 70 , q = 80 , r = 90 , s = 100 ,
t = 200 , u = 300 , v = 400 , w = 500 , x = 600 , y = 700 , z = 800 .
Now calculate the number of YOUR name !
Find the value of each letter of your name , and add them all together .
You can get a number corresponding to your first name , another number for your last name , and another number for both together .
You will get different results if you use longer or shorter versions of your name , or nicknames , or include middle names , or titles or suffices .
The results you want to get may also determine which numerical system you choose ; for example , you can get HITLER = 666 if you choose a system in which a=100 , b=101 , c=102 , etc .

So , Who Is the Person Whose Number Is 666 ?
Throughout history , attempts have been made to identify 666 with many famous people ( usually one 's enemies ) !
Since the Reformation ( and still today ! ) , some Protestants have tried to connect 666 with the Pope , either with the " Roman Pontiff " in general or with a specific Pope in particular .
( For example , see the article by Michael Scheifler , from a Seventh Day Adventist perspective ; but see also a response to this article by Mario Derksen on the " Catholic Insight " webpages . )
On the other hand , some Catholics used to see a link between the apocalyptic beast and Martin Luther .
have tried to connect 666 with the Pope , either with the " Roman Pontiff " in general or with a specific Pope in particular .
( )
On the other hand , some used to see a link between the apocalyptic beast and Martin Luther .
Some Democrats have tried to associate the beast with Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush , while some Republicans might argue it was John F. Kennedy or Bill Clinton ( see the websites listed in the " Fun and Humorous " section above ) .
Most biblical historians agree , however , that the Book of Revelation is simply referring to the Roman Emperor NERO , the most " beastly " ruler of the first Christian Century :
The Hebrew equivalent of " Emperor Nero " could be written NRWN QSR ( nun - resh - waw - nun qof- samek - resh in Hebrew spelling ) ; thus , the first word is 50+200+6+50 , the second word is 100+60+200 , and the total is no surprise !
" could be written NRWN QSR ( in Hebrew spelling ) ; thus , the first word is 50+200+6+50 , the second word is 100+60+200 , and the total is no surprise !
For more extensive discussion of the first - century Roman Empire and the historical references behind the dragon , the sea beast , and the land beast in Rev 12 - 13 , see any good biblical commentary on the Book of Revelation .
Is the Number Really 666 , or Was It Originally 616 ?
While most ancient Greek manuscripts of the New Testament have the number " six hundred sixty - six " in Rev 13:18 , some ancient manuscripts contain the alternate reading " six hundred sixteen " ( 616 ) , which might well be the older or original reading of this text .
A branch of biblical scholarship called " textual " criticism deals with such issues , trying to determine which variant was more likely the original reading .
If the text originally said 666 , how and why was it changed to 616 in later manuscripts ?
Or vice - versa , if the original text was 616 , how and why was it later changed to 666 ?
The proposal that 616 is the older and better reading of Rev 13:18 was recently bolstered by some newly published Oxyrhynchus Papyri .
The Oxyrhynchus Papyri website also has a discussion of Numerology , but opposes the application to Nero .
Thanks to my friend and colleague Robert M. Royalty , Jr. , Ph.D. , for telling me about this new discovery and website !
The change from " 616 " to " 666 " can easily be explained , especially if the historical reference was originally to Emperor Nero .
The final letter " nun " is optional in the Hebrew spelling of Nero .
Thus , NRW QSR would be 50+200+6+100+60+200 = 616 .
If this was the original reading , it is easy to see how the text of Rev 13:8 would have been changed to " 666 , " due to its more highly symbolic value ( since " 6 " represents lack or incompleteness , in contrast to the number " 7 " representing completion , the triple 666 represents evil more clearly than 616 . )
What about June 6 , 2006 ?
Relax !
Although this date could be abbreviated 6/6/6 , it has absolutely nothing to do with the " Beast " of the Book of Revelation !
Consider these few points :
First , this date should more properly be written 6/6/06 or 06/06/06 or even 06/06/2006 , since 6/6/6 is ambiguous as to the decade or century .
Second , this date depends on the Gregorian calendar commonly used today , but is different on the calendars in use at the time the Book of Revelation was written ( Julian , Roman , Hebrew ) , and also different on other calendars in use today ( Islamic , Chinese , etc . )
Third , Revelation 13:18 clearly says that 666 is " the number of a person , " not an indication of any date .
, " not an indication of any date .
Fourth , combinations of three sixes can be found almost anywhere we want , if we look hard enough .
Fifth , we can lots of have fun with all this , but there 's no need to be worried or superstitious about it !
Sixth , I had to put a sixth bullet in this list , but I do n't really have much else to say about June 6 ! ;-)
Despite this last bullet , several people asked me to " predict " what would happen on June 6 , 2006 .
Here 's what I replied :
As a biblical scholar and Catholic priest , I think trying to predict the future is a misuse of the Bible .
Biblical prophecy is not about crystal - ball gazing into the future .
Rather , prophets of the Bible are those who speak on behalf of God , conveying God 's messages to people , interpreting the past , present , and future through God 's eyes , so to speak .
Biblical prophets call people to repent and to remain faithful to God , not to worry about when the world will end or who is the " beast " of the Book of Revelation .
But just for fun , since people really pressed me to " predict " something , here is what I said would happen on June 6 , 2006 :
Most adults will go to work , but a few will call in sick , as on any other weekday ;
many children will go to the beach or a park , enjoying their first days of summer vacation , while an unfortunate few still struggle through their last days of school ;
websites like mine with information on 666 and related apocalyptic themes will have a spike in the number of visitors ;
millions of automobile odometers will briefly show a 666 sequence at some time during the day , but very few drivers will notice ;
only a few math aficionados will practice their factoring skills ( 666=2x3x3x37 ) , while millions of shoppers will look for a 666 in a product bar code or on their sales receipts ;
lamentably few people will vote in California 's primary election , and similarly few will go to see the remake of the " Omen " movie on its unusual mid-week opening night ;
more gamblers than usual will sit at a roulette table that evening , but few of them will know that the sum of the numbers on the spinning wheel equals 666 ;
more people will get married than on most other Tuesdays , but very few pregnant women will seriously worry whether their newborn child could be the anti-Christ .
Then , on June 7 , most of us will wake up again and wonder what all the fuss was about !
Reflections after June 6 , 2006 :
I was somewhat amazed by all the media interest and popular hoopla surrounding June 6 .
The first person to contact me was Seth Borenstein , a reporter from the Associated Press , who prominently featured this webpage and some of my comments from a telephone interview in an article published June 4 , 2006 ( entitled " Humor , curiosity surround June 6 , 2006 " ; alt title " A calendar date to end all others nears " ) .
Searches on Google News in 2006 showed that this AP article was reprinted by over 250 news outlets in the U.S. and around the world ( including Australia , Canada , China , Dominican Republic , Great Britain , Kazakhstan , Romania , Russia , South Africa , and Turkey ) .
As a result , in the following two days I was contacted by and / or gave live interviews on three television networks , six other newspapers , and fifteen radio stations ( not just from the USA , but also Canada , Great Britain , and Argentina ) .
Some of the radio interviews were on syndicated programs that ran in hundreds of cities in the U.S.
Each interview was somewhat different from all the others : some reporters asked about the biblical / historical background of the number 666 , others about the differences between 666 and 616 ; some radio hosts were interested in Emperor Nero and Ancient Rome , others in bar codes and implanted chips !
Some of the interviews lasted about 30 seconds , others about 30 minutes , most were rather fun to do , especially those that combined the report with the party going on that day in the little town of Hell , Michigan !
In the past few years , my website has gotten between 1000 and 2000 visitors daily .
However , as I had " predicted " above , it received well over 10,000 visitors on June 4 , over 18,000 on June 5 , and spiked at over 36,000 on June 6 !
Why are so many people interested in 666 ?
Are that many people really scared about the future ?
It seems that some people need to have more faith in God to find peace in their lives !
I 'm just glad there are only 60 minutes in every hour ; otherwise , some people might freak out twice a day , at 6:66 a.m. and 6:66 p.m.!
So , when all is said and done , the number 666 will continue to intrigue numerologists and fascinate gamblers , be profitable for Hollywood but avoided by most other businesses , provide fodder for the apocalyptic warnings of fundamentalist preachers and challenges for the teachings of mainline Christian pastors .
But after June 6 , 2006 , has come and gone , biblical scholars will go back to studying 616 , while the wedding industry looks forward to July 7 , 2007 !
