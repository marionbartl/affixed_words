Accused by Fox of slamming Bush , Woodward insists ' I 'm dealing with the facts ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Bob Woodward 's latest book is not nearly enough of a hagiography of the Bush administration for the folks at Fox News 's morning show , and they spent a few minutes of Fox & Friends grilling the Washington Post reporter Monday morning .
Brian Kilmeade , apparently after diligently studying his Bush - is - a - hero talking points , accused Woodward of taking what should have been " a miraculous military success story " -- the surge in Iraq -- and twisting it to portray the president as out of touch .
" But I 'm dealing with the facts here , " Woodward said dryly .
" And the facts are that at key turning points the president was not involved .
...
If you 're sitting on the ground in Iraq , you want your president involved at the same level you were involved .
in this case he was not . "
Woodward 's latest book , The War Within , is his fourth on the inner workings of President Bush 's White House .
Critics employed by outlets that are n't Fox News have accused Woodward of departing from the harsh skepticism on display in his previous offering , State of Denial , which was written and reported with little cooperation from the administration .
The most recent offering includes on - the - record interviews with numerous prominent administration figures , including President Bush himself .
A Bloomberg News critic opined that Woodward 's lips were " attached to [ Bush 's ] backside " after seeing what he viewed as an overly generous portrayal .
That view clearly was n't shared at Fox News , one of the last bastions of unquestioning Bush devotion and ceaseless celebration of the success of the troop surge , which has reduced violence in Iraq while failing to bring political reconciliation any closer .
Kilmeade opened the interview with an accusation that Woodward cared only about book sales .
" It seems to me you were wriring a book that was going to be very negative on the Bush administration in 2006 .
Miraculously to America 's benefit and the Iraqis benefit , it turned around , and instead of writing a pro-Bush book that would n't sell , you kept it negative to get to one that would , " he charged .
" Well that 's not true , " Woodward says , keeping his cool in the face of F & F's uninformed absurdity .
" If you 've looked at the book at all it goes meeting by meeting , document by document .
None of the facts have been disputed by the White House . "
For about six minutes , the host and guest sparred over just how detached from his administration President Bush was , until co-host Gretchen Carlson had to break up the party , to move on to the network 's next hard - hitting guest .
" This discussion could go on forever , " she said , but " we 've got to have Suzanne Somers on the show too . "

After a couple of teasers starring Jerry Seinfeld , Microsoft is airing some new ads that take Apple ’s “ I ’m a PC ” out into the real world .
So instead of John Hodgman ’s dorky PC character ( who is parodied in one of the new ads ) , they ’ve got all sorts of people — basketball players , actresses , scientists , fashion designers , etc. — proudly declaring “ I ’m a PC ” .
As Michael Sippey mentions , the ads do communicate a “ message of joy and abundance and widespread use of Personal Computing ” , but they ’re not “ great ” .
I briefly worked for a design firm in the late 90s that did a lot of advertising work .
One of the hard and fast rules in the office — which was taken from a book written by a successful ad man whose name I cannot recall — was that if a company was # 1 in a certain space , their advertising should never ever mention the competition , not even in an oblique fashion .
And even if a company was # 2 , they should do the same and act as if they were # 1 .
That ’s the problem with Microsoft ’s ads .
They ’re still # 1 and the bigger company , but by referencing Apple ’s successful ad campaign , they ’re acting like Apple is # 1 .
( John Gruber made this same point the other day . )
The ads fail because they serve to remind people that Apple comes up with good ideas that Microsoft then takes and shapes into something that so - called “ normal people ” can use or understand .
Except that this is n’t 1993 .
With the iPod , iPhone , iMac , OS X , the Apple Stores , and the iTunes Store , Apple has their finger firmly on the pulse of what normal people want and Microsoft ’s recent attempts ( the Zune , Vista ) to keep up by emulating Apple have failed .
If MS had created the “ I ’m a PC ” message on their own , the ads would be great , but these copy - and - paste ads lack soul and are merely “ eh ” .
What ’s interesting is that with the I ’m a Mac / I ’m a PC ads , Apple mentions Microsoft explicitly , over and over , proving the old adage that rules are made to be broken .
What works in Apple ’s favor is that they are the # 2 company and were clever about how they attacked # 1 .
Microsoft ’s hamfisted ads are almost saying to Apple , “ nuh -uh , my mom thinks I ’m cool ” while the image of Hodgman ’s frumpy PC is hard to shake and makes Windows seem lame without being overly insulting about it .
If you wanted close - up photos of the moon in the late 1800s , you were pretty much out of luck .
Unless , of course , you built incredibly detailed plaster models of lunar craters and then snapped carefully lit pictures of them .
And that ’s exactly what an engineer and astronomer did in 1874 to tremendous acclaim .
James Nasmyth , the inventor of the steam hammer , and James Carpenter , then at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich , England , released a hugely successful book , The Moon : Considered as a Planet , a World , and a Satellite , illustrated by their incredible moon mock - ups .
The august journal Nature gave the book a rapturous review .
" The illustrations to this book are so admirable , so far beyond those one generally gets of any celestial phenomenon , that one is tempted to refer to them first of all , " the reviewer wrote .
" No more truthful or striking representations of natural objects than those here presented have ever been laid before his readers by any student of Science ; and I may add that , rarely if ever , have equal pains been taken to insure such truthfulness . "
But what ’s really appealing about the images is n’t their " truthfulness " but their " truthiness , " said Corey Keller , the curator of a new exhibit , Brought to Light , on early scientific photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art .
" Astronomers were perfectly aware of what they were looking at , " Keller , whose exhibit includes the book ’s photos , said .
" But they felt that because they were photographed , it added a layer of authenticity to the undertaking that simple drawings did n’t have . "
Looking at these photos , astronomers could get the feeling of actually being there , which is the same desire that has driven manned space exploration throughout the last half - century .
" It was n’t possible to actually make those photographs of the moon , " she noted .
Imaging the moon , after all , was an immensely difficult task .
Even as 19th - century photographers and dagguerreotypists figured out the basics of taking pictures of the moon , they were limited by the immense distance separating them from their subject .
In fact , it was n’t until the
Apollo missions landed on the surface of our only natural satellite that humans were able to make real versions of these mock - ups .
In this five - part series , we ’re walking through the Brought to Light
exhibit with
Keller , who spent five years researching the history of early scientific photography .
This video segment looks at the early history of astronomical photography and at the story of the creation of a fake moon .

Christian faith groups Menu The LDS Restorationist movement ,
including many Mormon denominations ,
including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints :
Sponsored link .
Background :
The LDS Restoration movement is made up of denominations , sects , and small faith groups who trace their origins back to the original Church of Christ that Joseph Smith 's founded in 1830 .
The Church of Christ was renamed the Church of Latter - day Saints in 1834 , then became the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 .
Following Smith 's assassination by a Christian mob in 1844 , problems arose about the choice of a new leader .
This caused schism within the church , which resulted in the creation of a number of new faith groups .
The largest faction , under the leadership of Brigham Young , started on a long trek to Salt Lake in what is now Utah .
Other groups remained in the mid-west .
The Utah group changed the capitalization and punctuation of their name to became The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in 1851 .
It is now called by the latter title ( no pun intended ) , and is often referred to as the LDS , LDS Church , Mormon Church , Latter - day Saints , the Church , or The Church of Jesus Christ .
It remains by far the largest denomination within the LDS Restoration movement .
Many schisms followed so that the present - day LDS Restoration movement consists of almost a hundred faith groups , most of which are tiny .
The membership of the LDS Church and of some other groups within the LDS Restoration movement are often referred to as " Mormons " by the media and general public .
However , only the LDS Church and a few other faith groups used this term themselves .
Further , the LDS Church objects to any reference to other denominations having any claim to the term " Mormon . "
2018 - AUG : God allegedly orders LDS Church to use its full name :
To further complicate matters , God allegedly instructed the LDS Church to abandoned the terms " Mormon " and " LDS Church . "
They are to use the full denominational title : The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints . "
On 2018 - AUG - 17 , Jana Riess , a columnist for the Religion News Service wrote :
" Yesterday , the church that invested millions in its Meet the Mormons movie and exports its Mormon Tabernacle Choir as its ambassador to the world asked us all to stop using the word ' Mormon . '
Ahem .
It seems I ’m no longer a Mormon columnist .
I ’m a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints columnist , and is n’t that just so fun to say ?
What ’s more , this is being presented not as a simple branding change but in the language of divine revelation : ' The Lord has impressed upon my mind the importance of the name He has revealed for His Church , even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , ' said Russell M. Nelson , president of the Church formerly known as the LDS Church . "
There is considerable doubt about whether other faith groups will abandon the terms " LDS " and " Mormon . "
Richard E. Bennett , a church history professor at Brigham Young University said :
" I do n't think it 's going to stop our friends outside the church from calling us nicknames .
But certainly among members of the church , we 'll be making a greater effort to follow the directions . "
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir , which as been singing for over 150 years , has changed its name to " The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square . "
Choir president Ron Jarrett said :
" A new name for the Tabernacle Choir will represent a change after so many years .
But we have always been a forward - looking people , and we are focused on what is not changing : the world - class musicianship , the inspiring arrangements and programming , and our weekly ‘ Music and the Spoken Word ’ broadcast . "

What Mormons and other Christians think of each other 's theology :
In an essay on the LDS church in Christianity Today -- a leading evangelical Christian magazine -- Robert Millet and Gerald McDermott stated :
" Historically , evangelicals and Mormons have demonized each other .
Evangelicals consider The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints to be a cult and typically think Mormons are not real Christians . "
1
A major concern of evangelicals towards the LDS Church is their belief in the nature of God.
Evangelicals believe that God the Father is a spirit without a physical body .
One of the major sources of LDS theology is the Doctrine and Covenants [ D&C ] .
An article in SBC LIFE -- the official journal of the Southern Baptist Convention -- quotes D&C saying that the Mormons believe the Holy Spirit , Jesus Christ and the Heavenly Father to be :
" ... comprise three separate and distinct gods : the Father and the Son have bodies of flesh and bones 'as tangible as man's , ' but the Holy Ghost 'is a personage of Spirit ' ( Doctrine and Covenants [ D& C ] , 130:22 ) . "
5
In return , Mormons generally accept evangelicals and many other Christian denominations as Christian groups .
However Mormons also believe that the Christian movement deviated from the true messages of the Gospel after the last apostle died during the early first century CE and that the denominations in the LDS Restorationist movement have been able to recreate authentic Christianity .

We receive a lot of Emails saying that our use of " polygyny " is a typo and that the correct word is " polygamy . "
This is not a spelling error .
" Polygyny " means a marriage between one man and multiple wives , which is what the essays discuss .
Polygamy can mean : polygyny : a marriage among one man and multiple women ;
polyandry : a marriage among one woman and multiple men ; or
group marriage : a marriage among multiple men and multiple women
Only polygyny is currently promoted by certain fundamentalist Mormon denominations .
With few exceptions , polygyny was the only polygamous arrangement promoted by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints until it was at least temporarily suspended in the late 19th century .
American Experience and Frontline , two of PBS ' most acclaimed TV series presented " The Mormons , " a four hour documentary about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran 's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President - elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran 's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change .
Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran .
" Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics , " Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency .
" What is expected is a change in strategy , not the repetition of objections to Iran 's nuclear program , which will be taking a step in the wrong direction . "
In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon , Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear - armed Iran would be " unacceptable . "
He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening .
Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran " will not change so simply " but that Obama 's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted .
He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology , but " you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [ from reaching its goals in the nuclear field ] , " according to the news agency .
Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office .
" Obviously , how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee - jerk fashion .
I think we 've got to think it through , " Obama said .
" But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time .
And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president , and I wo n't be until January 20th . "
Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama , the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president - elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard - line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States .
Ahmadinejad said Tehran " welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts , " according to the state - run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday .
Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran 's nuclear program .
Tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes , but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities .

A senior Chinese official has welcomed the UK 's decision to recognise Beijing 's direct rule over Tibet .
Zhu Weiqun , who is leading talks with Tibetan exiles , told the BBC the move had brought the UK " in line with the universal position in today 's world " .
But Mr
Zhu would not say whether it might be linked with Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's efforts to bring China into a new world economic order .
Beijing says Tibet has been part of the Chinese nation since the 13th Century .
Many Tibetans disagree , pointing out that the Himalayan region was an independent kingdom for many centuries , and that Chinese rule over Tibet has not been constant .
After a brief military conflict between China and Tibet in the early part of the 20th Century , Tibet declared itself an independent republic in 1912 .
China sent troops to Tibet in 1950 and summoned a Tibetan delegation the following year to sign a treaty ceding sovereignty .
' Criminal acts '
Since then there have been periods of unrest and sporadic uprisings as resentment to Beijing 's rule has persisted , most recently in March , when there were riots and demonstrations both in Tibet and surrounding provinces .
Criminal acts like these have been dealt with according to law
Zhu Weiqun , Vice - Minister
United Front Work Department
China shows willingness to engage Q&A : China and Tibet The Chinese government says rioters killed at least 19 people , but Tibetan exiles say security forces killed dozens of protesters and were guilty of repression .
" I simply do n't agree about repression , " Mr Zhu told the BBC .
" Tibetans are our brothers and sisters . "
" Innocent civilians were hacked or burnt to death last March .
In one shop , five girls , one of them an ethnic Tibetan , were set on fire and killed .
Criminal acts like these have been dealt with according to law .
Do you call this repression ? "
On Monday , talks between Chinese officials and Tibetan exiles on the future of the Himalayan region ended after they failed to make any progress .
Mr Zhu is a vice - minister of the United Front Work Department , which conducts negotiations with Tibetan representatives .
He blamed this week 's deadlock on the Tibetans , whom Mr Zhu believes still want independence .
The Tibetans have yet to comment officially , but the Dalai Lama , the head of exiled Central Tibetan Administration , has previously said he does not want independence for his homeland , only meaningful autonomy .
' Anachronism '
Despite the stalled discussions , Mr Zhu made it clear that China wanted them to continue .
" China has done everything it can to talk to the Dalai Lama , " he said .
" The door is still open . "
The Dalai Lama's " middle way " seeks autonomy but not full independence
In a little publicised parliamentary statement on 29 October , UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband gave his strong backing to the talks and also backed the Dalai Lama 's call for autonomy as a basis for agreement .
Mr Miliband also referred to a historic agreement dating back to the early 20th Century , which acknowledged China 's " special position " in Tibet , but asserted that Tibet had never been fully part of the country .
Describing the policy as an " anachronism " , he asserted : " Like every other EU member state , and the United States , we regard Tibet as part of the People 's Republic of China . "
Mr Zhu said his government appreciated the British statement .
" I think this is a recognition of an already existing objective fact , " he said .
" It has also brought the UK in line with the universal position in today 's world . "
BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson says Mr Zhu diplomatically sidestepped the question whether the British decision might be linked with Mr Brown 's efforts to bring China into a new world economic order ; though that is certainly what many observers think .
They also think the Dalai Lama 's position has been weakened by the UK 's decision , our correspondent says .

The fix was in .
There ’s no other way to explain the disconnect between Sarah Palin ’s performance in last night ’s debate –which made me cringe so much that my forehead started to cramp–and the post - debate analysis , in which everyone in punditland agreed on the happy Hollywood ending : Sarah Palin has redeemed herself .
Seeing pundits all agree about this was terrifying .
What I saw in the debate was n’t the hyper - confident , polished , prom-queen bully from the GOP Convention , but a woman desperately in need of beta - blockers : a nervous , wobbly - voiced contestant in a County Fair amateur show trying her darndest not to forget her lines .
I was sure that her performance had McCain kicking his dog and calling his wife unprintable names , and that Palin would be announcing her withdrawal from the race “ for personal reasons ” by breakfast time .
You expect Fox News to spin Palin as positively as possible : as soon as the debate ended , Brit Hume grimly announced , “ She seemed perfectly comfortable , she seemed to get more confident as the debate went on , and she certainly does not seem to have committed any of the gaffes or deer - in - the - headlight moments for which she ’s been criticized in recent interviews . ”
Switching to CNN , the blame - America - first network , Campbell Brown , hero - for - a - day among the HuffPo crowd for throwing a hissy fit over Palin , returned to tamed form , repeating Hume ’s mantra almost word for word : “ I think the big picture is there were no major gaffes here , so I do n’t see it–and I ’m not going to be the judge here , the polls will show it –that this is n’t going to be a big game - changer . ”
It was a frightening , pod-people moment , as if her executive producer were standing behind the camera holding Brown ’s contract in one hand and a pistol - shaped lighter in the other .
The Laura Bush look - alike not only lined up behind Palin , but she even adopted Palin ’s distinctive Okie diction : “ You know , she seemed to do very well with the plain - spoken language , and he [ Biden ] –when he started talking about amendments or whatever–kind of lost people a little bit . ”
Campbell Brown modeling the Laura Bush chic look .
David Gergen , the embodiment of pundit centrism , hopped aboard the Palin - Is - Redeemed Express , although his face had a kind of pained , Stalin show - trial look as he spoke : “ Give credit to Sarah Palin .
It was the Sarah Palin of the early part of the campaign .
She was spirited , she came out strong . ”
Most depressing of all , Rachel Maddow , the only meat - eating progressive out there , gummed the Alaska governor in one of the most hilarious displays of self - censorship I ’ve witnessed : “ I think that Sarah Palin certainly did participate in the debate , and did stand along Joe Biden , and she did stay true to character , ” Maddow said , as if she was a POW in North Korea .
“ In terms of substance , she did meet expectations in not being able to keep up with the specifics . ”
There ’s only one explanation why TV pundits were reading the same lines : the fix was in from the start .
The redemption narrative was already built in .
America needed this redemption , if only to take the edge off of the massive bummer that is 2008 .
This is the year that America became a Loser Nation – the economy doomed , the empire in full retreat , and –until last night ’s Orgy Of Delusion –the hope of Main Street and Joe Sixpack turned out to be a total zero facing off against a lightweight like Katie Couric .
Americans are masochistic about a lot of things –they do n’t mind getting yanked around , fleeced , repressed , lied to , or murdered – but one thing they wo n’t tolerate is a loser .
If you stink of failure , you ’re history –and it ’s not a nice thing at all , since most of us fail at something .
But that ’s just the way Americans are .
For most of us , Palin ’s Couric interview was n’t funny , but rather a manifestation of what losers we ’ve become–just as Yeltsin ’s drunken antics were n’t funny to Russians suffering during their horrible decline .
Tina Fey ’s Palin impersonations on Saturday Night Live were painful to many Americans in ways that Blue Staters ca n’t fathom .
After the debate , Chris Wallace gleefully announced , “ ” It may be harder for Tina Fey to mock her on Saturday Night Live , although Lord knows they ’ll try . ” ”
Like most fixed events , this one started with a decoy : the alleged bias of moderator Gwen Ifill , the bland - o- matic PBS anchor , whom the right - wing claimed was an Obama mole , secretly plotting to open up a can of elitist whoop - ass on poor Sarah Palin .
Ifill reacted the way all bullied kids respond to a callout for a fight : she showed up in a wheelchair , saved by her broken ankle .
Palin , in one of her rare moments of prom-queen confidence , cheerfully told Ifill that she was n’t going to answer her questions if she did n’t feel like it , a classic case of the popular girl humiliating the school nerd , to the delight of the entire student body .
Gwen Ifill as George Wallace :
You would n’t beat up someone in a wheelchair , wouldya ?
This is what even Palin ’s critics fail to understand about her appeal : it is n’t that she ’s “ one of them ” –the Joe Sixpacks and the Dodge Durango - driving Bloodsport Moms .
Palin looks nothing like Middle Americans–she ’s too physically perfect , too confident , too healthy , with a perfect pearly smile .
The reason she ’s so popular is because Palin is the adult incarnation of the top Heather .
Those who have seen Heathers and remember honestly their own high school experience know everyone wants to be friends with the popular bully .
It ’s ingrained in our culture–middle Americans are drawn to bullies like John McCain and Sarah Palin on a level so primitive that it ’s almost impossible to counteract .
This has been substantiated by a recent study that suggests bullies are considered “ cool ” and popular by all ( including school staff ) but the directly - bullied kids .
Not that bullying ever stops –research published last year in the Journal of Management Studies showed that American workers are bullied up to 50 percent more than their Scandinavian counterparts .
And yet , in a classic example of Americans ’ penchant for optimistic delusion in the face of misery , “ only one in 10 ( nine per cent ) of Americans were aware that the behaviour they experienced constituted bullying , leading the researchers to conclude that bullying behavior is ingrained in the culture of the U.S. workplace . ”
This physical chasm between the popular bully Palin and her fans was made plain when CNN assembled an Ohio focus group to watch the debate : a cross-section of Americans herded into some grim provincial library and given “ reaction dials ” to show real - time reactions .
As the camera panned over the twenty or so participants , you could almost see the artery plaque , pre-diabetes and chronic back pain .
They were a cheerless bunch who looked like a casting call for a Todd Solondz film .
They desperately tried to please CNN team leader Soledad O’Brien–who , like Palin , is beautiful , slender and healthy–and who told some civics - class lies that they all pretended to believe–like “ negative campaigning does n’t go over well with these folks , ” or something like that .
The CNN reaction dials revealed nothing during the debate .
The only interesting moment came when Joe Biden solemnly talked about what a tragedy it would be if Obama were to get killed –and the reaction dials suddenly flat - lined to zero , indicating that Middle America has no strong feelings about whether a dead Obama is a good or bad thing .
Fox ’s focus group was the most clearly rigged jury that this country has seen since the Civil Rights
Act was passed , but that ’s what you ’d expect from a corn- fed creep like Frank Luntz , the Fox correspondent / Republican pollster who assembled the “ focus group , ” which he claimed were “ undecided voters ” split evenly between Bush and Kerry supporters in 2004 and split evenly about Sarah Palin .
“ Let me ask you now : how many of you thought Sarah Palin won the debate ?
Raise your hands . ”
They all raised their hands glumly , and Luntz turned back to the camera : “ Almost all of them raised their hands . ”
Then he asked the audience why , and some creep in the back , who observed , “ She was Main - Street America . ”
Luntz replayed their favorite moment , when Palin said that when it came to future financial crises , “ Never again ! ”
The planted creep in the back raised his hand and shouted , “ I felt like it was a 9 - 11 moment . ”
This is what happens when you ignore stupid zombies .
You might be tempted to ignore or dismiss Fox , but remember , Fox rates from two to three times more popular than its nearest network rival .
Ignoring
Fox for being evil or dumb will do about as much good as ignoring the Christian Right at the end of the last century .
Like the cocky SWAT cop in the original version of Dawn of the Dead , ignoring and mocking the zombies just because they ’re stupid misses the point–stupidity is their greatest weapon .
The SWAT cop ignored the zombies right up until one of them bit half of his leg off–and by then , it was too late .

CHANGE VS . MORE OF THE SAME ….
On Monday , Sarah Palin told Katie Couric that voters are going to have to decide between “ new energy ” and “ new ideas ” on one side , or “ many , many years in the Senate ” on the other .
Obama vs. McCain ?
No , she was talking about Palin vs. Biden , seemingly unaware of the dynamic at the top of the ticket .
CBS just sent out a transcript from this morning ’s “ Early Show , ” in which Palin touched on a very similar theme .
COURIC : I know you ’re heading to Sedona to work on your debate .
What is your coach advising you ?
PALIN : I do n’t have a debate coach .
COURIC : Well , what are your coaches ?
PALIN : I have quite a few people who are giving us information about the record of Obama and Biden , and at the end of the day , though , it is — it ’s so clear , again , what those choices are .
Either new ideas , new energy and reform of Washington , DC , or more of the same .
First , if she does n’t have debate coaches , I ’m the Heavyweight Champion of the World .
Second , and more importantly , Palin seems strikingly unaware of what this campaign is all about .
As she sees it , John McCain represents “ new ideas ” and “ new energy , ” while Barack Obama represents “ more of the same . ”
As someone who reads “ all ” newspapers , Palin might have noticed that she has this entirely backwards , and is n’t exactly helping her ticket ’s cause by dismissing “ more of the same . ”
Indeed , McCain / Palin agrees with Bush / Cheney on foreign policy , national security , economic policy , taxes , healthcare , energy , education , the environment , the federal judiciary , immigration , and the culture - war issues .
Indeed , McCain has personally boasted about voting with Bush 90 % of the time , and has insisted , “ [ O ] n the transcendent issues , the most important issues of our day , I ’ve been totally in agreement and support of President Bush . ”
Who , exactly , is “ more of the same ” ?
I sometimes feel as if Palin ’s candidacy is some kind of satirical performance art , and I ’m just not in on the joke .
When L. Ron Hubbard ’s first commercially published story , “ The Green God , ” appeared in Thrilling Adventures ’
February 1934 edition , it marked not so much the debut of a new author as it did the emergence of a literary force .
And what would be clear in a matter of months — it was one with a capacity for rapid - fire production in extraordinary volume .
In less than a year , in the words of one of publishing ’s most esteemed periodicals , L. Ron Hubbard earned a reputation “ as a superlative storyteller with total mastery of plot and pacing . ”
It was all there from the first — taut action , memorably defined characters , vivid plot contours , compelling artistry , and that hallmark L. Ron Hubbard sense of authenticity .
His tales delivered a sharp jolt of reality drawn from a wealth of his own experience in a life that , at only twenty - three , was already the widely traveled , richly diverse , boldly adventurous stuff of which towering careers — and legends — are made .
The History of Pulp Fiction
Like jazz and baseball , pulp fiction was a uniquely American invention , with its roots in the national experience tracing back to the 1830s when four - page story weeklies printed on newsprint became the inexpensive reading fare of a westward migrating population .
Cheaper paper available in larger quantities , faster presses , a more efficient postal service , transcontinental commerce and travel by railroad led to the thirty - two - page dime novel .
This was the introduction to the American psyche of a gallery of enduring literary heroes , both real and imagined , including Buffalo Bill , Frank Merriwell , Tom Swift , Horatio Alger , and Nick Carter .
From that heritage , and for an increasingly literate twentieth - century American population , the pulp fiction magazine arose and flourished and changed the course and complexion of America ’s popular culture .
The pulp was born in 1896 when publisher Frank Munsey changed the name of a failing children ’s magazine —
The Golden Argosy — to The Argosy ( and , later , to simply Argosy ) , and offered urgent yellow covers and more than a hundred pages of fiction — some 130,000 words — for a dime .
The market for it was ready , waiting and enormous .
Millions of people eager for entertainment were excluded from the world of hardcover novels and “ slick paper ” magazine fiction by their prohibitive cost , not to mention their often bloodless , self - conscious literary content .
In contrast , the fiction of the all - story pulps featured unfettered imagination , quick - paced narrative , and lean , muscular prose .
The appeal of the pulps in cost , quantity and vivid storytelling energy was immediate and widespread .
In no time , they became a ubiquitous fixture of American life .
To meet the competition , publishers upgraded their products .
Street & Smith — the publishing giant that years later would enlist L. Ron Hubbard ’s uniquely versatile literary gifts to revolutionize the science fiction genre — changed Buffalo Bill to Western Story Magazine and Nick Carter to Detective Story .
New themes , stories , and writing styles emerged — hard - boiled detective , frontier law and order , sword and sorcery , horror and science fiction , among others .
Provocatively colorful , irrepressibly popular , these magazines and their content would ultimately influence every later venue of international entertainment , from movies , radio and television to comics , animation and computer video games .
The number and diversity of magazines expanded quickly in the 1920s .
It was further bolstered in 1926 when publisher Hugo Gernsback introduced what historians generally consider the first “ purely ” science fiction magazine , Amazing Stories .
With an emphasis on science over the story , however , science fiction started to wane in popularity in the 1930s , only to be revitalized and redefined by L. Ron Hubbard , Robert A. Heinlein and a handful of other writers in what is still regarded as science fiction ’s golden age .
Shadowed by the Great Depression and the growing thunder of an approaching world war , broad vistas of imaginative mass entertainment dominated the market in the 1930s , when pulp magazines reached their high watermark in diversity and appeal .
From the first Argosy in 1896 to arguably the final issue of Science Fiction Quarterly in 1958 , the pulps published well over a million stories in upwards of a thousand different magazines — the variety of genre , style , caliber , content , and invention without historical parallel .
But more than that , the pulps provided a visible , readily accessible forum for many of the country ’s — and , ultimately , the world ’s — most gifted and influential writers to seize , ignite and exalt the imagination .
Confounding their critics and vindicating the literary loyalties of their legion of readers , the pulps featured the works of writers who remain mainstays of popular fiction to this day , including Dashiell Hammett , Agatha Christie , Raymond Chandler , Erle Stanley Gardner , Sinclair Lewis , Upton Sinclair , Tennessee Williams , Zane Grey , Max Brand , Louis L’Amour , Edgar Rice Burroughs , Robert E. Howard , Isaac Asimov , Ray Bradbury , Robert A. Heinlein and , of course , L. Ron Hubbard .
High Road to Adventure
From virtually the outset of his literary career , L. Ron Hubbard ranked among the most productive , versatile and successful writers in popular fiction .
As well , his prodigious output reflected the colorful , Renaissance - man qualities of his life .
As with Herman Melville , Mark Twain and Jack London before him , and his contemporary , Ernest Hemingway , L. Ron Hubbard ’s experiences and travels — as an explorer and prospector , master mariner and dare - devil pilot , photographer and filmmaker , philosopher and artist , composer and musician — found their way into his fiction and into the currents of American culture .
His stories and novels — many of them genre - shaping and trendsetting — translated the adventure and wonder of a world - traveler ’s journeys into living - room entertainment .
They transformed the exotic and provocative turns of a creative imagination into a compelling literary legacy .
As the distinguished author , editor and critic Frederik Pohl said :
“ There are bits and pieces from Ron ’s work that became part of the language in ways that very few other writers managed .
I can still remember scenes from Hubbard ’s stories when I ’ve forgotten most of the other things I was reading .
He had a gift for inventing colorful pictures that still stay with me .
Stories with these frequently memorable lines and quotable things .
Pictures that stayed in your head . ”
Never a detached , armchair spectator , L. Ron Hubbard channeled his intense appetite for adventure and his fierce curiosity about the basic nature of man and Earth ’s manifold cultures into wide travels in pursuit of his own research and to broaden and diversify his education in the classroom of the world .
In his own words :
“ Adventuring is a state of mind .
If you adventure through life , you have a good chance to be a success on paper .
“ Adventure does n’t mean globe - trotting , exactly , and it does n’t mean great deeds .
Adventuring is like art .
You have to live it to make it real . ”
— L. Ron Hubbard .
Traders and investment bankers might have more to worry about than dwindling bonus pools this year as mass firings on Wall Street are set to hit a record .
The fallout from this year ’s global credit crisis has claimed jobs throughout Wall Street , from hedge fund managers to floor traders and beyond .
More than 110,000 people have lost their jobs so far this year , and some industry experts forecast it could come close to 200,000 before the year is over .
Even the financial industry ’s biggest name is n’t immune .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the world ’s biggest investment bank , made plans Thursday to cut 3,200 positions from its staff of 32,000 .
Barclays Capital is in the midst of purging 3,000 jobs as part of its takeover of Lehman Bros. , and Bank of America Corp .'s acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. is sure to add thousands more .
Major U.S. financial companies are getting rid of redundancies caused by this year ’s rapid - fire consolidation .
They are also adapting to an environment of more regulation , less risk and dwindling profits .

“ Wall Street the way we know it is , frankly , gone , ” said Michael Williams , dean of the graduate school of business at Touro College in New York .
“ This was inevitable because there ’s just not enough money out there to support the huge staffs these banks and investment banks had before . ”
Williams and other analysts believe this next wave of cutbacks will be the biggest the U.S. financial industry has faced since massive bank failures in the 1930s .
He believes up to 250,000 financial workers -- perhaps even more -- could find themselves out of work by the second quarter of next year .
U.S. financial services companies have cut 111,201 positions through September , on top of 153,105 made last year , according to Chicago - based outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Assn. said there were currently 867,400 people employed by their members , which include securities firms , brokerages , stock exchanges and banks .
The agreement represents another novel use by Mr. Cuomo of the Martin Act , a powerful tool that allows the attorney general to bring criminal as well as civil charges .
Mr. Cuomo ’s predecessor , Eliot Spitzer , used the law to vastly expand the office ’s investigations of suspected Wall Street malfeasance .
Now Mr. Cuomo has turned it into a de facto form of environmental enforcement , too .
For energy companies , including those based far from New York , he is able to claim jurisdiction because they issue securities on Wall Street .
The agreement with Xcel requires the company to analyze the likely effects on its business of current and future legislation or regulations in the states and countries where it operates and to disclose that information in its investor filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Congress and many states are considering global warming legislation .
Ten states stretching from Maryland to Maine , including New Jersey , New York and Connecticut , have struck a deal to cap emissions and allow trading of pollution allotments among producers .
Under the agreement with Mr. Cuomo , Xcel will disclose the financial risks of lawsuits and of federal or state court decisions that would affect its business .
The company will also analyze and disclosed the “ material financial risks ” to itself associated with global warming , like drought  coal plants are prodigious users of water  or rising sea levels .
In a statement , the chairman of Xcel , Richard C. Kelly , said the company had already voluntarily reduced carbon emissions and planned to continue to do so .
“ We previously provided detailed information concerning the expected impact of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions regulations on our operations , and under this agreement we will make even more detailed disclosures , ” Mr. Kelly said .
“ This agreement will enhance our already aggressive efforts to be responsible environmental stewards . ”
Xcel officials said their reductions of greenhouse gases had totaled 18 million tons since 2003 .
They added that the company planned to build an additional 6,000 megawatts of renewable energy generation by the end of the next decade .

To troops downed in combat , few sights are sweeter than the approach of military rescuers .
In a few weeks , Tucson will be at the center of efforts to speed up that lifesaving process .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Personnel from around the globe will converge at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base from Dec. 1 to Dec. 12 for the largest rescue exercise of its kind .
The effort , dubbed Angel Thunder , will involve the U.S. Army and Air Force , troops from Germany , Chile , Colombia and observers from Canada , Mexico , Brazil and Pakistan .
Several non-military U.S. agencies such as the State and Justice departments , the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office , also will take part in the drills , which aim to smooth interaction between military branches , allied nations and civilian agencies .
With about 450 personnel involved , Angel Thunder “ is the most complex and largest Department of Defense personnel - recovery exercise to date , ” said a news release from Air Combat Command in Langley , Va .
D-M will be at the hub of the effort , but most of the mock rescue action will take place elsewhere in Arizona and in New Mexico .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
As the Treasury Department struggles to justify a $ 700 billion bailout of the nation 's financial system , troubled Washington Mutual reportedly is under the gun to avoid the same fate as other institutions and steer clear of government intervention .
The Seattle - based thrift WM , - 0.55 % faces the prospect of having its operations splintered among several buyers , according to a story in Tuesday 's Financial Times , as the company 's stock continues to fade .
Washington Mutual shares were off another 3.9 % to $ 3.20 in recent action .
Washington Mutual , the nation 's largest thrift with $ 310 billion in assets , reportedly is under the gun from the Office of Thrift Supervision to get a deal pushed through , but analysts say it all may have to wait until Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson brokers a deal with Congress to get the high - stakes bailout plan pushed through .
Washington Mutual would n't comment .
OTS officials also said they could n't comment .
" We 're aware of the situation and we 're monitoring it closely , " said OTS spokesman William Ruberry .
Such a deal to buy up " toxic " mortgage assets on banks ' balance sheets could affect the marketability of Washington Mutual -- particularly if its mortgage business benefits from a government bailout .
A single buyer might be willing to take on the whole company if the mortgage business is shielded by the government .
Otherwise , a breakup to segregate its attractive retail banking and deposit base is possible .
" The problem in my mind all along has been what are you going to do with the loan exposure , " said Howard Shapiro , analyst with Fox - Pitt Kelton .
The Times reported that five banks have come forward and are examining the prospect of buyer some or all of Washington Mutual .
They include J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , - 2.35 % , Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , HSBC HBC , +0.48 % and Spain's Banco Santander STD , - 4.33 % .
All five firms declined to comment on the report .
Washington Mutual 's ratings were cut by Moody 's Investors Service on Monday , ratcheting up the pressure on the firm .
But Shapiro said there may yet be a little time before the company has to sell itself .
Washington Mutual filed a memorandum of understanding with OTS , indicating that it had enough capital to keep operating .
" We do n't see any sign of true panic , " Shapiro said .

Reports of small chunks of blue plastic in Lean Cuisine brand frozen chicken dinners have led Nestle Prepared Foods Co. to recall 900,000 pounds worth of meals .
The frozen dinners were distributed nationwide , and at least one person has reported an injury , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food Safety and Inspection Service .
No other details of the reported injury have been released by the USDA .
However , Roz O'Hearn , spokeswoman for the Nestle Prepared Foods , told ABCNews.com in an e-mail that " there have been no reports of any injuries requiring medical attention . "
So far , the blue plastic has been found in three specific Lean Cuisine dinners -- Cafe Classics Pesto Chicken with Bow Tie Pasta , Spa Cuisine Chicken Mediterranean and Dinnertime Selects Chicken Tuscan .
O'Hearn said the company has received seven consumer complaints , " with one report that a consumer bit into it . "
The USDA considered the blue plastic a potential health threat and has ranked the recall as Class I -- a " health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious , adverse health consequences or death . "
" It could cause injury -- a piece of plastic could cut your mouth , it could scratch your throat , " said Amanda Eamich , spokesperson for the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service .
Eamich said the USDA knew the recalled dinners were distributed nationwide , but it would take time to track precisely which regions , states and cities received the contaminated shipments .
O'Hearn said Nestle traced the blue plastic to a single lot of raw ingredients shipped to a Lean Cuisine facility .
" We are requesting that you return recalled items directly to your supermarket for a full refund , " said O'Hearn .
According to the USDA , the contaminated dinners were produced between Aug. 18 and Oct. 27 of this year .
To determine whether a dinner in your freezer is contaminated , O'Hearn said consumers can call 800 - 227-6188 to check the production codes on the side of Lean Cuisine packages .
The USDA has also provided a list of production codes so consumers can check to see if their dinners have been recalled .
The following products are subject to recall :
9.5 - ounce packages of Cafe Classics Pesto Chicken with Bow Tie Pasta brand frozen meals .
Printed on the side of each package is a production code of 8280595912 as well as a use - by date of " Best Before May 2010 . "
10.5 - ounce packages of Spa Cuisine Chicken Mediterranean brand frozen meals .
Printed on the side of each package is a production code of 8231595912 or 8241595912 as well as a use - by date of " Best before Sept. 2010 " ; a production code of 8263595912 , 8269595911 or 8274595912 , as well as a use - by date of " Best before Oct. 2010 " ; or , a production code of 8291595912 or 8301595912 " as well as a use - by date of " Best before Nov. 2010 . "
12.5 - ounce packages of Dinnertime Selects Chicken Tuscan brand frozen meals .
Printed on the side of each package is a production code of 8234595911 and a use - by date of Best before Sept. 2009 ; a production code of 8253595911 or 8269595912 as well as a use - by date of Best before Oct. 2009 ; or a production code of 8292595911 or 8296595911 as well as a use - by date of " Best before Nov. 2009 .

Obama Picks Up Another Electoral Vote Nebraska is one of the two states ( along with Maine ) that awards one electoral vote for each congressional district carried plus two for the statewide winner .
It now appears that Obama won NE - 02 ( Omaha ) and picks up another electoral vote .
This is the first time since 1828 that either state has split its EVs .
The mapping software was n't set up to color in Omaha separately , so the state will be marked in purple to indicate the red+blue split .
Nebraska Republicans have reacted to this development with dismay and intend to introduce legislation in 2009 to go to a winner - take - all system like 48 other states .
Although technically the ( unicameral ) legislature is nonpartisan , de facto , the Republicans control it and also the governor 's mansion , so they will probably succeed .
An indirect effect of Obama winning the electoral vote is to provide a solid precedent for allowing a state to allocate its electoral votes as its state legislature determines by state law .
This issue could come up again if the Interstate Compact is adopted by states with 270 electoral votes .
If this happens , then those states will cast all their electoral votes for the winner of the national popular vote ( not the state popular vote ) , de facto eliminating the electoral college without a constitutional amendment .
Currently four states ( Hawaii , Illinois , Maryland , and New Jersey ) have passed it .
If another dozen or so blue states were to pass it , it would come into being and there would surely be court fights about the right of a state legislature to determine how its electoral votes were cast ( even though the constitution is pretty clear it is up to the states to choose their electors as they wish ) .
Having a precedent for something other than winner - take - all would strengthen that court case .
Reichert Wins in WA - 08 Rep. Dave Reichert ( R - WA ) won a close House election against Darcy Burner in WA - 08 .
Burner has conceded .
This is the second straight time Reichert has edged out Burner in a very close election in this swing district .
With Frank Kratovil 's victory in MD - 01 yesterday , the number of House races still undecided has declined to six .
They are : AK - AL , CA - 04 , OH - 15 , and VA - 05 plus two seats in Louisiana ( LA - 02 and LA - 04 ) where there will be runoffs in December .
Of these undecided races , VA - 05 is the closest to being resolved .
Tom Perriello ( D ) now holds a 745 - vote lead over Rep. Virgil Goode ( R ) with all the votes counted .
Perriello has claimed victory but Goode ( rhymes with food ) , who has represented this district ( which includes the fairly liberal Charlottesville ) in Congress for six terms has not conceded defeat yet .
Goode is nothing if not flexible .
He used to be a Democrat , then he was an independent and is now a Republican .
He also switched from being a Presbyterian to a being a Baptist .
Goode has been in the news repeatedly due to his " anchor babies , " his term for the babies of illegal immigrants who are born on U.S. soil and are thus automatically U.S. citizens .
While theoretically a court could deport a woman in the country illegally and tell her to either take her baby with her or give it up for adoption , most judges are very hesitant to separate a mother from her baby , even if the law allows this .
Goode has argued against providing government services ( such as health care ) for illegals ( such as the mother of the anchor baby ) .
As Virginia has become more Democratic over the past three election cycles , these views have become less popular and this may be the end of the road for Goode .
State of the Senate Races Sen. Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) has conceded , so Jeff Merkley ( D ) will be the new senator from Oregon .
However , three Senate races are still up in the air .
The most contentious one is in Minnesota where Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) currently leads Al Franken ( D ) by 221 votes .
Coleman has asked Franken to waive the automatic recount to save the taxpayers $ 90,000 , but Franken declined to take up his kind offer .
One peculiarity of this race is the presence of 25,000 undervotes , that is ballots in which someone voted for President but not for senator .
Such ballots are perfectly legal , but it seems unusual that someone would stand in line for a long time to vote for President but skip the extremely visible and contentious Senate race .
Some observers think that these voters may not have marked their Senate choice darkly enough on the ballot so the optical scanners missed them .
In a hand recount , some of these votes will be picked up .
Of great concern to Coleman is that 18,000 of the undervotes came from counties that Obama carried .
Probably a large fraction of these voters support the DFL ( Democratic - Farmer - Labor party , as the Democratic party is called in Minnesota ) and intended to vote for Franken .
A bitter fight here is likely .
In the presidential race , McCain led Obama in Missouri by 6000 votes when the regular votes were counted , but now they are counting the provisional ballots and absentee ballots .
The Alaska Senate race is still open , with convicted felon Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) leading by 4000 votes with 70,000 absentee ballots yet to be counted .
If Stevens wins , Sen. Jim De Mint ( R - SC ) wants to expel Stevens from the Senate , saying he does want any convicted felons in the GOP caucus .
If Stevens wins and is expelled , there will be a special election to fill the vacancy .
The most likely candidates would be Gov. Sarah Palin ( R - AK ) and Anchorage mayor Mark Begich ( D ) .
Given how popular Palin still is in Alaska , she could probably win that one , giving her a national platform for four years .
The whole thing is like a big chess game .
Speaking of big chess games , another one is going on in the Senate race in Georgia .
Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - GA ) beat Jim Martin ( D ) but apparently failed to get 50 % so there will be a runoff .
Chambliss has already enlisted John McCain , Mitt Romney , Rudy Giuliani , and every other big Republican gun in sight to campaign for him .
He has also started to smear Martin , as he did to Max Cleland in 2002 .
Barack Obama is in a bit of a bind here .
He would like an extra vote in the Senate , but if he campaigns for Martin , the press will see this as a proxy fight between Obama and McCain .
If Chambliss wins , as expected , the headlines will read : " McCain Wins Round 2 . "
For this reason , Obama probably wo n't campaign for Martin .
However , Martin might be able to get one or more Clintons to help out .
And since Bill Clinton is a fellow Southerner , that might carry some weight .
Still , Chambliss is the favorite .

The President - elect Barack Obama transition team and agenda website change.gov has listed comprehensive plans for the nation , including plans for LGBT rights .
Support for the LGBT Community
" While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969 , we still have a lot of work to do .
Too often , the issue of LGBT rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us .
But at its core , this issue is about who we are as Americans .
It 's about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect . "
The Obama - Biden Plan
-- Barack Obama , June 1 , 2007 * Expand Hate Crimes Statutes :
In 2004 , crimes against LGBT Americans constituted the third - highest category of hate crime reported and made up more than 15 percent of such crimes .
Barack Obama cosponsored legislation that would expand federal jurisdiction to include violent hate crimes perpetrated because of race , color , religion , national origin , sexual orientation , gender identity , or physical disability .
As a state senator , Obama passed tough legislation that made hate crimes and conspiracy to commit them against the law . *
Fight Workplace Discrimination : Barack Obama supports the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , and believes that our anti-discrimination employment laws should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity .
While an increasing number of employers have extended benefits to their employees ' domestic partners , discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace occurs with no federal legal remedy .
Obama also sponsored legislation in the Illinois State Senate that would ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . *
Support Full Civil Unions and Federal Rights for LGBT Couples : Barack Obama supports full civil unions that give same - sex couples legal rights and privileges equal to those of married couples .
Obama also believes we need to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1,100 + federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same - sex couples in civil unions and other legally - recognized unions .
These rights and benefits include the right to assist a loved one in times of emergency , the right to equal health insurance and other employment benefits , and property rights . *
Oppose a Constitutional Ban on Same - Sex Marriage : Barack Obama voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2006 which would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman and prevented judicial extension of marriage - like rights to same - sex or other unmarried couples . *
Repeal Do n't Ask - Do n't Tell : Barack Obama agrees with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili and other military experts that we need to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
The key test for military service should be patriotism , a sense of duty , and a willingness to serve .
Discrimination should be prohibited .
The U.S. government has spent millions of dollars replacing troops kicked out of the military because of their sexual orientation .
Additionally , more than 300 language experts have been fired under this policy , including more than 50 who are fluent in Arabic .
Obama will work with military leaders to repeal the current policy and ensure it helps accomplish our national defense goals . *
Expand Adoption Rights : Barack Obama believes that we must ensure adoption rights for all couples and individuals , regardless of their sexual orientation .
He thinks that a child will benefit from a healthy and loving home , whether the parents are gay or not . *
Promote AIDS Prevention :
In the first year of his presidency , Barack Obama will develop and begin to implement a comprehensive national HIV / AIDS strategy that includes all federal agencies .
The strategy will be designed to reduce HIV infections , increase access to care and reduce HIV - related health disparities .
Obama will support common sense approaches including age - appropriate sex education that includes information about contraception , combating infection within our prison population through education and contraception , and distributing contraceptives through our public health system .
Obama also supports lifting the federal ban on needle exchange , which could dramatically reduce rates of infection among drug users .
Obama has also been willing to confront the stigma -- too often tied to homophobia -- that continues to surround HIV / AIDS .
He will continue to speak out on this issue as president .*
Empower Women to Prevent HIV / AIDS : In the United States , the percentage of women diagnosed with AIDS has quadrupled over the last 20 years .
Today , women account for more than one quarter of all new HIV / AIDS diagnoses .
Barack Obama introduced the Microbicide Development Act , which will accelerate the development of products that empower women in the battle against AIDS .
Microbicides are a class of products currently under development that women apply topically to prevent transmission of HIV and other infections .
The transition team is also taking your opinions on civil rights , and ideas for moving the country forward .
Welcome to the home of busted carbon .
If you have any photos , please send them to me
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The United States is blocking efforts to get next month ’s Group of Eight summit to agree targets for cutting carbon emissions over the next 10 to 20 years , according to a draft of the declaration seen by Reuters .
The Chevron Burnaby Oil Refinery sits in the inner harbour of the Burrard Inlet in this view from West Vancouver , British Columbia , April 29 , 2008 .

The draft , dated May 5 , shows that Washington wants to make the Major Emitters grouping set up by U.S. President George W. Bush last year the main forum for climate action , taking the initiative away from the smaller group of rich nations .
“ In the U.S. view , the appropriate place for addressing long - term and mid-term goals is the Major Economies Leaders Declaration , ” said a U.S. comment in the draft .
“ We would be prepared to address mid-term goals in the G8 only if the Major Economies Leaders Statement does not do so and only in a way that points to the need for commitments from major emerging economies , ” it said .
The July 7 - 9 G8 summit at Hokkaido in Japan is due to adopt the informal goal agreed a year ago that global carbon emissions should be reduced by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
However the U.S. climate draft does not include a 2050 goal .
There is also rising pressure to set mid-term goals for 2020 to 2030 as well , as a way of reinforcing the long - term target .
The U.S. G8 draft does not include a mid-term goal .
EU comments on the G8 draft declaration stress G8 leadership and state that the developed countries must commit to carbon emission cuts of between 25 and 40 percent by 2020 .
The Major Economies Meeting -- also known as the Major Emitters Meeting -- will take place in Japan on the sidelines of the G8 summit .
It groups the United States , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , South Korea , South Africa and Britain , as well as the European Union and the United Nations .
VAGUE LANGUAGE
The vague language on long - term cuts in the U.S. draft declaration for the Major Emitters Meeting could give Washington scope to argue that the mid-term issue had been addressed in that forum , therefore removing the need for G8 intervention .
The draft also seeks to defer any agreement on specific mid-term goals to a U.N. meeting in December 2009 which is hoped will agree a successor to the Kyoto Protocol on cutting carbon emissions which expires at the end of 2012 .
The U.S. which only recently acknowledged that global warming was at least in part due to burning fossil fuels for power and transport , also rejected proposals by the G8 for an industry - by - industry approach to carbon curbs .
It said the Major Emitters , not the G8 , was the appropriate forum for any such declaration .
“ We are prepared to address it in the G8 only if the MEM Leaders Declaration fails to capture the sectoral approach idea , ” it said .
Washington endorsed expansion of civil nuclear power as a low carbon technology and says biofuels are not the main cause of the recent surge in world food prices .
The United States is promoting major nuclear expansion at home and is hoping to sell the technology abroad .
It is also investing heavily in biofuel research and development and production .
“ The expansion of nuclear energy would help to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and would provide the greater global energy security by diversifying supply options , ” said the U.S. comment in the draft G8 text .
It called for agreement in the Doha round of world trade talks on eliminating barriers to trade in green goods and services , adding that a voluntary deal within the G8 would not be the right approach .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) The U.S. is in the grip of fear .
People are so worried about the collapse of the economy that they 've stopped going to the mall , and they 're cutting every expense they can think of to save money for the hard times ahead .
They 've even stopped going to Starbucks .
Bankers too have pulled their purse strings closed and refused to lend anything to anyone .
Investors have been selling their stocks and converting what 's left of their retirement accounts to cash that can be horded in a safe .
Even the usually optimistic media now wonders if America is sinking into a depression .
Everyone is waiting for Washington to do something to end the crisis and get the country back on track .
But the truth is that even with its new administration , Washington is no more able to save the U.S. from depression now than it was in the 1930's .
Most Americans alive today have never witnessed a depression .
They have lived through an unprecedented period of good times characterized by a predominance of peace , economic expansion and easy credit .
Sure there were a few recessions along the way , but the general growth trend remained intact .
People felt confident that this trend would continue , with each generation envisioning an even better future for its children .
People have come to think of wealth as ever - expanding .
They have seen each year on the job entitling them to a raise , and the purchase of a house entitling them to capital gains .
They have eschewed " safe " investments like certificates of deposit and government bonds , believing investment in stocks could pave the way to an early and cushy retirement .
For many years Americans have contemplated their future with complacency .
It 's been a great time to be alive , but good times always come to an end .
A depression is a severe downturn in economic activity that lasts for several years .
It is a period during which the economy fails to grow at all and actually shrinks .
The last depression , named , began in 1929 and lasted ten years .
Several years during this period experienced huge economic shrinkage : 1930 - 8.6%1931 - 6.4%1932 - 13%1933 - 1.3
% The unemployment rate during this time rose to 25 % , and wages for those who still had jobs fell 42 % .
Total U.S. economic output fell from $ 103 billion to $ 55 billion and world trade sank 65 % as measured in dollars .
For many people during this period it was not a question of whether they could afford the latest styles for their children .
It was a question of whether they were able to provide their families with a few potatoes to eat .
Like the coming depression of today , the Great Depression followed a period of monetary expansion and easy credit that sparked a real estate boom .
Just like today , many people moved into mansions and bought stocks believing that the market had no way to go but up .
During the period from October , 1929 to July , 1932 the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from about 375 to 48 , a decline of 89 % .
The Dow did not regain the levels seen in 1929 until 1954 , and that was only as a result of World War II .
Without the war , the downturn would have lasted longer .
Why did it get so bad ?
Many people think that the monetary policies of the Hoover administration were to blame .
Instead of pumping money into the economy and increasing the money supply , the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to fall by 30 % .
The " New Deal " period created many government programs geared to ending the Depression , but unemployment remained in the double - digits until 1941 , when the outbreak of World War II created defense - related jobs .
Today it is believed that another depression of this magnitude cannot happen because those in charge of monetary policy paid attention to the lessons learned from the Great Depression .
People believe that laws and government agencies exist to prevent that type of cataclysmic economic pain from happening again .
But the fact is that Washington cannot save the world from the coming depression , and here 's why : Right now the government owes its creditors $ 52 trillion in interest - bearing debts .
Based on estimates from the U.S. Government Accountability Office , there is another $ 60 trillion in contingency debts and obligations such as Social Security , Medicare and guaranteed pensions .
Add to that $ 596 trillion ( more than half a quadrillion ) that represents the total value of U.S. debts and derivatives placed worldwide .
These are the numbers that are on the table as of now .
They do n't include the increasing line - up of companies doomed to fail , such as General Motors and Ford or the increasing need for handouts to companies already on the list of the " too large to fail " , such as AIG .
As times get harder for all Americans , more and more companies will begin to fail and look to the government to save them .
The precedent has been set .
The list also does not include the mortgages that will implode when the second leg of house price declines kicks in following increased job loss .
The figures also do n't include government handouts to those whose families are hungry because the parents are unemployed .
Now , consider that even after the additions to the ever lengthening list of pledged government bailouts in recent months , the total amount of rescue money announced in the U.S. so far is $ 2.7 trillion , a huge sum but miniscule in comparison to the massive debt that needs to be accounted for .
Yet the mantra still exists that Washington can save us from another Great Depression because they wo n't repeat history and make the mistakes that were made in the 1930's .
Americans continue to think that Great Depression Part II will not come to pass .
It 's time for Americans to start adding up the numbers and drawing some conclusions .
The U.S. economy is like a ship that has struck an iceberg and is taking on water .
With the economy sinking , Washington is unable to fund the bailouts and reign in the debt with higher taxes .
Higher taxes would crimp even more the amount of money available to be spent by consumers to keep the economy propped up .
And as more and more people lose their jobs , the tax base gets smaller and smaller .
Many people think it is no problem for Washington to get its hands on money since it owns the printing presses .
This would be the easiest solution to the problem - print up huge amounts of money and cause hyperinflation .
That would solve everything .
Salaries would increase and therefore taxes would increase .
GDP would expand in dollar terms and the debt would begin to seem small since it would have been conceived in " old dollars " , and the " new dollars " would be hyperinflated .
But this wo n't work because a huge amount of U.S. debt is held by foreign creditors who have insisted on stability for their investments .
There is no way they would stand for the U.S. launching a mode of hyperinflation because it would drastically decrease their value of their holdings .
Right now these foreign debt holders are the country 's benefactors .
Without them , American is sunk .
They are calling the shots and America is scrambling to keep them happy .
There is nothing for the government to do but go out into the world with its hat in its hands and try to borrow more money .
In fact , this has already started with the borrowing of $ 550 trillion dollars in the fourth quarter of this year , more than the entire deficit of fiscal year 2008 .
According to Goldman Sachs , the immediate needs of the Treasury will be a whopping $ 2 trillion to finance the bailouts , the existing deficit , and the next refunding .
This huge refunding of the federal deficit will result in an avalanche of new Treasury securities that have to be sold to someone .
In order to beat the bushes for buyers in these skittish times , the Treasury will have to increase the interest rates offered on these securities , adding even more fuel to the debt fire .
The reason given to Congress as need for speedy approval of the bailout was that without it , no one would be able to get a loan .
The specter of the masses with their credit cards planted firmly on their hips was a scary thought to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Fed Chairman .
Washington needs consumers to borrow more , spend more , and save less .
But consumers are doing just the opposite .
Recent sales figures point to a collapse in retail sales .
Washington is pushing bankers to lend , but they wo n't do it .
It 's as though everyone has been slapped in the face with cold water .
As a result , the economy is left to fall on its face .
It is this coming together of debt and deflation that makes a depression inevitable .
It 's what happened in the 1930's and it's what is happening now .
The downward spiral is across many areas and will inevitably encompass most of American life .
Consumers and businesses slash spending and lay off workers , leading to fewer consumers with money to spend at the businesses , resulting in the need to lay off more workers and so on .
Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures bring on selling of more real estate , driving the prices lower and lower .
These falling prices then bring on more mortgage defaults .
Fear of bankruptcy forces selling of stocks in companies , and the selling of stocks brings on more bankruptcies .
It is the inevitable unwinding of the good times that lasted for 30 years .
It will take awhile for all this unwinding to play itself out .
The unwinding of the Great Depression took 10 years and the debt overhang was nothing like it is today .

‘ OUTRIGHT LIE ’ ON TAXES ….
When he ’s not talking about Britney Spears , arugula , or tire - pressure gauges , John McCain tends to attack Barack Obama on taxes .
In fact , most of McCain recent ads feature the phrase “ higher taxes ” — in all caps — alongside Obama ’s picture .
Obama is no doubt aware of McCain ’s deceptive attacks , and emphasized his tax plan in his acceptance speech in Denver on Thursday : “ You know , unlike John McCain , I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas , and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America .
I ’ll eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start - ups that will create the high - wage , high - tech jobs of tomorrow .
I will — listen now — I will cut taxes — cut taxes — for 95 percent of all working families , because , in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class . ”
With that in mind , it was encouraging to see the Washington Post editorial board note today that “ McCain ’s ads on taxes are just plain false , ” and his campaign ’s message is peddling a “ phony , misleading and at times outright dishonest ” line .
[ T ]he McCain campaign insists on completely misrepresenting Mr. Obama ’s plan .
The ad opens with the Obama - as - celebrity theme — “ Celebrities do n’t have to worry about family budgets , but we sure do , ” says the female announcer .
“ We ’re paying more for food and gas , making it harder to save for college , retirement . ”
Then she sticks it to him : “ Obama ’s solution ?
Higher taxes , called ‘ a recipe for economic disaster . ’
He ’s ready to raise your taxes but not ready to lead . ”
The facts ?
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the Obama plan would give households in the bottom fifth of the income distribution an average tax cut of 5.5 percent of income ( $ 567 ) in 2009 , while those in the middle fifth would get an average cut of 2.6 percent of income ( $ 1,118 ) .
“ Your taxes ” would go up , yes — but not if you ’re someone who is sweating higher gas prices .
By contrast , Mr. McCain ’s tax plan would give those in the bottom fifth of income an average tax cut of $ 21 in 2009 .
The middle fifth would get $ 325 — less than a third of the Obama cut .
The wealthiest taxpayers make out terrifically .
The Post does n’t seem fond of any plan to cut taxes , but the editorial board nevertheless concludes that McCain has been pushing an “ outright lie . ”
Given that news outlets are generally very reluctant to use the “ l ” word when it comes to McCain ’s shameless dishonesty , it was encouraging to see Hiatt & Co. set the record straight .
Gen Dunwoody has been in logistics for most of her army career An American woman has been promoted to four - star general - the first female to reach the US Army 's highest rank .
In her acceptance speech , Ann E Dunwoody said she had never expected to rise so high in the ranks in her 33 - year career .
She said no - one was more surprised than she and her husband .
" Behind every successful woman there 's an astonished man , " she added .
There are 21 female generals , most of them one - star , in the US Army .
Women make up 14 % of the army 's active service strength of more than 500,000 soldiers .
' Open doors ' Gen Dunwoody comes from a long line of soldiers .
" A Dunwoody has fought in every American war since the Revolution , " said army chief - of - staff Gen George Casey .
Gen Dunwoody is married to retired air force officer Craig Brotchie .
" There is no - one more surprised than I , except of course , my husband , " she told an auditorium packed with the military 's top brass .
" And you know what they say , behind every successful woman there 's an astonished man . "
Defence Secretary Robert Gates said : " History will no doubt take note of [ Dunwoody 's ] achievement in breaking through this final ' brass ceiling ' to pin on this fourth star .
" But she would rather be known and remembered first and foremost as a US Army soldier . "
She is now head of the Army Materiel Command , in charge of weapons , equipment and uniforms for the army .
Women are barred from combat roles but have been allowed in the past two decades to serve in a wide variety of other positions .
" It 's been my experience in my 33 years in the military that the doors have continued to open and the opportunities have continued to expand , " she said .

DONALD KNUTH - Computer Literacy Bookshops Interview
December 7th , 1993
Now Professor Emeritus at Stanford University , Knuth is once again channeling his full energies into writing .
Dan Doernberg interviewed him in December 1993 to see what he 's been doing recently , and what we have to look forward to .
Knuth :
The CWEB system is an add - on to C that makes programming better than any other method known in the world , by far .
I simply have to be honest and say that it 's the greatest thing that 's there .
The CWEB System of Structured Documentation is the definitive user manual and complete explanation , more than anybody really needs to know about CWEB .
CLB : You 've said that CWEB gives an order of magnitude improvement in programmer productivity --- how so ?
Knuth :
Well , maybe not an order of magnitude , maybe only a factor of two .
People who have used CWEB have noticed that they write better programs , that the programs are more portable , more easily debugged , more easily maintained ... and they do n't take as long to write .
CLB : Has CWEB been used just at Stanford , or in industry as well ?
Knuth :
It 's being used around the world .
We 've had WEB , the original version ( for Pascal ) in a variety of systems , and then more and more people started getting infected by it .
TeX was written in WEB .
Silvio Levy did the conversion to CWEB in 1987 .
It was experimental for a long time , and now I 'm just saying " The experiment worked ! " .
CWEB is much better than WEB , because C is a much nicer language to work with for system programming and lots of other things .
For anybody who really cares about programming , I have no idea why they would not prefer this to any other system .
CLB : Easy to use , runs fast , all that good stuff ?
Knuth : Right , and it makes you happy after you finish writing a program !
CLB : Even if you write a bad program ?!
Editor 's Note : Ed Rollins , who served as political director for President Reagan , is a Republican strategist who was national chairman of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's 2008 presidential campaign .
Ed Rollins says internal divisions are preventing McCain 's campaign from getting out a clear message .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A campaign at war with itself cannot fight its opponent effectively .
We have seen two major campaigns this year that could be described as internally divided -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's losing primary campaign and now Sen.
John McCain 's general election effort .
And while chaos and disarray reigned supreme in Sen. Barack Obama 's opponents ' campaigns , the steady , disciplined and strategically driven Obama campaign marches forward toward likely victory .
Clinton 's campaign had several different groups setting and implementing strategy .
They include the first campaign team led by pollster Mark Penn , her loyalists from the White House days led by eventual campaign manager Maggie Williams and campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe , and a rump group led by her husband .
Prior to this year and his efforts on his wife 's behalf , President Clinton was viewed as one of the best political strategists around .
All that brain power could n't come together and agree on a consistent strategy to beat a young inexperienced outsider .
There will be second guessing and finger pointing for years to come .
We now see something similar in the McCain campaign .
There have been at least three major managerial changes or overthrows in the past 18 months .
The first was the Rick Davis / John Weaver battle .
Weaver and Mike Murphy , one of the best media strategists in the business , were the key players in the 2000 McCain effort and Weaver was the political guru who guided McCain 's efforts since then .
Davis , with a major assist from Cindy McCain and his former lobbying partner , Charlie Black , ousted Weaver .
Davis and Black , who masterminded Bob Dole 's unsuccessful 1996 campaign and Phil Gramm 's aborted presidential effort before that , are super lobbyists , and they opened the doors to their K Street allies .
Davis was then replaced -- in reality if not in title -- by Steve Schmidt , part of Karl Rove 's operation .
Schmidt is a first - rate tactician but new to McCain 's world , and he still shares power with Black and Davis .
This campaign would have been a much different operation if Weaver and Murphy had been brought back ; but that was never going to happen with Davis and Black .
In the end , it 's not relevant who holds what title in the McCain operation , because it is not being run by campaign professionals , but by the Washington lobbying class .
iReport.com : What do you think about the election ?
Share video commentary
And no one seems to be in charge , least of all the candidate .
The end result is a campaign suffering from " schizophrenia . "
John McCain is saying one thing on the stump , his running mate another .
But the worst sin is that his advertising campaign is incoherent and putting out multiple and inconsistent messages .
What McCain and his campaign need to understand is that whatever happened in the past is no longer relevant .
James Carville 's famous slogan in Bill Clinton 's 1992 victory over the first Bush : " It 's the economy stupid ! " can now be replaced with " You morons , what have you done with my money , my life and my kids ' future ? "
If John McCain wants anyone to pay attention to him in the last three weeks of this campaign , he must address those concerns .
Attacking Obama for his association with Bill Ayers -- the unrepentant Vietnam - era terrorist who should have been jailed four decades ago for bombing New York City Police Headquarters , the United States Capitol building , and the Pentagon -- is a legitimate tactic .
So is asking questions regarding the influence of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's controversial pastor .
The problem is that few voters care about what happened 40 years ago when in the last few weeks they have seen their savings and retirements and possibly their jobs and homes going up in flames .
If you do n't talk to voters about their concerns they will not spend one minute listening to you in the closing days of a campaign .
Government is not working .
President Bush 's leadership has failed the country and Congress has not done much better .
How are you going to be better ?
That 's the question voters want answered .
With one debate remaining and less than three weeks of campaigning left , John McCain 's 10 - year quest to be president is coming to a close and -- as of today -- a dreadful one .
All I can advise is " Engage us , John ! "
You are an honorable man who has dedicated your life to serving this country .
Quit the name calling and make the last weeks about leadership and solutions .
Accept Obama 's challenge issued last week : " The American people are n't looking for someone who can divide this country .
They 're looking for somebody who will lead this country . "
Tell us how you will lead this country through the greatest crisis we have faced in modern times .
And Sen. McCain , remember your own words of last week about Obama : " He 's a decent family man -- citizen -- that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . "
Tell us what those disagreements are .
Then , at least voters can make their final choices on things that matter to them now .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • Bill Clinton
At this point seeing housing prices drop is n’t a shock .
What should be a shock and revelation to everyone is the extent of the damage the bubble has caused in certain areas .
This trauma can only be measured now that we are seeing foreclosures spring up and we are realizing what peak prices were paid for tiny homes that really did not deserve to be any where near the top price .
No one will really uncover every single case of fraud during this epic boom .
This kind of fraud is a crime of opportunity and criminals donned a suit and ripped off thousands of people only to do it once again .
Now we are starting to hear stories about these same people changing shop and now becoming “ foreclosure specialist ” and taking more money of an already distraught populace .
The FBI should go after these people and raid their bank accounts .
The Los Angeles housing market has been ripped to shreds with this housing debacle .
There is simply no other way to describe the carnage .
When you see prices falling 38 % from their peak in one year you know something is changing drastically .
No one has been left immune from this including once nighttime sidekick Ed McMahon and his Beverly Hills mansion .
Today we are going to look at a home in a lower - income area in Los Angeles County .
Today we salute you Pico Rivera with our Real Home of Genius Award .
Real Home of Genius – Peak Price
Pico Rivera is located southeast from the downtown of Los Angeles .
Pico Rivera is your common working class L.A. city with 64,336 people calling the city home .
The city was named after Pío Pico who was the last Californio governor of California .
In 1982 Northrop Grumman purchased a former Ford plant .
Years later in 1988 it was revealed that much of the work on the B - 2 Spirit bomber was completed on the site .
This location now has a WalMart and Lowes .
How times have changed .
The current median price for a home in the city is $ 315,000 which is down 28.4 % from a year ago .
Even at these levels , it is still too high .
The median household income for a family in the city is $ 41,564 according to the 2000 Census .
Given that wages have remained stagnant for the region , I would imagine that not much has changed since then .
After all , you go from replacing a Ford plant , to a Northrop Grumman plant , to a WalMart .
This is a microcosm of what is occurring in places in Michigan except here in L.A .
The only difference here is there a large enough population to keep the consumption going .
That is until this bubble burst .
As I discussed in a previous article , the most someone should spend on a home is 3 times their gross income on a mortgage .
Here is the simple equation again :
Now given this equation , if we are to take the median income family we would get the following :
$ 41,564 x 3 = $ 124,692 Pico Rivera median home price in sane world
So the current median price of $ 315,000 is still absurd and demonstrates a willingness of people to still over pay even in the current climate .
Take a look at this home in the city that exemplifies this insanity :
This stunning 744 square foot home has 2 bedrooms and 1 bath .
It was built in 1938 although the peak price would make you think it was last sold in 2038 .
The home has been on the market for 113 days with no action .
Time to reduce the price a bit :
Price Reduced : 09/03/08 — $ 189,900 to $ 174,900
Nice movement .
Let us take a picture of the backyard before we decide on whether this is a good deal :
The ad tells us “ lot all dirt ” which we can clearly see for ourselves .
We are also told in the ad that this place has “ high ceilings . ”
Oh yeah .
You have to be high to believe that .
At least they tell us in the ad that this is a major fixer .
Take a look at the inside :
Again , are these photographs going to inspire us to buy ?
Before you start feeling sorry take a look at the sales history on this place :
06/13/2008 : $ 169,400 *
12/12/2006 : $ 425,000
02/03/1995 : $ 105,000
The June line item is simply the lender taking this place back .
Take a look at the peak price .
$ 425,000 for a 744 square foot home in Pico Rivera !
This 744 square foot home !
Which lender made that absurd loan ?
Paulson should flat out reject the entire institution on the basis of this one bonehead decision .
Really , an area with a median income slightly over $ 41,000 is seeing a 744 square foot home sell for $ 425,000 .
This was n’t even two years ago .
This home is the epitome of a Real Home of Genius .
You may be thinking that the price now makes sense .
It does n’t .
Keep in mind that Northrop Grumman when it was working on the project employed an estimated 13,000 people .
These were high paying jobs .
Do you think someone working at WalMart or Lowes can afford a $ 174,900 home ?
Would they even want to buy this place ?
As an investor , why would you even buy this place ?
Keep in mind a similar rental to this place would go for $ 950 a month even after the stunning 59 % price discount or a loss of $ 250,100 in less than two years .
The numbers at first glance seem appetizing .
That is after you run the real figures :
Monthly Rent : $ 950
Principal and Interest : $ 978 ( 7.5 % with 20 % down investment property )
Taxes and Insurance : $ 182
Misc Expenses : $ 95
Monthly net loss : -$ 305 FAIL
Downpayment : $ 34,980
Mortgage Amount : $ 139,920
This home fails on every front .
Today we salute you Pico Rivera with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned that international forces are planning the creation of a global central bank that will see a new fiat monetary system come to dominate the world economy .
The 2008 presidential candidate also warned that Barack Obama ’s administration will only represent a change in faces and not in policies .
Speaking about the recent G20 meeting Paul told Russia Today :
“ I think something will come of it but you probably did n’t hear about it yet .
There was some pomp and ceremony that the public knew about , but behind the scenes they were talking about the future and what they are going to do to try to internationalize all regulations , going in the opposite direction of free market and more towards international regulations .
I ’m sure they even talked about an international central bank . ”
Paul also pointed out that global bankers have been holding their own talks on the same matter :
“ At the same time the G20 was meeting , we also had the central banks meeting in Europe .
Bernanke was over there , and they are doing the same type of planning , so real planning will not be out in the open , until they want us to know about it . ” the Congressman said .
“ The system that we have today where the fiat dollar is a reserve currency of the world , it ’s losing that status and they have to replace it .
Hopefully they ’ll have enough sense to realise that another international agreement along the Bretton Woods will be no more successful than the last one . ”
Paul continued .
The Congressman argued that more regulations administered by central banks , rather than placed on to central banks , represents a dangerous move away from the free market .
“ We could restructure by getting rid of all the central banks , then you would have honest money come up because nobody could commit fraud .
Governments get away with committing fraud – that ’s what fiat money is . ”
Paul commented .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The Congressman warned that an Obama presidency offers no alternative to the economic policies that have led the U.S. and the world to the brink of economic meltdown .
Paul Described the kind of change Obama offers as :
“ Just change in faces and change in party labels .
Both parties represent the same special interests , they both have to represent big business .
Obama ’s supposed to be a man of the people , well he collected $ 750 million , more money than anybody else ever collected .
Wall Street supported him , the media supported him , all the big money supported him , so his change is not going to be much change at all .
He ’s not talking about changing monetary policy , the Federal Reserve or getting rid of the income tax or bringing our troops home . ”
Paul also commented that he does not believe Obama will withdraw troops from Iraq and pointed out that he has never said he will close down the military bases throughout the country and eliminate the huge embassy in Baghdad .
“ Policy will remain interventionist , ” the Congressman warned .
“ We will remain in the middle east and we will not be coming home , we ’ll stay in Korea , we ’ll stay in Europe , we ’ll be in eastern Europe , we ’ll be doing all these things .
Even though Obama benefited tremendously from ‘ change ’ , all we are changing is the face of our government . ”
Paul also warned that the stage has been set for fresh terrorist attacks in the U.S. as a consequence of a sustained interventionist foreign policy .

F# 101 F# , the latest member of the Visual Studio family of languages , offers some enticing advantages over C# and Visual Basic , stemming from its functional - object fusion nature .
by Ted Neward Oct 14 , 2008 Page 1 of 3 riginally a research language from Microsoft Research , F# has long been a " secret weapon " in the arsenal of .NET programmers for doing statistically and mathematically heavy coding .
More recently , however , a growing number of developers have begun to see the inherent advantages implicit in writing functional code , particularly in the areas of concurrency .
The buzz has begun to approach interesting levels following on the heels of an announcement last year from the head of the Microsoft Developer Division , S. " Soma " Somasegar , that F# would be " productized " and fully supported by Microsoft as a whole , suddenly removing the stigma and licensing restrictions that surround research projects .
One of the more recent ideas that 's sweeping the industry is the notion of " domain - specific languages , " ( DSLs ) whereby a developer builds a language that others ( typically either skilled knowledge workers / subject matter experts , or sometimes even other programmers ) will use to solve the particular business problems facing them .
As Neal Ford describes , two different kinds of DSLs permeate the space : internal DSLs , built on top of an existing language 's syntax , and external DSLs , built in some of the same ways as languages such as C# and Visual Basic — with a parser , an abstract syntax tree to store the parsed code , and either an interpreter to run the resulting program , or a code generator to turn it into an executable program .
As it turns out , F# 's derivation from a long line of functional languages means it has many of the tools necessary to make it easy to create simple external DSLs : discriminated unions , pattern matching , and combinatorial processing — all of which will probably be meaningless terms to the reader who 's never ventured outside of the object - oriented realm before .
In this article , I 'll go over F# 's basic syntax , paying close attention to both those concepts that closely mirror that of the traditional O - O languages , and those that are brand new to the C# / VB programmer .
While it 's entirely unreasonable to expect to master the F# language ( or any non-trivial language ) in a single column , by the end of this article , you should at least be able to recognize and read F# code , letting you dive more deeply into F# if and when appropriate .
Concepts
F# is a functional programming language for the CLR based on another functional / object language , OCaml .
F# is a CLR - adapted version of the Object - CAML language , also known as OCaml .
As a functional language , F# espouses several core key ideas : Static typing is a good safeguard to writing good code so long as the type information can stay out of the programmer 's way ( also known as type inferencing ) .
Functions are values and have first - class semantics right alongside integers and strings ; that shared and / or mutable state should be minimized ( if not avoided outright ) .
Functional design permits and encourages composition and substitutability ( which is where F# and other functional languages get much of their reputation for being " mathematical " languages ) .
Some of these concepts are more subtle than they may seem at first .
For example , type inferencing means less explicit code needed to make the compiler happy , which in turn not only means that you can express the same concepts in less code in F# , but also that much of the verbosity of generics in C# effectively " fall away " when writing similar code in F# .
Before going too deeply into a more conceptual discussion , a quick glance at some F# code may help put a framework around some of these ideas .
Setup
To get started , you must install the F# binaries .
As of this writing , F# still resides on the Microsoft Research site , the latest version is 1.9.4.17 .
You can find the download via the
When installed , F# not only puts several executables , assemblies , and assorted samples into the installation directory , but also registers its Visual Studio language service support .
This registration gives the F# developer much the same development experience as the C# or VB developer , with an added bonus : an extra tool window called interactive mode , which allows the F# developer to type some F# code and execute it immediately , much as the Immediate Window works in the debugger .
Simply " swipe " some code from the editor window with the mouse , hit Alt - Enter , and Visual Studio " automagically " pastes and executes the selected code in the Interactive Window .
( This is by far the easiest way to explore the language and its concepts . )
Author 's Note : The F# package will also install into the Visual Studio Isolated Shell , so programmers who do n't have a copy of the commercial Visual Studio bits can still play along .
Functional programming languages encourage immutable state and zero " side effects , " making them ideal for programming in highly concurrent environments .
Assuming F# has installed successfully , fire up Visual Studio , create a new F# Project ( under the " Other Project Types " node ) , add a new item ( " F# Source file " ) , and call it file1.fs ( the default ) .
Notice that when you open the new file , the compiler populates it with a large number of F# example snippets , which serve as an easy way of getting started with the language .
Have a look at the code in that template file later ; for now , delete it all and replace it with the following code : F# 's version of the ubiquitous " Hello world " program :
# light let language = " F# " printfn " Hello , % A " language Congratulations !
You are now an F# programmer .
Editor 's Note :
This article was first published in the September / October 2008 issue of CoDe Magazine , and is reprinted here by permission .
riginally a research language from Microsoft Research , F# has long been a " secret weapon " in the arsenal of .NET programmers for doing statistically and mathematically heavy coding .
More recently , however , a growing number of developers have begun to see the inherent advantages implicit in writing functional code , particularly in the areas of concurrency .
The buzz has begun to approach interesting levels following on the heels of an announcement last year from the head of the Microsoft Developer Division , S. " Soma " Somasegar , that F# would be " productized " and fully supported by Microsoft as a whole , suddenly removing the stigma and licensing restrictions that surround research projects .
One of the more recent ideas that 's sweeping the industry is the notion of " domain - specific languages , " ( DSLs ) whereby a developer builds a language that others ( typically either skilled knowledge workers / subject matter experts , or sometimes even other programmers ) will use to solve the particular business problems facing them .
As Neal Ford describes , two different kinds of DSLs permeate the space : internal DSLs , built on top of an existing language 's syntax , and external DSLs , built in some of the same ways as languages such as C# and Visual Basic — with a parser , an abstract syntax tree to store the parsed code , and either an interpreter to run the resulting program , or a code generator to turn it into an executable program .
As it turns out , F# 's derivation from a long line of functional languages means it has many of the tools necessary to make it easy to create simple external DSLs : discriminated unions , pattern matching , and combinatorial processing — all of which will probably be meaningless terms to the reader who 's never ventured outside of the object - oriented realm before .
In this article , I 'll go over F# 's basic syntax , paying close attention to both those concepts that closely mirror that of the traditional O - O languages , and those that are brand new to the C# / VB programmer .
While it 's entirely unreasonable to expect to master the F# language ( or any non-trivial language ) in a single column , by the end of this article , you should at least be able to recognize and read F# code , letting you dive more deeply into F# if and when appropriate .
F# is a CLR - adapted version of the Object - CAML language , also known as OCaml .
As a functional language , F# espouses several core key ideas : Some of these concepts are more subtle than they may seem at first .
For example , type inferencing means less explicit code needed to make the compiler happy , which in turn not only means that you can express the same concepts in less code in F# , but also that much of the verbosity of generics in C# effectively " fall away " when writing similar code in F#.
Before going too deeply into a more conceptual discussion , a quick glance at some F# code may help put a framework around some of these ideas .
To get started , you must install the F# binaries .
As of this writing , F# still resides on the Microsoft Research site , the latest version is 1.9.4.17 .
You can find the download via the F# site .
Look for the latest release link in the announcements column on the right - hand side ( the actual download URL changes with each release ) .
When installed , F# not only puts several executables , assemblies , and assorted samples into the installation directory , but also registers its Visual Studio language service support .
This registration gives the F# developer much the same development experience as the C# or VB developer , with an added bonus : an extra tool window called interactive mode , which allows the F# developer to type some F# code and execute it immediately , much as the Immediate Window works in the debugger .
Simply " swipe " some code from the editor window with the mouse , hit Alt - Enter , and Visual Studio " automagically " pastes and executes the selected code in the Interactive Window .
( This is by far the easiest way to explore the language and its concepts . )
Assuming F# has installed successfully , fire up Visual Studio , create a new F# Project ( under the " Other Project Types " node ) , add a new item ( " F# Source file " ) , and call it ( the default ) .

LIVERMORE , California —
Who says that there ’s nothing good about nuclear weapons research ?
The National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was built by the Department of Energy to gather data on the thermonuclear reactions that occur inside atomic weapons .
And as an excellent side bonus , NIF ( rhymes with stiff ) could unlock the secret of harnessing fusion for unlimited , clean electricity .
To achieve these high - fallutin ’ goals , NIF contains 192 of the world ’s most powerful lasers , which wend their way through a series of amplifiers inside the three - football - fields - long laser bay .
At the end of their journey , their energy is focused onto a tiny target about the size of the end of your pinkie .
When the facility is up to full - power , sometime next year , the physicists hope the lasers will fuse hydrogen atoms inside the target into helium , giving off more power than was pumped into them .
In this video , we tour the high - security facility and I talk with its director , Ed Moses , about this unique place and its role in the future of energy .
Every week , Wired Science will bring you videos on the latest in science , medicine , energy , and space .
You can subscribe to the podcast through iTunes , too , so check us out there .

Are producers of a new Doctor Who spin - off so afraid of fan backlash that they 've shut down their official production site ?
That seems to be the case when it comes to the new , Australian - made K - 9 series ; the show 's website went live earlier this week , giving fans a chance to see behind the scenes of the show before it shoots ... and then apparently went offline a few days later .
What happened ?
British magazine SFX visited the site when it went live , and was n't too impressed by what it found :
Advertisement
Although light on pictures of the metal mutt himself – and even lighter on details about the show – there are loads of photos of locations and sets being built .
Although one location is identified as Sherwood Forest , we do n’t reckon this means there ’s a Robin Hood episode , because there is , in fact a Sherwood Forest in Australia as well .
No sign of any gravel pits , but it looks like there might be a story set in natural history museum ...
Seems like this show may be a bigger deal than we were all expecting .
But the design of K9 - who'll allegedly be realised in CGi – still looks a bit naff , if you ask us .

Within a few hours of this report being posted , the site was suddenly password protected :
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Also suddenly present , the sentence " Information on this site is available only to authorised members of the production . "
So was the initial launch of the site a mistake , and it was always intended only to be available to people working on the show , or was access locked down after news of its existence was leaked online , alongside the word " naff " ?
We may never know , but one thing is for sure - We 're still unconvinced that the world needs a K - 9 series at all .
In a desperate bid to help U.S. banks recapitalize , Washington is dropping its inhibitions and reaching out to Canadian financial institutions to gauge their willingness to participate in rescue operations .
The Federal Reserve has activated a back channel that puts the central bank in direct contact with chief executives at Canada ’s largest banks and insurers , according to a person familiar with the dialogue .
They are approaching “ banks with major assets in the U.S. like [ Toronto - Dominion Bank ] and Royal [ Bank of Canada ] , because when they have a bailout situation they want everyone who is a potential buyer to look at it , ” the source said .
The ongoing conversations between the U.S. central bank and Canadian executives reflects the challenge facing Washington as it seeks to address both short - term liquidity and permanent capital needs of financial institutions crippled by more than $ 500 - billion in losses and limited access to financing .
The communications have included phone calls from Fed officials pitching potential sales of assets of U.S. financial companies and at least one intensive discussion of a major rescue operation , according to people familiar with the contacts .
The Fed has been steadily widening the circle of foreign institutions it is working with as the banking crisis has deepened , according to a former Fed official now on Wall Street .
The outreach to Canadian companies signals a more permissive environment in which U.S. authorities would look very favourably on an intervention by a Toronto - based institution .
It comes as Washington deploys greater reserves than initially anticipated to restore liquidity , while still facing an uphill battle to help banks recapitalize at a point in the crisis when projected losses of up to $ 1 - trillion still ahead for the global banking system .
The engagement of Canadian institutions follows U.S. federal assent for the acquisition of assets in bankrupt Lehman Brothers by the U.K. ’s Barclays , in a deal that followed intensive discussions with the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury .
That deal was smoothed by good relations between the London and Washington and a lower level of resistance to a deal with the U.K. on Capitol Hill , where political disquiet over foreign interventions has helped keep some buyers at bay .
“ Canada is not China , ” said a former Fed official .
A lobbyist for a Canadian bank said the political climate in Washington had changed markedly since the passage of a $ 700 - billion bailout and that this country is now seen as a potential source of support .
Executives and advisors in the Canadian financial services industry indicated they still saw live opportunities for their sector to help drive consolidation and recapitalization in the U.S. , despite limited flexibility at a time when sinking markets were lowering all boats .
“ I do n’t think Canadian banks want to take a lot of balance sheet risk but I do n’t think they are going to have to , ” the source said , adding that while the target banks have many subprime mortgages , the Federal Reserve will backstop these high - risk liabilities .
“ We could end up in a funny situation two years from now saying this was a once in a generational opportunity for Canadian banks . ”
U.S. regional banks remain in deep distress and an acquisition of this scale is seen as possible in the coming months , as Canadian banks cautiously explore possible buys and after TD Bank Financial Group put its name forward during an auction of Washington Mutual .
A broad sell - off in the U.S. insurance sector has also cut into the valuations and capital positions of U.S. insurers seen as possible matches for Sun Life and Manulife , the Canadian life insurers .
Sun is actively weighing the likelihood of an intervention in the U.S. , according to one person in the industry .
A foreign bank executive who participated in a recent round of rescue talks with the Fed said U.S. authorities were also keeping national regulators informed of high - stakes negotiations .
It was not clear how deeply involved Canadian authorities were in the discussions .
The Bank of Canada declined to comment .
We look at outrageously talented and successful people - the Beatles , Mozart , Rockefeller , Bill Gates - and assume there is such a thing as pure genius .
Not necessarily , argues Malcolm Gladwell ...
Say “ hooligan , ” and most will picture alcohol - fed football ( soccer ) fans of limited tooth count smashing one another in the face .
Their vehicular equivalents have a similar appetite for volatile fuels — you ’ll see no vehicle here listed on any EPA “ greenest ” list .
The applied violence here , however , results in nothing more than glares from onlookers and childish laughter inside the cabin from such behavior as burnouts , power slides , large applications of torque , and general tomfoolery .
Smooth is fast , but sideways is fun .
Why ?
Because it is .
Those who do n’t get sideways wo n’t like burnouts , either .
It ’s like asking a certain segment of the population why they insist on using pillow shams , which should be removed before using a pillow for things such as sleeping .
These cars are built to take the abuse .
Outsize personalities need to be backed up by overbuilt hardware , and these vehicles deliver .
Although hooligan vehicles might look a bit menacing , their talents are n’t always overtly broadcast .
Often , those that boast loudest fail , such as Chevrolet ’s thankfully offed SSR .
Driving it was like tucking an oversized , blunt bowie knife into your belt and walking around a sporting goods show .
Torque and hooliganism go together like Sunday mornings and winding roads .
All the vehicles here dish it up — except for maybe the last one , a shortcoming easily compensated for with total mechanical indifference ( think rental car ) and dutiful applications of gravity ( all cars accelerate at the same speed when pushed off a cliff ) .

2008 Chevrolet Corvette Z06
It ’s rare indeed that a car capable of truly exotic performance still welcomes a stiff paddling .
The resulting wails and shrieks from engine and tires are not like those of a chastened child but of a happily spanked BDSM participant .
It ’s amazing that this 505 - hp vehicle was conceived and produced in one of the most risk - averse and litigious countries on earth .
The Z06 delivers speed on the end of a long , sharp blade , whereas most others in the same performance index hand you a safety razor .
Want to drive really fast ?
Avail yourself of a couple inches of pedal travel .
Want to punish tires , your ribs , and your passenger ?
Ask in anger , and the Z06 will respond in kind , its talents delivered with a wicked grin .

2008 Dodge Charger SRT8
Few vehicles offer proof of complicity regarding the automotive / big - oil cabal quite as well as the burnout machine that is the Dodge Charger SRT8 .
The petroleum industry gets a twofer when you romp on the go pedal , burning gas and tires in voluminous quantities .
Hell , we ’re surprised the EPA does n’t require the rear tires to pass some kind of particulate - matter dispersion test , such is the inevitability of their going up in smoke .
Asking the SRT8 or , more precisely , the insta-maniac at the wheel , to behave is as futile a gesture as pleading with your dog not to go hunting for treats in the cat box .
The easily located button ridding your afternoon of traction control gives blessing to the smoky trinity of 425 horsepower , rear - wheel drive , and a total lack of mechanical empathy .

2008 Ford Mustang GT500KR
Few things can conjure the glory days of the muscle - car era like axle tromp , that terrible bouncing of spinning tires that is unfortunately a bit inevitable when you ’re channeling the torque of almost four Ford Focus engines through a solid rear axle .
The 540 horsepower and 510 pound - feet of torque are simply the most power a manufacturer has had the balls to send through a muscle - car - era rear suspension , knowing damn well what would happen : burnouts , worn suspension bushings , more burnouts , and happy customers with a gut full of Shelby Kool - Aid .
The temptation to fry tires might be tempered by the KR ’s price tag — $ 79,995 plus the cost of a Focus or two , depending on how unfriendly your friendly neighborhood Ford dealer is feeling .
2008 GMC TopKick
Few celluloid moments have made us as proud to be American — or as ready to join in the fight against apartheid — as when Mel Gibson strapped his GMC Sierra 3500 dualie pickup to an illegally funded mansion in Lethal Weapon 2 and tore it off the foundations .
Car and Driver had a similar moment , minus moral justification , when we used a GMC TopKick to raze a small and tired barn .
This probably could have been accomplished with a lawn tractor , but why go squirrel hunting with a BB gun when you can roll up with a howitzer ?
The GMC TopKick Ironhide edition , as seen in Transformers and available at any GMC dealer , is available with a chuffing 8.1 - liter V - 8 making 450 pound - feet of torque or a 6.6 - liter turbo - diesel making up to 620 pound - feet of quivering torque .
Either will be more than happy to turn you into the Shiva of construction , destroying buildings such that others can rise anew .

2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 / 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS
The Grand Cherokee SRT8 and the Trailblazer SS are like a pair of linebackers waiting to smack the back of your head with bountiful torque .
They both employ big , nasty American V - 8s to accelerate large , heavy , box - shaped forms from a stop with alacrity usually reserved for sleek , lithe - looking things .
No burnouts from the Jeep , thanks to four - wheel drive , but effortless stoplight victories in either require only judicious application of brake and throttle and perhaps the subsequent talents of a good traffic lawyer .

2008 Mercedes - Benz C63 AMG
The only thing more irresponsible than being a hooligan is being a hooligan with four terrified , carsick , or whooping passengers .
The C63 produces entirely improbable acceleration numbers , crushing proper sports cars such as the Audi R8 .
That 60 mph comes in just 3.9 seconds from a vehicle with two - wheel drive means the button marked ESP ( for Electronic Stability Program ) is essentially a lighter strapped to the fuse of an expensive , fuel - fed smoke bomb .
Just fore of the steering wheel , which features a flat bottom à la DTM race cars , are paddle shifters , the better to slash through each of seven forward gears and snap , crackle , and pop your way back down the cogs ; engine overrun here is a pleasurable - sounding thing and sure to worry fellow commuters .
We ca n’t forget the CLK63 AMG Black Series , essentially a two - door version of the sedan with 500 horsepower , evil bodywork , no back seat , and an exhaust roar Wagner would write into an opera .

2008 Nissan Frontier NISMO 2WD
Sometimes spinning tires puke smoke ; sometimes they sling mud , sand , and gravel .
The two - wheel - drive Nissan Frontier NISMO combines a bunch of stuff we like : a rock - solid chassis shared with the big - brother Titan , a 261 - hp V - 6 , and rear - wheel drive with an electronically controlled limited - slip differential .
We ’re surprised there is n’t an optional navigation system that directs you to mud pits and sand dunes , because that ’s exactly where we ’d go to get stupid .
The NISMO model boasts Bilstein off - road shocks and skid plates to ward off warranty claims by owners doing things that we ’re , um , not suggesting they do .
Just ask stadium and desert truck racers .
Rear - wheel drive and abundant power place one steering mechanism in your hands and the other below your right foot .
Enjoy .

2008 Mazdaspeed 3
Your chances are better of hitting the lottery than the Mazdaspeed 3 ’s EPA combined fuel - economy figure of 20 mpg .
This has nothing to do with governmental agency incompetence ( amazingly ) or any mechanical deficiency ; it ’s simply nigh impossible to keep your right foot much off the floor .
Mazda even equipped the 2.3 - liter , turbocharged engine with direct injection to aid in fuel economy and emissions , and alas , this also helped it make more midrange torque .
It ’s this grunt , made into a propensity for apex munching through superb suspension tuning and a limited - slip differential , that makes you want to drive less than responsibly , all the time .
Mazda gets a demerit only for limiting the amount of turbo boost , and thus power produced , in first and second gears in an effort — thankfully failed — to disallow owners the joy of shredding front tires , however less pleasurable it is than shredding rear tires .

2008 Subaru Impreza WRX STI
No car does dirt better than the Subaru WRX and STI .
They were born to do one thing : cover a stretch of dirt , tarmac , snow , or all three faster than any other vehicle .
A gaggle of World Rally Championships says they do it well , and few cars feature the results of motorsports experience — including advanced all - wheel - drive systems and big turbocharged power — as directly and at as pedestrian a price .
You can even slide a hot - dog cart in the dirt , but few vehicles feel so absolutely at home doing so as Subaru products .

Your First Car
This scribe ’s first car was a Chevrolet Beretta GT shared with his sister .
Any enthusiast will embrace whatever it is he or she has , often polishing a turd ; as such , I owned the best - detailed Beretta in the Northeast .
Then there was the third - hand , ragged - but - quick 1989 Taurus SHO , from which I learned that some cars require you to own both metric and standard tool sets ; that the Japanese , in this case Yamaha , do it better ; and that few things are as fun as watching your passengers ’ faces when you “ forget ” to apply the brakes when pulling into parking spots fronted by concrete walls .
First - car ownership usually coincides with high school , where physics class formulas can help you calculate the speed required to jump the ditch in your neighbor ’s field and auto shop is available to help you weld in new shock towers while you curse Bo Duke , who made it look so easy .

The Surface computer , which debuted for commercial use in July , has a 30 - inch screen on which users can tap , drag , spin and zoom in and out with their fingers or an object such as a paintbrush .
The computer mouse may someday become an endangered species .
Instead of rolling a mouse around to move a cursor around on the screen , more and more users will gesture with their fingers on touch screens and multi - touch track pads , analysts say .
Or they will tilt or shake the phones or other hand - held devices themselves to manipulate them , said Steve Prentice , vice president and fellow at Gartner , a market - research firm based in Stamford , Conn .
Apple 's iPhone , Nokia and other smart phones are already undergoing such a transformation with touch screens , he said in an e-mail , and the switch " will accelerate over the next two to three years . "
On an iPhone or iPod touch , a user can scroll through album covers by flicking a finger across the screen , or tilt and turn the device to control actions in a game .
Prentice , based in Egham , England , said it is likely users will stop connecting a mouse to their laptop computers within the next five years , if they have n't already .
And the use of a mouse will diminish on office desktop computers after that .
The new track pads are seen as offering more versatility .
" The demise will be hastened by the move toward 3D environments , which encourage a more complex range of movements to move around , and by the growth of multimedia applications and manipulation , which encourage a more natural user interface , " he said .
Already , Hewlett - Packard makes a TouchSmart personal computer with a touch - screen monitor .
Apple 's new laptop computers have track pads that support gestures with two , three or four fingers .
And the upcoming Microsoft Windows 7 will also support multi-touch .
Not so fast , says Logitech International , the Swiss maker of mice and other peripherals .
Touch screens will continue to develop , but , " I do n't see a world where it would override the effectiveness of the mouse and keyboard , " said Erik Charlton , director of product marketing for Logitech retail pointing devices .
The history of the mouse dates to 1968 , originating at what was then known as Stanford Research Institute .

RNC chair : Palin coverage ‘ sexist ’
Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan called the media “ sexist ” Monday for focusing on the $ 150,000 in committee funds used to clothe GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin .
“ I find it sexist that you would talk about this , ” Duncan said during an interview on MSNBC .
“ Do you talk about how much a tie costs that a male candidate wears in the campaign ?
No .
I find a double standard in this country and it ’s very disappointing . ”

Duncan would not answer whether he signed off on the spending , saying “ this was a campaign expense that came from the coordinated expense of the campaign .
It has nothing to do with the big issues of the day . ”
Palin has tried to distance herself from the story , blaming the RNC for buying the expensive clothes .
“ Just like the lighting and the staging and everything else that the RNC purchased , I 'm not taking them with me , ” Palin said during a campaign stop in Tampa , Florida .
“ Those clothes , they are not my property . ”
Duncan did not confirm Palin ’s account , saying only , “ I 'm not going to get into an argument with Sarah Palin or anyone else about this .
“ We are working with the campaign .
This was a coordinated expense that the campaign asked us to pay for , and we paid for that expense .
It ’s entirely legal , ” Duncan said .
Appearing later on the same cable network , Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said his committee has not spent any money on ties or any other clothing for its candidates .
“ We have not .
We do n't do that , and we have not , ” he said .

A controversial new policy to ban smokers from fostering children has been passed by a council .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ban , which was passed unanimously at a cabinet meeting of Redbridge Council last night , means that children in the east London borough will not be placed with foster carers who smoke after January 2010 .
Councillors say the move is crucial in protecting children from the harmful effects of passive smoking , but concerns have been raised that the ban could reduce the number of loving foster homes available to vulnerable children .
Speaking after the meeting , the cabinet member for children , Tory councillor Michael Stark , said : " We know this is a difficult issue because some people will feel it is an intrusion on personal freedoms , but we also know that smoking increases the risk of serious illness in childhood .
" The bottom line is that we must put the welfare of young children in our care first . "
The Fostering Network has expressed concerns that the policy could prevent good foster carers from coming forward .
A spokesman for the national charity said : " We certainly view this as a good move in terms of creating a smoke - free environment for a child , but we do n't agree that a blanket ban on any smokers becoming foster carers is the right thing .
" If a person has the right qualities and skills to be a foster carer , they should n't be put off coming forward just because they have the odd cigarette at the end of the garden or on a night out .
Fostering is about much more than just smoking . "
The council said the new policy is a result of scientific evidence which showed that second - hand smoke is a cause of lung cancer and childhood respiratory disease .
It said young children are particularly susceptible to the effects of second - hand smoke because their lungs and airways are small and their immune systems immature .
The risk of cot death , asthma , middle ear disease , pneumonia and bronchitis is higher if children live in a home where people smoke .

All new applicants will be told at an early stage that they will not be able to foster if they smoke , unless there are " exceptional circumstances " .
Existing foster carers who smoke will be helped to give up .
Smokers ' rights group Forest reacted angrily to the policy .
A spokesman said : " This is another attempt to stigmatise smokers and separate them from the rest of society .
" This discriminates against plenty of people who would have made excellent foster carers , and so it is damaging not only for them but also for the children that they would have fostered .
The really insidious implication is that smokers in general are not fit to be parents , and that is totally unacceptable . "
The plans met with mixed reactions from foster carers before last night 's vote .
During a consultation in June , one current carer said : " The policy is unfair as it is telling carers how to live their lives . "
Another asked whether the council plans to employ only non-smoking social workers in future .
But the majority of fostered children consulted were in favour of the policy .
During a consultation in September , 11 out of 17 children said they would discourage their family and friends from smoking , while only one said they would not and five said they did not have an opinion either way .
Southend - on - Sea Council , which does not allow smokers to foster children under the age of five , is planning to review its policy after Redbridge Council 's decision .
Children 's councillor Roger Hadley said : " In light of new evidence , it is time to reconsider the impact that living in a smoky environment has on young people .
" Children have a right to live in a clean , healthy environment .
In the light of Redbridge 's decision , I will be raising this for discussion at our next council meeting . "
The policy does not extend to private foster carers in Redbridge .
There was no indication that Jing Hua
Wu posed any danger when he walked into the offices of his Santa Clara employer Friday , a few hours after he ’d been fired .
So there was no reason for three top company officials to refuse his request for a meeting .
But some time after
Wu and the three executives went into a room to talk , police say , the 47 - year - old engineer pulled a 9 mm handgun and shot all three dead .
Nineteen hours later , a Bay Area manhunt ended when police cars swooped into the parking lot of a shopping center at El Camino Real and Grant Road in Mountain View .
Wu was unarmed and made no attempt to struggle , police said , when officers piled out of the cars at 10:45 a.m. Saturday and handcuffed him in front of the Home Consignment Center store .
The shootings caused “ genuine fear in the community , ” said Santa Clara police Chief Stephen Lodge at a news conference Saturday afternoon , adding that it was a relief “ to be able to take him into custody . ”
Authorities said
Wu would be booked on suspicion of three counts of homicide for the Friday afternoon slayings at SiPort , a small semiconductor company at 3255 Scott Blvd .
Police identified the victims as Marilyn Lewis , 67 , of San Jose , who was the company ’s head of human resources ; Brian Pugh , 47 , of Los Altos , who was vice president for operations , and Sid Agrawal , 56 , of Fremont , who was the company ’s co-founder and chief executive .
“ These were truly three innocent victims , just doing their jobs , ” Lodge said .
“ That ’s what makes it such a tragic event . ”
Wu , a test engineer who worked at SiPort less than two years , was “ let go ” Friday morning because of his performance , a company spokeswoman said .
Early police reports indicated he was laid off , but the spokeswoman said that was not the case .
Later in the day , sometime after 3 p.m. Friday ,
Wu returned to the business and asked to speak with the three executives , according to Lodge .
Citing statements from other employees who were in the offices at the time , police said Wu was dressed casually and gave the executives no reason to be concerned .
“ He must not have been acting too strangely for them to agree to the meeting , ” Lodge said .
Only
Wu knows what was said during the meeting , the chief added , because only he and the victims were in the room .
But other employees heard the shots and saw Wu leave the offices and drive away in a silver sport-utility vehicle .
They called police at 3:53 p.m.
Officers arrived within minutes and found several workers cowering in fear .
The three executives were dead .
Wu had no history of violence or mental illness , as far as police know , Lodge said .
All - night search
Police worked through the night to find Wu , who apparently never returned to his home in Mountain View .
Lodge would not say what led officers to the spot where Wu was captured Saturday morning or what Wu had been doing there .
Officers found the silver SUV near the spot where
Wu was arrested , but they were still searching for the gun Saturday night .
Shocked neighbors said
Wu was a friendly man who has lived for the past 11 years on Emerson Lane , a quiet Mountain View cul - de-sac , with his wife and three sons — a 2 - year - old and two 6 - year - old twins .
“ He ’s been a very good - natured , calm , even - tempered guy , ” said Jim Pollart , who lives a few houses down from Wu . “ I ca n’t imagine what could have caused him to do this . ”
Pollart said his family socialized a lot with Wu ’s family at the community pool and clubhouse .
On Sundays , Wu and his wife , Pollart said , often rode the light - rail train to the farmers market in downtown Mountain View .
“ They ’re nice folks .
Nice people , ” Pollart added .
“ I think we ’ll never make sense of it . ”
Meanwhile , friends of the three slain executives were reeling with grief .
“ They were all just really solid , nice people , ” said SiPort board member Drew Lanza .
“ This whole thing is really sad . ”
Lewis , who lived in San Jose , worked at NeoScale Systems before joining SiPort in November 2006 .
No one answered the phone at her home Saturday .
In an online profile , she wrote : “ As is customary in a startup industry , I wear multiple hats “… facilities , HR , recruiting , payroll , etc . ”
Pugh , who was married and had two children , grew up in San Jose and later moved to San Diego , before returning to the Bay Area to work at SiPort about a year ago .
“ He ’s a very detail - oriented , numbers person .
He was a very loving family man , ” said Robert Boles , an architect who was working on a remodeling project at Pugh ’s home .
A woman who answered the door at Pugh ’s home Saturday said she was too upset to talk .
Immigrant from India
At Agrawal ’s two - story English Tudor home in Fremont , a steady stream of visitors came to pay their condolences Saturday to the sons and the widow , who was too distraught to speak to reporters .
Outside the house , a huge pile of shoes lined the exterior entryway .
Friends said Agrawal came to the United States from India with big dreams in the 1970s — and by most accounts he succeeded .
“ We all had dreams of higher studies and coming to America , ” said Sanjay Mittal , who had known Agrawal since his days in college at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur .
Ambitious with an entrepreneurial spirit , Agrawal worked at Adobe Systems , Intel and Bell Labs , and he started a handful of companies on his own — some more successful than others , in fields from networking to data storage and semiconductors .
His latest venture appeared to be doing well , friends say .
Specializing in chips for hybrid digital radio , the company was attracting the interests of venture capitalists — and Agrawal seemed excited about its prospects .
“ He was pretty happy .
I remember him telling me the products were starting to work , ” said Mittal , who also owns a software company and was planning a trip to Brazil with Agrawal and his wife .
“ He worked very hard .
We have to .
You work late hours and travel a lot , whatever it takes to succeed . ”
Beyond his business interests , Agrawal had sophisticated tastes .
He collected a variety of art , once even traveled to Cuba for a particular piece , and enjoyed good wine .
“ I remember I had to carry a piece of art for him from India , ” said Arya Bhattacherjee , who has known the Agrawals for more than two decades .
But Agrawal ’s biggest source of pride was his family — his wife , Asha , and two sons , Ankur and Ashish .
Friends said Ankur is a freshman at Harvard University , while Ashish graduated from Harvard and is studying medicine at the University of California - San Francisco .
“ He was a very honest , very gentle , a very straightforward individual , a real family man , ” said Steve Fields , a contractor who worked with Agrawal and exchanged e-mail with him Friday afternoon .
Fields wrote to tell Agrawal that he could n’t finish a particular job because a family matter had come up .
At 2:23 p.m. , Agrawal e-mailed back : “ It ’s OK , family comes first . ”

Do n't have an anti-shake camera stabilizer in your camera ?
Have a chicken handy ?
Great !
Just strap your cam to its head and watch as nature 's image stabilization service does all the work .
According to the video , motion processors use an inertial measurement unit , which senses motion ( rate , type and direction ) and compensates for it .
Chickens have a pretty advanced version .
There you go : easy image stabilization .

MOSCOW , Nov. 25 ( UPI ) -- Russian gas monopoly Gazprom filed a lawsuit at an international court in Stockholm to force Ukraine to settle a $ 2.4 billion gas debt , officials said .
The Ukrainian government had complained Moscow was seeking to collect for gas still held , and unused , in underground storage facilities .
Moscow claims it is waiting for Kiev to pay its debt for gas consumptions from September .

Alexander Medvedev , the deputy chief of Gazprom , said his firm had filed suit at an international court in Stockholm to force Ukraine to settle its outstanding debt , the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant said Tuesday .
The decision to use legal pressure comes from a decision by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to consider court measures rather than supply cuts to force Kiev 's hand in the matter .

Twenty Things You Should Know About Corporate Crime
21 Corporate Crime Reporter 25 , June 12 , 2007
Twenty years ago , Corporate Crime Reporter , a weekly print newsletter , was launched .
From the beginning , the most popular feature of Corporate Crime Reporter has been a question / answer format interview .
Over the years , we ’ve interviewed hundreds of prosecutors , defense attorneys , law school professors , reporters , and activists .
Our first interview , which appeared in Volume One , Number One on April 13 , 1987 was with the premier corporate crime prosecutor of his day .
That was Rudolph Giuliani , then U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York .
At the time , he was prosecuting the likes of Michael Milken , Ivan Boesky and Marc Rich .
President Clinton later pardoned Marc Rich .
Apparently Marc
Rich ’s wife was dumping big cash into the Clinton library .
Rudy is now solidly in the hands of the corporate crime lobby .
He prosecuted corporate crime as a way to achieve higher office .
Then he learned one of the key lessons of corporate crime prosecution .
You can achieve higher office by prosecuting corporate crime .
But as you move up the ladder , you have to make nice with the corporate powers that be .
And so you turn your attention and rhetoric to various forms of street crime .
Now , Rudy is ready to be President .
So , corporate crime lesson number one – prosecute corporate crime to achieve higher office , then prosecute street crime to protect your political position .
Or to simplify it , corporate crime is all about power politics .
And the corporate crime game is a bi-partisan affair – it is played the same by Democrats and Republicans alike .
Eliot Spitzer , the former Attorney General of New York , prosecuted corporate crime to achieve higher office .
And now as Governor of New York , Spitzer is making nice with Wall Street .
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Corporate Crime Reporter , I present to you the Top 20 Things You Should Know About Corporate Crime .
With a tip of the hat to David Letterman , let us proceed .
Number 20
Corporate crime inflicts far more damage on society than all street crime combined .
Whether in bodies or injuries or dollars lost , corporate crime and violence wins by a landslide .
The FBI estimates , for example , that burglary and robbery – street crimes – costs the nation $ 3.8 billion a year .
The losses from a handful of major corporate frauds – Tyco , Adelphia , Worldcom , Enron – swamp the losses from all street robberies and burglaries combined .
Health care fraud alone costs Americans $ 100 billion to $ 400 billion a year .
The savings and loan fraud – which former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called " the biggest white collar swindle in history " – cost us anywhere from $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion .
And then you have your lesser frauds : auto repair fraud , $ 40 billion a year , securities fraud , $ 15 billion a year – and on down the list .
Number 19
Corporate crime is often violent crime .
Recite this list of corporate frauds and people will immediately say to you : but you can't compare street crime and corporate crime – corporate crime is not violent crime .
Not true .
Corporate crime is often violent crime .
The FBI estimates that , 16,000 Americans are murdered every year .
Compare this to the 56,000 Americans who die every year on the job or from occupational diseases such as black lung and asbestosis and the tens of thousands of other Americans who fall victim to the silent violence of pollution , contaminated foods , hazardous consumer products , and hospital malpractice .
These deaths are often the result of criminal recklessness .
Yet , they are rarely prosecuted as homicides or as criminal violations of federal laws .
Number 18
Corporate criminals are the only criminal class in the United States that have the power to define the laws under which they live .
The mafia , no .
The gangstas , no .
The street thugs , no .
But the corporate criminal lobby , yes .
They have marinated Washington – from the White House to the Congress to K Street – with their largesse .
And out the other end come the laws they can live with .
They still violate their own rules with impunity .
But they make sure the laws are kept within reasonable bounds .
Exhibit A – the automobile industry .
Over the past 30 years , the industry has worked its will on Congress to block legislation that would impose criminal sanctions on knowing and willful violations of the federal auto safety laws .
Today , with very narrow exceptions , if an auto company is caught violating the law , only a civil fine is imposed .
Number 17
Corporate crime is underprosecuted by a factor of say – 100 .
And the flip side of that – corporate crime prosecutors are underfunded by a factor of say – 100 .
Big companies that are criminally prosecuted represent only the tip of a very large iceberg of corporate wrongdoing .
For every company convicted of health care fraud , there are hundreds of others who get away with ripping off Medicare and Medicaid , or face only mild slap - on - the - wrist fines and civil penalties when caught .
For every company convicted of polluting the nation 's waterways , there are many others who are not prosecuted because their corporate defense lawyers are able to offer up a low - level employee to go to jail in exchange for a promise from prosecutors not to touch the company or high - level executives .
For every corporation convicted of bribery or of giving money directly to a public official in violation of federal law , there are thousands who give money legally through political action committees to candidates and political parties .
They profit from a system that effectively has legalized bribery .
For every corporation convicted of selling illegal pesticides , there are hundreds more who are not prosecuted because their lobbyists have worked their way in Washington to ensure that dangerous pesticides remain legal .
For every corporation convicted of reckless homicide in the death of a worker , there are hundreds of others that do n't even get investigated for reckless homicide when a worker is killed on the job .
Only a few district attorneys across the country have historically investigated workplace deaths as homicides .
Corporate crime prosecutors are underfunded by a factor of say – 100 .
White collar crime defense attorneys regularly admit that if more prosecutors had more resources , the number of corporate crime prosecutions would increase dramatically .
A large number of serious corporate and white collar crime cases are now left on the table for lack of resources .
Number 16
Beware of consumer groups or other public interest groups who make nice with corporations .
There are now probably more fake public interest groups than actual ones in America today .
And many formerly legitimate public interest groups have been taken over or compromised by big corporations .
Our favorite example is the National Consumer League .
It ’s the oldest consumer group in the country .
It was created to eradicate child labor .
But in the last ten years or so , it has been taken over by large corporations .
It now gets the majority of its budget from big corporations such as Pfizer , Bank of America , Pharmacia & Upjohn , Kaiser Permanente , Wyeth - Ayerst , and Verizon .
Number 15
It used to be when a corporation committed a crime , they pled guilty to a crime .
So , for example , so many large corporations were pleading guilty to crimes in the 1990s , that in 2000 , we put out a report titled The Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the 1990s .
We went back through all of the Corporate Crime Reporters for that decade , pulled out all of the big corporations that had been convicted , ranked the corporate criminals by the amount of their criminal fines , and cut it off at 100 .
So , you have your Fortune 500 , your Forbes 400 , and your Corporate Crime Reporter 100 .
Number 14
Now , corporate criminals do n’t have to worry about pleading guilty to crimes .
Three new loopholes have developed over the past five years – the deferred prosecution agreement , the non prosecution agreement , and pleading guilty a closet entity or a defunct entity that has nothing to lose .
Number 13
Corporations love deferred prosecution agreements .
In the 1990s , if prosecutors had evidence of a crime , they would bring a criminal charge against the corporation and sometimes against the individual executives .
And the company would end up pleading guilty .
Then , about three years ago , the Justice Department said – hey , there is this thing called a deferred prosecution agreement .
We can bring a criminal charge against the company .
And we will tell the company – if you are a good company and do not violate the law for the next two years , we will drop the charges .
No harm , no foul .
This is called a deferred prosecution agreement .
And most major corporate crime prosecutions are brought this way now .
The company pays a fine .
The company is charged with a crime .
But there is no conviction .
And after two or three years , depending on the term of the agreement , the charges are dropped .
Number 12
Corporations love non prosecution agreements even more .
One Friday evening last July , I was sitting my office in the National Press Building .
And into my e-mail box came a press release from the Justice Department .
The press release announced that Boeing will pay a $ 50 million criminal penalty and $ 615 million in civil penalties to resolve federal claims relating to the company 's hiring of the former Air Force acquisitions chief Darleen A. Druyun , by its then CFO , Michael Sears – and stealing sensitive procurement information .
So , the company pays a criminal penalty .
And I figure , okay if they paid a criminal penalty , they must have pled guilty .
No , they did not plead guilty .
Okay , they must have been charged with a crime and had the prosecution deferred .
No , they were not charged with a crime and did not have the prosecution deferred .
About a week later , after pounding the Justice Department for an answer as to what happened to Boeing , they sent over something called a non prosecution agreement .
That is where the Justice Department says – we ’re going to fine you criminally , but hey , we do n’t want to cost you any government business , so sign this agreement .
It says we wo n’t prosecute you if you pay the fine and change your ways .
Corporate criminals love non prosecution agreements .
No criminal charge .
No criminal record .
No guilty plea .
Just pay the fine and leave .
Number 11
In health fraud cases , find an empty closet or defunct entity to plead guilty .
The government has a mandatory exclusion rule for health care corporations that are convicted of ripping off Medicare .
Such an exclusion is the equivalent of the death penalty .
If a major drug company ca n’t do business with Medicare , it loses a big chunk of its business .
There have been many criminal prosecutions of major health care corporations for ripping off Medicare .
And many of these companies have pled guilty .
But not one major health care company has been excluded from Medicare .
Why not ?
Because when you read in the newspaper that a major health care company pled guilty , it ’s not the parent company that pleads guilty .
The prosecutor will allow a unit of the corporation that has no assets – or even a defunct entity – to plead guilty .
And therefore that unit will be excluded from Medicare – which does n’t bother the parent corporation , because the unit had no business with Medicare to begin with .
Earlier , Dr. Sidney Wolfe was here and talked about the criminal prosecution of Purdue Pharma , the Stamford , Connecticut - based maker of OxyContin .
Dr. Wolfe said that the company pled guilty to pushing OxyContin by making claims that it is less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications and that it continued to do so despite warnings to the contrary from doctors , the media , and members of its own sales force .
Well , Purdue Pharma – the company that makes and markets the drug – did n’t plead guilty .
A different company – Purdue Frederick pled guilty .
Purdue Pharma actually got a non-prosecution agreement .
Purdue Frederick had nothing to lose , so it pled guilty .
Number 10
Corporate criminals do n’t like to be put on probation .
Very rarely , a corporation convicted of a crime will be placed on probation .
Many years ago , Consolidated Edison in New York was convicted of an environmental crime .
A probation official was assigned .
Employees would call him with wrongdoing .
He would write reports for the judge .
The company changed its ways .
There was actual change within the corporation .
Corporations hate this .
They hate being under the supervision of some public official , like a judge .
We need more corporate probation .
Number 9
Corporate criminals do n’t like to be charged with homicide .
Street murders occur every day in America .
And they are prosecuted every day in America .
Corporate homicides occur every day in America .
But they are rarely prosecuted .
The last homicide prosecution brought against a major American corporation was in 1980 , when a Republican Indiana prosecutor charged Ford Motor Co. with homicide for the deaths of three teenaged girls who died when their Ford Pinto caught on fire after being rear - ended in northern Indiana .
The prosecutor alleged that Ford knew that it was marketing a defective product , with a gas tank that crushed when rear ended , spilling fuel .
In the Indiana case , the girls were incinerated to death .
But Ford brought in a hot shot criminal defense lawyer who in turn hired the best friend of the judge as local counsel , and who , as a result , secured a not guilty verdict after persuading the judge to keep key evidence out of the jury room .
It ’s time to crank up the corporate homicide prosecutions .
Number 8
There are very few career prosecutors of corporate crime .
Patrick Fitzgerald is one that comes to mind .
He ’s the U.S. Attorney in Chicago .
He put away Scooter Libby .
And he ’s now prosecuting the Canadian media baron Conrad Black .
Number 7
Most corporate crime prosecutors see their jobs as a stepping stone to greater things .
Spitzer and Giuliani prosecuted corporate crime as a way to move up the political ladder .
But most young prosecutors prosecute corporate crime to move into the lucrative corporate crime defense bar .
Number 6
Most corporate criminals turn themselves into the authorities .
The vast majority of corporate criminal prosecutions are now driven by the corporations themselves .
If they find something wrong , they know they can trust the prosecutor to do the right thing .
They will be forced to pay a fine , maybe agree to make some internal changes .
But in this day and age , in all likelihood , they will not be forced to plead guilty .
So , better to be up front with the prosecutor and put the matter behind them .
To save the hide of the corporation , they will cooperate with federal prosecutors against individual executives within the company .
Individuals will be charged , the corporation will not .
Number 5
The market does n’t take most modern corporate criminal prosecutions seriously .
Almost universally , when a corporate crime case is settled , the stock of the company involved goes up .
Why ?
Because a cloud has been cleared and there is no serious consequence to the company .
No structural changes in how the company does business .
No monitor .
No probation .
Preserving corporate reputation is the name of the game .
Number 4
The Justice Department needs to start publishing an annual Corporate Crime in the United States report .
Every year , the Justice Department puts out an annual report titled " Crime in the United States . "
But by " Crime in the United States , " the Justice Department means " street crime in the United States . "
In the " Crime in the United States " annual report , you can read about burglary , robbery and theft .
There is little or nothing about price - fixing , corporate fraud , pollution , or public corruption .
A yearly Justice Department report on Corporate Crime in the United States is long overdue .
Number 3
We must start asking – which side are you on – with the corporate criminals or against ?
Most professionals in Washington work for , are paid by , or are under the control of the corporate crime lobby .
Young lawyers come to town , fresh out of law school , 25 years old , and their starting salary is $ 160,000 a year .
And they ’re working for the corporate criminals .
Young lawyers graduating from the top law schools have all kinds of excuses for working for the corporate criminals – huge debt , just going to stay a couple of years for the experience .
But the reality is , they are working for the corporate criminals .
What kind of respect should we give them ?
Especially since they have many options other than working for the corporate criminals .
Time to dust off that age - old question – which side are you on ?
( For young lawyers out there considering other options , check out Alan Morrison ’s new book – Beyond the Big Firm : Profiles of Lawyers Who Want Something More . )
Number 2
We need a 911 number for the American people to dial to report corporate crime and violence .
If you want to report street crime and violence , call 911 .
But what number do you call if you want to report corporate crime and violence ?
We propose 611 .
Call 611 to report corporate crime and violence .
We need a national number where people can pick up the phone and report the corporate criminals in our midst .
What triggered this thought ?
We attended the press conference at the Justice Department the other day announcing the indictment of Congressman William Jefferson ( D - Louisiana ) .
Jefferson was the first U.S. official charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act .
Federal officials alleged that Jefferson was both on the giving and receiving ends of bribe payments .
On the receiving end , he took $ 100,000 in cash – $ 90,000 of it was stuffed into his freezer in Washington , D.C .
The $ 90,000 was separated in $ 10,000 increments , wrapped in aluminum foil , and concealed inside various frozen food containers .
At the press conference announcing the indictment , after various federal officials made their case before the cameras , up to the mike came Joe Persichini , assistant director of the Washington field office of the FBI .
“ To the American people , I ask you , take time , ” Persichini said .
“ Read this charging document line by line , scheme by scheme , count by count .
This case is about greed , power and arrogance . ”
“ Everyone is entitled to honest and ethical public service , ” Persichini continued .
“ We as leaders standing here today can not do it alone .
We need the public 's help .
The amount of corruption is dependent on what the public with allow .
Again , the amount of corruption is dependent on what the public will allow . ”
“ If you have knowledge of , if you 've been confronted with or you are participating , I ask that you contact your local FBI office or you call the Washington Field Office of the FBI at 202.278.2000 .
Thank you very much . ”
Shorten the number – make it 611 .
Number one .
And the number one thing you should know about corporate crime ?
Everyone is deserving of justice .
So , question , debate , strategize , yes .
But if God - forbid you too are victimized by a corporate criminal , you too will demand justice .
We need a more beefed up , more effective justice system to deal with the corporate criminals in our midst .
Thank you .

A Florida ranch was raided yesterday after repeated complaints from residential neighbors about a horrible smell lingering around the property .
Officials discovered a shed with floor drains and butcher knives , a freezer full of various types of animal flesh and a horse ’s head , and over 400 live animals living in poor conditions .
Ramiro Perez , who owned and maintained the operation , insists that he has done nothing wrong .[ social_buttons ]
Perez kept horses , cows , sheep , goats , pigs , chickens , and even caged hawks on his 10 - acre property and has been accused of feeding the animals garbage before selling the meat to the public .
The cattle , sheep , and goats also had access to ruminant - derived food , which increases the risk of mad cow disease .
The animals were fed onsite then taken by various Florida and Georgia rescue groups , but the 35 cows on the property have yet to find homes .
Despite the poor conditions on the farm , the animals have so far been found to be in decent health .
The local SPCA and other animal welfare groups have assisted in caring for the animals .
Perez has been charged with violating the county ’s ” sanitary nuisance ” law and could be fined for operating a business without a license , keeping an illegal structure , and feeding garbage to animals used for human consumption .
Investigators also suspect that pig feces has contaminated the ground water on the property , but further tests are needed to confirm .

The pride of the nation is secured .
Last night , two Britons joined a long and prestigious list of Ig Nobel prizewinners at the annual awards ceremony at Harvard University .
The Ig Nobel for literature was awarded for research into the different breeds of unpleasant character one might encounter in the workplace , while the Ig award for nutrition went to scientists at Oxford University who proved stale crisps taste better when eaten to an accompaniment of crunchy sounds .
The Igs have become an irreverent highlight of the academic calendar , an annual exercise to celebrate research that makes people laugh first and think later .
They are timed to coincide with the rather more lucrative and legitimate Nobels , which are awarded in Stockholm next week .
The ceremony is hosted by the tongue - in - cheek journal , Annals of Improbable Research , and is attended by real Nobel prizewinners and a 1,000 - strong audience .
This year 's recipients were given 60 seconds to deliver their acceptance speech , a time limit enforced by an eight - year - old girl .
David Sims of the Cass Business School in London , whose paper You Bastard : A Narrative Exploration of the Experience of Indignation within Organisations , won the literature prize , said : " I 'm delighted .
The whole ethos of the Ig Nobels is a wonderful way to make people think . "
The paper examines how people construct roles as clever bastards , devious bastards or bastard ex machina , and goes on to examine the mixture of joy and guilt of labelling someone as such .
Sims wrote the paper after puzzling how right - thinking people who often stressed the importance of appreciating others ' arguments would give up and brand someone a bastard .
" We are all novelists writing the next chapter of our life story and with bastards , we need to understand what kind of character they are trying to create , " Sims said .
Charles Spence , professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University , was awarded the Ig for nutrition for his investigation into the gastronomical role of sound .
In the study , volunteers ate crisps of varying freshness while wearing headphones .
As they ate , the sound of the crisp breaking was modified by a computer and played back to see if it changed their perception of the crisp 's freshness .
By making the crunch sounds louder , or by boosting the high frequencies , Spence made people rate the crisps 15 % fresher .
The work led to a collaboration with Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray , Berkshire , who played diners the sound of crashing waves to improve the flavour of oysters , and sizzling bacon to enhance his egg and bacon ice cream .
" I 'm very happy to be receiving the award , " said Spence , who is now testing why crisps come in such noisy packets .
The Ig Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to Dan Ariely at Duke University in North Carolina for a landmark study proving that costly placebos are more effective than cheap ones .
Ariely 's team told volunteers they were being given a new kind of painkiller , with some receiving an expensive one and others a much cheaper version .
Even though all of them received the same sugar pills , those who thought their pills were more expensive reported less pain when they were given small electric shocks .
" This is the proudest day of my life , " said Ariely .
" The Ig Nobels are humorous , but the work often examines things in real life , like why buttered toast is more likely to land face down . "
Ariely said his work has serious implications for the medical industry , because many patients are told they can only have cheaper drugs , or have inexpensive - looking medication , which could undermine how effective the drugs are .
While the active ingredients of the drug will help treat symptoms , often they work in tandem with the placebo effect , which triggers the body 's own healing mechanisms .
Among other winners were the people of Switzerland who claimed the Ig peace prize for adopting the legal principle that plants have dignity ; Geoffrey Miller at the University of New Mexico who won the economics prize for showing lap dancers received more in tips when they were ovulating ; and scientists in San Diego who showed that hair , string and almost anything else will become tangled given the chance , earning them the Ig award for physics .
Not all of the winners understood why their work had made people laugh .
Marie - Christine Cadiergues , who won the prize for biology by proving the fleas on dogs jump higher than those on cats , said : " Despite appearing funny and maybe crazy and useless to some people , this was part of a larger work on the biology of fleas ...
A better knowledge of flea biology can provide a better control and therefore help vets , pet owners and overall our favourite pets . "
Toshiyuki Nakagaki at Hokkaido University in Japan was similarly nonplussed about receiving the Ig award for cognitive neuroscience , after showing that slime mould could navigate a simple maze .
" I was wondering which aspect of our research attracted the Ig Nobel prize .
How does the prize evaluate our research ?
We are always serious and do n't know why they laugh once before thinking , " Nakagaki said .
The real Nobel prizes are awarded next week , beginning with medicine on Monday .
And the winners are ...
Physics
Won by Dorian Raymer at Scripps Institute of Oceanography , California , for discovering why ropes , hair and cables get more knotted the longer they are .
Chemistry
Jointly awarded to Sharee Umpierre at the University of Puerto Rico for discovering Coke is a spermicide , and to Chuang - Ye Hong at Taipei Medical University for showing that it is not .
Biology
Marie - Christine Cadiergues at the National Veterinary School in Toulouse for discovering that fleas jump higher on dogs than on cats .
Medicine
Dan Ariely at Duke University for demonstrating that expensive placebos are better painkillers than cheaper ones .
Economics
Geoffrey Miller at the University of New Mexico for discovering that lap dancers get larger tips when they are ovulating .
Archaeology

More than a century ago , the development of the earliest motion picture technology made what had been previously thought " magical " a reality : capturing and recreating the movement and dynamism of the world around us .
A breakthrough technology based on new concepts has now accomplished a similar feat , but on an atomic scale -- by allowing , for the first time , the real - time , real - space visualization of fleeting changes in the structure and shape of matter barely a billionth of a meter in size .
Such " movies " of atomic changes in materials of gold and graphite , obtained using the technique , are featured in a paper appearing in the November 21 issue of the journal Science .
A patent on the conceptual framework of this approach was granted to the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) in 2006 .
The new technique , dubbed four - dimensional ( 4D ) electron microscopy , was developed in the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology , directed by Ahmed Zewail , the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemistry and professor of physics at Caltech , and winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
Zewail was awarded the Nobel Prize for pioneering the science of femtochemistry , the use of ultrashort laser flashes to observe fundamental chemical reactions -- atoms uniting into molecules , then breaking apart back into atoms -- occurring at the timescale of the femtosecond , or one millionth of a billionth of a second .
The work " captured atoms and molecules in motion , " Zewail says , akin to the freeze - frame stills snapped by 19th - century photographer Eadweard Muybridge of a galloping horse ( which proved for the first time that a horse does indeed lift all four hooves off the ground as it gallops ) and other moving objects .
Snapshots of molecules in motion " gave us the time dimension , " Zewail says , " but what we did n't have was the dimensions of space , the structure .
We did n't know what the horse looked like .
Did it have a long tail ?
Beautiful eyes ?
My dream since 1999 was to come up with a way to look not just at time but also at the spatial domain ; to see the architecture of a complex system at the atomic scale , as it changes over time , be it for physical or biological matter . "
Scientists can observe the static structure of objects with a resolution that is better than a billionth of a meter in length using electron microscopes , which generate a stream of individual electrons that scatter off objects to produce an image .
Electrons are used to visualize the smallest of objects , on the atomic scale , because the wavelength of the radiation source used by a microscope must be shorter than the space between the atoms .
This can be accomplished using electrons , and in particular - - because the wavelength of an electron shrinks as its velocity increases -- by electrons that have been accelerated to dizzying speeds .

But just having electrons is n't sufficient to capture the behavior of atoms in both space and time ; the electrons have to be carefully doled out , so that they arrive at the sample at specific time intervals .
Zewail and his colleagues have achieved this by introducing the fourth dimension of time into high - resolution electron microscopy , in what has been termed ultrafast " single - electron " imaging , where every electron trajectory is precisely controlled in time and space .
The resulting image produced by each electron represents a femtosecond still at that moment in time .
Like the frames in a film , the sequential images generated by many millions of such images can be assembled into a digital movie of motion at the atomic scale .
As reported in the Science paper , Zewail and colleagues applied their new 4D electron microscopy to observe the behavior of the atoms in superthin sheets of gold and graphite .
Graphite , the material in pencils , consists of layers of carbon atoms locked into a sheet - like array .
The atoms move in a unique and coherent way on the femtosecond timescale .
However , the researchers found that on a slightly longer , picosecond ( one thousandth of a billionth of a second ) scale , the graphite nanosheets produce sound waves .
In the images , they directly visualized the elastic movements of the sheets and determined the force holding them together , which is described by a stress - strain property known as " Young 's modulus . "
The 4D movies produced from the frames revealed the behavior in space and time .
In a second paper in the current issue of the journal Nano Letters , Zewail and his colleagues described their visualization of the changes in a nanometer - thick graphite membrane on a longer time scale , up to a thousandth of a second .
The researchers first blasted the sample with a pulse of heat .
The heated carbon atoms began to vibrate in a random , nonsynchronized fashion .
Over time , however , the oscillations of the individual atoms became synchronized as different modes of the material locked in phase , emerging to become a heartbeat - like " drumming . "
Digital video , slowed down more than a billion times , illustrates this nano - drumming mechanical phenomenon , which displays a well - defined resonance that is nearly 100 times higher than can be detected by the human eardrum .

" With this 4D imaging technique , atomic - scale motions , which lead to structural , morphological , and nanomechanical phenomena , can now be visualized directly , and hopefully understood , " says Zewail , who is now expanding the research to biological imaging within cells in collaboration with Grant Jensen , an associate professor of biology at Caltech .
The researchers are currently using the 4D microscope to image the components of cells , such as proteins and ribosomes , the cellular machinery that makes proteins .
They have already produced images of a stained rat cell and , more recently , of a protein crystal and cell in vitreous water .
" The goal is to enhance the structural resolution in the images of these biomaterials by taking single - pulse snapshots before they move or deteriorate , and to follow their dynamics in real time , " Zewail says .
In a recent commentary on the development , Sir John Thomas of Cambridge University , who is a world - renowned expert in electron microscopy , said the invention and its applications are " revolutionary . "
" The door is now open for myriad explorations in the physical and biological sciences , " Thomas added .
" The sequences of images produced by this technique are remarkable , " says David Tirrell , chair of Caltech 's Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering .
" They not only provide unprecedented insights into molecular and materials behavior -- they do so in an especially satisfying fashion by allowing direct observation of complex structural changes in real space and real time .
These experiments will lead us to fundamentally new ways of thinking about molecules and materials . "
" Advances in imaging , concepts , and technology for visualization are fundamental to progress in diverse scientific and engineering fields , " says Edward M. Stolper , Caltech 's provost .
" Caltech has made a commitment to leadership across the many physical and biological disciplines in which imaging plays a critical role .
Ahmed 's pioneering work is trailblazing new frontiers of science and technology . "
Two centers supported the development of this technology : the Laboratory for Molecular Science , funded by the National Science Foundation , and the Physical Biology Center , funded by Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation .
The work was also supported by grants from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research , the National Science Foundation , and the National Institutes of Health .

The 38 countries that pledged to restrain their emissions of climate change–inducing greenhouse gases , most notably carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , are failing , according to new figures released today .
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , the body charged with overseeing global emission reduction efforts , says that , overall , greenhouse emissions — measured in terms of the most ubiquitous : carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO 2 e ) — dropped by 894 million metric tons between 1990 and 2006 ( the latest year for which figures are available ) .
But the UNFCCC found that emissions had grown by 2.3 percent — 403 million metric tons of CO 2 e — from 2000 to 2006 , and that the 16 - year dip was due entirely to the drop in economic activity ( factory and power plant shutdowns ) in former Eastern bloc countries such as Russia after the 1989 fall of communist governments , which led to a decline of more than two billion metric tons of CO 2 e emissions .
Those countries ' economies have recovered since 2000 , leading to an increase in CO 2 e emissions of some 258 million metric tons , according to UNFCCC .
Most industrialized European nations as well as China and the U.S. ( which have not agreed to any emissions ' reductions ) have been spewing more carbon dioxide since 1990 — up in total some 403 million metric tons of CO 2 e from 2000 levels .
The UNFCCC cautions that emissions may be even worse now , noting that the statistics in the study are already nearly three years old .
" UNFCCC expert review teams need two years to verify the data , partly by traveling to the countries concerned , " says UNFCCC spokesman John Hay .
" This makes the UNFCCC data not the freshest , but the most reliable on the market . "
The U.K. and the Principality of Monaco are the only two European countries that , after pledging to reduce emissions ( by 12.5 percent and 8 percent , respectively ) by 2012 , appear to be on track .
In contrast , Austria , which vowed in 2002 to cut emissions by over the next 10 years 13 percent below 1990 levels , is instead pumping out 15 percent more CO2e than it did in 1990 .
Likewise , Japan is now emitting over 6 percent more greenhouse gases now than in 1990 despite a promise in 2002 to reduce them by 6 percent by 2012 .
Even countries allowed to emit more greenhouse gases under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol ( an international treaty to reduce emissions ) to allow further economic development have nearly doubled their allowed growth .
Ireland , for example , has seen greenhouse gas emissions grow by nearly 26 percent when , under the terms of the treaty , they should only rise by 13 percent .
The treaty signatories have until 2012 to get their acts together .
If they continue to exceed their limits by that date , they will be suspended from international carbon trading , which currently allows them to purchase cheaper emission reductions from developing countries in lieu of reducing their own ; instead , they would be required to achieve 1.3 times the missed reduction in future years .
World governments are set to gather next month in Poznan , Poland , to continue negotiations on a binding international agreement to cut globe - warming greenhouse gases after 2012 — a so - called successor to the Kyoto Protocol currently in force .
Under the Bush administration , the U.S. has participated in such talks without accepting a binding emissions reduction target .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , the U.S. emitted nearly six billion metric tons of CO 2 last year , up from roughly five billion metric tons in 1990 .
It remains to be seen how the incoming Obama administration will proceed , though on the stump the president - elect pledged to cut U.S. emissions to 80 percent below present levels by 2050 .
When releasing today 's report , UNFCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer stressed the importance of negotiating a new and binding agreement to cut climate change pollution .
" The figures clearly underscore the urgency for the U.N. negotiating process to make good progress in Poznan and move forward quickly in designing a new agreement to respond to the challenge of climate change , " he said .
He also noted that President - elect Obama would not attend .
In contrast , the pound has suffered heavily in foreign exchange trading and is now 13 pc lower against the dollar this month alone as expectations that the UK economy is now facing a severe recession becomes the mainstream view .
News on Friday the economy contracted 0.5 pc in the three months to September sent the currency tumbling almost 9 cents at one point .
WASHINGTON
It ’s a cool idea , Hillary Clinton as secretary of state .
At long last , the feminist icon would represent the feminist ideal of getting a room of her own , all on her own .
Running for the Senate and the presidency , Hillary felt entitled to get money , endorsements and support because she was the wife of Bill Clinton  and at times the victim of Bill Clinton .
If she became secretary of state , she would be getting the job despite her husband  and because of her own transformation in the primaries from a legacy applicant to a scrappy one .
After balking during his wife ’s campaign at releasing records of his business dealings and big donors to his presidential library , Bill would have to stop spewing about Barack and start spilling to him .

The dynamic duo on Fox News is apparently breaking up for good .
' Liberal ' Alan Colmes will be leaving Sean Hannity to further his own career , ending 12 years of partnership with the conservative poster child .
According to the Huffington Post :
OX News Channel 's ( FNC ) Alan Colmes will relinquish his role as co-host of Hannity & Colmes at the end of the year .

Thanks for watching !

In announcing his decision , Colmes said , " I approached Bill Shine
( FNC's Senior Vice President of Programming ) earlier this year about
wanting to move on after 12 years to develop new and challenging ways
to contribute to the growth of the network .
Although it 's bittersweet
to leave one of the longest marriages on cable news , I 'm proud that
both Sean ( Hannity ) and I remained unharmed after sitting side by side ,
night after night for so many years . "
How will Hannity cope without Colme 's soothing liberalism ?
Will he explode in a fit of unfettered conservatism ?
The thought of Hannity left alone is truly scary .
Colmes has n't exactly challenged Hannity over the years , but he has provided some sort of a check to his rampant Republicanism .
I have to say , I 'm pleased Colmes has decided to get out of this abusive relationship .
Working as a liberal gimp with the biggest bully on Fox can't have been good for his self esteem , and Colmes may finally blossom when out by himself .
But Hannity may find himself distincly out of sorts .
Like a domineering husband without a submissive wife to beat on , he could find himself descending into Ike Turner territory , of even worse , hosting a show like Bill O'Reilly 's .
Either way , it wo n't be fun to watch .
After seeings its videos repeatedly removed from YouTube , John McCain 's campaign on Monday told the Google - owned video site that its copyright infringement policies are stringent to the point of stifling free speech , and that its lawyers need to revamp the way they evaluate copyright infringement claims .
" We fully understand that YouTube may receive too many videos , and too many take - down notices , to be able to conduct full fair - use review of all such notices , " wrote Trevor Potter , the campaign 's general counsel , in a letter to YouTube and Google .
" But we believe it would consume few resources — and provide enormous benefit — for YouTube to commit a full legal review of all take - down notices on videos posted from accounts controlled by
( at least ) political candidates and campaigns . "
The McCain campaign's web video ads have been repeatedly either knocked off YouTube or have had to be revamped for using excerpts of television debate footage , and pop songs as soundtracks , without negotiating for the rights first .
One of its highest profile hits on the web , " Obama Love , " for example , faced an embarrassing revamp in July when YouTube received a DMCA take - down notice from The Warner Music Group .
The campaign had used Franki Valli's hit tune " Ca n't Take My Eyes Off Of You " as the video 's sarcastic soundtrack .
The letter is notable both because YouTube and online video generally have become prime platforms for communicating political messages during the 2008 presidential campaign , and because this is one of the rare instances when a member of Congress is speaking out in favor of fair - use rights , after experiencing for themselves the onerous burden put on citizens using media to express ideas .
The concept of fair use has had few defenders in Congress , where it 's usually treated by lawmakers as code for piracy .
The letter was addressed to YouTube 's CEO Chad Hurley , William
Patry , Google 's senior copyright counsel , and YouTube 's General Counsel
Zahavah Levine .
Patry , ironically , is known for scholarship on the fair - use doctrine .
The doctrine says that four factors should be used to determine whether the unauthorized use of copyrighted material infringes :
Whether the use is non-commercial and transformative ; whether it 's factual ; the extent of the use of the material and the impact of the use on the market for the work .
McCain 's campaign on Monday argued that its uses of tiny clips of copyrighted material falls within the scope of the doctrine .
" The uses at issue have been the inclusion of fewer than ten seconds of footage from news broadcasts in campaign ads or videos , as a basis for commentary on the issues presented in news reports , or on the reports themselves , " Potter wrote .
" These are paradigmatic examples of fair use , in which all four of the statutory factors are strongly in our favor . "
Earlier last year , the McCain campaign was the subject of copyright infringement claims from Fox News , which objected to the campaign 's use of its debate footage .
A copy of the letter is available here .

TOKYO , Nov 23 : US President George Bush believes the Iraq war was a success and is “ very pleased ” with what is happening there , he said in a pre-recorded interview broadcast on a Japanese television network on Sunday .
“ I think the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was right , ” Bush told the Sunday Project programme of the private Asahi network .
Saddam was an enemy of the United States and a lot of people thought he had weapons of mass destruction , Bush said , adding “ remarkable ” progress had been made in Iraq since the late dictator was toppled in 2003 .
“ People have been able to take their troops out of Iraq because Iraq is becoming successful .
I ’m very pleased with what is taking place there now , ” he said , adding there still is “ a lot of work ” to be done .
“ We are bringing troops home because of the success in Iraq .
But Iraq is not yet completely safe .
“ So there will be a US presence for a while there at the request of the Iraqi government , ” he said .
“ The United States is willing to continue to help .
Most countries there within a very broad coalition have come home but we want to help this government , ” he said without further elaborating .
The Japanese network said the interview was conducted in Washington just before Bush left for Asia - Pacific talks in Peru at the weekend .
The Bush presidency has been indelibly marked by the Iraq war , from the invasion spurred by false allegations that Saddam was harbouring weapons of mass destruction to the abuses by US troops of Iraqis in the Abu Ghraib jail .
Some 4,200 American soldiers have been killed in the country in a war which has also cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars .
The war was also a dominant theme of the 2008 White House race , with president - elect Obama vowing to bring home the forces within 16 months .

Here are the fundamental principles of movie asteroid science , as derived from the NBC miniseries " Asteroid " :
Asteroids travel through space making a noise like a powerful but subdued engine .
Asteroids are usually locked into orbits , but if a comet comes by , they can be bumped out of their rut and become dangerously unstable .
It 's only the fact that everything is locked into an orbit which prevents collisions in our solar system .
Any asteroid that gets loose is certain to crash into Earth within a matter of hours .

It also requires martial law , so that " looters will be arrested on sight " .
( Have they no mercy ? )
With 30 + hours to go , people will panic in the streets and run around at random .
A mile - wide asteroid can mostly burn up in the atmosphere , causing it to do only a relatively small amount of damage ( bursting a dam ) when it strikes .
A river from a burst dam can exactly keep pace with a pickup truck for several minutes .
It will then obligingly pause as the pickup truck turns around and goes in another direction .
When a raging river washes over a pickup truck on a bridge , the bridge wo n't be damaged , the truck wo n't be swept off the bridge , and people in the open back of the truck wo n't be swept away .
A four - mile - wide nickel asteroid ( which would mass about a * trillion * tons ) can be destroyed -- literally destroyed , so that nothing remains -- by three airplane - mounted lasers .
But with only two airplane - mounted lasers , it instead instantly explodes into thousands of pieces .
Astronomers are very surprised that it was n't literally destroyed .
Laser beams are easily visible in space .
Incoming asteroids spend several minutes in Earth 's atmosphere .
Asteroids made of softer or more volatile stuff than nickel will harmlessly burn up in the atmosphere regardless of size .
Asteroids that land in the ocean will do no damage regardless of size .
Asteroids are discovered by astronomers peering directly through their telescopes in brightly lit observatories .
Whatever they see will appear on computer monitors , however .
Asteroid positions are reported in plainly audible 75 BPS Baudot teletype signals .
Oddly , there will be no dog to be rescued at the last possible moment .
Maybe only tornadoes and volcanoes come equipped with dogs .
Would you settle for goldfish ?
Every time some guy walks into a bar , usually the hero , he gets into a fight .
Usually right under a BUDWEISER sign ( see " product placement " ) .
Likelihood of fight increases if country music is playing in the background .
Movie heroes in a bar will either order strong alcoholic drinks and swallow them down like iced tea or will ask for milk .
The latter will always provoke sarcastic remarks and a fight will ensue .
When men drink whiskey , it is always in a shot glass , and they always drink it in one gulp .
If they are wimps , they will gasp for air , then have a coughing fit .
If they are macho , they will wince briefly , flashing clenched teeth .
A cup of black coffee / splash of cold water in face is enough to render the most inebriated person stone cold sober in a split second ( see several thousand westerns , and " Peter 's Friends . " )
Whenever someone looks through the binoculars , you see two joined circles instead of one .
Glasses never collect moisture when you come in from the cold outside .
Computer geeks and " intelligent " persons use them , action heros never have glasses .
A villain will always commit murder right in front of the window when someone with binoculars is watching .
People are often exact duplicates of remote ancestors , or of their parent at the same age .
At least one of a pair of identical twins is born evil .
Radiation causes mutation not to your future children , but to you , there and then .
Mutation is never immediately fatal , but first either makes you into a formless blob , or a functional creature with animal - like features .
Interbreeding is genetically possible with any person or creature from anywhere in the universe .
Newborn babies can babble , crawl , and hold their heads steady .
People never cough , sneeze , blow their noses , or show any other symptoms of being in less than perfect health .
Only exception to the above is when they 're dying .
A cough is a symptom of terminal illness .
Menstruation is an unknown phenomenon in movies .
Female movie characters are all immune from it .
You can eat as much as you want in a film and you 'll never EVER have to go to the bathroom .
Vomit is portrayed by distant toilet flush .
Nobody ever throws - up on the carpet .
Evil geniuses who devise bombs to destroy things / people always have them detonate after at least an hour , giving the hero ample time to defuse it .
Bombs always have big , blinking , beeping timer displays .
Evil geniuses who devise bombs to destroy things / people are always thoughtful enough to include a visible display ( usually LED ) of how much time remains before the bomb detonates , giving the hero accurate feedback on exactly how much time remains .
When you cut the wire to the detonator , the timer will stop .
You will not be able to do this , however , until only one second remains .
All wires have different colors , so the hero can easily differentiate them when he has to cut the right one .
Bombs detonated with microwave ovens always explode 2 seconds after the timer reaches 00:00 and the microwave oven beeps ( ex. " Under Siege " ) .
Explosions always happen in slow motion .
When an explosion occurs , make certain you are running away from the point of detonation so the blast can send you flying , in slow motion , toward the camera .
A building that in real life would require several dozen carefully placed explosive charges for demolition , can in a movie be destroyed by a single bomb in a car trunk ( see " Lethal Weapon III " ) .
This bomb will cause no damage to any other building on the block .
Movie passengers either do n't pay cabs at all , or have the exact change .
Same is true in restaurants .
Checks are always designed to be 15 percent under the bills the male costumer has in his hands first .
Movie people can get cabs instantly , unless they are in danger , whereupon no cab can be found
Movie characters driving in the city will get to park wherever they like when they get to their destination .
When you are alone in the back seat of the car , make sure you sit in the middle .
Sudden accelleration of a car ( be it forwards , backwards , stopping , skidding , sliding , or whatever ) causes a loud skid , even on dirt or wet roads .
Be prepared .
Each wheel is also fitted with a smoke device to let you know when this happens .
Hollywood cars are also special : when you take off quickly , you always leave a skid mark for each drive wheel , regardless of whether you have a limited slip differential or not .
Pedestrians in Hollywood have the world 's best reactions , so do n't worry if you have to drive down a sidewalk .
Mr Pappodopolus is quite used to having his fruit cart smashed , and despite his gesticulations and curses , he always manages to get out of the way in time .
There are always people carrying around large sheets of glass on the street during a car chase .
The person behind the wheel is talking to and looking at their passenger for the entire journey without actually looking at the _road_ , changing gear , signalling etc. ( ex . " When Harry Met Sally " ) .
Cars chasing each other in the middle of a city will not suffer enough damage to stop the chase .
People being chased by a car will keep running down the middle of the road instead of ducking in somewhere where a car cannot go .
A car will always explode when shot at , unless the hero is driving it .
When you drive a car , you can always recognize all the persons you know that pass you in the opposite direction .
If someone has " fixed " the foot - brakes in the car , the driver never use the hand - brake and the gears to slow down , at least not until the last moment .
Cars often end up on cliff - edges with 2 wheels in the open air .
The good guys are saved just before the car falls over , the bad guys join the car in the free fall , often caused by a bird setting down on the part of the car hanging over the edge .
When a car falls off a cliff after a car chase , it usually explodes before reaching the ground .
When speeding cars hit a parked car , they fly up into the air while the parked car does n't even wiggle
After a car crash , no movie character ever sits and shakes for five minutes , or becomes incoherent with shock .
All cars seem to run on kerosene rather than gasoline ( hence the copious black smoke when they burn ) .
Watch steering wheels in movie cars , especially in " through the windshield looking at the driver " shots .
9 times out of 10 , the spokes of the wheel , which one would think should be horizontal , or close to it , are vertical , i.e. , one can see one of the wheel spokes vertical , above the dash , in front of the driver 's face , even when he 's driving straight .
Whenever you see someone driving , even on straight and smooth roads , they are sawing at the wheel hard enough to be running an obstacle course .
The car does n't swerve at all , of course .
The amount of excess wheel - twisting is independent of speed .
Not only do movie cars always park right in front , but they are never locked .
Even convertibles with their tops down , in NYC , are still there hours later .
Movie cars have all excellent brakes and can come to a full stop from 80 MPH ( with loud screeches , even on dirt roads ) in 20 ft .
There 's never an annoying wind disturbing the coiffures of convertible passengers .
There are no stop signs in movie land .
Wherever you have to drive , no matter how close or far away it is , you never have to stop before you get there .
Film cars do not have inside rear - view mirrors .
Most of them do , however , have an appx 1 " gray spot on the inside of the windshield where the mirror would normally mount .
Film cars never start the first time when you 're running away from the bad guy .
If there is a large bump in a downhill road , speeding cars will always fly over them and hit the ground in shower of sparks .
An interior view will then show the reaction of the passengers at the moment of impact .
They will not be injured , even if they are not wearing safety belts .
No tire damage , broken axles , or suspension failures will occur as a result of the impact .
The car will then execute a sharp left turn at the bottom of the hill .
Losing a hubcap at this point will be optional .
Any time you see a really nice , snazzy foreign car or a great old car like a 65 mustang , you know it 's going to be smashed into a million pieces .
All too many times a Hollywood car chase will be interupted by the emergence of a semi from a driveway , alley , or street , resulting in the escape of the hunted , or the death of an expendable character .
Police cars involved in chase scenes usually tend to suffer more than any other vehicles - they have head on collisions , smash parked cars , fall into water , and of course , experience the ever popular flying - roll , causing the car to land upside down and crush the lights and siren .
Usually , we never get to see the unlucky police force member before or after the inevitable accident .
A car that crashes will always explode in a ball of flames , but not until the hero can pull the important passengers to safety , and yell , " Watch out !
She 's gonna blow ! "
Acid applied by the villain to the hero 's brake lines never has any effect unless the car is heading down a steep , winding road .
Cars at traffic lights have invujlnerable brake lines .
No one ever runs out of gas ( even in long car chases ) .
Corollary : every stolen car has a full gas tank and gets great gas mileage .
Vintage cars are always 100 % immaculate and freshly polished .
They never have any scratches , dents or repairs .
No one fumbles for car keys right before a car chase .
they always jump right in and start the car up because they 've left the keys in the ignition .
Not a great idea in any major city .
Woman falls to the ground whilst being chased by a bad guy , even when running over level , unobstructed terrain .
Note that when a man and woman are being chased , usually the woman falls , then the man pauses and helps her up .
Corollaries to the above :
Man will then continue to run with woman , holding her by the hand or preferably upper arm , even though this takes them both below the speed either one could make on their own .
All movie women must be pulled along by their hands , even if the male puller is short & fat and the woman is a track star .
All movie women try to run in heels , never stopping to kick them off .
Women not only have to be pulled along , they do not have enough sense to run and keep running unless a man touches her elbow , holds her hand or puts his arm around her shoulders .
Chasees will always stop to throw obstacles ( trash cans , lumber , chairs ) in their pursuers ' way .
No matter that they take three times as long to dump the obstacles as it takes the chasers to simply jump over them .
GOOD
Chess players are always portrayed as upper class .
( Go to any tournament and see how many rich guys there are there .
NONE !
They 're too busy chasing women and driving fast cars to play chess . )
Chess players in movies are always all around brilliant and charming people .
( With very few exceptions , REAL chess players are introverted and so involved with chess they have little time to WASTE pursuing anything as trivial as LOVE , A PROFESSION , or SOCIAL GRACES .
Exception : Computers !
Most Chess players are , or will become , Computer nurds ) .
Great Chess players are always honored to play on some rich guy 's fancy Philipino Art Set .
( In reality , better players are almost always adament about playing on a plain , unadorned wood or plastic " Staunton " set .
No red or blue pieces , no ceramic or metal , no elephants for rooks . )
The board is usually set up wrong , with the black square at the players lower right , or with one or both of the King / Queen set up backwards .
( WHITE SQUARE GOES ON THE PLAYERS RIGHT .
QUEENS on thier own color : white QUEEN on white , black QUEEN on black . )
Supposedly brilliant players usually miss one move checkmates in critical games .
This is akin to a professional race car driver backing his station wagon into the garage door .
On the other hand , good players are often portrayed as seeing 15 or 20 moves ahead in detail from a middle game , when there are still many pieces on the board .
( One could more easily predict the next president and all 535 congressmen correctly before the election .
In the End Game , when the number of pieces is limited , looking ahead often becomes a question of counting moves , who can get to the critical square first , or of very limited numbers of moves , and is more feasible . )
Beginners usually beat experienced players , as a mechanism for showing the neophyte 's native brilliance .
( This is about as common as a tall , athletic man who 's never seen a basketball beating an NBA player in one - on - one .
It could happen , if the pro had a really bad day , but who would you bet on ? )
Players who are really behind ( have lost more pieces ) come up with brilliant ways to win anyway .
( If they 're so good , how did they get behind in the first place ? )
Male characters generally are cold - natured .
They need to wear jeans and leather jackets when the female characters are comfortable in cutoffs and a halter top .
Heroes are the exception to the above .
He often is more comfortable in extreme cold after losing his coat or having the shirt ripped from his back .
When this is not true ( Cliffhanger ) , swimming in ice water helps .
Whenever anyone knocks out anyone else and takes their clothes , it 's always a flawless fit .
Word processors never display a cursor .
You never have to use the space - bar when typing long sentences .
Movie character never make typing mistakes .
All monitors display inch - high letters .
High - tech computers , such as those used by NASA , the CIA , or some such governmental institution , will have easy to understand graphical interfaces .
Those that do n't , have incredibly powerful text - bases command shells that can correctly understand and execute commands typed in plain english .
Corollary : you can gain access to any information you want by simply typing " ACCESS ALL OF THE SECRET FILES " on any keyboard
Likewise , you can infect a computer with a destructive virus by simply typing " UPLOAD VIRUS " ( see " Fortress " )
All computers are connected .
You can access the information on the villain 's desktop computer , even if it 's turned off .
Powerful computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever the screen changes .
Some computers also slow down the output on the screen so that it does n't go faster than you can read .
The * really * advanced ones also emulate the sound of a dot - matrix printer .
All computer panels have thousands of volts and flash pots just underneath the surface .
Malfunctions are indicated by a bright flash , a puff of smoke , a shower of sparks , and an explosion that forces you backwards .
People typing away on a computer will turn it off without saving the data .
A hacker can get into the most sensitive computer in the world before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries .
Any PERMISSION DENIED has an OVERRIDE function ( see " Demolition Man " and countless others ) .
Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be accomplished in under three seconds .
Movie modems usually appear to transmit data at the speed of two gigabytes per second .
When the power plant / missile site / whatever overheats , all the control panels will explode , as will the entire building .
If you display a file on the screen and someone deletes the file , it also disappears from the screen ( e.g Clear and Present Danger ) .
If a disk has got encrypted files , you are automagically asked for a password when you try to access it .
No matter what kind of computer disk it is , it 'll be readable by any system you put it into .
All application software is usable by all computer platforms .
The more high - tech the equipment , the more buttons it has ( Aliens ) .
However , everyone must have been highly trained , because the buttons are n't labelled .
Most computers , no matter how small , have reality - defying three - dimensional , active animation , photo - realistic graphics capability .
Laptops , for some strange reason , always seem to have amazing real - time video phone capabilities and the performance of a CRAY Supercomputer .
Whenever a character looks at a VDU , the image is so bright that it projects itself onto his / her face ( see " Alien " , " 2001 " ) .
Two people will often converse while one stares out the window , with their back to the other .
When an emotional point is made , the first person will turn around .
When you go to rob a bank in a film , you will always choose the teller who has just started his or her first day on the job .
In situations like the Vietnem war , and violent inner city neighborhoods , the person with the most plans , prospects , and hopes will die .
A dying person 's last words will always be coherent and significant .
A good person will always die in the presence of friends .
If a person good person dies with his eyes open , a friend will close them , and they will remain closed .
If a villain dies with his eyes open , no one will close them , and the camera will linger on his face .
When your sidekick , lover , or similar acquaintance is on the verge of dying , do n't call an ambulance ; instead hold her warmly and whisper words of comfort , or kiss her passionately .
Theoretically she may not be much into it under the circumstances , but hey , it may be your last chance !
Then , when she relaxes or slumps over visibly , you can say your tearful good - bye to her , because this means she is dead .
Alternately , if she is already slumped over when you get to her , check her pulse , but if the resulting music is soft and slow , do n't bother trying CPR .
If she does n't like this treatment better than a chance to save her life , do n't worry ; it 's not like she will be able to do anything about it !

A drug that combines four different medicines and could halve deaths from heart attacks and stroke around the globe will enter human trials this week in London .
The once - a - day polypill has been the dream of doctors for many years , but because the drugs it contains , including aspirin , are cheap , there has been no financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to get involved .
Now , however , international teams of researchers , with the backing in the UK of the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation , are just a few years away from making the polypill an accessible reality .
Difficulties in combining four drugs in one tablet have been overcome and the Red Heart pill , as it has been christened , has been manufactured by the Indian generic drug company Dr Reddy's .
Volunteers are now being recruited for a 12 - week pilot trial which will involve up to 700 people in six countries .
If all goes well , the main trial with 5,000 to 7,000 volunteers will begin at the end of next year .
Anthony Rodgers , co-director of the clinical trials unit at the University of Auckland , leader of the project , said it had been a struggle to get the polypill this far .
" The chances of mainstream pharmaceutical industry taking this on are slim .
" We spent a few years around about 2000 - 2002 trying to persuade a number of companies to do this , but got nowhere .
Basically , their whole business model is around people paying a few hundred pounds a year for the latest blockbuster drug .
A pill with established medicines that halved cardiovascular risk and could be available for £ 20 a year could be seen as a threat . "
He added that it had been hard to find a source of research funding for a lifesaving idea that involved using existing medicines and was therefore about application as much as innovation .
" If someone came up with a credible solution to preventing most cancer , using established available and affordable medicines , can you imagine it taking this long to be trialled ? "
The typical candidate for the polypill is a 55 - year - old man ( or slightly older woman ) who smokes .
Smoking , being overweight and inactivity are the common causes of cardiovascular disease .
Doctors in the UK prescribe a cocktail of drugs for people at risk - especially if they have had a heart attack .
But even though these preventive drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol are easily available on the NHS , some people do not go to the doctor , while others find it hard to stick to a multi - drug regime .
The polypill combines aspirin , a statin to lower cholesterol and an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide to counter high blood pressure in one tablet .
" There are particular groups in our community who are not getting the required preventive therapy , both among those at modest cardiovascular risk who are not being evaluated and those at pretty serious risk who have already had a heart attack , " said Professor Simon
Thom , from the international centre of circulatory health at Imperial College London , where the UK arm of the trial is taking place and where the first volunteer will begin taking the tablets this week .
Among people who have already had one heart attack , drug take - up should be 100 % , but it is not .
The Red Heart pill could transform the prospects of people in the developing world .
In middle - income countries such as India and Brazil , cardiovascular disease is soaring as western habits are become ingrained .
" Coca Cola costs peanuts and everybody has motorised transport .
This has happened almost within a generation , so it 's nothing to do with genetics , " said Thom .
According to the World Health Organisation , 17 million people die of heart disease and strokes every year and 80 % of deaths are in developing countries .
Polypill enthusiasts say the death toll could be halved by the daily Red Heart tablet , which would cost $ 1 ( 54 p ) a month .
Although
Thom would expect a range of polypills to be prescribed by doctors in the UK , a standard tablet could be sold over the counter at pharmacies in the developing world .
" The prospect in the developing world is that the pill will be administered almost blind , but the people who really should be in the front of the queue are those who have had heart attacks and strokes and are not getting a sniff of any of these drugs because they are prohibitively expensive , " said Thom .

What 's better than having a nice leather or cloth iPod sleeve to show off to your friends ?
If you 're thinking one made of imitation meat -- you 're dead right !
Apparently , a company in Japan is under the impression that you want to wrap your music player in a grade A lookalike , undoubtedly to the thrill of your vegetarian friends and family .
Of course , do n't just get one for the shock value -- this thing oozes pure , sophisticated style .
If you 've got ¥ 6,800 ( or about $ 66 ) and dignity to spare , it can be all yours .

In the spirit of the ASU Photo Tour , I ’ve decided to do a little collection of images for the FSO image which is built on the FreeSmartphone .
Orgframework .
Let me first get some weight off my chest .
I ’ve been feeling burnt out by Openmoko since the end of June when some confusion was cleared up about the ASU , the FSO and in general , the direction of the software for Openmoko devices .
I ’m going to toss around some acronyms and a new title to think about .
The ASU was a proof - of - concept image that combined Qtopia , Enlightenment and GTK running on top of Xorg .
This first image was built ( I ’m told ) by rasterman by hand and that issues would be worked on until August , when a first “ functional ” image would be released .
ASU , then , means April / August Software Update .
Either month works just fine – the first image was released in April , the result slated for release in August .
To address the confusion , that software line is now Openmoko 2008.08 so “ ASU ” and 2008.08 are the same thing for the most part .
With me ?
Good , let ’s move on .
When the ASU was announced , two other things happened .
The GTK based 2007.02 line was obsoleted ( or some might argue deprecated since it ’s now getting attention from the community ) and the FSO Framework was announced .
I ’ll focus on the framework , because it ’s where my complaints and burnout centered around .
The ASU and Framework were announced at roughly the same time .
To the community it appeared as if Sean Moss - Pultz had pulled a decision out of his ass to abandon the software that people knew and go with Qtopia instead .
This decision appeared to be arbitrary and sudden , leaving a lot of questions unanswered .
Frankly , it left a lot of questions unasked , because this move was so radical and sudden .
The biggest unanswered question was I want to develop an app for Freerunner , what should I start with ?
This is when the Framework was revealed by Mickey Lauer .
Perhaps this was too big of a leap , but from then on it appeared as if the ASU and the Framework were complimentary projects within Openmoko .
The end result of both projects would be to develop dbus based services and signaling and adapt the Qtopia applications to use this system .
As I reasoned , ASU focused on the userspace apps and the Framework would focus on the back - end and the merger of those two would be the “ mass market ” software Openmoko would ship on average - Joe ready devices .
The future looked promising , and I was among one of the most vocal people in regard to this .
On 28 June 2008 , Mickey Lauer posted again , making it pretty clear my assumptions were wrong .
The Framework would not be merged into the ASU line to be shipped to customers .
If the two were to merge , it would be by community support .
Frankly , after the disappointing abandonment of the Neo 1973 device , the sudden shift from one development line to another , the horrible communication about the aim and directive of the “ official ” and general all around cluster - fuckery that is Openmoko I began to loose faith in the project .
I know I ’m not alone in that regard , because within 24 hours of feeling I ’d been hoodwinked , the SHR project was announced .
While it may not have been the “ fork heard ’ round the world ” it was a significant point , because I think there the camel ’s back snapped .
Allow me to take a moment to give my impression about the other side too .
I mentioned above that the general opinion was that Sean Moss - Pultz issued a directive to begin adopting Qtopia and that it was contrary to the aims of Openmoko .
Now , I do n’t know since I ’m not in regular communication with him ( the times we ’ve exchanged e-mails have been polite and to the point ) but I suspect the issue is deeper than that .
From reading Sean ’s blog posts and mailing list messages , I think the man is committed to open platforms and more than that , the power that leveraging those platforms gives to users .
I think he truly cares about Openmoko ’s goals .
On the flip side , he ’s also the CEO of a company and in that respect , his job is to ensure that Openmoko turns a profit .
Furthermore , while he wears the title “ Chief Executive Officer ” there ’s nothing chief about his position if it ’s anything like other companies .
The financiers , investors , venture capitalists and shareholders ( if it ’s public ) are the real chiefs .
Speaking bluntly , I suspect that those people started getting freaked out by the Freerunner “ delay ” .
The media had long moved on and the term “ vaporware ” began floating around in regard to Openmoko and I ’m sure this made the investor squeamish .
Sean had a choice then .
In order to see his goal happen , he needs to compromise .
To continue building and selling open platforms to people , Openmoko would need to make their first platform profitable to please the investors .
That platform might not see the light of day unless they could be convinced that Openmoko could begin turning profit quickly .
With the GTK based software showing problems , some architecturally , the decision was to either rebuild a boat mid-voyage or hop on that shiny ocean liner next to you .
I do n’t fault Sean for making that call .
I fault the investors who decided to dump money into a project and then did n’t allow the vision to be pushed forward .
If they wanted to back an open platform , they should let the people making open platforms do what they need to meet that goal .
If they wanted to back a company shipping phones that were nothing special , they should have done that .
It was n’t the one decision alone that hurt the project though .
Openmoko is open .
The first time this hurt Openmoko was with Freerunner .
When Freerunner was conceptualized and discussed , the media ( even open source centric media ) stuck to their traditions and speculated that “ Freerunner will be an iPhone killer ” .
The problem with talking about your products is that nobody is used to companies talking about their products before they ’re in warehouses , awaiting some magical signal to roll out to customers .
So while it was pretty clear to someone who thinks critically , a lot of people saw the Freerunner as being “ delayed ” .
There was also the “ developer ” and “ mass market ” confusion – even as the Freerunner was shipping , people did n’t understand that there were two markets , and two release dates , for the device .
Of course , I get the impression that even this might actually have changed , instead to focus a smaller run on “ niche markets ” like universities and specialty vendors and aim the next product more broadly , but this is n’t confirmed for me .
But I digress .
Openmoko is trying to walk the balance between being open and being effective .
How do you talk about plans about future dazzling products and ( a year or 18 months later ) ship a product that STILL dazzles people ?
How do you market a product as meeting people ’s needs when the product is designed to not assume to know the user ’s needs and be flexible enough to still fill them ?
Openmoko has n’t mastered it and it ’s caused some backlash , but nobody else is doing the same thing better .
In some ways , it ’s a gigantic experiment .
As I sat down to write all that , I planned on it being a small post and then jumping right into the pictures of the FSO , but it turned out filling up two ( going on three ) pages in OpenOffice Writer , but it feels good to have put the feelings into words .
With that , let ’s move onward , and look at what the FSO Framework has to offer .
Meet Zhone .
Zhone is a very basic program designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Framework backend systems .
As an added bonus it looks spiffy .
I do n’t have a working SIM inserted in this image , so you ca n’t see the network I ’m connected to or signal strength but these features normally exist and can be seen in later images .
For a moment , we ’ll ignore the irony of the icon selection .
I ’m a married man with a professional career and other than ones in use for the purpose of having a rotary phone in use , I ’ve not seen one in the wild .
Yet in my hands to take this screenshot was a device that has substantially more computing power than a Game Boy Advance , which itself has substantially more computing power than all of NASA Mission Control when they placed a human being on the moon .
Let ’s ignore this and click the phone icon , shall we ?
At the top you can see two bars , one blue and one green .
The blue bar represents cellular signal strength and above it displays the carrier message .
This SIM works , but is not active , so can only be used for emergency calls so displays “ SOS Only ” .
To the right is a green bar , displaying battery strength .
In all honesty , I ’m not sure what the letters above that bar indicate , but I ’m sure that I ’ll get that information soon after this post is public .
If you ’re terribly interested , check back later or leave a comment with an e-mail address ( does n’t require registration , that bugs the hell out of me ! ) and I ’ll send you a message once I know for sure .
Got it already .
🙂
They stand for Bluetooth , GSM , WLAN and GPS , respectively .
Small letters indicate “ turned off ” , capital letters are for “ turned on ” .
Thanks for pointing this out wurp !
Below that is the dialer display and keypad .
The back arrow deletes and the big green check enters the number .
The smaller arrows , as well as the bottom row of icons do nothing , except for the “ X ” which exits the dialer .
The next section well look at include the messaging features .
The forward , delete and reply buttons simply drop me back at the main screen .
I ’m assuming this is because I have no SMS messages but it could be unimplemented features .
I have a strong hunch that they work .
In the Milestone 1 release , unimplemented features were clearly marked as such .
Clicking on the “ Send ” button brings up a selection screen where you pick your contact , touch the bar for that contact and are presented with a message compose screen .
I had to censor the first image because it contained phone numbers .
The nifty thing about this is that it actually imported them from the SIM card automagically .
Contacts management is the next feature of Zhone to explore .
Like the SMS section , you ’re presented with a menu to select your action , including “ Edit Name ” , “ Edit Number ” and “ new ” .
I elected to do each of those for illustrative purposes and use random keypad presses for the number .
The final portion of Zhone is something GPS related .
This does nothing for me as of yet , but I wanted to show it anyway .
Exiting Zhone is easy since Illume is installed and functional .
First is the ASU launcher with a light blue hue as icons are selected .
The next image is a screenshot of the screenshot application to show that GTK works but looks ugly unthemed , but I ’m sure that ’s not really in dispute .
It ’s been a while since I ’ve seen the keyboard in action , and it ’s improved quite a bit .
I ’m not sure if this is a FSO improvement or done to Illume directly , but it makes the Freerunner quite a bit more functional .
There ’s several modes now , including a full QWERTY mode which can be selected .
The great news is that it ’s actually terminal capable !
A few new images that did n’t make it onto this page can be found in my Openmoko Image Gallery including a possible bug ( the keyboard selection menu does n’t close if the keyboard does ) but all told the “ interesting ” stuff made it ’s way here .
What ca n’t be put in a photo collection is stability .
None , and I do repeat none , of the apps crashed .
Suspend and resume are actually working reliably on the Freerunner with a press of the power button for each .
The AUX button puts the device into lock mode .
My only complaint is that the lock mode still accepts screen presses , meaning that to put the device in a purse or a pocket it needs to be fully suspended else it runs the risk of powering up and down the backlite as keys and spare change collide with it .
All in all , there ’s promising progress from all different fronts and it ’s rapidly rekindling my desire to get involved and take control of my phone .
Now …

It may be just a concept for now , but the new SGI Molecule blows our minds with its potential power : Imagine 5,000 Atom N330 chips in just one 3U rack computer , the size of your average PC desktop .
That 's 10,000 cores in one single computer , or 40 more times the processing power of your typical 1U x86 cluster node .
Is this possible ?
How do they expect to do this without actually creating a hole full of molten metal and plastic ?
According to SGI , the key to make this system work is their proprietary Kelvin cooling technology , which we can only imagine works by pouring buckets of liquid nitrogen over the CPUs .
According to them , all this vaporware may result in a computer that can sustain 20,000 threads of execution , with a 15TB / sec memory bandwidth per rack .
• High concurrency with 20,000 threads of execution — 40 times more than a single rack x86 cluster system •
High throughput with 15TB / sec of memory bandwidth per rack — over 20 times faster than a single rack x86 cluster system •
Greater balance with up to three times the memory bandwidth / OPS compared to current x86 CPUs •
High performance with approximately 3.5 times the computational performance per rack •
Greener with low - watt consumer CPUs and low - power memory that deliver 7 times better memory bandwidth / watt • Innovative Silicon Graphics Kelvin cooling technology , which enables denser packaging by stabilizing thermal operations in densely configured solutions •
Operating environment flexibility , capable of running industry - standard Linux ( R ) implementations , with Microsoft ( R ) Windows ( R ) variants on some configurations

Back when we were putting together the grant proposal for ACCURATE , one of the questions that we asked ourselves , and which the NSF people asked us as well , was whether we would produce a “ bright shiny object , ” which is to say whether or not we would produce a functional voting machine that could ostensibly be put to use in a real election .
Our decision at the time , and it was certainly the correct decision , is that we would focus on innovating in the technology under the covers of a voting system , and we might produce , at most “ research prototypes ” .
The difference between a research prototype and a genuine , commercial system are typically quite substantial , in general , and it would be no different here with voting system prototypes .
At Rice we built a fairly substantial prototype that we call “ VoteBox ” ; you can read more about it in a paper that will appear on Friday at Usenix Security .
To grossly summarize , our prototype feels a lot like a normal DRE voting system , but uses some nice cryptographic machinery to ensure that you do n’t have to trust that the code is correct .
You can verify the correctness of a machine , on the fly , while the election is ongoing .
Our prototype is missing a couple features that you ’d want from a commercial system , like write - in voting , but it ’s far enough along that it ’s been used in several human - factors experiments ( CHI ’08 , Everett ’07 ) .
This summer , our mission is to get this thing shipped as some sort of “ open source ” project .
Now we have several goals in this :
Allow other researchers to benefit from our infrastructure as a platform to do their own research .
Inspire commercial voting system vendors to build better products ( i.e. , solving the hard design problems for them , to reduce their cost for adopting innovative techniques ) .
Allow commercial voting system vendors to build on our source code , itself .
All well and good .
Now the question is how we should actually license the thing .
There are many , many different models under which we could proceed :
Closed source + patents + licenses .
This may or may not yield revenues for our university , and may or may not be attractive to vendors .
It ’s clearly unattractive to other researchers , and would limit uptake of our system in places where we might not even think to look , such as outside the U.S .
Open source + a “ not for commercial use ” license .
This makes it a little easier for other researchers to pick up and modify the software although ownership issues could get tricky .
Open source with a “ BSD ” - style license .
A BSD - style license effectively says “ do whatever you want , just give us credit for our work and you ’re on your own if it does n’t work . ”
This sort of license tends to maximize the ease with which companies can adopt your work .
Open source with a “ GPL ” - style license .
The GPL has an interesting property for the voting system world : it makes any derivatives of the source code as open as the original code ( unless a vendor reimplements it from scratch ) .
This sort of openness is something we want to encourage in voting system vendors , but it might reduce vendor willingness to use the codebase .
Open source with a “ publication required ” license .
Joe Hall suggested this as another option .
Like a BSD license , anybody can use it in a product , but the company would be compelled to publish the source code , like a book .
Unlike GPL , they would not be required to give up copyright or allow any downstream use of their code .
I did a quick survey of several open source voting systems .
Most are distributed under the GPL :
Adder
eVACS ( old version is GPL ; new version is proprietary )
Helios ( code not yet released ; most likely GPL according to Ben Adida )
OVC ( GPL with extensions to require change histories be maintained )
Pvote
Civitas is distributed under a non-commercial - use only license .
VoteHere , at one point , opened its code for independent evaluation ( but not reuse ) , but I ca n’t find it any more .
It was probably a variant on the non-commercial - use only theme .
Punchscan is distributed under a BSD - style license .
My question to the peanut gallery : what sort of license would you select for a bright , shiny new voting system project and why ?
[ Extra food for thought :
The GPLv3 would have some interesting interactions with voting systems .
For starters , there ’s a question of who , exactly , a “ user ” might be .
Is that the county clerk whose office bought it , or the person who ultimately votes on it ?
Also , you have section 3 , which forbids any attempt to limit reverse - engineering or “ circumvention ” of the product .
I suppose that means that garden - variety tampering with a voting machine would still violate various laws , but the vendor could n’t sue you for it .
Perhaps more interesting is section 6 , which talks about how source code must be made available when you ship compiled software .
A vendor could perhaps give the source code only to its “ customers ” without giving it to everybody ( again , depending on who a “ user ” is ) .
Of course , any such customer is free under the GPL to redistribute the code to anybody else .
Voting vendors may be most scared away by section 11 , which talks about compulsory patent licensing ( depending , of course , on the particulars of their patent portfolios ) . ]
Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Nachos
American business , typically a reliable Republican cheerleader , is decidedly lukewarm about Senator John McCain ’s proposal to overhaul the health care system by revamping the tax treatment of health benefits , officials with leading trade groups say .
The officials , with organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the Business Roundtable and the National Federation of Independent Business , predicted in recent interviews that the McCain plan , which eliminates the exclusion of health benefits from income taxes , would accelerate the erosion of employer - sponsored health insurance and do little to reduce the number of uninsured from 45 million .
That is largely the argument made in recent days by Mr. McCain ’s opponent , Senator Barack Obama , who has revived a dormant campaign debate over health care with an intensified attack on the McCain plan .
Conscious that the issue plays well with swing voters , Mr. Obama devoted a speech on Saturday to characterizing Mr. McCain ’s plan as “ radical ” and a “ Washington bait and switch , ” and he has reinforced the message in four television advertisements .
That has set off a furious back - and - forth between the campaigns , with the McCain campaign countering that Mr. Obama ’s plan also would undermine employer coverage by mandating that medium and large companies either provide insurance for their workers or pay a tax .
The payments would help subsidize a new government health plan for low - income people , and some economists believe it would entice workers away from their employer - sponsored coverage .
The world is heading for an " ecological credit crunch " far worse than the current financial crisis because humans are over - using the natural resources of the planet , an international study warns today .
The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30 % more resources than the Earth can replenish each year , which is leading to deforestation , degraded soils , polluted air and water , and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species .
As a result , we are running up an ecological debt of $ 4tr ( £ 2.5tr ) to $ 4.5 tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world 's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report 's authors , led by the conservation group WWF , formerly the World Wildlife Fund .
The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually , such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection .
The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world .
This had led the report to predict that by 2030 , if nothing changes , mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle .
" The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means , " says James Leape , WWF International 's director general .
" But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch . "
The report continues : " We have only one planet .
Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species , humans included , is large but fundamentally limited .
When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth 's living systems .
Ultimately this loss threatens human well - being . "
Speaking yesterday in London , the report 's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge international response in line with the multibillion - dollar rescue plan for the economy .
" They now need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that 's the survival of all life on planet Earth , " said Chief Emeka Anyaoku , the president of WWF International .
Sir David King , the British government 's former chief scientific adviser , said : " We all need to agree that there 's a crisis of understanding , that we 're removing the planet 's biodiverse resources at a rate which is as fast if not faster than the world 's last great extinction . "
At the heart of the Living Planet report is an index of the health of the world 's natural systems , produced by the Zoological Society of London and based on 5,000 populations of more than 1,600 species , and on an " ecological footprint " of human demands for goods and services .
For the first time the report also contains detailed information on the " water footprint " of every country , and claims 50 countries are already experiencing " moderate to severe water stress on a year - round basis " .
It also shows that 27 countries are " importing " more than half the water they consume - in the form of water used to produce goods from wheat to cotton - including the UK , Switzerland , Austria , Norway and the Netherlands .
Based on figures from 2005 , the index indicates global biodiversity has declined by nearly a third since 1970 .
Breakdowns of the overall figure show the tropical species index fell by half and the temperate index remained stable but at historically low levels .
Divided up another way , indices for terrestrial , freshwater and marine species , and for tropical forests , drylands and grasslands all showed significant declines .
Of the main geographic regions , only the Nearctic zone around the Arctic sea and covering much of North America showed no overall change .
Over the same period the ecological footprint of the human population has nearly doubled , says the report .
At that rate humans would need two planets to provide for their wants in the 2030s , two decades earlier than the previous Living Planet report forecast just two years ago .
This figure is " conservative " as it does not include the risk of a sudden shock or " feedback loop " such as an acceleration of climate change , says the report .
But it warns :
" The longer that overshoot persists , the greater the pressure on ecological services , increasing the risk of ecosystem collapse , with potentially permanent losses of productivity . "
In the 1960s most countries lived within their ecological resources .
But the latest figures show that today three - quarters of the world 's population live in countries which consume more than they can replenish .
Addressing concerns that national boundaries are an artificial way of dividing up the world 's resources , Leape says : " It 's another way of reminding ourselves we 're living beyond our means . "
The US and China account for more than two - fifths of the planet 's ecological footprint , with 21 % each .
A person 's footprint ranges vastly across the globe , from eight or more " global hectares " ( 20 acres or more ) for the biggest consumers in the United Arab Emirates , the US , Kuwait and Denmark , to half a hectare in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Haiti , Afghanistan and Malawi .
The global average consumption was 2.7 hectares a person , compared with a notional sustainable capacity of 2.1 hectares .
The UK , with an average footprint of about 5.5 hectares , ranks 15th in the world , just below Uruguay and the Czech Republic , and ahead of Finland and Belgium .
In one week , America will have it ’s first black president elect …
… barring some unforeseen event or the Republicans doing what they know what to do best every four years – stealing an election .
It ’s easy to use the typical and lazy argument that black people support Obama simply because he is black .
Naturally , blacks will be proud of him , just like women would have been of Hillary Clinton had she won the nomination instead of Obama .
As were Catholics when JFK beat Nixon .
To claim that his skin colour is the only reason black people want him to be president is an insult .
That statement assumes that blacks are an unthinking herd that is only governed and motivated by colour .
Besides , this simplistic view omits the fact that 88 % of black voters voted for John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore got a whopping 90 % in 2000 .
Blacks vote Democrat idiot !
If they recall , before the Democratic primaries black people all over America were saying that Obama was not black enough .
Of course now he is too black .
I like what Chris Rock says about people who say America can’t have a black president , “ Why not ?
We just had a retarded one . ”
My second favourite quote about Obama ’s candidacy is from comedian and talk show host , Bill Maher , the host of HBO ’s Real Time ( I watch the programme on the “ internets ” ) .
He said , “ Do n’t lie and say you wo n’t vote for Obama because of his race ; it ’s because he ’s smarter than you .
That ’s why you wo n’t vote for him .
That ’s why you voted for Bush twice ! ”
He will be the first American president in eight years I can say without doubt is smarter than I am .
It does n’t take a lot to be smarter than me .
And I hope I can say the same thing about South Africa ’s next president .
Obama overcame every single hurdle that has been put before him ; sometimes they were not just mere hurdles , they were like the Great Wall of China .
Let ’s start with his name .
Here is a man who has the “ misfortune ” of having his middle name as “ Hussein ” in the United States of all places .
And he decided to run for president too with that name .
As if that was n’t bad enough , his surname sounds like Osama and his name is Barack .
All very “ un-American sounding . ”
Television reporters have often made the mistake of referring to him as “ Democratic nominee Barack Osama ” on live television .
He had to overcome that .
He has been accused of being Muslim .
I suspect that being called a Muslim is code for terrorist in some parts of the US .
Of course had he been Muslim there should have been nothing wrong with that either .
During his hard fought primaries against Hillary Clinton there was a poll that showed that 13 % of Americans thought that he was Muslim and a whopping 80 % of those said they would n’t vote for a Muslim .
When General Collin Powell , ( former Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff , former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State ) a Republican , broke ranks with his own party to endorse Barack Obama , a Democrat , he tackled the Muslim issue in a fashion that I had n’t heard any major political figure address .
He said that he was disturbed by what was permitted to be said by the Republicans .
The lazy and anti-intellectual wing of the Republican Party said that Powell endorsed Obama because he is also black .
( Interestingly , the ANC has been displaying some anti-intellectual signs of late . )
Powell gave the example of an elderly lady who said at a McCain rally during a Q&A session , “ Well , you know that Obama is a Muslim ? ” McCain grabbed the microphone from the lady and said , “ No ma’am , he ’s an American . ”
Powell said , “ The correct answer is he is not a Muslim , he is a Christian .
But the really right answer is , what if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ?
The answer is no , that ’s not America .
Is there something wrong with some seven - year - old Muslim kid believing that he / she can be president ? ”
Then he went on to admonish senior members of his party , the Republicans , for implying that Obama is a Muslim and might be associated with terrorists .
He went on to talk about a photo assay about soldiers that had died in Iraq .
He mentioned a picture he saw of a mother in a cemetery ; she had her head on the headstone of her son ’s grave .
The headstone had her son ’s name and awards .
“ At the very top of the tombstone was not a Cross , or the Star of David , it had a Crescent and a Star of Islamic faith … he was an American . ”
No one has said that there is nothing wrong with being a Muslim and an American at the same time as Collin Powell .
No one has refuted the silent bigotry that being Muslim is un-American with the same eloquence and intellectual fluidity as Collin Powell .
Then there is Reverend Jeremiah Wright who almost single - handedly sank Obama ’s hopes .
His sermons after 9/11 when he railed against America , which essentially said that America got what it deserved .
“ God bless America , ” he said .
“ No , God damn America . ” Suddenly Hillary saw a glimmer of hope ; maybe she stood a chance after all .
Instead of addressing the crisis in a typical politician ’s manner – managing and spinning the crisis , he did the opposite .
He decided to tackle the issue of race in the United States head on and spoke to Americans as if they were adults in his great speech , what I believe to be his greatest speech , “ A more perfect union . ”
He survived that because he spoke about race in a way that had never been done before ; he addressed white fears and black fears all at once .
Then there was Hillary Clinton .
People forget how tough Obama is .
They look at him and see the nice guy with an easy flashy smile ; the ladies see a guy they ’d introduce to their mothers .
Obama is one tough SOB .
This is the guy that defeated the most powerful political machine in American history .
Hillary Clinton .
I ’m sorry , that should be a plural : the Clintons .
It is a miracle that he has gone this far .
He is a black man , with a father from Africa .
He has a Muslim middle name .
His surname rhymes with Osama .
His preacher almost sank his presidential aspirations .
He ca n’t show emotion , because if he does then he will be seen as the typical , angry black man .
He has little experience .
He did n’t just run against one Clinton , he ran against two , and one a popular former president .
The Republicans paint him as one who palls around with terrorists .
The list is endless .
Barack Obama has destiny written all over him .
He is one of those rare individuals whose mark of destiny is hard to miss .
He knows it .
We know it .
He knows we know it .
But we should not mark him as a great man yet .
Because destiny must be fulfilled , for before it is , it is mere potential .
And potential is nothing without results .
Because of his self - awareness , he is humble enough to poke fun at the Messianic expectations that have been set on him .
Just two weeks ago at the Al Smith dinner ( he was the first Catholic to run for the presidency of the United States ) where both candidates were invited to poke fun at one another , Obama said of himself , “ Contrary to the rumours you may have heard , I was not born in a manger .
I was actually born on Krypton , sent here by my father Jo Ell to save the planet earth . ”
There was much laughter after this .
What a breath of fresh air he will be , God willing .

The more people you know , the more chances for a friend to come through with a lucky break .
In one study , Richard Wiseman , professor of psychology and author of The Luck Factor , showed participants a list of last names and asked them if they were on a first - name basis with at least one person with each name .
Of the subjects who considered themselves lucky , half were able to tick off eight or more names .
Only a quarter of the participants in the unlucky group could .
“ Lucky people talk to lots of people , attract people to them , and keep in touch , ” Wiseman told Health.com .
“ These habits result in a ‘ network of luck , ’ creating the potential for fortuitous connections .

HARTFORD , Conn .
– A Connecticut judge dismissed a lawsuit Monday that alleged election fraud and questioned whether Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama was qualified to appear on the ballot for Election Day .
State Supreme Court Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers dismissed the case after hearing testimony from the state and a Greenwich man who bought the action .
The plaintiff , Cort Wrotnowski , challenged the authenticity of Obama ’s birth certificate .
The lawsuit is similar to at least seven others filed in state courts across the country that cite a lack of evidence that Obama was n’t born in the U.S .
Officials in Hawaii have said there ’s no doubt the Democratic presidential candidate was born there .
Wrotnowski , who runs a health food store and is a registered Republican , represented himself in the hearing at Hartford Superior Court .
He said Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz has the obligation to ensure that Obama is qualified to appear on the ballot .
“ It ’s a fundamental point , which is this document has not been produced , ” he said after the hearing .
“ I ’m not the first , not the last , just among a growing number of people across the country who ’ve become distressed about the lack of disclosure . ”
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal argued on behalf of Bysiewicz and the state .
“ I ’m delighted that the court has soundly and quickly rejected a baseless , bogus claim that ’s apparently part of a nationwide effort to confuse or derail the election , ” he said .
Obama leads Republican John McCain in Connecticut and in many national polls .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
October was another awful month for jobs .
Two key employment reports released Wednesday showed the largest number of planned job cuts in nearly five years , with private sector jobs falling by the largest amount in nearly seven years .
Job cut announcements by U.S. employers soared to 112,884 in October , up 19 % from September 's 95,094 cuts , according to outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc .
That was the highest number of pink slips handed out since January 2004 .
Layoffs last month were up 79 % from October 2007 , when 63,114 job cuts were announced .
Separately , payroll manager ADP said Wednesday that the private sector lost a seasonally adjusted 157,000 jobs last month - more than six times September 's decrease and the largest drop since December 2001 .
The dour reports were ominous signs for the jobs market ahead of the Department of Labor 's monthly unemployment report on Friday .
That report is expected to show that 200,000 jobs were lost in October and that the unemployment rate grew to 6.3 % from 6.1 % a month earlier .
" The economy has taken a marked turn for the worse , so it 's hard to envision a scenario where we do n't see steep job losses in the next few months , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" In the best - case scenario , jobs will stabilize by the middle of 2009 . "
October 's numbers bring the total number of planned job cuts to 875,974 in 2008 , 14 % higher than all of 2007 and the largest 10 - month total since 2003 .
The embattled financial and automaking industries were hit the hardest , as they have been all year .
The struggling industries have seen a combined 239,760 layoffs so far this year , representing 27 % of all layoffs in 2008 .
With a Wall Street credit crisis leading the economy into a likely recession , 17,949 financial sector jobs were lost in October .
The automotive industry cut 15,692 jobs last month .
Low consumer confidence and high gas prices during the spring and summer have led to historically low sales of automobiles around the globe , especially for trucks and SUVs .
On Monday , the Institute for Supply Management 's manufacturing index fell to its lowest reading since October 2001 .
Tuesday , auto sales tracker Autodata reported that the seasonally - adjusted annual auto sales rate plunged to its worst reading since February 1983 .
" The weakness in this week 's manufacturing and auto sales reports was amazing , " said Baker .
" That could push Friday 's unemployment number as high as 250,000 [ lost jobs ] . "
Of the 25 industry categories that the Challenger report tracks , 18 reported higher job cuts in October .
The manufacturing , consumer products , pharmaceutical , food and electronics industries all reported that October yielded the highest level of job cuts so far in 2008 .
" The fact that nearly three out of four industry categories are cutting more jobs is proof of how widely the impact of this downturn has spread , " said John Challenger , chief executive of Challenger , in a statement .
" Even if the economy begins to rebound in the spring or summer , it could be months before we start to see net gains in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate . "
Private sector jobs tumble
The ADP report showed that private sector jobs fell by the largest number in nearly seven years , dragged down by the weak manufacturing and goods - producing sectors .
The decline of 157,000 jobs was worse than the consensus view of economists , surveyed by Briefing.com , who had expected a loss of 100,000 jobs .
Unemployment has been trending higher since January , and ADP reported the lowest total nonfarm private payroll level since October 2007 .
The company said it does not expect job losses to let up anytime soon .
" It would not surprise me at all to see many more declines in employment in the near - future , " said ADP spokesman Joel Prakken in a conference call with reporters .
Prakken said he did n't anticipate a turnaround for these numbers until the second half of next year , and added that it was " highly likely " that unemployment numbers will be in excess of 200,000 job losses per month for the next several months .
Last month 's decline was led by a drop of 126,000 goods - producing jobs , 85,000 fewer manufacturing jobs and 45,000 fewer construction jobs .
Service sector jobs declined by 31,000 , the first reported drop in the traditionally strong industry since November 2002 .
Companies with 500 or more workers shed 41,000 jobs in October , and companies with between 50 and 499 employees reported a net loss of 91,000 jobs .
Businesses with fewer than 50 employees lost 25,000 positions , marking the first reported decline in small business employment since November 2002 .
The data used in the ADP National Employment Report was taken from ADP payroll data which averaged 500,000 payrolls for 24 million U.S. employees .

A Nigerian religious leader with 86 wives has accepted an Islamic decree ordering him to divorce all but four of them , local authorities say .
A spokesman for the emir of Bida told the BBC that Mohammadu Bello Abubakar , 84 , agreed on Saturday to comply with the decree .
Last week one of Nigeria 's top Islamic bodies , the Jamatu Nasril Islam , sentenced him to death .
The sentence was lifted but he was threatened with eviction from his home .
Earlier , Mr Abubakar had challenged Islamic scholars , saying there was no punishment stated in the Koran for having more than four wives .
" I have not contravened any established law that would warrant my being banished from the land ...
There is no law that says one must not marry more than four wives , " the AFP news agency reported him as saying .
Many of the wives live three to a room , some have seven children
" All my wives are with children and some of these are people I have married and stayed with for over 30 years .
How can they expect me to leave them within two days ? " he reportedly told local newspapers .
The former teacher and Islamic preacher lives in Niger State with his wives and at least 170 children .
Niger is one of the Muslim majority states to have reintroduced Sharia punishments since 2000 .
Several people have been sentenced to death for adultery by Sharia courts but none of these sentences have been carried out .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The Republican Party 's image has gone from bad to worse over the past month , as only 34 % of Americans in a Nov. 13 - 16 Gallup
Poll say they have a favorable view of the party , down from 40 % in mid-October .
The 61 % now holding an unfavorable view of the GOP is the highest Gallup has recorded for that party since the measure was established in 1992 .
By contrast , the public 's views of the Democratic Party remain as positive after the election as they were just prior to it .
More than half of Americans , 55 % , currently hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party and only 39 % an unfavorable view , highly typical of views toward the Democrats all year .
The Republican Party 's image deficit began well before 2008 .
In December 2005 , the Republicans and the Democrats were rated about equally , with just under half of Americans viewing each party favorably .
Shortly thereafter , the Republicans ' favorable rating fell to 36 % , and has since struggled to cross the 40 % threshold .
The Democrats ' favorable rating gradually improved during 2006 , and has not fallen below 51 % since the spring of that year .
The Republican Party is notably less well reviewed by members of its own party than the Democratic Party is by its own : 78 % of Republicans have a favorable view of the GOP , versus 91 % of Democrats viewing their own party favorably .
Fewer political independents rate the Republican Party ( 32 % ) than rate the Democratic Party ( 47 % ) favorably .
Where to Go From Here ?
The Republican Party heads into the New Year with its brand tattered by the election after decisive losses in the 2008 presidential and congressional races .
Such a defeat inevitably leads to introspection in party circles about its message going forward .
Gallup addressed this issue in the recent poll with a question asking , " Over the next few years , would you like to see the Republican Party and its candidates move in a more conservative direction , a less conservative direction , or stay about the same ? "
Most rank - and - file Republicans ( 59 % ) want to see the party move in a more conservative direction and another 28 % want it to remain about the same .
Only 12 % would prefer to see the Republican Party become less conservative .
Neither party can win the presidency or majority power in Congress without attracting substantial support from political independents .
But right now , independents are not offering any clear guidance about what they want from Republicans .
About a third say the party should become more conservative , an equal percentage say it should become less conservative , and just under one - quarter say it should stay the same .
Democrats -- whose views about the Republican Party are far less relevant to its future -- are most likely to favor its moving in a less conservative direction .
Bottom Line
The Democratic Party is enjoying an extended stretch of popularity with Americans that started in 2006 , and is likely to continue as long as its new party leader , President - elect Barack Obama , continues to inspire high confidence ratings -- and eventually job approval ratings -- from the American people .
After suffering major blows in the election , the Republican Party is experiencing its worst image rating in at least a decade ( similar to the public relations hit it took after the Republican - controlled House of Representatives impeached Bill Clinton in December 1998 ) .
Previous Gallup analysis linked the party 's decline to the downward track of President George W. Bush 's job approval ratings in 2005 and 2006 .
However , the latest drop in the Republican Party 's favorable rating , from 40 % to 34 % ( with much of that drop coming from Republicans ) , is not associated with a corresponding decline in Bush 's job approval score ; rather , it most likely reflects Americans ' reaction to the Republicans ' big losses on Election Day .
With Bush no longer around to symbolize the Republican Party , the GOP will soon have an opportunity to redefine itself .
The initial guidance from rank - and - file Republicans is to tack to the right -- returning to core Republican principles , as many Republican thought leaders are currently advocating .
However , with only about a third of independents wanting the party to be more conservative , it is unclear how much that approach might help to expand the Republican base .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,009 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Nov. 13 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Wild mustangs , those quintessential symbols of the American West for hundreds of years , are facing their most deadly predator yet : the pen-pushing civil servants of the US Bureau of Land Management .
Growing pressure on the horses ' traditional habitat has left officials contemplating a programme of mass slaughter to reduce the number of mustangs held captive in government - run pens .
More than 33,000 of the animals , almost as many as the number still in the wild , have been rounded up and taken off increasingly barren public land in recent years , to reduce pressure on grazing required by the cattle - ranching industry .
But the increasing cost of keeping them fed and watered has left the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) contemplating a programme of what it calls " euthanasia " – sending healthy horses to slaughterhouses where they are likely to be turned into steak for export to France .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The proposal sparked outrage from conservationists when it was outlined in a recent Government Accountability Office report , with welfare groups accusing the BLM of holding an unnecessarily high number of mustangs in captivity in order to appease the politically powerful ranching lobby .
" They say there are too many horses left on the range , and that they need to gather them all the time , " said Jerry Reynoldson of the Wild Horse Adoption Association .
" But there are only 30,000 left in the wild , and they 're spread over 10 states .
In Nevada alone , the BLM controls 47 million acres .
But the ranchers control economic forces and pay lobbyists in Washington , so they give the horses short shrift and convince the authorities that they need to be taken off the land . "
Campaigners say slaughter would mark an ignominious end for a creature that arrived in North America with the Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century , and which once existed in such numbers that maps of Texas from the 1700s marked many areas as simply : " vast herds of wild horses " .
Deanne Stillman , author of a new book , Mustang : The Saga of the Wild Horse in the American West , said : " Horses blazed our trails , they fought our wars , they are the greatest icons of freedom .
The word ' euthanasia ' suggests that the BLM will be putting these horses out of their misery .
But they are not in misery in the first place .
It 's the most cynical thing I 've ever heard . "
Today , 33,100 mustangs are left in the wild , roaming in 199 herds .
Because the animals have few natural predators left and do not provide sport for hunters , government officials say a quota must be taken into captivity each year .
Some of the captive horses are adopted by members of the public , but supply has outstripped demand in recent years , and the BLM says drastic action is needed to reduce the number in captivity , which cost $ 21 m ( £ 14 m ) a year to feed .
" We do n't want to do euthanasia , but we are up against the wall on our budget , " a spokesman told USA Today .
The only hope for many horses may lie with Madeleine Pickens , wife of the Texan oil billionaire T Boone Pickens , who recently announced that she was trying to establish a million - acre refuge where all captive mustangs can be released .
Her plan will see private land turned into a rural theme park where Americans can interact with the mustangs .
Its announcement persuaded the BLM to grant captive horses a stay of execution until the New Year .
" We will take all the excess horses , " Mrs Pickens explained , " and put them somewhere where families can see them and live among them , and camp out in teepees and have bonfires and look up at the stars and get to know this incredible aspect of our heritage . "
MIAMI 
The strange tale of Joe the Plumber unfolded a bit more on the campaign trail Friday when Senator John McCain used a rally here to defend the Ohio man he made a national star of by focusing on him in Wednesday night ’s presidential debate .
The man , Joe Wurzelbacher , gained fame after he met Senator Barack Obama recently and expressed concerns that Mr. Obama ’s tax plans would hurt him if he ever became wealthy enough to buy his own plumbing business .
Mr. McCain seized on the encounter at the debate to highlight the fact that Mr. Obama ’s tax plan  which would cut taxes on 95 percent of Americans  would raise the taxes on small businesses .
The Obama campaign countered that Mr. Wurzelbacher in fact stood to get a bigger cut under their plan .
But under the glare of the ensuing media spotlight , reporters found that Mr. Wurzelbacher did not actually have a plumbing license , and that he actually owed some back taxes .
Mr. McCain leapt to his defense here Friday in a rally at Florida International University  and made another leap by suggesting that the Obama campaign was somehow maligning the plumber whose vote Mr. Obama has sought at a campaign stop in Ohio .
“ The response from Senator Obama and his campaign yesterday was to attack Joe , ” Mr. McCain said .
“ People are digging through his personal life , and he has TV crews camped out in front of his house .
He did n’t ask for Senator Obama to come to his house .
He was n’t recruited or prompted by our campaign .
He just asked a question .
And Americans ought to be able to ask Senator Obama tough questions without being smeared and targeted with political attacks . ”

The New York Times is writing A ‘ Moral Hazard ’ for a Housing Bailout : Sorting the Victims From Those Who Volunteered .
Over the last two decades , few industries have lobbied more ferociously or effectively than banks to get the government out of its business and to obtain freer rein for “ financial innovation . ”
But as losses from bad mortgages and mortgage - backed securities climb past $ 200 billion , talk among banking executives for an epic government rescue plan is suddenly coming into fashion .
A confidential proposal that Bank of America circulated to members of Congress this month provides a stunning glimpse of how quickly the industry has reversed its laissez - faire disdain for second - guessing by the government — now that it is in trouble .
My Comment
The proposal warns that up to $ 739 billion in mortgages are at “ moderate to high risk ” of defaulting over the next five years and that millions of families could lose their homes .
To prevent that , Bank of America suggested creating a Federal Homeowner Preservation Corporation that would buy up billions of dollars in troubled mortgages at a deep discount , forgive debt above the current market value of the homes and use federal loan guarantees to refinance the borrowers at lower rates .
My Comment
“ We believe that any intervention by the federal government will be acceptable only if it is not perceived as a bailout of the bond market , ” the financial institution noted .
In practice , taxpayers would almost certainly view such a move as a bailout .
If lawmakers and the Bush administration agreed to this step , it could be on a scale similar to the government ’s $ 200 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry in the 1990s .
My Comment
The arguments against a bailout are powerful .
It would mostly benefit banks and Wall Street firms that earned huge fees by packaging trillions of dollars in risky mortgages , often without documenting the incomes of borrowers and often turning a blind eye to clear fraud by borrowers or mortgage brokers .
A rescue would also create a “ moral hazard , ” many experts contend , by encouraging banks and home buyers to take outsize risks in the future , in the expectation of another government bailout if things go wrong again .
My Comment
If the government pays too much for the mortgages or the market declines even more than it has already , Washington — read , taxpayers — could be stuck with hundreds of billions of dollars in defaulted loans .
My Comment
But a growing number of policy makers and community advocacy activists argue that a government rescue may nonetheless be the most sensible way to avoid a broader disruption of the entire economy .
The House Financial Services Committee is working on various options , including a government buyout .
The Bush administration may be softening its hostility to a rescue as well .
Top officials at the Treasury Department are hoping to meet with industry executives next week to discuss options , according to two executives .
“ There are a lot of ideas out there , ” said Scott Stanzel , a spokesman for President Bush , when asked at a White House press briefing on Friday about a possible buyout program .
“ There are many different ways in which we can address this problem and we continue to look at ways in which we can do that . ”
My Comment
Supporters contend that a government rescue could be the fastest and cleanest way to force banks and investors to book their losses from bad mortgages — a painful but essential first step toward stabilizing the housing market .
My comment
The government would buy the mortgages at their true current value , perhaps through an auction , at what would probably be a big discount from the original loan amount .
The mortgage lenders , or the investors who bought mortgage - backed securities , would be free of the bad loans but would still have to book their losses .
My Comment
If the government took control of the bad mortgages , supporters of a rescue contend , it could restructure the loans on terms that borrowers could meet , keep most of them from losing their homes and avoid an even more catastrophic plunge in housing prices .
My Comment
“ Every citizen has a dog in this hunt , ” said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , a community advocacy group that has developed its own mortgage buyout plan .
“ The cost of spending our way out of a recession is something that everybody would have to bear for a very long time . ”
Mr. Taylor estimated the government might end up buying $ 80 billion to $ 100 billion in mortgages .
But he said the government could recoup its money if it was able to buy the mortgages at a proper discount , repackage them and sell them on the open market .
My Comment
Surprisingly , the normally free - market Bush administration has expressed interest .
Treasury officials confirmed that several senior officials invited Mr. Taylor to present his ideas to them on Feb. 15 . Mr. Taylor said he had also received calls from officials at the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , which is part of the Treasury Department .
My Comment
But even supporters acknowledge that a government rescue poses risks to taxpayers , who could be left holding a very expensive bag .
Ellen Seidman , a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and now a senior fellow at the moderate - to - liberal New America Foundation , said the government ’s first challenge is to buy mortgages at their true current value .
If the government overpaid or became caught by an even further decline in the market value of its mortgages , taxpayers would indeed be bailing out both the industry and imprudent home buyers .
My Comment
“ It ’s not easy , but it ’s not impossible , ” Ms. Seidman said .
“ There are various auction mechanisms , both inside and outside government . ”
My Comment
A second challenge would be to start a program quickly enough to prevent the housing and credit markets from spiraling further downward .
Industry executives and policy analysts said it would take too long to create an entirely new agency , as Bank of America suggested .
But they expressed hope that the government could begin a program from inside an existing agency .
My Comment
But even if the government did buy up millions of mortgages and force mortgage holders to take losses , the biggest problem could still lie ahead : deciding which struggling homeowners should receive breaks on their mortgages .
My Comment
Administration officials have long insisted that they do not want to rescue speculators who took out no -money - down loans to buy and flip condominiums in Miami or Phoenix .
And even Democrats like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , have said the government should not help those who borrowed more than they could ever hope to repay .
My Comment
But identifying innocent victims has already proved complicated .
The Bush administration ’s Hope Now program offers to freeze interest rates for certain borrowers whose subprime mortgages were about to jump to much higher rates .
But the eligibility rules are so narrow that some analysts estimate only 3 percent of subprime borrowers will benefit .
My Comment
Bank executives , meanwhile , warn that the mortgage mess is much broader than people with subprime loans .
Problems are mounting almost as rapidly in so - called Alt - A mortgages , made to people with good credit scores who did not document their incomes and borrowed far more than normal underwriting standards would allow .
My Comment
Borrowers who overstated their incomes are not likely to get much sympathy .
But industry executives and consumer advocates warn that foreclosed homes push down prices in surrounding neighborhoods , and a wave of foreclosures could lead to another , deeper plunge in home prices .
My Comment
Right or wrong , the arguments for rescuing homeowners are likely to be blurred with arguments for rescuing home prices .
At that point , industry executives are likely to argue that what is good for Bank of America is good for the rest of America .

An endangered bird of prey reintroduced to Northern Ireland after a 200 - year absence has been found shot dead , it emerged yesterday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The body of the red kite was discovered in a field near Castlewellan in Co Down , the police confirmed .
The bird was one of 27 kites released by the RSPB in the region in July at the start of a three - year reintroduction programme .
Wing tags and an identifying leg ring had been removed from the four - month old bird before it was recovered by the RSPB .
Dr Mark Avery , the RSPB ’s director of conservation , said : “ We are shocked and angered by the senseless killing of one of the recently released red kites .
“ These magnificent birds were neither a threat to humans nor livestock , so we can only assume that whoever did this was either ignorant or gets a perverse sense of enjoyment from killing birds of prey .
“ We believe that there will be much anger not only in Northern Ireland but right across the UK .
“ Red kites are a globally threatened species and their reintroduction became a celebration of the return of an iconic species to Northern Ireland . ”
Red kites were hunted to extinction in Ireland over 200 years ago .
Dr Avery added : “ RSPB Northern Ireland had been working tremendously hard behind the scenes for a number of years to get the Red Kite Reintroduction Project off the ground , and we are determined to see it succeed .
“ The message needs to be sent out that these birds should be a treasured addition to our countryside and not a target for illegal shooting . ”
Primary school pupils were to have been offered the chance to track the life of the bird through the RSPB ’s Adopt A Kite initiative .
PSNI Constable Alex Beck said : “ Wildlife crime is taken seriously by the PSNI , and its significance cannot be underestimated .
“ Red Kites , like all wild birds , are protected by law under the Wildlife ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1985 .
As such , any person involved in this type of crime could find themselves subject to a report to the Public Prosecution Service . ”

The leading cause of infant death in developed countries , sudden infant death syndrome , is still largely a medical mystery .
Past studies have revealed that in the brain stems of more than half of infants who die from SIDS , the neurons that produce serotonin — a chemical responsible for regulating heart rate , body temperature and mood — are overly prevalent and abnormally shaped .
Until now , no one has known how these problems might cause death , but a July 4 Science study reveals clues about what might be going wrong in SIDS and how doctors might prevent it .
Mood researchers at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Monterotondo , Italy , were investigating how serotonin levels affected anxiety - related behavior in mice when they got a surprise .
They bred the mice to have too many 5 - HT 1A receptors , which are known to signal neurons to slow down the release of serotonin when the chemical is abundant in the brain .
Having more receptors ultimately lowers serotonin levels and overall serotonin activity .
The team was startled to find that nearly three quarters of the mice died before they turned four months old , typically after suffering sudden drops in heart rate and body temperature so drastic that the complications killed the animals .
Although the researchers do not yet know what prompts these crises , co-author Cornelius Gross speculates that they occur when serotonin activity cannot ramp up properly .
For instance , serotonin systems are turned off during rapid - eye - movement ( REM ) sleep , so waking is typically accompanied by a rapid increase in serotonin activity .
In the mice , Gross explains , the compromised 5 - HT 1A feedback loop may prevent serotonin neurons from firing when they should , disrupting nervous system function .
If Gross is right , the unexpected findings reveal how a seemingly simple alteration in the serotonin system can lead to infant death .
Although SIDS babies have normal 5 - HT 1A receptors , one of their many other serotonin feedback mechanisms may be malfunctioning in a similar way .
If so , the key to preventing SIDS could one day be as simple as finding a way to regulate abnormal serotonin feedback .

Even before Barack Obama was elected president Tuesday , he had already changed one life - right here in San Francisco .
Seventeen - year - old James Kessler , a junior at Stuart Hall High School , is battling a rare and deadly sarcoma form of cancer .
He had only one wish : to meet Obama in Chicago on election night .
The Make - A - Wish Foundation contacted The Chronicle , which forwarded James ' request to the Obama campaign .
Not only did campaign officials say " yes " - they did him one better .
They phoned James ' mom on Friday to suggest that her son immediately catch a plane to Henderson , Nev. , where Obama was speaking the next day at a local high school .
After the speech , James was invited inside a portable classroom for a private chat with Obama .
" Unbelievable , " said Jean Kessler , who tells us that Obama spoke to her son as if there were nothing else going on - talking about their families , James ' hopes for attending college and more .
Finally , before posing with James and his mom for pictures , Obama reminded the teen " to dream big . "
" And if this goes as we hope , " Obama added , " we need to get you to Washington to my inaugural . "
Then , for James , it was off to Chicago , where he was given a prime spot near the likes of former President Jimmy Carter and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson .
" It was all I had hoped for , " James told his tearful mom .
To the wire :
The fight over same - sex marriage went right down to the wire - with each side taking in close to $ 1 million in the last weekend of the campaign for one final media blitz .
Together , the campaigns both for and against the gay marriage ban collected and spent upward of $ 70 million .
" It was probably the biggest campaign in the country outside of the presidential race , " said Yes on 8 head Frank Schubert .
And one of the most expensive .
But unlike other big - ticket ballot fights over energy , insurance rates or prescription drug sales - where giant corporate interests cut multimillion - dollar checks - the marriage fight was largely financed through individual donors .
" There were so many names on our first report that it crashed the secretary of state 's computer , " Schubert said .
It is estimated that 70,000 people cut checks to support the ban - compared with about 100,000 who gave to fight it .
" We 've never seen anything like it , " said No on 8 's Jeff Kors .
Until next time .
Too hot : San Francisco's KSFO radio bills itself as the home of " Hot Talk " - but it was sister station KGO that may find itself on the hot seat after liberal gay gab host Charles " Karel " Bouley went off with an expletive - charged rant against Joe the Plumber on Saturday night .
The station had just gone to ABC network headline updates - including electioneering sound bites from Barack Obama and John McCain .
When the news referenced Joe the Plumber , Karel - apparently not knowing that his mike was still on - went into an obscenity - laced tirade , culminating with " I want mother - ing Joe the Plumber dead ! "
Karel 's tirade was captured by bloggers and has been making the rounds on the Internet ever since .
We called KGO for comment and hoped to get in touch with Karel as well .
They have yet to call back .
Lunch crowd :
The spirit of Democratic dynamo lawyer Bob McCarthy was alive and well Tuesday as about 250 past , present and future politicos - including U.S. Sen .
Dianne Feinstein - packed San Francisco's California Culinary Academy for the traditional election day luncheon hosted by former police commissioner and restaurateur Angelo Quaranta .
" I have not seen Dianne so engaged in years , " said former San Francisco mayor and Chronicle columnist Willie Brown .
" She was really working the room .
Getting her picture taken with everyone and talking about all the state measures she had been working on . "
Feinstein also made a big point of introducing East Bay Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher as her " very good friend " - leading some to speculate that if Feinstein runs for governor in 2010 , Tauscher would be on the short list to replace her in the U.S. Senate .
Speaking of the governor 's race , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom - who is openly exploring a run for the state 's top office - was a no - show .
He opted , instead , to do a last - minute , applause - filled No on 8 walk along Polk Street .
Attorney General Jerry Brown , who is also running for governor , did show at the party - but stuck to the back of the room , letting Dianne have the day .
And finally : U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxerhad hoped to have her own private party Tuesday night at the Beverly Hilton - away from the commotion over at the Century Plaza , where the Obama campaign and state Democratic Party were holding court .
Alas - just 24 hours before the party was to start - the hotel alerted Boxer 's folks that another party had been booked at the opposite end of the hall .
Boxer 's gala went on , but so much for privacy .
The other party 's host ?
None other than Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger - the man oft - mentioned as taking on Boxer for her Senate seat in two years .

Does anybody out there remember when US Senator Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) spit on Paul Wellstone ’s freshly dug grave and said these words :
“ To be very blunt and God watch over Paul ’s soul , I am a 99 percent improvement over Paul Wellstone , ” Coleman said in a front - page story published in Roll Call .
“ Just about on every issue . “
Well , I seriously doubt that Paul Wellstone had a Sugar Daddy named Nasser Kazeminy .
Kazeminy loves Norm .
Like the GOP loves Governor Palin with $ 4,000 clothing allowances to make her look “ pretty ” ; Kazeminy gives Norm Coleman big shopping sprees to buy him new suits at Neiman Marcus , flies the Coleman Clan to the Bahamas on his private jet and personally leaves little mints on the Colemans ’ pillow every night .
( Please Note : I was going to say that Kazeminy personally lights the Colemans ’ cigarettes immediately after their “ whoopee time ” , but I did n’t want to be too … Ummm “ Obtuse ” .
This is a “ family friendly ” site for God ’s Sakes .. )
Now if you ’re not quite sure what ’s going on with this story , I can help .
Nothing like a little help from a Fruit Fly when everybody else can’t tell you jack - shit .
Nasser Kazeminy is the CEO of mega - corp NJK Holdings in Houston .
According to the Huffington Post , Kazeminy gave $ 1,300 to Norm Coleman in the first Quarter of 2007 , and in the 4th Quarter , $ 10,000 to the Minnesota GOP .
Paul McKim is the CEO of a company called DMT , Deep Marine Technologies .
Kazeminy is the controlling stockholder for DMT and feels it is his duty to give money to the Coleman ’s paltry salary income as a US Senator by forcing McKim to send money to a Minneapolis based insurance company Hays Companies , Lauri Coleman ’s ( US Senator Norm Coleman ’s wife ) employer .
This is where McKim and Kazeminy get all “ testeroni ” with each other and McKim points out that he ’s the CEO of DMT and that leaves Kazeminy out of the decision making process .
Kazeminy thinks that as DMT ’s controlling shareholder , that makes McKim his personal tool - job and threatens to have him fired if he does n’t “ help the poor destitute Coleman Clan ” .
This is where The Nation magazine comes in – They obtained the original lawsuit filed last Monday :
In March 2007 , Kazeminy began ordering the payment of corporate funds to companies and individuals who tendered no goods or services to DMT for the states purpose of trying to financially assist United States Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota .
In March 2007 , Kazeminy telephoned B.J. Thomas , then DMT ’s Chief Financial Officer .
In that conversation , Kazeminy told Mr. Thomas that “ US Senators do n’t make [ expletive deleted ] ” and that he was going to find a way to get money to Coleman and wanted to utilize DMT in the process …
Kazeminy told Mr. McKim that he [ Kazeminy ] would make sure there was paperwork to make it appear as though the payments were made in connection with the legitimate transations , explaining further that Senator Coleman ’s wife , Laurie , worked for the Hays Companies , an insurance broker in Minneapolis , and that the payments could be made to Hays for insurance .
When Mr. McKim made further objections , Kazeminy repeatedly threatened to fire Mr. McKim , telling him “ this is my company ” and that he and Thomas had better follow his orders in paying Hays .
Subsequently , Kazeminy caused Hays to produce a document entitled “ Disclosure of Service Fees ” which purported to legitimize the basis of the payments to be made to Hays by DMT .
According to the lawsuit , Laurie Coleman received three $ 25,000 payments under the alleged “ invoice ” called “ Disclosure of Service Fees ” .
… So , will we soon have another six years of Norm Coleman taking money from other Sugar Daddies until he looks just like Alaska ’s Senator Ted Stevens ?!
Oh …wait , that parallel has already been spotted .
More on that in a minute .
The lawsuit goes on :
Kazeminy informed McKim and Thomas that Hays would funnel the money from DMT to Senator Coleman through the payment of compensation , to his wife , Laurie , and that there was nothing to worry about .
Laurie Coleman never provided any type of services or products to DMT .
Furthermore , at no time has Hays been licensed to broker insurance in the State of Texas .
Read the break - down of the entire lawsuit here , courtesy of the Minnesota Independent .
Harpers Magazine recently wrote that Kazeminy and Coleman are extremely close :
Coleman also has a close relationship with Minnesota businessman Nasser Kazeminy , a big donor to the G.O.P. and to Coleman .
In 2005 , the senator and his daughter jetted down to the Bahamas on a private plane owned by Kazeminy , a trip valued at $ 3,960 .
In 2004 , he and his wife flew to Paris on Kazeminy ’s plane , a $ 2,870 value .
Laurie Coleman is apparently the Little Darling at her work at Hays Companies in Minneapolis .
Meanwhile , the senator ’s own wife , Laurie Coleman , is employed by Minneapolis - based Hays Companies , according to his latest personal financial disclosure form .
The Hays Companies offers clients advice on risk management , commercial insurance , and employee benefits .
The firm ’s executives , their spouses and employees provided Coleman with $ 20,700 in campaign contributions between 2002 and 2006 .
It ’s not clear why a risk management firm would require the services of Laurie Coleman , an aspiring actress and the inventor of the “ Blo & Go , ” a hands - free hair drying device ( “ The whole key to this is the suction , ” she has explained of her product ’s utility . )
Coleman ’s financial disclosure form does n’t list his wife ’s job description or salary .
LeRoy Coleman , the senator ’s spokesman , declined to elaborate ; the firm did not reply to a request for comment .
Nice to see the Coleman ’s have surrounded themselves with people who share in the true “ American Family Values ” crowd !
Kazeminy has been swimming in Minnesota politics for a long while .
An old City Pages article from 2002 discusses Kazeminy ’s involvement with Minnesota Republicans here .
Atypical for Coleman , he filed a Defemation lawsuit against Minnesota ’s DFL Senator Al Franken .
Such lawsuits are considered frivolous by the courts and are routinely thrown out .
But , Norm Coleman files them as a diversion from the subject hoping enough people will feel sorry for him rather than see him as the weasel he really is :
This lawsuit against Franken marks the fourth one Coleman has filed throughout his political career .
Screaming and hollering at Franken has n’t taken grip because there ’s nothing to see .
Coleman decided to withdraw the defamation suit .
Now all of this information is what ’s floating out there in MSM .
Turn the page , Baby and catch up with this :
Yesterday , November 1st , 2008 , a new lawsuit has been filed in Delaware against Coleman ’s Kazeminy !!
A second lawsuit has been filed against Sen. Norm Coleman ’s supporter Nasser Kazeminy , accusing him of using a Texas company to funnel secret cash to the senator ’s wife , Laurie .
The Coleman campaign says both suits are part of an Al Franken - inspired smear campaign designed to destroy his reputation .
The Franken camp says it has nothing to do with the litigation .
This second lawsuit simply adds Paul McKim in an additional suit against Kazeminy :
Both actions allege that Kazeminy told executives at Deep Marine that he wanted to provide financial assistance to the Colemans through an insurance consulting arrangement between Deep Marine and Hays Companies .
But the second suit cites a “ confidential source . ”
The lawsuit alleges “ gross misuse ” of corporate funds at Deep Marine by Kazeminy , who controls a majority share of stock .
The complaint contains a section of allegations related to “ improper payments to Sen. Norman Coleman ’s wife . ”
But in a new wrinkle , Deep Marine ’s former CEO , McKim , is named as a co-defendant with Kazeminy and several other individuals who were in positions of authority at the company .
Instead of blaming Al Franken for this second lawsuit , Coleman ’s campaign manager , Cullen Sheehan blames the Minneapolis Star - Tribune ( of course ! ! )
Coleman ’s Clan whines :
Coleman ’s campaign manager , Cullen Sheehan , said Friday night that the suits are “ baseless and false claims … being used to influence the outcome of the election . ”
Sheehan also said that the Star Tribune , by reporting on the lawsuits , “ is actively participating in the destruction of the reputation of Sen. Coleman and his wife . ”
Nice !
You see , do n’t you ?!
Republicans never take responsibility for their own misdeeds .
It ’s simply not in their DNA !
So , do you still think Norm Coleman has been “ 99 % better than Paul Wellstone ” ?
Hey Brodkorb !
You wanna stop whining about all of this “ Seven - Degress of Separation ” bullshit about Al Franken ?
You ’re going to pull your freaking hair out trying to unravel “ Thirty - Nine Degrees of Separation ” once you ’ve analyzed this second lawsuit !
Actually , watching your tiny head explode while you ’re on Fox News ( again ) trying to defend these disgusting Republicans , might be the fun and entertainment I ’m actually looking forward to !
Stay tuned for more updates on this new Republican debacle .
Together with Ted Stevens ’ ( R - AK ) help , Norm Coleman will give us the filibuster - proof majority in the United States Senate !!
by Fruit F. Fly
Extra Amusement Credit :
Watch Norm Coleman run his ass - off trying to get away from the press .
You just want to yell at him : “ Hey Norm !
What did Al Franken do to get you to spend all of that campaign donated money claiming he had something to do with it !
If he did … Then what was it ? ! ”
Watch Cullen Sheehan , Norm Coleman ’s campaign manager bungle up a press briefing on the topic .
It ’s three and a half minutes of hilarity while Sheehan has his worst Bad - Hair Day ever saying over and over : “ Uhhh … The Senator has reported he has ever received . ”
Laurie Coleman ’s interviewin’ about her “ Blo and Glo ” invention can be heard here .
It ’s hysterical …truly .
About as much fun as countin ’ the number of times Sarah Palin can drop the letter “ G ” from every word ending in “ ing ” .
… Goin ’ strong , do n’t cha know !
News Geeks are giggling at Mark Leon Goldberg ’s latest in the UN Dispatch who ’s ruefully wishing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan fly to Minneapolis and demand Norm Coleman ’s resignation .
The pun is based on GW Bush appointed John Bolton ’s complaint who wished Norm Coleman did to Annan three years ago .
Kofi Annan had to defend himself against Norm Coleman about money laundering schemes that included his own son .
Laurie Coleman becomes the sacrificial lamb in version 2.0 .
Update : I was critiqued ( quite politely ) by another blogger for spelling Kazeminy ’s name incorrectly .
I corrected the errors of my writings and I hope all is well in the world …
Also in the Land of Oz , on the third moon of Endor as well in the micro bacterial terrain on the inside of my boxer shorts .

The Bush administration made a choice in the wake of 9/11 .
The FBI needed to dramatically increase its counterterrorism capabilities .
To do that , it needed agents .
Most of those agents came from FBI priorities now deemed less important – like white - collar crime .
The ramifications , as the Seattle Post – Intelligencer documented in a multi-part series last year , “ The Terrorism Trade - Off , ” were plenty and apparent .
Among them was a dramatic drop in financial crime investigations like fraud and embezzlement cases .
But now that the nation is in the midst of a market crisis , the FBI is scrambling to regain lost ground , the New York Timesreported this weekend .
Since 2001 , the FBI reassigned about one third of the 1,700 agents who had been working white - collar crime cases .
Now the FBI , “ struggling ” to find the resources to respond to the financial crisis , is “ planning to double the number of agents working financial crimes by reassigning several hundred agents amid a mood of national alarm . ”
Even a few months ago , the White House had reiterated the wisdom of shifting agents from the white - collar crime .
When the administration ’s 2009 budget again contained no new funding to boost the number of agents in the FBI ’s crime - fighting squads , a White House official responded to criticism by saying " The assumption that how it was pre-9/11 is how it ought to be for all time is not the correct premise . ”
The Times points to another possible reason for the FBI ’s diminished performance in combating white - collar crime : concern from the administration that the recent high - profile investigations of Enron , WorldCom and others had gone too far .
Several “ former law enforcement officials ” told the paper that “ senior administration officials , particularly at the White House and the Treasury Department , had made clear to them that they were concerned the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were taking an anti-business attitude that could chill corporate risk taking . ”
With the credit market nearly frozen , chilling corporate risk - taking is unlikely still a problem , and politically , the terrorism trade - off appears to no longer be acceptable .
On an almost daily basis , news has leaked that the FBI is investigating one of the major financial institutions at the center of the crisis : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , AIG , Lehman Brothers , Washington Mutual , Countrywide .
At last count , the FBI says it 's investigating 26 national corporations related to the crisis .
It seems the philosophy has been to jump first and scramble for resources later .
When the U.S. Attorney for Seattle announced that his office was investigating WaMu , he was candid about the reasons : “ intense public interest ” in the largest bank collapse in U.S. history .
Last week , assembled at Miami ’s InterContinental Hotel for a meeting of the Republican Governors Association , the governors seemed cheerful .
The G.O.P. had lost only one statehouse on Election Day .
The prospects for a Republican pickup in Virginia in 2009 were decent , and good candidates were plotting runs in states like California , Pennsylvania and Ohio in 2010 .
There was even a sense of liberation in the air .
For the last 14 years , there has been either a Republican Congress or a Republican White House , or sometimes both .
Now the Republican governors are free of those heavy taps on the shoulder from their “ betters ” in Washington .
So for these governors , this seems a moment of opportunity , in which their policies , their examples and their successes can help shape the future of the G.O.P .
The governors will be important .
But there was an almost - never - mentioned elephant in the Versailles Ballroom ( yes , that ’s its name ) full of Republicans : George W. Bush .
For the hard fact is this :
The worst financial crisis in almost 80 years has happened on his watch .
The Bush administration will leave behind probably the most severe recession in at least a quarter - century .
Fairly or unfairly , this will be viewed as George Bush ’s economic meltdown .
If Republicans and conservatives do n’t come to grips with what ’s happened — and ca n’t develop an economic agenda moving forward that seems to incorporate lessons learned from what ’s happened — then they could be back , politically , in 1933 .
Your leader column , published on the eve of Venezuela 's latest elections , gave the false impression that President Hugo Chávez has been undermining democracy with an " autocratic government " and implies that he no longer " uphold [s ] a constitution that guaranteed basic rights " ( Chavismo loses its charisma , November 22 ) .
Around 11 million Venezuelans cast their ballots to elect 22 state governors and hundreds of mayors and municipal representatives , in a record 65 % turnout for such elections .
A clear majority backed the candidates of President Chávez 's United Socialist party , which won 17 of the 22 state governor posts .
The latest figures show that it also won the popular vote , with around 5.4 m votes against the 4.2 m obtained by the main opposition candidates .
Chávez supporters also won 80 % of mayoralties , including the seat of the federal government , and 18 out of 24 state capital cities .
Even though Chávez has a strong democratic record and repeatedly said ahead of the vote that he would respect the electoral outcome , and has done so , you claimed that he threatened to " send tanks on to the streets of those states that end up in the hands of opponents " .
In stating this , you ignored Chávez 's immediate acceptance of his narrow defeat in last year 's constitutional referendum .
By contrast , the opposition attempted a military coup against Chávez in April 2002 .
The basic right of people to participate in Venezuela 's political process has been strengthened since the Chávez government was first elected nearly a decade ago .
Sunday 's vote was the 13th set of elections since Hugo Chávez became president .
Extensive voter registration campaigns have seen a 64 % increase in the number on electoral rolls and thousands of new voting stations established .
Half of all candidates at Sunday 's elections were women , up from only 18 % in 2004 , thanks to new legislation .
Far from Chávez " cowing the media , trade unions and civil society " , civil rights are at the heart of the government .
The media in Venezuela is 85 % privately owned and , as anyone who has been there knows , virulently attacks the government on a daily basis .
Trade union rights are guaranteed constitutionally and the International Labour Organisation this year rejected claims that Venezuela violates union freedoms .
You cite policy areas where you claim the Chávez government has failed .
Venezuela indeed has many problems to resolve after decades of opposition policies left the country without basic infrastructure and a majority in desperate poverty .
But by not giving a similar focus to the enormous social advances that the Chávez government has overseen , you present an imbalanced picture .
Such advances include illiteracy being eradicated , extreme poverty being halved , and two million people being lifted out of poverty .
Child malnutrition has dropped from over 20 % in 1998 to 4 % today .
The minimum wage is now the highest in Latin America .
That is why President Chávez 's government continues to command majority support .
Sunday 's election results prove that your editorial was right in two respects : Venezuela has a " vibrant democracy " ; and the achievements of Chávez 's government " command genuine support " .

Seeks , Receives Judge 's Order to be Returned to Roll After Being Purged in NY ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/5/2008 , 11:05 am PT
Actor Tim Robbins , one of a few who 've been very outspoken about election integrity concerns , was told he was no longer on the rolls yesterday in NYC , at the polling place where he'd voted for " more than a decade " .
A " ruckus " reportedly ensued as Robbins fought to not have to vote on a provisional ballot , and eventually was forced to go see a judge in order to get to cast his vote .
Says Robbins , in the short video below , as he was in the process of getting the needed paperwork to fight to cast his vote in America : " This is what you have to do to vote ...
I had to go down to see a judge ...
My name was not on the roll , and I 'm not the only one .
According to workers , 30 people in 5 hours had been taking off the rolls .
You can do the math on that .
6 per hour , per district across America ... "
P.S. Note from Brad :
Much to get caught up on today --- from the Al Franken mess in MN , questions about the Prop 8 results in CA , about Ted Stevens ' Diebold re-election in AK , MO 's close race for President and much more --- even as I 've got a phalanx of promised media interviews , etc. to get through all day .
Remember , most of the problems from Election Day do n't begin to reveal themselves until the days following the election .
So much catchup to come soon .
My thanks for your patience , and for both Jim Cirile and Des ' work in keeping this joint up to date - ish as I 've been otherwise unable to do much BRAD BLOGGING over the last 24 or so ...
UPDATE 12:20 pm PT : The Nation 's John Nichols notes the " Orwellian twist " , given Robbins ' appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher just over a week ago , urging people to fight for their right to vote not on a provisional ballot if they found themselves purged from the rolls on Election Day ...
“ Refuse provisional ballots .
They ’re throwing those out .
They can throw those out .
If that ’s your last resort , take it , but fight in the polling place to vote .
It ’s your right as an American .
You have every right to vote if you ’re registered .
And if you ’re not on the rolls and something went wrong , document it .
Video cameras at polls are going to be an effective way to fight this Election Day . ”
Appearing on the HBO talk show “ Real Time With Bill Maher ” a few weeks before Tuesday ’s election , actor Tim Robbins urged voters to stand their ground when it came to demanding their right to vote :
In an Orwellian twist on the actual Election Day , Robbins had to take his own advice .
When he showed up at the New York City polling place where the politically - active actor has been voting for more than a decade , he was told that his name was not on the list of registered voters .
So he refused to leave his polling place in Greenwich Village , even after an election worker suggested that the police might have to be called .
Finally informed that he could go downtown to the office of the city ’s Board of Elections , Robbins made the trek , got verification that he was properly registered , got a judge to rule that he would be allowed to vote , and headed back to his polling place to finally vote five hours after his Election Day ordeal began .
Robbins had the time , the resources and the information to make sure his vote would be cast and counted .
He could overcome the hurdles placed in the way of democracy .
But not all Americans were so well - positioned , or so determined , as Robbins .
And that is why Tuesday ’s election cannot be called a success by anyone who takes serious the promise of the American experiment .
Nichols has much more on the disaster that remains our electoral system , and what can and must now be done about it ...
I was reading the Arctic Circle , the comics strip ( left ) provided by the Daily Green , and this reminded me I never wrote about what is referred to as the Pacific Trash Vortex .
Spreading from California to Japan and Hawaii , it is the world ’s largest dump and the biggest sign – with the billion tonnes of CO2 – that we have gone way to far in polluting our planet .
But the Pacific is not the only one : all our oceans are polluted by million tons of plastic .
I collected for today ’s post two articles on that most dreadful fact .
The UK newspaper The Independent wrote a most interesting article on that topic :
A “ plastic soup ” of waste floating in the Pacific Ocean is growing at an alarming rate and now covers an area twice the size of the continental United States , scientists have said .
The vast expanse of debris – in effect the world ’s largest rubbish dump – is held in place by swirling underwater currents .
This drifting “ soup ” stretches from about 500 nautical miles off the Californian coast , across the northern Pacific , past Hawaii and almost as far as Japan .
Charles Moore , an American oceanographer who discovered the “ Great Pacific Garbage Patch ” or “ trash vortex ” , believes that about 100 million tons of flotsam are circulating in the region .
Marcus Eriksen , a research director of the US - based Algalita Marine Research Foundation , which Mr Moore founded , said yesterday : “ The original idea that people had was that it was an island of plastic garbage that you could almost walk on .
It is not quite like that .
It is almost like a plastic soup .
It is endless for an area that is maybe twice the size as continental United States . ” (…)
The “ soup ” is actually two linked areas , either side of the islands of Hawaii , known as the Western and Eastern Pacific Garbage Patches .
About one - fifth of the junk – which includes everything from footballs and kayaks to Lego blocks and carrier bags – is thrown off ships or oil platforms .
The rest comes from land .
(…)
Unless consumers cut back on their use of disposable plastics , the plastic stew would double in size over the next decade .
(…)
According to the UN Environment Programme , plastic debris causes the deaths of more than a million seabirds every year , as well as more than 100,000 marine mammals .
Syringes , cigarette lighters and toothbrushes have been found inside the stomachs of dead seabirds , which mistake them for food .
Plastic is believed to constitute 90 per cent of all rubbish floating in the oceans .
The UN Environment Programme estimated in 2006 that every square mile of ocean contains 46,000 pieces of floating plastic , Dr Eriksen said the slowly rotating mass of rubbish - laden water poses a risk to human health , too .
Hundreds of millions of tiny plastic pellets , or nurdles – the raw materials for the plastic industry – are lost or spilled every year , working their way into the sea . ( …)
“ What goes into the ocean goes into these animals and onto your dinner plate .
It ’s that simple , ” said Dr Eriksen .
This image provided by the Independent gives us a grasp at the size of the phenomenon .
—
An article from TreeHugger also had some serious impact on me :
In the most polluted areas , the plastic - to - plankton ratio is 48 to 1 .
It ’s become part of the oceanic landscape .
Net a piece of plastic , and you ’ll find barnacles and small crabs clinging to it .
Not a good thing for fish , birds , and mammals that mistake it for its natural food , such as eggs , jellyfish , or other sea creatures .
Most of the plastic will eventually photo - degrade into small , dust - like particles to the point that it will be non-detectable to the human eye , but ingestible by sea mammals , birds , and fish — many of which we then consume ourselves .
One thing the captain said to me really hit home .
“ I lived in a world that was pre-plastic , ” he said , turning to face me .
“ I am the last generation to witness a clean ocean , free from plastic .
All succeeding generations will only see an ocean filled with trash . ”
To exemplify this , Marguerite experienced this first - hand during one of her trip to Hawaii .
This is unbelievable .
So much waste , so much pollution …
Yet , some hope remains .
Indeed , we are beginning to mine landfills ( it will be the subject of a future post ) , we may also one day clean up the oceans on a much larger scale than we are currently doing .
Meanwhile , it is time for us all to adopt those great tips provided by Daryl of Verda Vivo .

For many months now I have been saying the CPI was going to go negative and stay there for quite some time .
This was an easy call to make given the plunge in commodity prices in general and gasoline prices specifically .
The effect would be even greater if housing prices were properly reflected in the CPI .
For more on housing in the CPI please see CPI and CS - CPI vs. Fed Funds Rate .
Here is the BLS Consumer Price Index October 2008
On a seasonally adjusted basis , the CPI - U decreased 1.0 percent in October following very little change in September and August .
The large October decline was the largest one month decrease since publication of seasonally adjusted changes began in February 1947 .
Compared to a year ago , the October index was up 3.7 percent .
The energy index fell 8.6 percent in October following declines of 1.9 percent in September and 3.1 percent in August .
Motor fuel prices continued to decline in October , with the gasoline index falling 14.2 percent .
Despite the decline , gasoline prices remain 12.0 percent above their October 2007 level .
The index for household energy items declined 0.9 percent following a 3.4 percent decrease in September .
Petroleum based household fuel prices continued to decline , but the October decreases were moderated by an increase in the electricity index .
The food index increased 0.3 percent in October , a smaller advance than the average monthly increase of 0.7 percent during the June through September period .
Compared with a year earlier , the food index was up 6.3 percent .
The index for all items less food and energy turned down in October , declining 0.1 percent to a level 2.2 percent above October 2007 .
Contributing to the decrease in October were declines of 1.0 percent in the apparel index , 4.8 percent in the airline fare index , 1.6 percent in the index for lodging away from home , and 0.7 percent in the index for new and used motor vehicles .

Current accounting rules allow banks to pretend .
And certainly the Fed is going out of its way to bend the rules to allow new forms of pretending .
Expect to see still more accounting rules that allow broker dealers to pretend .
However , all the pretending and misdirection about the sinking dollar and the price of gold cannot stop the fact that deflation is about contraction of money supply and credit .
The former is not growing and the value of the latter is collapsing no matter how many pretend otherwise .
It 's time to face the facts : Deflation is right here right now .
The mad scramble by some corporations to raise capital , the scramble by others to play " hide and seek " with level 3 assets , and the scramble by virtually
everyone to play swap - o- rama with the Fed supposedly just to prove the process works tells the real story .
The real story is deflation .
We are in deflation now , but few see it because they do not understand what deflation is : a net contraction of money supply and credit .
The only question now is how long deflation lasts , not whether it gets here .
So far , none of the liquidity measures taken by the Central Bankers have worked .
The reason is simple : You Cannot Patch a Busted Dam With Water no matter how hard you try .
Those harping about prices of consumer goods , food , services , etc. , are missing the boat about what deflation is and what one should expect in deflation .
Trillions of dollars of debt are being wiped off the books via bankruptcies and foreclosures while inflationistas worry about the price of eggs going up by 35 cents .
The data are crystal clear .
We are not in a period of inflation , we are not in a period of stagflation , we are not in a period of disinflation .
If you exclude all the options proven to be impossible , the remaining option no matter how unlikely it may seem at first glance , must be the correct answer .
That answer is deflation .
We are in it , and have been for some time .
click on chart for sharper imageThe CPI is still rising year over year , but this may be the last month for it to do so .
Looking ahead year over year comparisons will become increasingly easy to beat , especially in energy and transportation .
And with the drop in food prices at the commodity level some relief in food prices may be coming , possibly with a lag .
Gasoline futures are back at 2004 prices .
Heating oil futures are back at 2005 prices .
Live cattle futures have been in a rising flag pattern since 2003 .
The recent channel break could be a headfake as in 2005 or it could be the real deal .
I suspect the latter given falling grain prices .
Weather and harvest dependent , there is no reason corn prices could n't or even should n't fall back to $ 3.00 or lower .
Looking at food , energy , and transportation , as well as easy year over year comparisons , expect to see increasing talk of deflation in the mainstream media .
They are way late to the ballgame of course , because1 )
Prices are a very lagging measure of monetary policy2 )
Inflation and deflation are about money supply and credit , the latter being more important .
After predicting deflation for several years , on March 17th 2008 I stated it had arrived .
March 17 , 2008 Now Presenting : Deflation !
April 22 , 2008 Deflation
In A Fiat Regime ?
August 10 , 2008 The Future Is Frugality October 10 , 2008 Roubini Discusses the Double D's , Deflation and Depression November 11 , 2008 Industrial Bond Yields Strongly Support Deflation Thesis
The S&P 500 is down about 45 % this year , credit is collapsing , foreclosures are at all time highs , credit card defaults are soaring , unemployment has risen from 4.4 % to 6.5 % , short term treasury yileds have collapsed to 0 % , and the long bond yield has fallen like a brick , yet only in the last couple weeks has anyone in the mainstream media been talking about deflation .
That alone should tell you how silly it is to be focusing on prices as a measure of deflation .
Auto manufacturers , insurance companies , banks , and brokerages are all effectively bankrupt .
Banks have lent out 10 times more than can be paid back , and brokerages are in even worse shape
Those who focused on Peak Credit and its counterpart Peak Earnings saw this coming .
Those blindly looking at prices or money supply alone are still trying to figure out how and why treasury yields are where they are , the stock market has collapsed , commodities have plunged , and banks are scared to death to lend .
Looking ahead , there is every reason to expect increasing foreclosures , rising unemployment , rising bankruptcies , rising defaults , and rising corporate bond yields .
Yet Bernanke cannot cut rates other than symbolically as the Fed Funds Rate is effectively trading at zero .
Welcome to deflation Ben Bernanke .
You , Greenspan , and the Fed caused it with your serially bubble blowing activities .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner has urged Israel not to launch a military strike against Iran ’s nuclear program , an Israeli newspaper reported on Sunday
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Kouchner , in the region for talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders , urged the Jewish state to continue to support Western - backed sanctions and dialogue to press Iran to halt its atomic project , the Haaretz daily said .
“ I know that in Israel , and the Israeli army , there are those who are preparing for a military solution or an attack ” aimed at halting the Iranian program , Kouchner told the paper in an interview .
“ In my opinion that ’s not the solution , ” he said , adding that the possibility of Iran achieving a nuclear weapon was also “ absolutely unacceptable . ”
Kouchner called the risk of an Israeli strike on Iran a “ danger . ”
He said Tehran was aware Israel had said it would not wait until Iran could produce a nuclear bomb .
He said the West should pursue “ talk , talk and more talk , ” including further sanctions to persuade Iran to stop its nuclear program .
Tehran denies seeking to build an atomic bomb , saying it only wants to generate electricity .
“ I do n’t think the alternative is to bomb first , ” Kouchner said .
Kouchner said France believed Iran may be able to produce one atomic weapon within two to four years .
Tehran last month rejected a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding it halt its nuclear enrichment work .
Israel , widely believed to be the Middle East ’s only nuclear power , sees Iran ’s nuclear program as a security threat , citing remarks by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for the Jewish state ’s demise .
The chicken industry has been remarkably effective in breeding efficient egg - layers and plump - breasted broilers , but a new study says that focus has created a chicken population that lacks genetic diversity , leaving the birds more vulnerable to diseases .
The study found that industrial chickens have lost about half of the genetic variations once found in the wild chicken populations , and some have lost 90 percent of those genes .
This means most of the world 's chickens lack characteristics that evolved when they lived in the wild , and may be useful again to help them face stress and disease as livestock .
Scientists want to breed DNA for traits such as disease resistance , or " animal well - being " , back into commercial birds without introducing undesirable traits at the same time [ New Scientist ] .
Researchers say the biggest concern is that if commerical chickens are nearly identical genetically they 'll all be susceptible to the same infectious diseases , and an outbreak of of a ailment like avian flu could devastate the entire industry .
All white egg - laying chickens in the U.S. are derived from the white Leghorn breed , whereas all chickens grown for meat , known as broilers , derive from the British Cornish , or Indian , game breed .
Winnowing the genetic code has allowed farmers to meet the current global demand of 61 metric tons of meat and more than 55 million metric tons of eggs — an increase in production of 436 percent since 1970 [ Scientific American ] .
In the study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [ subscription required ] , lead researcher Bill Muir argues that what 's needed
is an infusion of genetic material from chickens outside the industry , especially those bred by small farmers in the developing world .
The standards of commercial farming wo n't be easy to crack , but it 's necessary .
" This will take much time and effort , " said Muir , " but it 's an insurance policy on the future " [ Wired News ] .
But it will be a hard sell , as introducing breeds of slower - growing chickens would interfere with the fast profits of commercial farming .

Feds say S.F. has more pot clubs than Starbucks , but it might not add up
There are more medical marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco than Starbucks Coffee shops .
Or at least , so claims the Office of National Drug Control Policy in a posting on its official blog , pushingback .com .
Seem a little far - fetched ?
Yep , that 's because it is .
The feds contend there are 98 marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco , compared with 71 Starbucks .
They even provide a Google map of the supposed locations of both .
This allegedly official map has some pot clubs in highly unlikely places , like the top of Nob Hill .
San Francisco's Department of Public Health , which issues permits for medical marijuana dispensaries , is befuddled by the federal data .
" I do n't know how they got that , " Senior Health Inspector Larry Kessler said .
The city agency lists 24 pot clubs in the city .
But the feds are n't backing down .
Officials there say their information includes dispensaries that are unregulated yet easily findable through a Google search .
" This is information that is readily available to any teenager , " said Rafael Lemaitre , a federal drug office spokesman , who called the state 's medical marijuana law " essentially a fraud . "
Yet when asked for their pot club list , Lemaitre provided only 74 entries for marijuana dispensaries - not 98 .
He said some alternative medicine - type spots were removed because the feds are actually unsure if they sell pot .
Not all of the 74 hold up , either .
Six do n't list addresses in San Francisco .
Another is 12 Galaxies , the Mission District nightclub that closed in August .
At least one dispensary is listed twice .
Lemaitre said it 's difficult to get precise data on " the illegal drug business . "
Bottom line :
The feds ' data listed fewer than 71 actual marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco , meaning , yes , there are more Starbucks .
Venti cappuccinos for everyone !
Update : Monday night , the feds changed their blog entry to say there are 71 marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco and 66 Starbucks .
But Starbucks spokeswoman Vivian Doan told The Chronicle that even though the company Web site lists 66 shops in San Francisco , there are actually 71 .
So the feds ' contention still seems like a bit of a pipe dream .

Not even halfway :
The city 's Health Department has proposed about $ 10 million worth of budget cuts to the mayor 's office but it still needs to lop off another $ 17 million this year to help the city make up an expected $ 90 million to $ 125 million budget shortfall .
Health officials have resubmitted a lot of the same cuts they proposed earlier this year - cuts that were eventually restored by the mayor or the Board of Supervisors .
This time around , said Greg Sass , chief financial officer for public health , the mayor and the supes may have no choice but to accept the cuts .
" We do n't really have any brand - new ideas , " Sass said .
" Generally speaking , our ideas should n't come as a surprise . "
A spokesman for the mayor said no final decisions have been made .
Among the programs getting hit hardest : Behavioral health services would lose more than $ 2 million ; nearly $ 1 million would be cut from mental health and substance - abuse outreach programs ; HIV prevention efforts would lose more than $ 1 million ; and security work now performed by the Sheriff 's Department at hospitals and clinics would be outsourced to private companies .

Never mind the street name :
The godfather of San Francisco punk rock , a man known for insulting crowds and performers alike , is likely to soon get his own tribute from city leaders .
Dirk Dirksen , the " pope of punk " who died in 2006 , operated the Mabuhay Gardens club in North Beach for 10 years , where he brought in acts like Devo , the Dead Kennedys and the Ramones .
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote today on whether to rename Rowland Street , which is adjacent to Broadway and Montgomery Street , as Dirk Dirksen Street .
The street is near his old club , also known as " Fab Mab . "
Supervisor Tom Ammiano , who is sponsoring the name change , recalled appearing at the club as a comedian .
Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams also played there .
" There I was performing and I was a little bit nervous .
People were laughing and I heard from the back ' You suck ! '
It was Dirk , and I knew I was in then , " Ammiano said .
Some residents on the small street oppose the change .
They 'd rather the city focus on the ruckus from North Beach revelers that envelops the street on weekends .
Somewhat ironically , it 's the sort of ruckus that likely spilled out from a punk show .
But no matter .
In the conversations over the name change , residents proposed installing a gate at the street entrance and city leaders have expressed interest in doing that .
It 's not very punk , but everybody gets something with no punches thrown .

Charity touchdown :
They wo n't be playing at home again until December , but five San Francisco 49ers will make a different sort of appearance today at the San Francisco Food Bank .
Isaac Bruce , Jason Hill , Donald Strickland , Manny Lawson and Parys Haralson will be on hand to help pack food boxes for low - income seniors .
Since 2004 , the food bank has given out the boxes to nearly half a million people , a total of 15 million pounds of food .
Today they 'll pack the 500,000th box .
The food boxes are part of a USDA program that serves nearly 10,000 people in San Francisco every month .
It nearly was a victim of budget cuts until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped in with a bill last month .
The boxes packed by the 49ers will be passed out Thursday at a senior housing facility .

CHICAGO , Nov 5 ( Reuters ) - Democrats won some big prizes in U.S. state legislative elections , gaining control of chambers in New York , Wisconsin , Ohio , Delaware , and Nevada , a bipartisan group said on Wednesday .
But Republicans also enjoyed victories in Tuesday ’s election , taking both chambers in Tennessee and winning control of the state senate in Montana and Oklahoma .
“ It ’s a bit of a stalemate , ” said Tim Storey , an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures who said the election gave both parties “ something to crow about . ”
Legislative races that could change party control of chambers in Montana , Indiana , Alaska and Texas were too close to call , according to the bipartisan group , which was tracking election results .
Democrats ’ win of the New York Senate , which Republicans have held since 1966 , marks the first time since 1935 that Democrats control both the legislature and the governor ’s office in that state , Storey said .
The state elections will figure into the redistricting process that allows legislatures to redo the borders of congressional districts , giving whichever party is in control the upper hand .
Voters on Tuesday elected 642 state senators who will remain in office when redistricting , based on the 2010 census , begins in 2011 , according to the conference .
Tuesday ’s election decided 79 percent of all legislative seats .
Democrats held the majority at almost 54 percent prior to the vote in which 5,824 legislative seats in 44 states were on the ballot .
Heading into the election , Democrats controlled both chambers in 23 states , while Republicans were the majority party in 14 states .
Legislatures in 12 states were divided between the two parties .
Nebraska ’s single - chamber legislature is nonpartisan .

Scientists in Australia have discovered antibodies in the blood of sharks that could potentially prove effective in battling cancer .
[ social_buttons ]
It has been discovered that the antibodies ( molecules that fight disease ) in sharks are extremely resilient and researchers hope that this quality can be isolated to help slow the spread of cancer , malaria , and other human diseases .
The Australian team discovered that shark antibodies were tough and able to survive in both very acidic and very alkaline settings .
This is important as it means that a “ shark pill ” would still be effective within the very acidic environment of the human stomach .
The team found that the shark molecules can actually latch on to cancer molecules and stop them from spreading .
Associate Prof Mick Foley from Melbourne ’s La Trobe University said : “ The cells actually grow less than where we do n’t add a shark antibody or we add a completely irrelevant shark antibody .
So this indicates the shark antibody that we have is binding to those cancer cells and for some reason causing them to grow more slowly and perhaps even killing them . ”
Sharks were singled out for this study because they are known to have very strong immune systems and do n’t often catch infections .
It is hoped that shark blood will prove effective for other diseases as well , such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis .

The League of Conservation Voters has launched a new campaign to counter Chevron ’s newest greenwashed advertising blitz .
In their new ads , Chevron asks , “ Will You Join Us ? ” and gives examples of the things people can do on a personal level to stop global warming .
They do n’t mention what they as a company have the power to do .
Instead , they ask people to do things like take their golf clubs out of their trunk , replace light bulbs with CFLs , and “ consider ” buying a hybrid .
We all know that Chevron has a unique ability to do much more to stop global warming than simply encouraging others to make personal changes — their business decisions affect everyone on the planet .
Barack Obama said it best : “ We ca n’t solve global warming because I f** * ing changed light bulbs in my house .
It ’s because of something collective . ”

He said that he'd fought to change the restriction over the summer , though he'd been a member for 12 years .
Dawson announced his candidacy Sunday .

En el pasado Debate sobre el Estado de la Región , Esperanza Aguirre anunció la transformación del Canal de Isabel II , empresa responsable del abastecimiento de agua a la Comunidad de Madrid , en una sociedad anónima .
En el pasado Debate sobre el Estado de la Región , la Presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid Esperanza Aguirre anunció la transformación del Canal de Isabel II , empresa responsable del abastecimiento de agua a la Comunidad de Madrid , en una sociedad anónima , así como la venta a particulares del 49 % de las acciones , con el fin de que gestione el ciclo integral del agua en Madrid .
Dicha actuación la justificó en la “ necesidad de obtener fondos para llevar a cabo infraestructuras hidráulicas necesarias para Madrid , como es la construcción de dos nuevos grandes embalses ” .
Dicha justificación resulta a todas luces inaceptable , pues el Canal de Isabel II es una empresa rentable , que da todos los años cuantiosos beneficios económicos a la Comunidad de Madrid , y que en la mayoría de los casos no destina a nuevas infraestructuras hidráulicas , como es el caso de la construcción del Teatro del Canal , cuyo coste se ha situado entorno a los 100 millones de euros .
Por otra parte , Madrid no necesita de la construcción de nuevos embalses , pues con las infraestructuras actualmente existentes tiene capacidad para abastecer a una población de más de nueve millones de habitantes , ni es competencia del Canal de Isabel II ni de la Comunidad de Madrid la construcción de nuevos embalses , pues ésta corresponde al Gobierno Central .
Da la sensación de que la Presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid , en su línea habitual de desprecio a las competencias del Gobierno Central , pretende hacerse cargo de la gestión del agua en Madrid , sin necesidad de proceso de transferencias de ningún tipo , y cedérsela a su vez a una empresa privada .
Como puede suponerse , dicha actuación choca abiertamente con lo establecido en la Ley de Aguas , que establece que las cuencas hidrográficas que afectan a más de una comunidad autónoma las gestiona el Estado ( la cuenca del Tajo , a la que pertenece Madrid , afecta a 5 comunidades autónomas ) , en el caso de Madrid , a través de la Confederación Hidrográfica del Tajo .
También supone un incumplimiento de lo establecido en la Directiva Marco de Aguas , que establece la necesidad de unidad de gestión por cuenca hidrográfica .
La privatización del Canal de Isabel II conlleva graves consecuencias ambientales y sociales , que a continuación pasamos a comentar .
Consecuencias sociales .
Todos los años el Canal de Isabel II obtiene importantes beneficios económicos ( 80 millones de euros en 2007 ) , que van a parar a las arcas públicas , y que por tanto revierten en beneficio del conjunto de los ciudadanos ( al menos teóricamente , pues algunas inversiones realizadas con los fondos del Canal como es la construcción del Teatro del Canal , son más que discutibles ) .
Sin embargo , en el momento que se privatice , los beneficios económicos producidos por el Canal , obtenidos del conjunto de los ciudadanos a través de la factura del agua , irán a parar a los bolsillos de los accionistas de la empresa .
El Canal de Isabel II abastece a los ciudadanos de la Comunidad de Madrid en régimen de monopolio , por lo que , al tratarse además de un servicio de primera necesidad , un empeoramiento de la calidad del mismo , no supondría en ningún momento una alteración del consumo .
Por ello , su privatización hace previsible una importante reducción en la actual plantilla de trabajadores , pues el empeoramiento del servicio que necesariamente conllevaría no produciría reducción del consumo de ningún tipo , por lo que supondría un incremento de los beneficios , al reducirse los gastos , eso sí , a costa de empeorar el servicio de abastecimiento de agua que actualmente reciben los madrileños .
En este sentido , es previsible una reducción sustancial del número de trabajadores hasta alcanzar el mínimo imprescindible para garantizar , aunque sea de forma precaria y deficiente , el suministro de agua a todos los abonados .
Este deterioro en el servicio podría llegar afectar incluso a la calidad sanitaria del agua de suministro .
Actualmente la gestión del abastecimiento de agua potable que realiza el Canal de Isabel II en Madrid , puede considerarse más que aceptable , pues se abastece a los ciudadanos con un agua en general de buena calidad , tanto sanitaria como de sabor , y de hecho es bebida por la gran mayoría de los vecinos de Madrid .
Sin embargo , en otras grandes ciudades de nuestro país , el mal sabor del agua , hace que una gran parte de la población no la beba , consumiendo en su lugar agua mineral embotellada , cuyo coste es varios cientos de veces superior al del agua del grifo .
Un deterioro en la calidad del suministro , como consecuencia de la previsible reducción de plantilla para reducir costes e incrementar beneficios como consecuencia de la privatización , conllevaría que la mayoría de la población dejase de consumir el agua del grifo , y se pasase al agua mineral embotellada , lo que supondría un encarecimiento de la cesta de la compra , que además afectaría a toda la población incluyendo , a las clases más desfavorecidas .
Se estima que una familia de cuatro miembros , que utiliza agua mineral embotellada para beber y cocinar , gasta una media de 75 € mensuales , mientras que ese gasto se reduce a tan sólo 0,30 € , si usa para ello agua del grifo .
Existen algunos varemos sobre la calidad de las aguas que vienen determinados por la normativa vigente , y que las empresas , públicas o privadas , están obligadas a cumplir .
Sin embargo , hay otros que son de carácter más subjetivo , como es el sabor y el olor .
Si una empresa privada que gestiona el abastecimiento urbano , tiene también participación o intereses en una empresa que produzca agua mineral embotellada , podría en un momento dado tener la tentación de empeorar el olor o el sabor , desplazando al consumidor hacia el agua mineral embotellada , con el consiguiente perjuicio para los usuarios .
En este sentido , el hecho de que la gestión del abastecimiento de agua potable quede en manos privadas , podría dar lugar a actuaciones empresariales cuanto menos éticamente dudosas y que perjudicarían al conjunto de los usuarios , sin que estos pudieran hacer nada para evitarlo , dado su carácter de mercado cautivo .
El ejemplo aquí expuesto no es un futurible o simple suposición , pues alguna situación de este tipo o parecida ya se ha dado en España .
El Canal de Isabel II , al tratarse de una empresa con más de 150 años de funcionamiento , es propietaria de amplias superficies de suelo a lo largo de toda la Región , una parte del mismo situado en diferentes puntos del centro de Madrid .
Este suelo alcanzaría un importante valor en el mercado inmobiliario por lo que , si el Canal llegase a privatizarse , es previsible que intentasen sacar a la venta aquellos terrenos del centro de Madrid que actualmente ya no necesitan estrictamente para la realización de la función de abastecimiento .
La construcción de gran número de viviendas en esas zonas del interior de la ciudad , algunas de gran superficie , incrementaría sustancialmente la densidad de población en esos barrios , lo que conllevaría necesariamente una pérdida de calidad de vida para los vecinos de los mismos .
Como podemos apreciar , la privatización del Canal de Isabel II , conllevaría graves consecuencias sociales , de pérdida de ingresos económicos para las arcas públicas , deterioro de la calidad del servicio , sin que los usuarios puedan hacer nada para evitarlo ; y pérdida de puestos de trabajo , entre otros .
Consecuencias medioambientales
La privatización del Canal de Isabel II también produciría importantes daños ambientales .
El agua es un recurso natural limitado y escaso , cuya obtención conlleva necesariamente daños ambientales más o menos importantes , por lo que debe consumirse tan sólo la necesaria , siendo por tanto muy importante la realización de continuas campañas de concienciación ciudadana sobre la necesidad del ahorro .
A lo largo de los años , el Canal de Isabel II ha llevado a cabo numerosas campañas de concienciación ciudadana , cuyo resultado ha sido en general muy satisfactorio , traduciéndose siempre en una reducción del consumo no inferior al 10 % .
Por otra parte , el Canal de Isabel II invirtió durante varios años importantes cantidades de dinero encaminadas a reducir las pérdidas en las redes de distribución .
Como consecuencia de ello , nos encontramos con el consumo de agua por habitante abastecido ha bajado en los últimos 15 años de manera espectacular .
Mientras que en 1991 el consumo de la población abastecida por el Canal fue de 610 Hm3 , en el año 2007 el consumo total fue de 542,15 Hm3 , a pesar de que en 2007 el Canal suministraba a 1.200.000 personas más que en 1991 .
De esta manera , el consumo por habitante se ha reducido en 15 años en más del 30 % .
En el caso de que se privatizase el Canal de Isabel II , es muy posible que dejasen de hacerse las campañas de concienciación , pues la realización de cualquier campaña de fomento del ahorro por parte de una empresa privada de abastecimiento , va directamente en contra de su principal objetivo , ganar dinero , pues cuanto más agua venda más ingresos recibe .
Eso , que es aceptable en el caso de una empresa pública por el interés general , es inconcebible en el marco de la empresa privada , que lo que le interesa es precisamente que se gaste la mayor cantidad de agua posible , lo que conlleva daños ambientales importantes ( construcción de nuevos embalses y conducciones , sobreexplotación de acuíferos , reducción de los caudales ambientales , etc. ) , y también sociales ( reducción de la garantía de suministro en periodos de sequía ) .
Por otro lado , la gestión privada acabaría muy posiblemente con la política de bloques vigente en la tarifa actual ( el precio del m3 se incrementa conforme aumenta el consumo a partir de determinados niveles ) , que tiene como fin favorecer a las personas que consumen agua de forma más racional y penalizar a los grandes consumidores .
En todos los casos en los que se ha producido la privatización del agua , se han llevado a cabo inmediatamente subidas por igual de tarifas , cuando no ha sido incluso mayores para los consumos más bajos , impactando más sobre quién menos tiene y sobre los que menos consumen .
Asimismo , también es previsible una importante merma de las inversiones empleadas en la reducción de las pérdidas en las redes de distribución pues , dado lo barato que le resulta la obtención , especialmente en alta , y potabilización del agua al Canal , hace que la reducción de la mayoría de las pérdidas en las redes de distribución no sea rentable para cualquier empresa privada de abastecimiento , lo que conlleva un incremento progresivo del consumo no achacable a los usuarios , con las mismas consecuencias ambientales ante indicadas .
Además , un alto nivel de pérdidas en las redes de distribución repercute en una peor calidad del agua de abastecimiento , por la succión exterior que se produce en las conducciones cuando se produce un corte temporal en el suministro .
Hace algunos años , el Canal de Isabel II financió importantes actuaciones de carácter puramente medioambiental ( incluso con varios millones de euros ) , como es la restauración ambiental de riberas de los ríos .
Es impensable que acciones de ese tipo vuelvan a repetirse algún día si la entidad llega a privatizarse .
Como ya se indicó anteriormente , la Comunidad de Madrid , además de privatizar el Canal de Isabel II , pretende que dicha sociedad anónima gestione el ciclo integral del agua de Madrid , competencia , que corresponde al Gobierno Central , y pretende inaugurar esa nueva competencia , con la construcción de dos nuevos grandes embalses en la Comunidad de Madrid .
Uno situado en la zona norte , y mientras que el otro se ubicaría al sur de la Región .
La construcción de estos dos embalses , especialmente el situado en la Sierra Norte , producirían un gran impacto medioambiental .
Además , se trata de embalses totalmente inútiles , pues los dos se ubicarían en cauces que apenas cuentan con cuenca de vertido , y además el situado en la Sierra Norte se situaría aguas arriba del embalse de El Atazar , situado en una cuenca como la del Lozoya que se encuentra hiperregulada .
Además , resulta evidente que la Comunidad de Madrid no necesita de la construcción de nuevos embalses para abastecimiento , y así lo ha manifestado en reiteradas ocasiones el Gobierno Central a lo largo de los últimos 15 años , con independencia de que gobernase el Partido Socialista o el Partido Popular , pues con las infraestructuras actualmente existentes , el Canal de Isabel II tiene capacidad para abastecer a una población de más de nueve millones de habitantes .
En definitiva , se trata de embalses que producirían importantes daños medioambientales que son completamente inútiles e innecesarios , y que a los únicos que beneficiarían sería a las empresas constructoras que llevasen a cabo las obras .
Por todo expuesto , podemos concluir que la privatización del Canal de Isabel II conllevarían importantes perjuicios sociales y ambientales , y ningún tipo de beneficio para el interés general .
Por ello , cabe preguntarse cuáles han sido las motivaciones reales que han empujado al Gobierno Regional a promover esa privatización , que desde luego no responde a los intereses del conjunto de los madrileños .
Por todo ello , desde Ecologistas en Acción rechazamos totalmente la privatización del Canal de Isabel II , así como la invasión de competencias de la Comunidad de Madrid en la gestión del ciclo integral del agua que , al tratarse de una cuenca compartida con otras comunidades , le corresponde al Estado , tal y como se establece en la legislación estatal y europea .

Moves to have the body of Mary Queen of Scots returned to Scotland will begin this week .
A member of the Scottish Parliament , Christine Grahame , is to lodge a motion calling for the Catholic monarch 's remains to be returned from Westminster Abbey where she is currently interred .
Mary fled to England after being forced to abdicate in 1567 .
She was held prisoner by her cousin Elizabeth I , found guilty of treason and executed at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire 20 years later .
From its birth in the labs of Tim Berners - Lee back in 1992 , to its interaction with the Napster in 1999 , and its 2004 induction of Wikipedia : the Internet as we know it , has evolved drastically , been around the world literally , and changed the way humans live permanently .
Nothing can replace it , nothing is like it , and it has no alternative .
The internet is like a diamond mine for the people who wish to acquire wealth , a profound lake of information for those who have an insatiable appetite for knowledge base , and an eternal form of entertainment for those wish to amuse themselves .
With the passage of time , people from amongst us have emerged with the craziest of ideas to test and enhance the potential of this God ’s gift to mankind .
And it is due to the efforts of these noble souls , that we have the entire world at the simple tap of our fingers .
In no particular order , Skidzopedia provides you with a list of those people who have influenced the Internet greatly .
Larry Page and Sergey Brin – Google Inc .
Two PhDs from Stanford University started work in the garage of a friend’s .
And they were defiantly not building steam engines !
They were , however , creating the internet ’s most powerful search engine .
Sergey Brin and Larry Page are arguably the world ’s most successful Internet entrepreneurs and developers in history .
This enabled them to earn billions , while assisting everyone from high school students to particle physicists have an easy time searching for information over the internet .
Google was first launched on Stanford ’s website ( google.stanford.edu ) and then finally on Google.com in 1997 .
It is estimated that GOOGLE is worth about a staggering $ 25 billion dollars .
David Filo and Jerry Yang – Yahoo !
Inc .
Yahoo !
too is the creation of two Stanford University ’s Electrical Engineer graduates , called Jerry Yang and David Filo .
Yang started by listing web pages on the Internet and named it “ Jerry ’s Guide to the World Wide Web ” .
Then , he decided to switch it to Yahoo ! and the initial URL was at akebono .
stanford.edu/yahoo
In December 1994 , that particular website had already received over a million hits .
Realizing its potential , David Filo and Jerry Yang got serious and diversified Yahoo ! as a web portal .
David Filo ’s net worth is $ 2.9 billion dollars and Jerry Yang ’s is $ 2.3 billion dollars .
Bill Gates – Microsoft
William Henry “ Bill ” Gates III , is an American business magnate , philanthropist , the world ’s third richest person ( as of February 8 , 2008 ) , and chairman of Microsoft , the software company he founded with Paul Allen .
Gates is one of the best - known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution .
In the later stages of his career , Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors , donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , established in 2000 .
Gates also holds the record of being the Richest Person in the world for 15 consecutive years .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sales at U.S. retailers suffered a record decline in October as fears of recession sapped spending , but part of the drop was due to slumping gasoline prices , which helped buoy consumer confidence this month .
The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales slumped 2.8 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted $ 363.7 billion , the largest decline since the department ’s current methodology was adopted in 1992 , as mounting unemployment hit shoppers ’ appetites .
A separate Reuters / University of Michigan November survey of consumers showed that confidence unexpectedly rebounded from a record October drop as tumbling gas prices offset worries about the economy .
While lower gas prices were welcome , declines in a broad number of retail sales categories showed consumers were still on the defensive .
“ What you are seeing now is the turmoil in the credit and funding markets playing out into the consumer sector , ” said Kevin Flanagan , fixed income strategist , global wealth management at Morgan Stanley in Purchase , New York .
Economists polled by Reuters forecast a 2.0 percent fall in October retail sales as the escalating financial crisis took a toll on consumer .
Retail sales last month were down 4.1 percent from a year ago .
Sales excluding autos fell a record 2.2 percent in October versus a forecast of a 1.2 percent decline .
Lower gasoline prices , as crude oil retreated sharply from a July peak around $ 147 a barrel , helped depress sales at gas stations by a record 12.7 percent in October .
As a result , a closely watched core measure of retail sales excluding autos and gasoline fell 0.5 percent in October .
“ Take out cars and gas , it ’s a drop of half a percent .
It ’s not good , but it ’s not horrific .
This could have been worse ; it ’s encouraging that it was n’t , ” said David Resler , chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York .
The Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its confidence index edged up to 57.9 in November from 57.6 in October .
Despite the rise , sentiment remains at depressed levels , with the index below the lowest levels hit during the depths plumbed during the last two recessions .
“ Lower gas prices and sizable discounts at retailers helped to slightly improve consumers ’ assessments of current economic conditions , while higher unemployment and a deepening recession dimmed their expectations for future gains , ” the Surveys of Consumers said in the report .
“ You might have hoped , say gasoline was way , way down in price , that might free up money to spend on other stuff .
But that did n’t happen , people still spent less on other stuff .
So that ’s not good , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at Global Insight in Lexington , Massachusetts .
Lakshman Achuthan , managing director at the Economic Cycle Research Institute , a New York - based independent forecasting group , put it more bluntly : “ Not only is no economic recovery on the horizon , but the economy is falling off a cliff at its fastest pace in at least six decades .

Individual car makers have reported a collapse in sales since mid-September after auto - loan terms tightened sharply in the aftermath of investment bank Lehman Brothers failure .
The Commerce Department said motor vehicle and parts sales slide 5.5 percent in October after a 4.8 percent September fall .
October ’s performance for the category was the weakest since August 2005 , when car sales were off 10.3 percent .
A separate report from the Labor Department showed U.S. import prices posted the largest monthly drop since 1988 in October as the cost of imported oil weighed for the third consecutive month .
Overall import prices declined 4.7 percent after falling by a revised 3.3 percent in September .
But for the 12 months through October , import prices were still up 6.7 percent .
Petroleum prices tumbled 16.7 percent last month after falling a revised 10.2 percent the previous month .
The Commerce Department data showed that stocks of unsold goods at U.S. businesses unexpectedly fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in September .

Sir Pugsalot with his pal Mount Mastiff .
[ Shaking head ]
You know that Sir Pugsalot is the brains of the outfit , he 's all planning to get a ride on Mount Mastiff to the dog cookie jar and the dinner table for dessert snorfing .
But I bet Mount Mastiff calls the major shots , like where the pair is gonna nap for the day , how much effort to exert in general etc .
Kristin D. , Ruhmember that time we scaled Mount Mastiff !?
Mirror 's Edge is a bit like a platypus ; its component pieces are all familiar , but when assembled , they create something altogether new and wonderful .
It 's played in first person , and has some guns , but certainly is n't a first person shooter .
There 's plenty of jumping and puzzles to solve , but it 's not a platformer .
It has a breakneck pace and time trials , but it 's definitely not a racing game .
It 's all of these and none of them , a bizarre amalgamation of style and speed that will leave you breathless and perhaps even a bit dizzy .
Yes , Mirror 's Edge is many things , but boring sure ain't one of them .
In yet another dystopian future ( seriously , someone make a game where the future is a happy place , please ) , the government has begun sticking its nose into electronic communication so frequently that anyone wanting to keep their messages private uses a messenger called a runner instead .
You play as Faith , one such nimble bag - carrier , who uses her athletic prowess to spring from rooftop to rooftop as she eludes the authorities and generally helps stick it to the man .
She 's content to Fight the Power in her own small way until her policewoman sister is framed for murder by a mysterious conspiracy of someones .
Faith could take on the establishment guns blazing , but she 's not that kind of girl and besides , you 've played that game before .
Instead , you 'll use Faith 's skill as a runner to access areas and information that would be off - limits to the status quo who restrict themselves to street level .
What this means in practical terms is lots of running and jumping from roof to roof , crawling through countless airducts , access corridors , and tunnels , to track your quarry and obtain the info you need to clear your sister 's name .
The police naturally are n't thrilled with your interference , so you spend much of the game running for your life full - tilt as they attempt to gun you down .
You could stand and fight - Faith has a number of sweet combat moves at her disposal - but the wiser move is almost always to turn and run .
Whether you put up your dukes or take to your heels , you 'll have to make split - second decision after split - second decision in order to succeed .
Knock the cop out or shoot him where he stands ?
Run for the ledge or shimmy up the pipe ?
Whatever you 're going to do , do it fast ; stop to take a breath or get your bearings , and you 'll likely end up dead .
This frenetic pace is , ironically , both a huge part of the game 's appeal and its frustration .
The gogogo nature of the levels is a perfect fit with the plot and your character , especially given the game 's first - person view .
You truly begin to feel like a runner , pushing your body to its limits to stay one step ahead of the law .
The world around you blurs as you pick up speed , sounds dies out until all you can hear is the rattling of your own breath .
All that matters is the next jump , the next slide , the next door .
It 's exhilarating , but it does n't leave much room for exploration or planning .
Players that like to check out an environment 's every last nook and cranny will howl in frustration as they 're forced to overlook huge sections of the city in order to make their escapes .
Fortunately , you 're not barreling through a level completely blind .
Most of the Mirror 's Edge scenery is stark and pristine , as though the entire city has been dunked in a bucket of whitewash , but bright and bold swaths of color accent the landscape , including the vibrant red that your " runner vision " uses to nudge you in the right direction .
A bright red door might mark your entry point to the next part of the level , or red pipes will lead you to higher ground .
It 's a beautifully seamless and nonintrusive way of pointing you towards the current goal , but if that 's not quite enough , you can also hit the B button to automatically look in the right direction .
The two systems combined work very well at preventing you from ever feeling lost or confused about where you 're supposed to go .
Apple has a storied history of being the first company to introduce an array of new technologies in its computers , or among the very first , at least .
It all started with color graphics in 1977 ’s Apple II and continuied features such as graphical user interfaces , Firewire , Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , and light - up keyboards–and items such as the buttonless touchpads on its new laptops .
But it ’s just as core to the company ’s character that it ’s often the first company to kill a technology if it appears to be heading for the dustbin of computing history .
Which is causing a bit of a firestorm this week :
The new MacBook has no FireWire port , and some Apple fans are very , very unhappy about that .
In our T - Poll on the topic , 49 % of respondents are pretty ticked off , and 85 % think FireWire still has life in it ; only 10 percent applaud Apple ’s decision .
It looks like Steve Jobs is n’t terribly sympathetic :
He allegedly sent a brief e-mail to an unhappy customer pointing out that USB has been standard equipment on new HD camcorders for several years .
Which is true , but may not pacify folks with camcorders that are FireWire only .
Or who like FireWire ’s speed for external hard drives .
Or who just have trouble giving up technologies that they know and love .
( Side note : Some pundits snipe at Jobs for the fact that his e-mails in response to Apple customers are usually extremely brief .
Me , I ’m impressed that he finds the time to send ’em at all–and what the e-mails lack in diplomacy , they make up for in honesty . )
Like I say , Apple would clearly prefer to move too fast rather than too slowly when it comes to eliminating technologies that may be past their prime .
I do n’t know if anyone from the company has ever explained its rationale , but I presume it stems from a desire to save money ; t remove components and therefore reduce weight and bulk ; and maybe simply to simply remove clutter from the clusters of ports on its computers .
I know of no instances in which feedback from angry customers caused it to reverse its decisions .
Nor of any where most PC manufacturers did n’t eventually follow its lead .
Shall we review the evidence ?
The Floppy Drive
The first most famous thing about Apple ’s original iMac was its radically new industrial design in a world of beige PC boxes .
The second most famous thing ?
It had no floppy - disk drive , which at the time seemed sacrilegious .
( Jobs had tried to kill the floppy before :
His first NeXT workstation dispensed with it in favor of an drive that took $ 100 magneto - optical discs , but a later NeXT machine brought back the floppy drive . )
British computer magazine PC
Pro was part of a chorus of doubters :
The lack of a floppy drive is more of a concern .
Many people use floppies as a cheap way of transporting and safekeeping files .
Apple ’s argument is that the built - in modem and Ethernet adaptor make the floppy disk redundant .
If you want to transfer a file from system to system , you can do that via email or across a network .
That ’s true , but some of us still find a floppy disk more convenient .
If your network falls down or your modem connection fails , it can be the only way of getting a vital document from one system to another , and it ’s not as if a floppy drive would have been an expensive addition .
Aftermath :
This time , Jobs did n’t bend when people demanded their floppy drives back ; eventually , Apple eliminated them from all MAcs .
PC manufacturers were slower to murder the floppy , but murder it they did :
In 2003 , Dell made headlines when it stopped including floppy drives in Dimension desktops as standard equipment .
But “ murder ” might not be the right word considering that Dell still offers floppy drives as a build - to - order option on at least some of its computers , a decade into the iMac era .
Hey , you can still buy a 5.25 ″ floppy drive if you really need it .
SCSI
Once upon a time , Macs had SCSI interfaces and everything from scanners to printers were attached via them .
The iMac had no such port , and while I do n’t know if anyone became violently angry over that , it did cause headaches for folks who tried to connect their old SCSI devices to iMacs via USB - to - SCSI adapters and found it did n’t work very well .
Aftermath : SCSI was always somewhat exotic on PCs , although many flatbed scanners used it in the pre-USB age , and sometimes included an external SCSI card in the box .
It long ago disappeared from the desktop , but lives on in the form of iSCSI , a very popular standard for attaching hard drives to networks in data centers .
Serial Port
The iMac also ditched the RS - 232 RS - 422 serial port .
( On PCs , serial ports were used to connect keyboards and mice ; on Macs , their primary purpose was to connect Macs together and to attach printers . )
Its loss did n’t inspire the passion that the iMac ’s omission of a floppy drive did , but it was noticed and mourned .
From a 1998 thread in the misc.invest.stocks newsgroup :
Since the iMac does not come with a serial port , connecting it to older Macs is in fact a major problem , and something Apple investors should know , as it may limit adoption of the iMac by older Mac users .
In fact , this seems to be the case : a lot of existing Mac users are waiting for USB - to - serial adapters to come out before purchasing the iMac .
Personally , I wish Apple had included at least one traditional serial port with the iMac so people could use existing peripherals such as printers , etc .
But Apple decided to screw the short - term
customer in an effort to force industry adoption of USB , for the benefit of users in the long run .
Aftermath : On PCs , the RS - 232 serial port and its soulmate , the parallel port , were eventually known as “ legacy ” ports –which was a codeword for “ you ’re obsolete but people would squawk if we killed you right now . ”
Today , serial is mostly dead , but not entirely so–here ’s an HP desktop that still has it , for instance .
Apple Desktop Bus
ADB was once the connector Macs used to hook up keyboards and mice ; its disappearance on the PowerBook 150 caused some controversy , but it really began to say its bye - byes when it was missing on the original iMac in 1998 ; by the end of 1999 , it was missing from most Macs .
As far as I know , the Mac community did n’t descend on Cupertino with pitchforks and torches as a result .
But reading up on ADB at Wikipedia , I just learned something I did n’t know :
It was created by Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak in the mid-1980s .
Is it too late to be angry about Apple killing what was possibly the last bit of technology in its products personally invented by Woz ?
Aftermath : Until 2005 , PowerBooks and iBooks still used ADB internally to connect their keyboards and mice , possibly making them the last Apple computers with direct contributions from Woz .
Dial - Up Modem
In 2005 , Apple phased out dial - up modems from Macs .
It did n’t create a firestorm .
But some campers were less than happy over the move .
A gripe from AppleFritter :
I understand that technology must advance , and that in order to advance , certain companies ( like Apple ) must force their hand and just stop selling computers with modems .
I do n’t think that time is now , though .
I think that they should wait until a clear majority of the people of the U.S. have access to broadband .
51 % , that ’s all I ’m asking .
Aftermath : Forty - nine bucks will still get you an external 56 - Kbps Apple modem , proving that there are such things as Mac users who want dial - up .
I ’d love to know how many Apple sells a year , and when it will discontinue the product .
Meanwhile , dial - up is still present on many ( but by no means all ) Windows - based PCs to this day .
FireWire for iPods
Also in 2005 , Apple released the first full - sized iPods without FireWire support–FireWire having been a major selling point for the original iPod back in 2001 , since most other audio players at the time supported only the sluggish USB 1.1. ZDNet ’s Jason D. O’Grady was shocked .
And amazed :
I am simply shocked and amazed that Apple has abandoned FireWire on the just - announced fifth generation iPods with video .
I understand why there ’s no FireWire on the iPod shuffle ( no port ) and even why it ’s off the nano ( tiny form - factor , lower cost ) but why in blazes did Apple leave FireWire off the new video iPod ?
Do n’t believe me ?
Take a close look at the iPod specs page and their Autosync page – there ’s no mention of FireWire anywhere , just USB 2.0 .
Apple has even gone to the trouble of demoting their FireWire Web page from a top level page ( www.apple.com/firewire/) to a page buried on their developer Web site under device drivers ( developer.apple.com/devicedrivers/firewire/index.html ) on or around October 12th , according to Google ’s cache .
Apple invented FireWire as “ one of the fastest peripheral standards ever developed ” and wonEmmy and Grammy awards for the technology ’s impact on the television and music industries .
It ’s inexcusable to leave Fire Wre off an iPod that you ’re supposed to sync videos to , it just does n’t make sense .
Aftermath : iPods have become very popular video devices despite the lack of FireWire–USB 2.0 is fast enough , it would seem .
Meanwhile , I believe iPods still have a tiny bit of FireWire legacy left to them–enough to let them charge if you plug them into a FireWire port via an old FireWire synching cable .
This circuitry is also used by some iPod / iPhone docks and chargers .
But the iPhone 3G eliminated this capability , causing headaches for manufacturers of iPhone accessories and rendering add - ons already owned by 3G buyers obsolete .
I ’m not sure if any technologies or features in current Macs are on Apple ’s hit list , though if I had to predict , I ’d guess that it may be the first company to eliminate DVD drives and argue that high - def downloads ( such as those from , oh , iTunes ) have eliminated the need for optical drives .
Any other thoughts on which features in current Macs may be toast within the next couple of years ?

And speaking of gas , several of you asked about the Auto Industry Bailout .
At first we thought “ How Boring ” but then Harold showed me his credit card bill from Exxon and that got us going …
FROM HELEN :
So the oil companies are once again boasting record profits and yet the auto makers are asking for some government cheese .
Does anyone else see the irony here ?
So I ’ve got a little trickle down theory of my own .
As long as Detroit continues to make cars for the Gas - Capades let the oil companies bail them out .
It ’s a “ robbing Peter to pay Paul ” kind of thing except in this case Peter and Paul seem to be riding the short bus … and it ’s not to save on gas .
Is anyone else as pissed about all of this as I am ?
Eight years ago – 8 YEARS AGO – a brilliant politician who was asking for your vote to become President said this :
“ We can have a next - stage prosperity where you do n’t have to build your lives around a fuel source that is distant , uncertain and easily manipulated .
We will demand and develop new technologies to free ourselves from gas - tank price - gouging , and we will sell those technologies to the world .
We ’ll build a new generation of fuel - efficient vehicles — and then make it easy for families to afford them . “
And that politician , Al Gore , received the majority of votes in the nation and then the Supreme Court told the nation to sit down and shut up .
OK .
Now I am all worked up again .
Republicans – each and every last one of you – need to reach for the nearest gas pump and then promptly stick it so far up your ass that only Sarah Palin ’s “ Pipeline From Jesus ” can find it .
How could you do this to us ?
An idiot .
You put an idiot in charge of things and sat by for EIGHT years while the nation and the world fell apart .
And if that was n’t enough , 58 million of you wanted to replace Laurel with Hardy as the next president .
Sweet Jesus if I could jump through this computer screen and slap the crap out of 58 million of you I would .
Everyday is precious .
EVERYDAY .

Never again .
FROM MARGARET :
Well , now Helen … .
I do see your point but please leave my Lincoln Town Car out of this .
I love my big old town car .
It makes me feel safe to have all that metal around me .
Just the other day , I took a little ride in my nephew ’s half gas half electricity “ car ” .
I promise you I thought I was going to die .
Is that really the future ?
If so , I pass , thank you very much .
You can have the Clown car , I ’ll keep my Town car .
That ’s all I have to say about that .
And there you go again about the Republicans .
The damage is done , dear .
Time to point that shot gun of yours at something new .
There is plenty out there to aim at and plenty to pull the trigger over too .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m just as upset about things as you are .
My anger , however , is more local than global .
Has n’t that always been the way with us ?
Right now I am so angry at the manager of our grocery store .
He moves things .
I have been going down the same aisle for YEARS to get whatever it is that I am running in there to get and now , nothing .
Gone .
He moved it .
And , no , Helen , I ’m not just forgetting where things are .
He has moved them around .
Makes me so gosh darn mad .
Now , I also know what you are thinking , Helen , but this IS important to me .
We ca n’t ALL keep up with the goings - on of our government and all things like that .
I ’ll leave that to you , dear .
But what about the little problems that face most people everyday ?
I think these should be addressed as well .
Even though I think we could probably fill this blog web page with pages and pages , but do n’t worry , I wo n’t .
Oh , and one last thing then I ’m done .
Just so that you all know .
Helen can cuss the shine right off a nun ’s shoulder .
I can ’t .
Never have .
Although I must admit , one of you commenters used the term “ Ass Hat ” the other day .
Made me laugh so .
I kind of like it .
Not sure how to use it , but I do think there are times when such a term would do nicely .
In fact , there is a certain Grocery Manager I have in mind .
Thanks for that .
That ’s it .
I ’m done .
Well thanks for stopping by everyone .
We ’re having fun and hope you are too .
Come back soon .
We mean it .
Really .
The Doomsday Clock conveys how close humanity is to catastrophic destruction –the figurative midnight–and monitors the means humankind could use to obliterate itself .
First and foremost , these include nuclear weapons , but they also encompass climate - changing technologies and new developments in the life sciences that could inflict irrevocable harm .
The Doomsday Clock conveys how close humanity is to catastrophic destruction –the figurative midnight–and monitors the means humankind could use to obliterate itself .
First and foremost , these include nuclear weapons , but they also encompass climate - changing technologies and new developments in the life sciences that could inflict irrevocable harm .
Nuclear
The nuclear age dawned in the 1940s when scientists learned how to release the energy stored within the atom .
Immediately , they thought of two potential uses–an unparalleled weapon and a new energy source .
The United States built the first atomic bombs during World War II , which they used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 .
Within two decades , Britain , the Soviet Union , China , and France had also established nuclear weapon programs .
Since then , Israel , India , Pakistan , and North Korea have built nuclear weapons as well .
For most of the Cold War , overt hostility between the United States and Soviet Union , coupled with their enormous nuclear arsenals , defined the nuclear threat .
The U.S. arsenal peaked at about 30,000 warheads in the mid-1960s and the Soviet arsenal at 40,000 warheads in the 1980s , dwarfing all other nuclear weapon states .
The scenario for nuclear holocaust was simple : Heightened tensions between the two jittery superpowers would lead to an all - out nuclear exchange .
Today , the potential for an accidental or inadvertent nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia remains , with both countries anachronistically maintaining more than 1,000 warheads on high alert , ready to launch within tens of minutes , even though a deliberate attack by Russia or the United States on the other seems improbable .
Unfortunately , however , in a globalized world with porous national borders , rapid communications , and expanded commerce in dual - use technologies , nuclear know - how and materials travel more widely and easily than before–raising the possibility that terrorists could obtain such materials and crudely construct a nuclear device of their own .
The materials necessary to construct a bomb pervade the world–in part due to programs initiated by the United States and Soviet Union to spread civilian nuclear power technology and research reactors during the Cold War .
As a result , according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials , substantial quantities of highly enriched uranium , one of the materials necessary for a bomb , remain in more than 40 non-weapon states .
Save for Antarctica , every continent contains at least one country with civilian highly enriched uranium .
Even with the improvement of nuclear reactor design and international controls provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , proliferation concerns persist , as the components and infrastructure for a civilian nuclear power program can also be used to construct nuclear weapons .
Much of the recent discussions focuses on Iran and its pursuit of a civilian nuclear power capability , but Mohammed ElBaradei , the IAEA director general , estimates that another 20 to 30 countries possess the capabilities , if not the intent , to pursue the bomb .
Meanwhile , the original nuclear weapon states ( in particular , Britain , France , Russia , and the United States ) continue to modernize their nuclear arsenals , with little effort to relinquish these weapons .
All of which leads many to believe that the world is embarking on a second nuclear age .
Climate Change
Fossil - fuel technologies such as coal - burning plants powered the industrial revolution , bringing unparalleled economic prosperity to many parts of the world .
But in the 1950s , scientists began measuring year - to - year changes in the carbon - dioxide concentration in the atmosphere that they could relate to fossil - fuel combustion , and they began to see the implications for Earth ’s temperature and for climate change .
Today , the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years .
These gases warm Earth ’s continents and oceans by acting like a giant blanket that keeps the sun ’s heat from leaving the atmosphere , melting ice and triggering a number of ecological changes that cause an increase in global temperature .
Even if carbon - dioxide emissions were to cease immediately , the extra gases already added to the atmosphere , which linger for centuries , would continue to raise sea level and change other characteristics of the Earth for hundreds of years .
The most authoritative scientific group on the issue , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , suggests that warming on the order of 2 - 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years is a distinct possibility if the industrialized world does n’t curb its carbon dioxide emissions habit .
Effects could include wide - ranging , dramatic changes .
One drastic result : a 3 - to 34 - inch rise in sea level , leading to more coastal erosion , increased flooding during storms , and , in some regions such as the Indus River Delta in Bangladesh and the Mississippi River Delta in the United States , permanent inundation .
This sea - level rise will affect coastal cities ( New York , Miami , Shanghai , London ) the most , compelling major shifts in human settlement patterns .
Inland , the IPCC predicts that another century of temperature increases could place severe stress on forests , alpine regions , and other ecosystems , threaten human health as mosquitoes and other disease - carrying insects and rodents spread lethal viruses and bacteria over larger geographical regions , and harm agricultural efforts by reducing rainfall in many food - producing areas while at the same time increasing flooding in others–any of which could contribute to mass migrations and wars over arable land , water , and other natural resources .
Biosecurity
Advances in genetics and biology over the last five decades have inspired a host of new possibilities –both positive and troubling .
With greater understanding of genetic material and of how physiological systems interact , biologists can fight disease better and improve overall human health .
Scientists already have begun to develop bioengineered vaccines for common diseases such as dengue fever and certain forms of hepatitis .
They are using these tools to develop other innovative medical solutions , including cells that have been bioengineered to serve as physiological “ pacemakers . ”
The mapping of the complete human genome in 2001 allows for even greater understanding of human functioning .
As a consequence of the Human Genome Project , scientists have already identified more than 1,800 genes associated with particular diseases .
But along with their potential benefits , these technological advances raise the possibility that individuals or non-state actors could create dangerous known or novel pathogens .
Additionally , researchers with the best intentions could inadvertently create novel pathogens that could harm humans or other species .
For example , in 2001 , researchers in Australia reported that they had accidentally created a new , virulent strain of the mousepox virus while attempting to genetically engineer a more effective rodent control method .
Unlike the biological weapons of the last century , these new tools could create a limitless variety of threats , from new types of “ nonlethal ” agents , to viruses that sterilize their hosts , to others that incapacitate whole systems within an organism .
The wide availability of bioengineering knowledge and tools , along with the ease with which individuals can obtain specific fragments of genetic material ( some can be ordered through the mail or over the internet ) , could allow these capabilities to find their way into unspecified hands or even those of backyard hobbyists .
Such potential dangers are forcing scientists , institutions , and industry to develop self - governing mechanisms to prevent misuse .
But developing a system to ensure the safe use of bioengineering , without impeding beneficial research and development , could pose the greatest international science and security challenge during the next 50 years .

One would think that Iraqi farmers , now prospering under " freedom " and " democracy , " would be able to plant the seeds of their choosing , but that choice , under little - known Order 81 , would be illegal .
But first , it is important to set the context .
Most people have never heard of the infamous " 100 Orders , " but they help explain why the majority of Iraqis remain opposed to foreign occupation .
The 100 Orders allow multinational corporations to basically privatize an entire nation , and this degree of foreign and private control has not been witnessed since the days of the British East India Company and its extraterritoriality treaties .
A few examples of the 100 Orders are illuminating : Order 39 allows for the tax - free remittance of all corporate profits .
Order 17 grants foreign contractors , including private security firms , immunity from Iraq 's laws .
Orders 57 and 77 ensure the implementation of the orders by placing U.S. - appointed auditors and inspector general in every government ministry , with five - year terms and with sweeping authority over contracts , programs , employees and regulations .
( 1 ) Back to one of the most blatant orders of all : Order 81 .
Under this mandate , Iraq 's commercial farmers must now buy " registered seeds . "
These are normally imported by Monsanto , Cargill and the World Wide Wheat Company .
Unfortunately , these registered seeds are " terminator " seeds , meaning " sterile . "
Imagine if all human men were infertile , and in order to reproduce women needed to buy sperm cells at a sperm bank .
In agricultural terms , terminator seeds represent the same kind of sterility .
Terminator seeds have no agricultural value other than creating corporate monopolies .
The Sierra Club , more of a mainstream " conservation " organization than a radical " environmentalist " one , makes the exact same case : " This technology would protect the intellectual property interests of the seed company by making the seeds from a genetically engineered crop plant sterile , unable to germinate .
Terminator would make it impossible for farmers to save seed from a crop for planting the next year , and would force them to buy seed from the supplier .
In the third world , this inability to save seed could be a major , perhaps fatal , burden on poor farmers . "
( 2 ) What makes this Order 81 even more outrageous is that Iraqi farmers have been saving wheat and barley seeds since at least 4000 BC , when irrigated agriculture first emerged , and probably even to about 8000 BC , when wheat was first domesticated .
Mesopotamia 's farmers have now been trumped by white - smocked , corporate bio-engineers from Florida who strive to replace hundreds of natural varieties with a handful of genetically scrambled hybrids .
Where does such hubris come from ?
It comes from the entire mission surrounding the invasion of Iraq , which , upon closer inspection , had been planned years in advance by a faction of " neo-cons " who adopted Leon Trotsky 's glorification of the state , his theory " permanent revolution , " and his goal of exporting revolution worldwide .
The neo -con revolution aims to alter the economic , political and cultural foundations of nations on the other side of the planet ( rejecting old - fashioned notions of self - determination , popular sovereignty and even the nation - state system ) .
This mission includes the transformation of agriculture and the establishment of " food control " over local populations .
Order 81 fits into this revolutionary program , and it is quite diabolical upon closer inspection .
First , it forces Iraq 's commercial farmers to use registered terminator seeds ( the " protected variety " ) .
Then it defines natural seeds as illegal ( the " infringing variety " ) , in a classic Orwellian turn of language .
This is so incredible that it must be re-stated : the exotic genetically scrambled seeds are the " protected variety " and the indigenous seeds are the " infringing variety . "
As Jeffrey Smith explains , author of Order 81 : Re-Engineering Iraqi Agriculture : " To qualify for PVP [ Plant Variety Protection ] , seeds have to meet the following criteria : they must be 'new , distinct , uniform and stable ' ... it is impossible for the seeds developed by the people of Iraq to meet these criteria .
Their seeds are not ' new ' as they are the product of millennia of development .
Nor are they ' distinct ' .
The free exchange of seeds practiced for centuries ensures that characteristics are spread and shared across local varieties .
And they are the opposite of ' uniform ' and ' stable ' by the very nature of their biodiversity . "
( 3 ) Order 81 comes with the Orwellian title of " Plant Variety Protection . "
Any self - respecting scientist knows , however , that imposing biological standardization accomplishes the exact opposite :
It reduces biodiversity and threatens species .
So Order 81 comes with an Orwellian title and consists of Orwellian provisions .
Jeffrey Smith peels away the layers of mischief behind Order 81 , finding it nonsensical that six varieties of wheat have been developed for Iraq : " Three will be used for farmers to grow wheat that is made into pasta ; three seed strains will be for ' breadmaking . '
Pasta ?
According to the 2001 World Food Programme report on Iraq , ' Dietary habits and preferences included consumption of large quantities and varieties of meat , as well as chicken , pulses , grains , vegetables , fruits and dairy products . '
No mention of lasagna .
Likewise , a quick check of the Middle Eastern cookbook on my kitchen shelves , while not exclusively Iraqi , reveals a grand total of no pasta dishes listed within it .
There can be only two reasons why 50 per cent of the grains being developed are for pasta .
One , the US intends to have so many American soldiers and businessmen in Iraq that it is orienting the country 's agriculture around feeding not ' Starving Iraqis ' but ' Overfed Americans ' .
Or , and more likely , because the food was never meant to be eaten inside Iraq at all � "
( 4 ) Just in case Iraqi farmer can't read , Order 81 enforces the new monopoly on seeds with the jackboot .
Order 81 makes this clear in its own text , buried at the bottom of the document , as is most screw - you fine print :
" The court may order the confiscation of the infringing variety as well as the materials and tools substantially used in the infringement of the protected variety .
The court may also decide to destroy the infringing variety as well as the materials and tools or to dispose of them in any noncommercial purpose . "
( 5 ) Order 81 is about power and profit , but it disguises itself as humanitarian legislation .
Topping it all off , the entire document puts on rather magisterial airs .
It was signed by L. Paul Bremer himself , with his own hand , and presumably with his own pen : " Pursuant to my authority as Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority � "
Like the Roman Proconsuls , Paul Bremer also spent a year in the provinces , governing the so - called barbarians �

To most of you this is no longer news .
The DOD issued orders that USB drives and other removable devices are no longer to be used .
Through autorun features and the presence of some nasty malware the decision was made to prohibit the use of the devices in an attempt to contain a malware outbreak .
There have been a number of examples of this type of thing in the past ( remember the digital frames ? ) and I must confess removable devices are not my favourite thing , nor should they be yours .
Apart from the malware angle there is also the data leakage angle .
How much information is walking out the door everyday ?
Yet many organisations take the ostrich approach and ignore the problem as to hard to solve .
There are quite a number of commercial products on the market that allow you to control removable devices , audit what is read or written to them , which devices can be used and what content can be taken from them .
The products typically also control other devices such as the wireless on laptops , infrared and bluetooth .
All potential avenues of data leakage .
Natively there are still somethings you can do such as use group policies to control access to the USB ports .
Epoxy glue also works a treat .
The main thing is to manage the risk .
Accept that the threat exists , determine the potential impact to your organisation and decide what you are going to do about it .
Let us know what you do to control removable devices .
I 'll update the diary at the end of the shift with your suggestions .

This month marks the 50th anniversary of NASA , which was launched a year after the Soviet Union lofted Sputnik into orbit , a feat that threatened to accelerate the communist rival 's lead over the U.S. in spaceflight technology .
It 's probably fair to ask whether any U.S. president might once again be in a position to respond to such a huge scientific and technological challenge .
Former Vice President Al Gore 's vision , for example , of creating 100 percent carbon - neutral electrical power in the next decade might be one such challenge — and something Gore specifically likened to a ' moon shot ' — requiring commitments , coordination and funding at every level of the public and private sectors .
But candidates may have to revise their ambitions and spending plans in the wake of the $ 700 - billion federal fiscal bailout , which promises to put a massive dent in taxpayers ' pocketbooks .
Jeffrey Sachs 's analysis of the financial crisis paints a sobering picture for the incoming administration .
Hence , it may be tough to pin down funding commitments for science and technology between now and election day .
To wit : Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has said that some of his goals may have to be delayed , but reiterated that there are some things that " just can't wait , " such as his proposed $ 150 - billion investment in clean or sustainable energy programs ( toward his goal of freeing the U.S. from dependence on foreign oil ) and the attendant creation of five million " green collar " jobs .
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain 's proposal to offer a taxpayer - funded $ 300 - million prize to the developer of a battery package that could cost - effectively power cars may have a game show element about it , but his supporters view it as a counterbalance to his " drill baby drill " approach to energy and the environment .
According to a report by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation , the campaign platforms of both McCain and Obama " incorporate substantially more focus on innovation and technology policies than their predecessors ' platforms in the 2004 election . "
Yet just about the same time that Obama released an 11 - page plan ( PDF ) for science and innovation , on the heels of his endorsement by dozens of Nobel Prize winners ( PDF ) , his opponent 's campaign started talking about a one - year freeze in discretionary spending .
And with McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , sparking an unprecedented level of interest in the beliefs and philosophies of a vice presidential candidate , some more populist questions of science — creationism in the classroom , for example — have taken on a more direct resonance with voters than usual .
Meanwhile , as we head into the crucial final weeks of the campaign , there has been no shortage of comparisons and evaluations of the two tickets ' stances and contrasting proposed policies on everything from climate change ( where the next president will have both an opportunity and responsibility to provide global leadership on the issue ) to stem cell research .
The Obama campaign recently answered questions posed by Nature magazine ( the McCain campaign declined , as it did also in response to a similar request from Physics Today .
Scientific American's own questions to the candidates , together with the candidates responses to the Sciencedebate 2008 Web site , will give interested voters a chance to measure the two candidates ' approaches .

Guest Post : Trita Parsi
The distinction between the apocalyptic rhetoric Israeli leaders use publicly in relation to Iran , and the more pragmatic view they hold among themselves on how to deal with Tehran and its nuclear program , has long been clear to anyone paying very close attention .
In short , it ’s clear that many of Israel ’s key leaders do n’t believe Iran is a suicidal ideologically - crazed regime that would risk destroying itself in order to destroy Israel , and therefore that even a nuclear - armed Iran would not be an “ existential threat ” to Israel , although clearly it would present a major strategic challenge by fundamentally reordering the balance of military force in the region .
And of late , some of them have begun a gingerly but very clear retreat from the idea that Israel will have to bomb Iran ’s nuclear facilities if no one else does — President Shimon Peres has said as much , publicly , and outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has echoed that position .
I asked Rootless Cosmopolitan ’s favorite Iran expert , Dr. Trita Parsi , to weigh in on the basis of his extensive research and interviews with many of the key decision - makers on the Israeli and Iranian sides .
Trita ’s book Treacherous Alliance —
The Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran and the U.S. is a must - read for anyone seeking to understand the Israeli - Iranian relationship , and why there ’s plenty of room for pragmatic coexistence .
Israel Gets Real on Iran
By Trita Parsi
On the eve of his departure from political life , outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Olmert delivered a stinging parting shot – putting under question not only the wisdom of holding on to Palestinian land , but also the feasibility of an Israeli military strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
“ We have to make a decision , one that goes against all our instincts , against our collective memory , ” he told the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth .
Recognizing that no other Israeli leader ever had uttered these words publicly , Olmert went on to declare that “ Israel must withdraw from almost all , if not all ” of the West Bank to achieve peace .
On Iran , Olmert argued that Israel had lost its “ sense of proportion ” when stating that it would deal with Iran militarily .
“ What we can do with the Palestinians , the Syrians and the Lebanese , we cannot do with the Iranians , ” Olmert said , in stark contradiction to his own earlier warnings on Iran as well as the rhetoric of many of his hawkish cabinet members .
“ Let ’s be more modest , and act within the bounds of our realistic capabilities , ” he cautioned .
Olmert ’s interview dashed the hopes of neoconservatives in Washington hoping for an Israeli post -November surprise through the bombing of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
With the U.S. facing a financial crisis and Israel ’s lacking the “ proportions ” to take on Iran , the risk for military confrontation with Iran in the last months of the Bush Administration has decreased significantly , according to most analysts .
Olmert ’s statement may signal a long - overdue shift towards Israel ’s Plan B on Iran .
Israel ’s first preference had been to pressure the U.S. to exercise its own military option on Iran , and to prevent any diplomatic breakthrough that might cause Washington to accept some level of Iranian uranium - enrichment capability .
In this regard , Israeli warnings of its readiness to attack Iran if the U.S. declined to do so served primarily to pressure Washington to launch a military strike .
Talk about the Israeli military option was aimed at keeping the American military option on the table .
Since the mid-1990s , a key tenet of Israel ’s foreign policy has been to sound alarm bells on Tehran .
Originally , the aim was to prevent any thaw between the U.S. and Iran out of a fear that Israeli security interests would be sacrificed in a potential U.S. - Iran deal .
Plan A was to nip this in the bud by undermining efforts to pursue diplomacy in the first place .
This policy did not lack critics , however .
An internal Israeli Iran - committee in the early 1990s led by former commander of the Israeli air force , David Ivry , concluded that the aggressive Israeli rhetoric had prompted Iran to turn its focus towards Israel .
Iran has enough problems in the region , the committee argued , there was no need to make Israel shine any brighter on Iran ’s radar .
As Iran ’s power grew in the region , Israeli concerns grew accordingly .
The more Iran could present itself as an indispensible actor in the region , the greater the risk of a U.S. - Iran accommodation .
Left with few good options , and an unwillingness to consider how a U.S. - Iran deal could change Iran ’s behavior towards Israel , the inclination in Israel was to intensify the very policy its Iran - committee had warned against .
But while Israel ’s Iran hawks argued against U.S. - Iran diplomacy , they had a hard time digesting the Bush Administration ’s opposition to Israeli - Syrian diplomacy .
The contradiction in the Israeli position was evident during AIPAC ’s conference earlier this summer .
Ephraim Sneh – a leading Iran hawk of Israel ’s Labor Party – argued passionately against U.S. - Iran diplomacy while making an equally passionate case for diplomacy Syria .
His justification was that in case of war , the Israeli public must know that every stone had been turned before their young men and women were sent to battle .
On Iran , however , Sneh did not acknowledge the same justification .
Olmert ’s valedictory interview may be the first small steps towards a Plan B on Iran – one that takes as its point of departure the new regional realities :
A balance of power that has shifted away from Israel , and an Iran that is unlikely to unlearn the technology of enriching uranium .
Israel now needs a way out of the prison of its own rhetoric .
Repeating statements that a nuclear Iran is “ unacceptable ” and using a rhetoric that creates an air of inevitability of war has left the Jewish State with no real options .
A more nuanced rhetoric on Iran may have the down - side of reducing pressure on the U.S. to act – “ If we do n’t talk about Iran , the world will forget about Iran , ” as Israeli Iran expert David Menashri put it – but has the up - side of enabling new options to emerge for the Jewish state .
Warning about being “ boxed into the corner , ” a recent Haaretz editorial offered a clear break from Israel ’s Plan A : “ The best chance of calming the atmosphere and reducing the threat lies in starting negotiations between the United States and Iran …
[ I ] t is the only route not yet tried and is likely to help moderate Iranian policy .
Israel must encourage an American rapprochement with Iran , with the understanding that this will serve the Israeli interest as well . ”
And in a video by the Jewish Council for Education and Research , several high - ranking Israeli generals throw their weight behind U.S. - Iran diplomacy as a path towards advancing Israeli security .
Still , in spite of the many rising voices against Israel ’s losing approach on Iran , the Jewish state is a long way from discarding its Plan A .
Unlike Olmert who recognized the unfeasibility of Plan A while leaving office , Israel ’s new Prime Minister , Tzipi Livni , may enter office with Plan B in sight .
She rejects the idea that Israel “ will not be able to live ” with a nuclear Iran and says Israel must deal with the challenges it faces .
Though Livni wo n’t go as far as Barack Obama in promising direct diplomacy with Tehran , she may help Israel find a few more options on Iran .

Dear Friends and Readers
After 9 years of posting to the the Ruth Group blog , during trying times and trying to change the times , it is time for me to move on .
Since Feb of 2003 when I started , a month before the Bush invasion of Iraq , I ’ve posted over 13,000 articles , pointers , links , commentaries and howls .
Bob Zuber , while he was with us , contributed over 6,500 posts from the news of mid-city America .
Others have contributed points of view , news of events and most importantly kept readers in touch with Ruth Group projects , such as helping to fund Soldiers of Conscience , and bringing a young Iraqi boy to California to restore his hearing , lost in a US bombing attack .
It ’s a good record , even if the blog never grew to be the community gathering place I ’d hoped it might become .
Since those early months , when “ blogging ” was little known and certainly not a phenomenon , many many new news and opinion sites have appeared on the Internet .
We users have incorporated our information gathering and discussions with such sites .
Major news corporations have had to include websites and blogs as part of their offerings .
Many new and interesting voices have found a home without needing investments of capital or phalanxes of editors deciding what is “ news . ”
We are all richer for it , if sometimes , overwhelmed .
Some of my regular favorite are : Glenn Greenwald , Hullabaloo , War in Context , Tom Dispatch , Juan Cole and Amy Goodman ’s Democracy Now .
Common Dreams and Alternet continue to pull together articles from many sources .
I love to make regular drive - bys to English language news sites in Pakistan , India , Germany , France , Greece , Turkey and others .
Perhaps the most important places to remember are those of vitally important public interest groups like CREW and OpenSecrets and human rights organizations like Doctors Without Borders , Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International .
With new people and organizations beginning to blog everyday , this far from exhausts the sites that should be at our fingertips — to learn from , to join in actions , and to support .
The most important climate change sites are 350.org and ClimateProgress.org
Some , like Huffington Post have turned disappointing ….
I will continue to post at my own site , All In One Boat , where I have concentrated on longer - form writing , book and movie reviews , stories , translations and poems .
I ’ve also just started The Last Dog Watch , where I can post news and current events I just ca n’t ignore .
Even though part of my reason for stopping here is to allow time for long postponed interests to gestate and come to fruition I ’ve already found that it is n’t in the nature of this beast to not look , or to ignore what is going on .
I do n’t know how regularly I ’ll post , but it will serve at least as someplace for me to go to shout some news , holler about egregious or dangerous behavior from the powerful , or simply to flag events that seem to me to be of significance outside my own small pond .
This site , Ruthgroup.org , will be left up as an archive .
All the best , and as everybody ’s hero , Albert Einstein told us

In just 16 days , a presidential campaign that has raged for almost two years will at last come to an end .
In that time , America has undergone profound changes .
And for most Americans , those changes have not been for the better .
When the first , absurdly early straw polls were taken in Iowa in 2007 , America was torn by a war in Iraq that seemed unwinnable .
But the economy seemed reasonably sound .
That preoccupation with the war may help explain why Republicans passed over Mitt Romney ’s successful record of job creation in favor of war hero and foreign - policy specialist John McCain .
On the Democratic side , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , who was n’t even in Congress when the war began , bested Sen.
Hillary Clinton in part because she voted to authorize the war .
Americans , as we now know , wanted change .
But as this race nears the finish line , America ’s priorities have changed , too .
The “ surge ” has reduced the level of violence in Iraq and President Bush has begun modest troop withdrawals .
Sens. McCain and Obama differ mostly about the details and pace of future withdrawals .
But the speed and virulence of the worldwide liquidity crisis , caused by the collapse of the junk mortgage market , has stunned most Americans and has led voters , who now review their shrinking retirement funds and rising unemployment rates with alarm , to focus overwhelmingly on America ’s economic ills .
Given this inescapable economic agenda , The Post believes Barack Obama is better equipped to lead America back to a prosperous future .
It ’s time to change course .
Frankly , neither Obama nor McCain has a comprehensive plan to end the economic crisis , or to even calm our jittery nerves .
But Obama ’s promise to surround himself with this country ’s top economic thinkers , such as Warren Buffet , is at least somewhat comforting .
In unsteady times , it may seem obvious to gravitate toward the veteran politician , but in this campaign , it ’s been the newcomer who has had the steady hand .
This fast - breaking global meltdown overwhelmed both campaigns and the final weeks of a hard - fought political contest are hardly the place for the cool , bipartisan thinking needed to get us out of this mess .
Fortunately , bipartisan efforts by the Bush administration and Congress have at least bought America time to begin crafting long - term economic reforms .
Looking at McCain ’s and Obama ’s specific proposals , we unfortunately find much to dislike in both port- folios .
We can live with Obama ’s call to raise taxes on families earning more than $ 250,000 a year .
And , in fact , we ’ve long thought it fiscally irresponsible to wage two wars on tax cuts .
However , we ’re concerned he may increase capital gains taxes at a time when the economy is starved for investment capital .
Indeed , we ’d favor eliminating capital gains taxes entirely if such profits are reinvested in another enterprise within one year .
We also would urge Obama to expand investment tax credits for businesses , to put profits back to work creating new jobs .
America ’s other most pressing long - term economic problem is health care .
Obama ’s plan , while not perfect , is far superior to McCain ’s catastrophic ideas .
How does it affect the economy ?
Consider this : General Motors now pays more than $ 1,500 for health care benefits , mostly for retired employees , on each new car sold .
America ’s competitors in Japan , Germany and China do n’t share such costs because their national health care plans are funded through broad - based taxes .
Somehow , America must level the playing field .
McCain wants to eliminate the corporate tax deduction on existing health care plans , a cruel corporate surtax averaging $ 3,500 per employee .
That tax hike would force employers to drop coverage for tens of millions of workers .
The lucky workers who still had employer - paid benefits would have to pay income taxes on them — a $ 3,000 tax increase on a typical middle - income Colorado worker .
And this massive tax increase on employers and employees alike comes from a man who asked repeatedly in the last debate : “ Why raise anybody ’s taxes ? ”
Why , indeed , Sen. McCain ?
We ca n’t imagine a Democrat - controlled Congress would pass McCain ’s reckless health care tax .
But even proposing such a scheme shows his woeful lack of understanding of America ’s economic underpinnings .
As to Obama , we confess we fear that a compliant Congress may be all too eager to approve his plans .
That ’s why it ’s critical for him to reach across the aisle and draw the best team he can assemble to get America working again .
Why not ask Romney to chair his health - care reform task force , or even serve as his economic recovery “ czar ” ?
There ’s precedent for such a move , since Wendell Willkie helped sell President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s vital wartime lend - lease program after losing his presidential race to FDR in 1940 .
What ’s the chance that Obama will reach out in such a bipartisan fashion ?
Actually , he has a long record of doing exactly that .
We do n’t mean his brief tenure in the Senate so much as his successful run as a community organizer in Chicago .
Republicans love to mock Obama ’s history as a community organizer .
But here was a man with no money to offer , no patronage to dispense , no way to punish his opponents .
All he could do was to work with people from all walks of life , liberals and conservatives , business people and the unemployed , and bring them together in common cause for a better community .
Could there really be better preparation to reunite a worried and divided America to again pursue our “ more perfect union ” ?
If Americans were only worried about foreign affairs , McCain ’s stalwart service in the military and experience on the national stage would make him the more credible commander in chief .
But our eyes have turned homeward and , in this hour , Obama has the eloquence and vision to bring us back together .
As novelist Christopher Buckley said in endorsing Obama , the Illinois senator “ has a first - rate intellect and a first - rate temperament . ”
With the help and prayers of the American people , we believe those talents can also make Barack Obama a great president .
As Steve Hildebrand works Miami , this can't be good for McCain :
Even Gov. Charlie Crist , who helped deliver Florida for McCain during the primary , said he will spend the final weeks before Election Day minding the state 's weak economy rather than campaigning for the Arizona senator .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States
Tuesday night , crowning an improbable two - year climb that owes much of its success to his command of the internet as a fundraising and organizing tool .
Obama won 52 percent of the nation 's popular vote , and had a 338 - 163 advantage in electoral votes Wednesday morning , thanks to victories in several swing and traditionally Republican states .
The results are a stunning and hard - won victory for a candidate who began the race as a relative newcomer to the national political stage , and ended it as first African - American to win the White House .
" I was never the likeliest candidate for this office , " Obama said in an acceptance speech in Chicago Tuesday night .
" We did n't start with much money or many endorsements .
Our campaign ... was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause . "
Both Obama and Republican rival John McCain relied on the net to bolster their campaigns .
But Obama 's online success dwarfed his opponent's , and proved key to his winning the presidency .
Volunteers used Obama 's website to organize a thousand phone - banking events in the last week of the race – and 150,000 other campaign - related events over the course of the campaign .
Supporters created more than 35,000 groups clumped by affinities like geographical proximity and shared pop-cultural interests .
By the end of the campaign , myBarackObama.com chalked up some 1.5 million accounts .
And Obama raised a record - breaking $ 600 million in contributions from more than three million people , many of whom donated through the web .
" He 's run a campaign where he 's used very modern tools , spoke to a new coalition , talked about new issues , and along the way , he 's reinvented the way campaigns are run , " says Simon Rosenberg , president and founder of the nonprofit think - tank NDN , and a veteran of Bill Clinton 's first presidential campaign .
" Compared to our 1992 campaign , this is like a multi-national corporation versus a non-profit . "
Ironically , it was McCain who first saw the internet 's potential in a presidential race , running an experimental set of targeted banner ads during his doomed 1999 primary battle against George W. Bush .
But eight years later , Obama finally teased out the net 's full potential as an election tool .
The campaign 's commitment to online organizing took shape during the primaries , when it hired online director Joe Rospars , a veteran of Howard Dean 's web - heavy 2004 campaign , and lured Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes to build its own social networking site , myBarackObama.com .
Hughes was intrigued by the challenge .
" We were going to be taking on some of the biggest names in politics , " Hughes recalled in an interview last week .
As the presidential race heated up , the internet grew from being the medium of a core group of political junkies to a gateway for millions of ordinary Americans to participate in the political process , donating odd amounts of their spare time to their candidate through online campaign tools .
Obama 's campaign carefully designed its web site to maximize group collaboration , while at the same time giving individual volunteers tasks they could follow on their own schedules .
The scale of Obama 's campaign reached massive proportions .
By Election Day , for example , it was asking its cadres of volunteers to make a million phone calls to get out the vote .
In addition to fostering grassroots supporters with its social networking tool , the Obama campaign contacted hard - to - reach young voters through text messages , collecting thousands of numbers at rallies and sending out texts at strategic moments to ask for volunteer help or remind recipients to vote .
The campaign also launched web pages and online action groups to fight the underground , e-mail whisper campaigns and robo-calls that surfaced in battleground states .
In one effort , the campaign urged supporters to send out counterviral e-mails responding to false rumors about Obama 's personal background and tax policies .
In fundraising , Obama followed in the footsteps of Howard Dean 's 2004 bid by regularly soliciting small donations from a wide swath of voters , raising record amounts online by federal filing deadlines .
He then used this money for more traditional campaigning — for example , flooding cable markets in strategic states with television advertising .
Obama spent a record - shattering $ 293 million on TV ads between January 1 , 2007 , and October 29 , 2008 , according to TNS Media Intelligence .
McCain spent $ 132 million during the same period .
In many ways , the story of Obama 's campaign was the story of his supporters , whose creativity and enthusiasm manifested through multitudes of websites and YouTube videos online .
It even resulted in volunteer contributions like the innovative Obama '08 iPhone and iTouch application that enabled owners to mobilize their friends and contacts in battleground states through the Apple devices .
The campaign was constantly adding new features even to the end , and many hope that Obama will bring this approach with him to the White House .
Obama almost has no choice as he faces the task of rebuilding Washington 's credibility with voters , says David Stephenson , a consultant who advises governments on transparency .
" I 'm not sure that Obama is an XML jockey , " says Stephenson .
" But he does have people advising him that realize how important this is . "
Either way , Obama 's rise to the presidency will be studied for years to come as the textbook example of a new kind of electioneering driven by people and technology , says Ralph Benko , a principal of the political consulting firm Capital City Partners , in Washington , D.C .
" It was a peer - to - peer , bottom - up , open - source kind of ethos that infused this campaign , " says Benko .
" Clearly , there was a vision to this . "

The US housing market is experiencing a sharp downturn Construction of new US homes fell more than expected last month to reach its lowest level in almost 18 years , Commerce Department figures have shown .
The number of new houses and apartments being built in September declined 6.3 % compared with the same month in 2007 .
This fall was much more severe than the 1.6 % dip that analysts had expected .
Analysts predict that housing construction will fall throughout 2009 , and only grow again when the banking sector and wider economy recover .
Not only is housing demand falling , but builders can't get credit to build homes
Mark Zandi , Moody's Economy.com
Until then , would - be new homeowners are finding that they either cannot afford to get their first mortgage , or that banks are reluctant to lend .
Without these would - be customers , homebuilders are cutting back on the number of new houses they build .
' Slide continuing '
The report showed that starts on new homes in September fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000 units , the slowest pace since January 1991 .
The fall in the construction of one - room apartments was even more pronounced , falling 11 % from a year earlier to an annual rate of 544,000 , the lowest figure since August 1982 .
The study added that the downturn in construction was most notable in the north - east of the country .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com said the fall in construction was " a significant weight on the economy " .
" Not only is housing demand falling , but builders can't get credit to build homes , " he added .
" The slide in construction will continue into next year . "
Fellow analyst , Peter Kenny of Knight Equity Markets , added that construction levels will not rise again until the current glut of unsold properties is sold .
" The housing inventory overhang needs to be digested in order for us to move forward , " he said .

New Green leader Caroline Lucas has said the party was " coming of age " and expected to secure its first MPs .
Ms Lucas , unveiled as the party 's first leader at its annual conference , has also said she plans to draw attention to the party 's social justice policies .
In her speech to the London conference she called for a windfall tax on energy companies and a " Green new deal " of investment in energy efficiency .
Ms Lucas branded bosses of energy companies energy " robber barons " .
She told the conference : " Just three companies - BP , Centrica and Shell - together made £ 1,000 profit every second over the first six months of this year .
" These corporations are robbing from the poor to give to the rich and they know it .
And it 's about time they learned that , in a progressive democracy , there is no place for robber barons . "
It follows her criticism of Gordon Brown for failing to impose a windfall tax on the energy companies .
Green spin doctors ( yes they really do exist ) insist there is no question of the party abandoning its principles
Carole Walker
BBC political correspondent
Greens push for the mainstream
The party leader also used her speech to call for a Green New Deal to deliver public investment in " green - collar " jobs in areas including renewable energy , which she said could create hundreds of thousands of jobs while helping the fight against global warming and cutting fuel bills .
And Ms Lucas gave her backing to a programme of free insulation to every home in the UK .
The party leader told the BBC she expected to see Green MPs at Westminster in the next two years .
She identified Brighton Pavilion , Lewisham and Norwich South as target seats .
Ms Lucas told the BBC success in local elections , combined with the change to the party hierarchy , meant the Green party were well positioned for success at the next general election .
" I 'm confident this is all part of a real coming of age for the Green party and we will be seeing Green MPs at Westminster next time round , " she said .
' Abstract ideas '
The MEP for South East England - the party 's candidate for Brighton Pavilion - beat the only other candidate , Ashley Gunstock , by 2,559 votes to 210 in the leadership vote .
Earlier , Ms Lucas , 47 , told the BBC : " We need to redouble our efforts to get our message across even more urgently .
We think that by having a leader we can do that even better . "
She added the decision to switch from the party 's previous system of having two principal speakers followed " the realisation that people do n't respond to abstract ideas " .
" They respond much more to the people and policies that represent those ideas .
We have a face to put to the policies , " said the new leader .
Ms Lucas added : " There is a huge number of people out there who want to hear our message and we need to get better at getting it across .
" I want to get our message out about social justice .
Everybody knows we 're the party of the environment .
What fewer people know is that if you are looking for the real progressive force in British politics today it is the Green party . "

Public Sector Pensions
28 Nov 2008 , by Nigel Stanley in Pensions & Investment , Politics , Public services
There has been a sustained campaign by the Taxpayers ’
Alliance and rightwing newspapers against public sector pensions .
Public servants are featherbedded they say , and the future cost of providing pensions are of telephone number proportions .
They seem to have made a convert in David Cameron .
This is what he said in answer to questions at a Manchester Chamber of Commerce meeting last Monday ( first revealed by the FT ’s estimable Nick Timmins ) :
“ We have got to end the apartheid .
We are getting into a situation now where pretty much everyone in the private sector has gone to defined contributions and the final salary schemes are closed .
In the public sector you have still got a lot of people on final salary schemes including members of parliament .
“ MPs are going to have to lead by example .
We have got to close the MP ’s final salary scheme because we have got to be able to turn around to the rest of the public sector and say that over time it does makes sense to move towards defined contribution .
“ There is an issue of fairness between the private sector and the public sector but there is also an issue of economic efficiency .
We do not want to make it so hard for people to move from the public sector to the private sector or from the private sector to the public sector .
“ My vision over time is to move increasingly towards defined contribution rather than final salary schemes .
This is something ( sic ) where the government has been remarkably feeble partly because they are in hock to the public sector unions ” .
It is only fair to report that today the Tories ’ Chris Grayling has attempted to row back .
The FT again :
“ That is not a decision we have taken , ” he said .
“ That is not a decision we have even discussed .
There is no hidden plan to make radical changes in one particular direction or another . ”
Mr Grayling said it was “ irresponsible ” for opposition politicians to “ grandstand ” about the issue without having proper access to assessments of the costs .
“ It is an issue that no future government will be able to ignore but we ’re just not willing to get involved in a detailed discussion about the future of public sector pensions from a position of substantial ignorance in opposition , ” he said .
But this is a slightly odd response .
First he seems to be accusing his leader of grandstanding – as there is no doubt that he did say all of this in Manchester .
Secondly it is simply not the case that there are lots of secrets about public sector pensions hidden away in Whitehall .
Public sector pensions info is in the public domain .
The Pensions Policy Institute has indeed just published a very useful summary of the situation .
It would not be surprising if public sector workers concluded that Mr Cameron ’s words were an accurate statement of intent , even if the TUC ’s rather obvious point that there are lots of potential losers in every marginal seat caused a rapid public retreat .
Mr Grayling as the DWP shadow may also realise that what Mr Cameron said is extremely hard to achieve for many public servants .
To see why , you first have to understand the different ways that pensions are funded .
In the private sector there are two basic models of pension provided by employers :
Defined benefit ( DB ) pensions make a pensions promise to their members .
Usually this is that every member will get a pension in retirement that is related to their salary when they leave their job and the number of years they contributed to the pension scheme .
It is up the employer to make sure than the pension scheme is well enough funded to pay out the pensions that are promised .
pensions make a pensions promise to their members .
Usually this is that every member will get a pension in retirement that is related to their salary when they leave their job and the number of years they contributed to the pension scheme .
It is up the employer to make sure than the pension scheme is well enough funded to pay out the pensions that are promised .
Defined contribution ( DC ) pensions do not make any kind of promise about the pension a member will receive .
They are simply a savings scheme .
The member and employer contribute to the pension .
It is then invested on the members behalf , and the pension the member gets depends on the size of this savings pot when they retire and turn it into a regular pension income by buying an annuity .
There is lots more about how pensions work on the TUC ’s advice website workSMART .
Defined benefit schemes have become more expensive for employers in recent years because people are living longer .
Some have been renegotiated , but many have been closed to , at least , new members and replaced by DC schemes that not only put the risk on to the member , but on average , have much less generous employer contributions .
But in the public sector there is a third kind of pension scheme .
The main schemes for civil servants , teachers and health workers , to name the big three , are unfunded ‘ pay - as - you - go ’ schemes .
While they offer a defined benefit they do not have a pension fund backing them .
Members ’ contributions simply go into the public purse each year and pensions are paid out from general funds .
Not all public sector schemes are unfunded .
The two big ones that are not are those for local government and the universities .
These are traditional funded DB schemes .
When a private sector employer replaces a DB scheme with a DC scheme , they start to save money straight away .
The pensions contributions they pay for people in the DC scheme are almost always much less than the contributions they would pay if the employee was still a member of the DB scheme .
At the same time they are reducing the future commitments of the DB scheme and thus the risk that they would have to make extra future payments to honour the pensions promise .
But it is very hard to see how a Conservative government could replace an unfunded public sector scheme with a DC scheme .
This is because they would have to run both pensions alongside each other until everyone with any rights in the unfunded scheme was dead .
They would have to both continue to fully fund today ’s pensions from tax revenue to meet the benefits built up under the unfunded scheme and start to build up the fund from which tomorrow ’s DC pensions would be paid .
It would actually cost more for many years to both fund the payment of today ’s pensions and build up the funds to pay tomorrow ’s pensions before any savings were achieved .
Indeed it is hard to see any way of achieving quick savings ( other than by increasing member contributions ) in unfunded schemes as the pay outs are all the result of benefits accrued in previous years – and the Conservatives have said that they will not touch accrued benefits . )
These arguments of course do not apply to funded public sector pensions which is why local government workers and university staff have every right to be concerned .
But pointing out the technical problems with Mr Cameron ’s proposal is not enough .
The arguments of the opponents of public sector pensions should also be answered .
Their arguments are three - fold :
They say that it is unfair that public sector workers get decent pensions while most people in the public sector do n’t .
They say they are unaffordable .
They say that have n’t moved with the times .
Of course they are right that the difference between the public and private sectors is unfair .
For that matter the difference between pensions in the boardroom and those for other staff reported in the TUC ’s anuual PensionsWatch report ( pdf ) is also unfair , though the critics seldom mention that .
The question is what should you do about this unfairness .
Pensions are inadequate in most of the private sector , should you make them as mean in the public sector ?
Levelling down is what the right always used to try to hang on the left .
Of course the same people blame this government for the decline of private sector pensions , and in particular some of Gordon Brown ’s early tax changes .
While they may have played some small part , it is increasing longevity , employer aversion to risk and the change in the nature of capitalist ownership that leads to today ’s boardrooms giving priority to short - term shareholder value over long - term commitment to staff that are the real reasons for the employer retreat ( probably not helped by employees undervaluing pensions as a benefit - at least until recently ) .
But it does leave right - wing newspaper both blaming the government for ending good pensions in the private sector and simultaneously demanding the government end good pensions in the public sector – not an entirely consistent position .
Good pensions are expensive and as public sector costs are dominated by wages , public sector pensions are inevitably a good part of a sizeable wages bill .
But we should still treat the figures with some caution .
There is almost no other item of public spending that can be estimated in advance for so many years .
You can work out how much future pensions will cost because they depend on benefits built up in the past and actuaries can estimate how long people will live .
There is no equivalent government promise to fund the health service at all in the future , but of course in real life they will .
But while you can work out the future cost of pensions it is not very helpful to present the figure as a total as if it all has to be paid straight away because it wo n’t .
It ’s a significant but affordable annual commitment .
The total number you get also depends on arcane stuff like what discount rate you choose to present spending promises in say 20 years time in today ’s money .
Read the PPI report for more on this .
Lastly ( and I think this is the longest ever Touchstone post so probably no - one ’s still reading ) , it is simply not true that public sector pensions have not changed .
They have all been ( or some may still be in the process ) renegotiated .
The retirement age is being raised to 65 , and indeed some now have a novel risk sharing element where members and employers will jointly fund the costs of any unexpected increases in mortality .

The ABLJ just published a new paper , Parents in Financial Crisis : Fighting to Save the Family Home .
The paper uses data from the 2001 Consumer Bankruptcy Project to examine the differences in how hard people struggle to save a home based on the presence -- or absence -- of minor children in the house .
The data support the claim that families with children work harder to try to hang on to home both before and during bankruptcy .
The finding is consistent with the thesis that families buy homes as a way to buy opportunities for their children ( schools , neighborhoods ) and that the potential loss of a home is more painful to parents who fear the lifetime impact of the loss on their children .
The data pre-date the current mortgage crisis , but they are useful on several levels for thinking about what is happening now .
At one level , the data reported in Parents in Financial Crisis are a reminder of the impact of a wave of foreclosures .
For adults to pick up stakes and move to a rental in a less desirable part of town can be painful , but they can go to the same work every day and continue the same after - work activities .
For a child , however , foreclosure may mean transferring to a weaker school , losing a chance to play in the band or on a softball team , dropping out of a scout troop , and losing all the friends she has ever known .
Sure , we 're a highly mobile society , and children move all the time .
But a move to a nicer house or a move so mom can take a better job is a move that most parents undertake at least in part with an eye toward improving a child 's lifetime chances .
A move from a foreclosure is not a move up .

This seems like an excellent idea to me :
Utah 's growing tourism industry and the star - studded Sundance Film Festival are being targeted for a boycott by bloggers , gay rights activists and others seeking to punish the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints for its aggressive promotion of California 's ban on gay marriage .
It could be a heavy price to pay .
Tourism brings in $ 6 billion a year to Utah , with world - class skiing , spectacular red-rock country and the film festival founded by Robert Redford among popular tourist draws .
Gay rights activist John Aravosis , whose well - trafficked AmericaBlog.com is urging the boycott , is unapologetic about targeting Utah [ . ]
The Mormon Church , based in Salt Lake City , encouraged members to work for passage of the ballot measure .
Thousands of Mormons worked as grass - roots volunteers and gave tens of millions of dollars to the campaign .
If the Mormon Church wants to stick its big fat nose into other people 's lives , then they need to live with the consequences .
Angels in America :
NCsoft has announced that the open beta test for its latest MMO , Aion : Tower of Eternity , is going rather well in Korea .
The beta has already seen an impressive high of 170,000 concurrent players ; that 's not even a total , that 's just the number of players online simultaneously .
11,000 people were logged into the game two minutes after the beta started on Tuesday , and 40,000 within an hour .
NCsoft has opened 25 beta servers to meet the demand , and Aion has gone straight to the top of Korea 's PC café charts .
Seems as though the huge community of home fans of NCsoft 's Lineage games - Lineage and Lineage II boast over 800,000 players each - is really getting behind Aion .
But NCsoft is hoping that it will also succeed where Lineage failed , and cross over to the West .
" The response we 're seeing in Korea is incredibly exciting , " said NCsoft West boss David Reid .
" Our Aion community in North America and Europe is also rapidly growing .
We 've got aggressive plans for the western launch in 2009 . "
Aion combines the looks and factional warfare focus of an Asian MMO with the rich questing and easy levelling we enjoy in the West .
It 's due out in North America and Europe on PC next year , like the man said .

Earlier this week a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 , did an emergency landing here in Rome .
On its approach to Ciampino airport , the airplane hit a large flock of birds about 50ft off the ground .
It experienced multiple bird strikes to both engines , most probably loosing its main power .
The pilot performed an emergency landing , by slamming onto the airstrip .
Through the force , the plane veered back in the air and bounced again onto the tarmac .
Then the plane slipped off the side of the runway , but the pilot managed to get it onto the tarmac again .
He stopped the aircraft at the very end of the strip .
After evacuating the passengers from the plane , the airplane 's left main landing gear collapsed ( sounds almost like a cartoon script ) , rolling the plane on its side , severely damaging the wing and the belly of the fuselage .

Sir Richard Branson is backing a landmark legal challenge by environmental campaigners against a multimillion - pound luxury leisure complex which threatens to destroy some of the most eco-sensitive mangrove swamps in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI ) , the paradise home of the British business tycoon .
The case , which is to be heard in full next year , is expected to have far - reaching consequences for the protection of the fragile Caribbean environment .
Sir Richard , head of the Virgin group of companies , has paid for a team of barristers , led by the former chairman of the Bar Stephen Hockman QC , to fly to the group of islands and seek to stop plans to build a marina , five - star hotel and golf course in the British overseas territory .
The Branson family home is on Necker Island , which Sir Richard bought for £ 180,000 in 1979 and is located just over the water from Beef Island where the development is planned .
At threat is one of the most important mangrove systems in the BVI , providing a vital home for hatchlings and juvenile fish , lobster and conch .
Under the BVI government plans one of the golf holes is to be sited in the middle of the disputed area .

The Virgin Islands Environmental Council ( VIEC ) , a charity supported by Sir Richard and other interested groups , says it has brought the action to seek legal protection of the environment in the BVI for future generations .
A council spokesman said : " This is a landmark case that addresses a number of important issues which will impact on the future of environmental law and practice throughout the Caribbean .
The outcome of this case will definitely impact the way other large projects currently under planning review are dealt with , leading to a more sustainable future for the BVI .
" The case will serve to define more clearly the government 's responsibility in adhering to environmental laws when granting or refusing planning permission . "
Last month , the case went to the East Caribbean Supreme Court , which rejected legal objections by the BVI government and the developers to the legal action going ahead .
The action will begin in full early next year .
The campaigners hope the legal action currently underway will lead to a reversal of the planning permission and the redesignation of Beef Island as a Caribbean national park .
" We believe this will result in a more sustainable solution for Beef Island and set a healthy legal precedent for BVI and Caribbean development .
At best the land may even become available for acquisition by the government with the critical areas being declared national parks , leaving the remainder available for sustainable development .
" By taking legal action , VIEC is ensuring the natural resources of the BVI are preserved for the benefit of future generations , that the government adheres to the procedures set out in law when granting planning permission , and that the people have a voice when addressing environmental issues that affect every citizen 's wellbeing , " the VIEC spokesman said .
Sir Richard recently announced plans for a new eco-resort on Mosquito Island , another of the British Virgin Islands , which will include 20 villas and a beachfront restaurant powered entirely by wind turbines and solar panels .
The BVI dispute is expected to be used to illustrate the case for an international environmental court which will be debated at a high - profile symposium at the British Library in London today .
An International Court for the Environment ( ICE ) has been championed by Mr Hockman and has been given a cautious welcome by Gordon Brown .
The Prime Minister told MPs earlier in the year that the first stage of moving towards an international environment court would be persuading all countries to agree to binding targets .
SOACHA , Colombia  Julián Oviedo , a 19 - year - old construction worker in this gritty patchwork of slums , told his mother on March 2 that he was going to talk to a man about a job offer .
A day later , Mr. Oviedo was shot dead by army troops some 350 miles to the north .
He was classified as a subversive and registered as a combat kill .
Colombia ’s government , the Bush administration ’s top ally in Latin America , has been buffeted by the killings of Mr. Oviedo and dozens of other young , impoverished men and women whose cases have come to light in recent weeks .
Some were vagrants , others street vendors or manual laborers .
But their fates were often the same : being catalogued as insurgents or criminal gang members and killed by the armed forces .
Prosecutors and human rights researchers are investigating hundreds of such deaths and disappearances , contending that Colombia ’s security forces are increasingly murdering civilians and making it look as if they were killed in combat , often by planting weapons by the bodies or dressing them in guerrilla fatigues .
With soldiers under intense pressure in recent years to register combat kills to earn promotions and benefits like time off and extra pay , reports of civilian killings are climbing , prosecutors and researchers say , pointing to a facet of Colombia ’s long internal war against leftist insurgencies .
OK , let me get this straight :
The central axiom of conservative Republicanism is that government is inherently corrupt and can't do anything right .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior U.S. lawmaker on Friday joined a growing chorus asking the head of the Federal Communications Commission to explain his plan to open unused airwaves for wireless devices , an approach backed by Google Inc .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has scheduled a November 4 vote by the commission on his plan to allow unlicensed use of parts of the spectrum called “ white spaces . ”
These unused pockets of the spectrum will become available when U.S. broadcasters are required to move completely to digital television next year .
Google , Motorola Inc and Microsoft Corp are among the companies that want the unused spectrum for a new generation of wireless devices .
Rep. John Dingell , chairman of the House of Representatives House Energy and Commerce Committee , sent a list of questions to Martin , including whether an FCC engineering report was peer reviewed , and how the agency would deal with interference from broadcast signals if it occurs .
“ Why did the Commission decline to adopt a licensed approach to some of all of this spectrum ? ” Dingell , a Michigan Democrat , wrote , reflecting the concerns of the broadcasters and other opponents of the plan .
Executives from News Corp .
Walt Disney ’s ABC , CBS Corp and General Electric ’s NBC signed a letter protesting the proposal earlier this week .
Dingell asked for responses from Martin by next Friday , four days ahead of the FCC ’s scheduled vote .
Big sports leagues , such as Major League Baseball and NASCAR , said in a regulatory filing that the current proposal is a “ huge leap backward ” in sports broadcasting , threatening to disrupt events because of possible interference issues .
Martin ’s plan is backed by several consumer groups , which say it will help expand cheaper broader to high - cost areas like rural communities .
Enlarge By Brian Snyder , Reuters A swimmer stands in Walden Pond in Concord , Mass. , Oct. 12 .
Buttercups , dogwoods , lilies , orchids , roses and violets around the pond are at risk because of global warming , a study shows .
QUICK QUESTION QUICK QUESTION From Walden Pond in Massachusetts to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming , climate change has begun to dramatically affect the flora and fauna of these American treasures , according to two studies in Monday 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The studies show that the warming of the Earth 's atmosphere over the past few decades has caused a loss of many of the flowers that Henry David Thoreau recorded in his book Walden and also has contributed to a decline in several species of native animals once common in Yellowstone .
WEATHER GUYS : Global warming still a hot topic for voters Thoreau first recorded the plants and flowers of the Concord , Mass . , area in 1854 .
Since then , Concord 's average annual temperature has risen by 4.3 degrees , the studies show , and botanists have kept a record of the region 's flora .
ECO - SCORE : See where you can save energy , plus more environmental news Hardest hit are species that do n't respond well to temperature increases , including buttercups , dogwoods , lilies , orchids , roses and violets , says Harvard University biologist Charles Davis , lead author of the article .
Davis says that even though about 55 % of all natural areas in Concord are undeveloped or remain well - protected , 27 % of the species documented by Thoreau have been lost , and 36 % exist in such low numbers that their local extinction may be imminent .
The research points to climate change as the sole culprit and says the loss of species wo n't be random .
" Certain lineages … are far more susceptible to decline under rapid climate change than others , " Davis notes .
In Yellowstone , researchers report that climate change and the resulting droughts and lack of snowpack have caused four species of amphibians — including three species of frogs and one of salamander — to go into severe decline .
" Amphibians are a bellwether for environmental degradation , even in natural ecosystems such as Yellowstone … where species have been actively protected longer than anywhere else on Earth , " writes lead author Sarah McMenamin of Stanford University .
The findings are based on climate data going back 60 years and remote - sensing data from the past 20 years , she reports .
Climate change is again fingered as the sole cause .
" There is no other reason for the regional aquifer to be drying up , at exactly the same time we 're seeing this change in climate , " she says .
McMenamin adds that " amphibian declines , population crashes and extinctions of entire amphibian species are becoming increasingly common . "

A chapter on " Potential for Terrorist Use of Twitter " notes that Twitter members sent out messages , known as " Tweets , " reporting the July Los Angeles earthquake faster than news outlets and activists at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis used it to provide information on police movements .
" Twitter has also become a social activism tool for socialists , human rights groups , communists , vegetarians , anarchists , religious communities , atheists , political enthusiasts , hacktivists and others to communicate with each other and to send messages to broader audiences , " the report said .
Hacktivists refers to politically motivated computer hackers .
" Twitter is already used by some members to post and / or support extremist ideologies and perspectives , " the report said .
" Extremist and terrorist use of Twitter could evolve over time to reflect tactics that are already evolving in use by hacktivists and activists for surveillance , " it said .
" This could theoretically be combined with targeting . "
The report outlined scenarios in which militants could make use of Twitter , combined with such programs as Google Maps or mobile phone pictures or video , to carry out an ambush or detonate explosives .
" Terrorists could theoretically use Twitter social networking in the US as an operation tool , " it said .
" However , it is unclear whether that same theoretical tool would be available to terrorists in other countries and to what extent . "
Besides Twitter , the report examined the potential use by militants of Global Positioning Systems and other technologies .
" GPS mobile phone service could be used by our adversaries for travel plans , surveillance and targeting , " it said , noting that just such uses have been discussed in pro-al - Qaeda forums along with the use of voice - changing software .
" Terrorists may or may not be using voice - changing software but it should be of open source interest that online terrorist and / or terrorist enthusiasts are discussing it , " the report said .

Last week we had a spectacular series of games but from all the games I have chosen only three of them .
The first game I chose is Manchester City against Arsenal .
Manchester City won the match tactically and the result could be only one positive for them .
Arsenal were without ex-captain William Gallas who was left out of the squad after declaring in the press that there were arguments betwen the players .
His absence has cost Arsenal and it looks like will be again in the starting eleven next match .
The goals were scored by Ireland , Robinho and Sturridge .
The second game I chose is from Bundesliga , Bayern against Cottbus .
The match started well for Bayern who missed a number of chances to open the score .
Despite the run of the game Cottbus managed to take the lead after a free - kick well executed by Skela .
Ribery equalised also from a free - kick and then the Bayern recital began .
Demichelis , Klose and Toni set the final score , a 4 - 1 comfortable victory .
The match was dominated from start to end by Bayern .
The last game is from Serie A , Fiorentina against Udinese .
The game started with chances for both sides but only Udinese managed to score until half - time .
Flores scored with a superb shot that surprised Frey .
The second half was absolutley delightfull .
Mutu equalized from a penalty , followed by two goals from Montolivo and one from Gilardino .
Comotto was sent off after handling the ball inside the penalty box .
Di Natale scored from the penalty but it was all settled for Fiorentina .
It was probably the best game of the season for Fiorentina and in my view is the best game of the week .
Which of this do you choose ?
I ’m waiting for your coments .

Monks from the Greek Orthodox and Armenian denominations were preparing for a ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City when a disagreement led to a full - fledged fistfight .
The fight began when Armenian clergy were holding a procession to commemorate the finding of the cross believed to have been used in the crucifixion of Jesus , according to The Associated Press .
The Greek members of the clergy wanted one of their monks present , the AP reported , for fear that the procession would undermine their claim to an ancient structure built on what is believed to be the tomb of Jesus .
The two sides could not agree , and when the Armenians tried to begin the procession , the Greek monks stepped in and the fighting began , the AP reported .
" We were keeping resistance so that the procession could not pass through ... and establish a right that they do n't have , " a young Greek Orthodox monk with a cut next to his left eye told the AP .

Many among the dozens of monks came away with cuts and bruises , said police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld .
Officers were called to the scene to break up the brawl .
They detained two monks , one from each denomination , Rosenfeld said .
The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem is thought to be built on the site of Jesus ' crucifixion and resurrection .
Rivalries between the different sects that share control of the church often lead to tensions .

All the components of glass can be found in two places : the beach and the laundry room .
It 's possible to melt pure white - silica beach sand into glass , but only at temperatures of 3,000 to 3,500 °F .
Washing soda , lime or borax ( a traditional laundry aid ) added to the sand disrupts the quartz - crystal structure of silica and reduces the required temperature to a more practical , though still dangerous , 2,000 °F , which I achieved with a backyard grill and a vacuum cleaner .
Glass is thought to have been discovered around 7,000 years ago by Phoenician merchants when cooking fires were built over sand that , by chance , had some of these substances mixed in .

Scientists may have less to cringe about when they go to the movies , if a new initiative designed to foster cooperation between scientists and the entertainment industry is successful .
The new effort , called the Science and Entertainment Exchange , is a project of the US National Academy of Sciences , and will be run by science writer Jennifer Ouellette , author of The Physics of the Buffyverse .
By bringing scientists together with Hollywood - types , the project aims to improve the scientific accuracy of what the entertainment industry produces and also help scientists communicate more effectively with the general public .

The project is “ vitally important ” , said Seth MacFarlane , creator of the television show Family Guy , at a press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday .
Other entertainment industry figures were also at the event , including Lawrence Kasdan , who wrote the screenplays for The Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi .
Science ‘ undervalued ’
Married film producers Janet and Jerry Zucker , who were among the driving forces in setting up the Exchange , started paying more attention to science when their daughter was diagnosed with diabetes after becoming ill .
“ They gave here a shot of insulin and this was like a miracle , because she was laying there on the examining table , and within a few hours she came alive again , her lustre came back , ” Janet Zucker said .
The experience motivated them to get involved in the fight for increased funding for stem cell research in California , and more recently to help set up the Exchange .
MacFarlane , who is a member of the Exchange ’s advisory board , said he feels that in recent years science has been “ undervalued and degraded ” .
“ This idea that intelligence is somehow not cool or not American or something to be scorned has been kind of embraced by a lot of people , ” he said .
Point of contact
Just exposing entertainers to more science will help improve the situation , he said , noting that he just finished making a Family Guy episode based on the possibility that there are multiple universes , prompted by a documentary he saw on the subject .
“ I did n’t really know that that was a real thing , that it was possible [ and ] being theorised about , ” he said .
“ So we did a story about it . ”
Aside from serving as a point of contact for members of the entertainment industry seeking advice on scientific accuracy , people involved in the Exchange hope that it will help create new partnerships between scientists and entertainers to promote scientific literacy and inspire the next generation of scientists .
After Wednesday ’s press conference , the Exchange organised a symposium , sponsored in part by New Scientist , in which scientists and entertainers were to discuss hot topics in science like climate change and genomics .

The species pictured here — known colloquially ( and hilariously ) as the mummichog — is a favorite of scientists because of its unusual breeding patterns .
Up to eight times a year , female mummichogs will spurt out a passel of fertilized eggs onto empty mussel shells and shallow - water plants ; the embryos like to develop in the open air .
Once they get a little larger than the ones shown here , it 's possible to look right through the egg and see the fishlets ' beating hearts .
Revelation emerges as government appeals against order to release minutes of two cabinet meetings in March 2003
Gordon Brown tonight faces fresh calls for an Iraq inquiry following the emergence of documentary evidence that " proved " there was insufficient cabinet discussions on the legality of going to war .
The revelation emerged in a court hearing today when the government was appealing against an order to release the minutes of two cabinet meetings , on March 13 and 17 2003 , immediately before the start of the invasion .
Jonathan Swift , counsel for the Cabinet Office , revealed that it was part of the commissioner 's case that the minutes of March 17 " proved the absence of sufficient discussion " .
It is already known that at the second meeting , the then attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , gave the cabinet the single - page text of a parliamentary answer declaring that an invasion of Iraq would be legal without a further United Nations security council resolution .
Ten days earlier Goldsmith had given Tony Blair , then prime minister , longer and more equivocal advice , which was not shown to the whole cabinet .
Timothy Pitt - Payne , counsel for Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , said the commissioner was not suggesting that the minutes would answer " one way or another " whether there was sufficient cabinet discussion of Iraq as the issue had been discussed at many previous cabinet meetings .
The meeting on March 17 was the cabinet 's only opportunity to discuss Lord Goldsmith 's advice before the start of the war three days later .
Pitt - Payne said that he would discuss the exact contents of the minutes during a closed session , but he added that they were " highly material " to the issue .
The revelation appears to back up the claim of Clare Short , former cabinet minister , that she was prevented from questioning Lord Goldsmith on his opinion and whether he had any doubts .
Sir Andrew ( now Lord ) Turnbull , former cabinet secretary , told a House of Commons committee in March 2005 that ministers " had a chance to ask questions " following an oral presentation from Lord Goldsmith .
Last week , Lord Bingham , a former senior law lord , described the invasion of Iraq as " a serious violation of international law and the rule of law " .
William Hague , shadow foreign secretary , today said : " The more we find out about how Britain went to war in Iraq the stronger the case grows for a proper inquiry into origins and conduct of the war .
" There is growing evidence that the decision to go to war was taken in the context of a serious failure of the machinery of government and of cabinet government .
The good conduct of Britain 's foreign policy requires the urgent restoration of both .
" The sooner we learn the lessons of the past the sooner we can apply them .
So if this government persist in rejecting the inquiry the next Conservative government will establish one as an early priority . "
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs , Ed Davey , said : " This revelation is a damning indictment of Blair , Brown and the whole Labour leadership who sat round that table .
No wonder Clare Short decided to leave the Labour party .
" Not to consider fully such a critical piece of legal advice , on the eve of a major war , makes a total mockery of cabinet government .
Tony Blair broke the unwritten rules of our constitution , yet nothing has been done by Gordon Brown to prevent this happening again .
" The case for a public inquiry has been strengthened yet again , and Gordon Brown should announce one in the Queen 's speech . "
The tribunal concerns the records of cabinet meetings in March 2003 , which considered legal advice on the imminent invasion of Iraq .
Thomas ruled earlier this year that the formal minutes of these meetings should be revealed .
The Cabinet Office is currently appealing to the tribunal .

6 Sudden Company - Wide " Status " Meetings
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Email You 'll Get :
" Our Founder and CEO of DoomedCorp would like to bring the DoomedCorp family together to talk about our future .
Attendance required . "
What 's Actually Going On :
No one likes meetings , but they beat the alternative of , you know , working .
Unless they 're not watching your Internet usage in which case the meeting is just a rude interruption in your porn stream .
Every few months you probably have big meetings where the CEO talks about how bright the company 's future is , if we all just work a little harder and keep our eyes on the prize , etc .
But the meeting to get worried about is the sudden , unscheduled , company - wide meeting .
There 's a good chance they are trying to get ahead of bad news , breaking it to you before you read about it in the papers .
Or hear that guy on CNBC screaming about it .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
These meetings are all about damage control .
Keep an ear open for vagueness ( " We here at DoomedCorp are facing some tough times , but I promise you , we 'll forge ahead with determination ! " ) and spin ( " It seems dark now , but I assure you , there is a new dawn breaking . " )
It 'll probably close with the CEO making a promise to stay with the company as long as it takes .
Time to Go :
Look for more meetings , with increasing frequency , as more bad news rolls in .
The company is trying to get ahead of the office grapevine , suppressing rumors so you wo n't get nervous and quit , hoping you 'll stay the course right up until you arrive to find a security guard standing next to a cardboard box filled with the stuff from your cubicle .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Of course , there 's also the worst case scenario , which is when the sudden company - wide meeting is held after the bad news hits , because the news was so bad the company could n't bring itself to say it to your face ( like having it turn out the higher ups were robbing the company blind ) .
So we guess another warning sign is if the CEO 's speech is interrupted by the cops dragging him out the door .

This is a description of an impromptu scene I experienced several years ago .
I post it since I had a discussion recently about scenes that rumba on the edge of non-consensual assaulted nutjob time .
While there is implicit consent overall , the act described herein is not something I condone for everyone , and Might Be Upsetting .
Please do n’t click - through if seemingly non-consensual sexual play might … MIGHT be triggering for you .
Take care of yourself ! [ / disclaimer ]
I ’m one of those people who really like to play rough sexually .
No big whoop .
But I am also one of those people who eroticized shit that might seem bizarre , even to hardcore perverts .
Like humiliation , housework , feeling trapped .
Of course , this shit is bread & butter & afternoon tea for some people .
And so it goes .
A thirty day practically live - in service contract can be either fun or grueling .
In the middle of a heat wave in the middle of a particularly warm summer , it can be both .
I was in service to a friend of mine , a long time play partner , and today was the day to clean the house .
No mean feat for a 3 - story 3 bedroom 3 bathroom home with a dungeon downstairs that had toys scattered everyplace from goddess - knows - what he ’s been up to the night before .
But I settled in to the task , since it helps me to zone out .
By the time I got to the first floor , even the AC was not adequate to keep me cool so I was down to a bra .
The noise from the vacuum was pretty loud , and I did n’t hear him walk down from his office on the second floor of the house and lean in the doorway .
I jumped startled when I saw him there , waved hi , and continued my work .
He did n’t leave , and I was feeling a bit self - conscious , vacuuming naked , and not feeling particularly sexy .
He had this kind of thoughtful but blank look as he watched .
With him , this is Never A Good Sign .
He abruptly left .
I did n’t feel any better .
When there ’s a wasp in the room you ’d like to know where it is and what it is up to .
With him out of eyeshot , it was impossible to know what in hell he had planned .
If anything .
But that look …
I shrugged it off and continued to clean .
About ten minutes or so later , he came back downstairs .
This time in the same state of undress as me .
Well , without the bra , of course .
I took a step back because ….
I was a bit scared .
And I was really pretty much in the “ Clean the house ! ! ” zone , so a 6 ’ 4 ” tall naked frosty - eyed man striding towards you is enough to give you pause .
He wrapped my braids in his hand , yanked back my head and instructed me to “ Turn the fucking vacuum cleaner off . ”
It was tough , bent backwards as I was , but I felt around with my foot and shut it down .
The sudden silence was deafening .
With another wrap of my hair around his fist , I was driven down to my knees and my mouth driven over his cock .
The unexpected shove made me gag and wheeze , and push my hands against his thighs , trying to dislodge him .
My hands were immediately slapped away , my head pulled backwards , and my face , both cheeks , left and right , slapped also .
… there is one handhold on reality gone …
He was eerily silent as he shoved his cock back down my throat , and I tried to relax , to not choke ….how long before I was yanked up and thrown over the back of the couch ?
No idea .
I was starting to cry from the disorienting feeling of having to change gears , of not being aroused , and not knowing what in hell he was about to do … I realized he was preparing to fuck me , a condom wrapper drifting in the periphery of my vision .
“ P— pplease– I ’m on my period … ”
He looked down ” So you are . ’
He jerked me back to my feet , dragged me to the bathroom and pushed me down on the toilet , reaching between my legs to pull the tampon out .
..oo , the grip on reality is slipping … not too many fingers left … hold on …
I was suddenly so humiliated , I burst into tears .
My vision was blurred by hot exploding lachrymation as he lifted me bodily off of the toilet , pushing me back towards the couch .
Bent over again , I feel him entering me suddenly .
Under most circumstances , this would have been far , far too painful , but there was plenty of blood to ease his entry .
I continued to cry as he fucked me over the back of the couch , my arms wrapped around my head to cradle me from banging it against the wall .
My scalp ached from his constant pulling pulling pulling then oh my god what is he doing …
I felt the head of his cock pressed against my ass .
No lube , no …. no way …
I pulled around , his face millimeters from mine , his eyes really quite … not … there …
I wept .
“ You can ’t …. you ca n’t do that …you need lube … something … ”
He smiled that terrible , terrible smile .
“ Oh , I think that is n’t a problem … there ’s plenty of blood . ”
And in one thrust , he made his point .
I felt as though I ’d been punched in the stomach , the pain was so great .
I tried to not scream …it was the middle of the afternoon in a Very Nice Neighborhood and I did n’t want to have the Police involved but GODDESS goddess did it hurt .
I was hyperventilating and barking into the couch when he pulled my head back , and whispered
“ Scream all you want to one is gonna come help you anyway , you little black bitch … ”
And scream I did .
Shrieking wailing incoherent gurgling shouts rent the quiet of the room , and the pain was profound .
White hot with my skin ice cold and just to make it more interesting his teeth in the back of my neck so that the loop of pain became even more rapid and dangerous …
I was losing my mind , the grip slipping …
His thrusts became staggered , deeper , his hand shoved me forward until I was against the wall and pillows barely able to breathe , and I knew he was about to be finished and I was glad because this ordeal would be over and I ’d have proven I could take it and it would be over but then then he said did he I think he said it just three words
“ Come . For. Me ”
and goddesses help me I did , I did shaking so hard he was almost losing his hold on me screaming so loudly and without restraint that my throat felt flayed and hurt his terrible , terrible growls in my ear pushing me further even and holy shit I cannot stop another wave of punishing obliterating orgasm …
gone gone gone nothing to hold on to
some time passed .
There was a warm wet towel tossed at me , casually .
“ Clean yourself up .
You ’re a mess .
And finish vacuuming . ”
And I did .
Then I curled on the corner of the same couch where I ’d been so brutally violated , so suddenly , and just stayed .
Very .
Still .
He came bouncing back downstairs , dressed again , grinning like a kid .
“ Hey !!
Look !
Here !
There ’s sorbet !!
I brought you mango .
That ’s your favorite , right ? ”
SO thoughtful ….no ?
It IS my favorite 
And he was one of my favorite play - partners , for years .
A Tubular Cavity Penetrating the Local Disk
On May 29 , 2003 , a team of astronomers ( including Barry Welsh , Rosine Lallement , Francoise Crifo , Daphne Sfeir , and and Jean - Luc Vergely ) presented the first detailed map of interstellar space within 1,000 ly ( 300 pc ) of the Solar System .
They also announced confirmation of the hypothesis that the so - called Local Bubble of the spiral disk 's gas clouds actually pierces the disk of the galaxy , perhaps as the result of exploding stars around one or two million years ago ( CNRS press release ) .
The tubular cavity of hot , low - density gas was found to be irregular with tunnels branching off through the surrounding dense gas wall , which is suspected of having interconnecting cavities and tunnels like an interstellar sponge , as first suggested by astronmers nearly 30 years ago ( Cox and Smith , 1974 ) .
The astronomers hypothesize that energetic supernova explosions created fast - moving expanding bubbles of hot gas that collided with the surrounding cold gas of interstellar space , which in turn became compressed into thin shells .
Eventually , these shells of cold gas met other expanding hot cavities and broke up to form small tunnels or pathways between the expanding voids ( U.C. Berkeley press release ; and Welsh et al , 1999 ) .
Such " hot chimneys " have been detected in other galaxies .

Larger illustration .
Regions of extremely low density but
probably hot , ionized gas are shown
in white , while dark areas are large
condensations of cold and dense
gas which surround the local cavity .
These dark " walls " are broken in
several places by low density
" interstellar tunnels " that link the
local cavity with other nearby
bubble cavities such as the
Pleiades and GSH 238+00+09 ( more ) .
By locating stars that showed no absorption by sodium and those that did , the astronomers were able to construct a three - dimensional picture of the edge of the low - density region surrounding the Solar System by observing 1,005 hot and bluish type A and B stars , whose sodium absorption lines are easy to detect from their spectra .
Eventually , measurements towards more distant stars picked up large numbers of sodium atoms , indicating the presence of a dense neutral - gas boundary , or " wall , " around the local cavity of hot and sparse , ionised gas .
The nearest wall is 175 to 190 ly light years from the Solar System , in the direction of the galactic center .
By measuring the motion of sodium gas atoms detected along the 1,005 sight - lines , the astronomers hope to say soon whether the gas wall that surrounds the Local Chimney coming towards the Solar System , or is moving away to enlarge the local cavity .
If the wall is approaching the Solar System , then it is likely that a distant explosive force is pushing it towards the Solar System .
If the wall is expanding away from the Solar System , however , then a supernova explosion may have taken place near the Solar System about a million years ago .
The Local Chimney has been around for a few million years .
It could easily have been caused by a supernova punching through the top and bottom of the galactic disk , the intense stellar winds from 10 or so hot stars , a powerful gamma-ray burst , or even a large star moving through the area .
In theory , any of these could have swept dense , neutral gas out of the region , leaving only very tenuous , hot , ionized hydrogen gas .
Assuming that the Local Bubble or Chimney was created by the supernovae of young , massive stars during the past few million years , some astronomers have been looking for their probable source among the 27 member B stars of the Pleiades moving group , which are located towards the nearest part of Gould 's Belt of massive hot , OB - type stars ( more discussion in pdf ) .
The youngest stars in the galactic region surrounding around the Solar Neighborhood are associated with " subgroup B1 " of the Pleiades ( M 45 ) stellar moving group , and astronomers hypothesize that the more massive stars born in this group may have already exploded as 20 or so supernovae over the past 10 to 20 million years as the entire group of stars moved through a nearby region of the Local Bubble ( Berghoefer and Breitschwerdt , 2002 ) .
The center of mass of these stars is located 135 +/- 15 pc away from the Sun , whereas the distance of the Gould or Gould 's Belt of young bright stars in this direction is around 160 pc , whose origins may be 30 to 60 million years old .
According to ( Asiain et al , 1999 , in pdf ) the Pleiades B1 subgroup may only be 20 +/- 10 million years old .
Some astronomers wonder if the Local Chimney 's system of interlocking , gaseous cavities is characteristic of the entire Milky Way .
Astronomers looking at an updated map of the cold , local interstellar gas in the galactic plane see an inner empty region with finger - like extensions or tunnels that poke through the surrounding wall and reach into nearby regions of the galaxy , such as the Lupus - Norma , Auriga - Perseus and Scorpius - Centaurus associations of young stars .
These regions are known to contain large amounts of hot and ionized low - density gas that can be detected at radio and ultraviolet wavelengths .
The local void of gas extends out of the galactic disk and stretches into the overlying galactic halo region .
Thus , the cavity appears as a tube - like " chimney " that links the gas in the galactic disk with that of the halo .

Supernova explosions can break
through the galactic disk and
inject hot gas into a galactic
corona , perhaps driving a
" galactic fountain " , wherein the
gas cools and condenses , and
eventually recycles matter into
the galactic disk ( more ) .
Galactic chimneys have been widely observed in other galaxies and are thought to be responsible for venting the hot , ionized gas expelled in supernova explosions into galaxy halos .
Active vents seen in other galaxies have been called " galactic fountains " while the gas falling back into the disk have been dubbed " galactic rain . "
Astronomers searching for signs of hot gas in the Local Chimney with the NASA FUSE satellite have detected hot gas that is coming towards the Solar System , which could be part of a fountain that is falling back onto the galactic plane .
A previously unknown population of vampire moths has been found in Siberia .
And in a twist worthy of a Halloween horror movie , entomologists say the bloodsuckers may have evolved from a purely fruit - eating species .
Only slight variations in wing patterns distinguish the Russian population from a widely distributed moth species , Calyptra thalictri , in central and southern Europe known to feed only on fruit .
When the Russian moths were experimentally offered human hands this summer , the insects drilled their hook - and - barb - lined tongues under the skin and sucked blood .
Entomologist Jennifer Zaspel at the University of Florida in Gainesville said the discovery suggests the moth population could be on an " evolutionary trajectory " away from other C. thalictri populations .
This is the second population of vampire moths Zaspel and her team have found .
They discovered the first in Russia in 2006 .
Next January , she will compare the Russian population 's DNA to that of other populations and other species to confirm her suspicions .
" Based on geography , based on behavior , and based on a phenotypic variation we saw in the wing pattern , we can speculate that this represents something different , something new , " Zaspel said .
" But it is really difficult to say without knowing genetic differences between individuals in that population , and among individuals from other populations , how different this group is going to be . "
( Zaspel 's research is funded in part by a grant from the National Geographic Society 's Committee for Research and Exploration .
National Geographic owns National Geographic News . )
Blood Feeding
If it turns out that Zaspel has indeed caught a fruit - eating moth evolving blood - feeding behavior , it could provide clues as to how some moths develop a taste for blood .
Some researchers , she noted , hypothesize that blood - feeding in insects and animals evolved from behaviors such as feeding on tears , dung , and pus-filled wounds .
" We see a progression from nectar feeding and licking or lapping at fruit juices to different kinds of piercing behaviors of fruits and then finally culminating in this skin piercing and blood - feeding , " she said .
Chris Nice , a biologist who studies butterfly evolution at Texas State University in San Marcos , said few butterfly and moth species are equipped with the hook - and - barb - lined tongues needed to pierce fruit .
" The fruit - piercing stage in the first place sets the stage , in a morphological sense , for further transitions into , in this case , the blood - feeding , " he said .
Nice added that genetic research such as Zaspel 's is the only way to test ideas on how certain behaviors evolve .
Sexual Gift ?
The next question is why this Russian population of C. thalictri appears to have evolved blood - feeding behavior , Zaspel said .
Only male moths exhibit blood - feeding , she noted , raising the possibility that as in some species of butterflies and other moths , the Russian moths do it to pass on salt to females during copulation .
" There is no evidence it prolongs the life of the male , or anything like that , " she said .
" So we suspect that it is probably going to the female . "
The sexual gift , she said , would provide a nutritional boost to young larvae that feed on leaf - rich , but sodium - poor , diets .
Dorgan : Lieberman actions not acceptable for chairmanship David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday November 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Joe Lieberman is unfit to hold the chairmanship on the important Homeland Security Committee , Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) said Sunday .
Dorgan told Fox 's Chris Wallace that Sen. Joe Lieberman 's campaigning for the Republican president candidate and some Republican Senators was not acceptable behavior for someone with a Democratic Chairmanship .
" The question is , is that acceptable ?
The answer is no , " Dorgan said .
Vermont Sen. Patrick
Leahy also said recently he did n't think Lieberman should keep his chairmanship .
Lieberman appalled his fellow Democrats during the presidential election for his strong support of Sen. John McCain and harsh attacks against then Sen. Barack Obama .
He appeared at the Republican National Convention to express his approval of McCain and was also considered as a possible running mate for McCain .
But next week , that Democrats will meet to vote on whether Lieberman should be allowed to keep his leadership position in the Senate .
Sen . John Kyle ( R - AZ ) told Chris Wallace that Republicans would welcome Lieberman into their caucus .
" If he came over to the Republican side and organized with us , I do n't think it would change the way he votes , " Kyle said .

Hello
Here is the latest Caml Weekly News , for the week of October 14 to 21 , 2008 .
OCaml version 3.11.0+beta1
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/bc84e6a824b52bdd#
Dear OCaml Users ,
We are pleased to celebrate the birthday of Friedrich Nietzsche by releasing OCaml version 3.11.0 + beta1 .
We need YOU to test it thoroughly and report any problems you might have .
Does your favorite software work with it ?
It is available as a source release only ( plus documentation ) , from this address : http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.11/
It is also available from our CVS server at : http://camlcvs.inria.fr/
Use tag " ocaml3110beta1 " to get the beta release , and tag " release311 " to track the bug fixes between this and the final release of 3.11.0 .
Have fun and PLEASE send us some feedback , positive or negative .
--
The OCaml team .

Camlp5 HOW-TO
------------------------
Camlp5 version 5.09 does not work with OCaml 3.11.0 + bet a1 out of the box .
A new version compatible with OCaml 3.11.0 should be released very soon .
In the meantime you can use the following commands ( in the root directory of the Camlp5 5.09 sources ) to compile Camlp5 5.09 with OCaml 3.11.0 + beta1 .
Note that you will need to provide the path name to a copy of the OCaml 3.11.0 + beta1 sources at the line labelled " HERE " .
cp - R ocaml_stuff/3.11 ocaml_stuff/3.11.0 cp ocaml_src/main/ast2pt.ml_3.11 ocaml_src/main/ast2pt.ml_3.11.0 ed main / ast2pt.ml
<<- EOF g/OCAML_3_11/s//& OR OCAML_3_11_0 / wq EOF ed top/rprint.ml
<<- EOF g/OCAML_3_11/s//& OR OCAML_3_11_0 / wq EOF ../ configure -- transitional make steal OCAML_SRC= < path- to-ocaml - source - dir > # HERE make core make bootstrap_sources ../ configure -- transitional make world.opt
That 's all .
Now you can " make install " as usual .
Great news , thanks !
One note to GODI users : trying out the beta version is very simple ; just ask GODI to build the godi-ocaml and godi- ocaml - src packages , and configure the latter one by setting OCAML_CVS_CHECKOUT to " yes " and OCAML_CVS_REVISION to " release311 " ( or " ocaml3110 beta1 " if you want the Beta 1 static snapshot ) .
GODI will then automatically recompile all packages .
For ease of testing , I 've very quickly updated the FreeBSD port ( lightly tested , as in " it seems to work for me " ) .
It is available at http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~boender/ocamlport.tar.gz ( to be untarred at the root of your ports tree ) .
> Thanks for the good work .
I would like to know exactly what > architectures support the native Dynlink ?
I did not see this information > in the release notes .
The native Dynlink is known to work under Linux x86 , Linux AMD64 , Win32 ( mingw/msvc ports ) .
It has been lightly tested under Win64 , some flavors of BSDs and also the Cygwin port .
> And on macosx ?
It seems here on 10.5.5 that only dynlink.cma and > dynlink.cmi for bytecode get installed .
So I guess there 's no support . >
What about the future ?
Native dynlink used to work on Mac OS X < 10.5 ( x86 only ) .
The new linker in 10.5 does not support linking shared libraries with non-PIC code .
It is still possible to use the old linker , called ld_classic , but some libraries ( like X11 ) does not work , so this has been disabled in the configure script .
The clean solution to make natdynlink work on recent Mac OS X systems ( beside convincing Apple to support the old behavior of their linker in their new implementation ) is to change OCaml 's x86 backend so that it produces only PIC code ( this has been done for the AMD64 port ) .
I do n't think there is currently any plan to work on that .
I 'm glad to report that I just tried with XCode 3.1.1 and the linker did not complain ( as it did with XCode 3.0 ) .
I wrote a little test and the native Dynlink worked with that version of XCode ( using 10.5.5 , Intel -- I had to drop an - I flag in the linker call from the OCaml compiler when I was trying it ) .

Decent Java parser written in Ocaml ?

> Currently I 'm looking for a Java parser .
Is there anyone aware of a > decent Java source code parser written in Ocaml ?
I wrote a simple Java parser and pretty - printer several years ago : http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ecc/joust.tar.gz
I 'll let you decide whether it's " decent " .
This was before the addition of Java generics , so it could use some updating .
Camelia progress
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/3577668ca4322396#
Here 's the update from the trenches : I 'm about 75 % done porting Camelia code to Qt4 , the editor - related parts took longer than anticipated since a lot of code had to change due to the arguably better way that Qt4 handles text editing .
The code shrinks quite a bit in the process ( 20 % or so , per the line counts ) , so that 's hopefully good ;)
The debugging will surely take quite some time .
I'm in the process of getting admin rights to the sourceforge project and setting up an SVN repository for the code .
The upcoming version will be 2.0 , and I hope to add some features to it before it 's final .
I 'm sure of Ocamlbuild support .
Any other features that people would like ?
I 'll keep you guys posted , this is obviously a " slightly " * larger project than initially anticipated , but the codebase is OK to work with , and it 'll have way more features than anything done from scratch in a weekend would ;)
My plan is to have the final 2.0 release support all OCaml builds out of the box on Windows ( MSVC , MinGW and Cygwin ) , although I will put 3.11.0 as the minimum supported version of OCaml due to debugger and other woes .
Linux and OSX will also be supported ; Linux - wise I can only test on FC9 , but bug reports will be welcome of course .
Cheers , Kuba * - " slightly " in the log scale , so just one order of magnitude is " not much " ;)
> In the meantime , is there a public source control with the current version > or a tarball ?
( I 'd just like to take a look at the code , not necessarily > run it ) .
SVN is in the usual sourceforge. net location .
The original 1.1 release from a couple years ago is tagged , and I 'm chopping away at it in the trunk .
Browse it at : http://camelia.svn.sourceforge.net/
Checkout : svn co https://camelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/camelia camelia
I know that the indenter support will be gone at least for the alpha version , as the indenter needs a revamp -- the QSyntaxHighlighter machinery can be ( ab) used to modify the text in - place , and will most likely host all of the indenter .
Right now , indenter has a big bunch of regexps and is a bit hard on the eyes .
What I will do instead is to tokenize each line and work off the token stream ; I expect this will cut the code size a lot .
The syntax highlighter has a notion of state for each line , and the state of preceding line , and is automatically invoked by Qt whenever the lines change .
I have to check , but I think it is also invoked when the state of the preceding line changes .
So it 's fairly easy to work with .
Anyway , the plan is not to drop features , so the final release will have a hopefully nice indenter and whatnot .
Also note that I 'm submitting everything to SVN pretty much as I go , and I try to keep the code compileable , so if anyone feels like contributing , let me know .
It may be easier to work on it once it all gets to compile , which is still one file away and I will of course brag once it hits the " it compiles and pretends to run " mark .
Autocompletion

I have written smart autocompletion based on the toplevel in a mode I call SOLID .
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~pengzang/tools.html
I 've never gotten around to announcing it because it takes time to polish up and write good doc ... time that I have n't had of late .
However , I have been using it myself for a while and a handful of random people have emailed me about it and it works with them so , it may work for you .
Now seems as good a time as any to tell people about since I 've held off for over a year saying anything ..

Broken home children are ' five times more likely to suffer mental troubles '
Children from broken families are nearly five times more likely to suffer damaging mental troubles than those whose parents stay together , Government research has found .
It also showed that two parents are much better than one if children are to avoid slipping into emotional distress and anti-social behaviour .
The findings say that children ’s family backgrounds are as important - if not more so - than whether their home is poor , workless , has bad health , or has no one with any educational qualifications .
Difficult start : Children raised by a single parent are more likely to suffer distress
The research adds to a wealth of data that shows children suffer badly from divorce or parental break - up , and that those brought up by a single parent are more likely to do badly at school , suffer poor health , and fall into crime , addiction and poverty as adults .
The report , funded by the Department of Health and published by the Office for National Statistics , investigated emotional disorders - ranked as those which cause considerable distress and interference with the way in which children perform at school and during play .
It also looked at conduct disorders which result in aggressive , violent or anti-social behaviour .
The researchers studied nearly 8,000 children aged between five and 16 in 2004 and found almost one in ten had disorders .
The children were checked again last year .
The report said that a child whose parents had split during this time was more than four and a half times more likely to have developed an emotional disorder than one whose parents stayed together .
They were nearly three times more likely to exhibit a conduct disorder .
Eleven per cent of those children whose families broke up had emotional disorders , against 3 per cent among those whose families were still together .
Nearly a third of children found to have mental disorders in 2004 still suffered from them three years later .
The Department of Health said : ‘ The Government is committed to helping children and young people experiencing mental health problems . ’
But academic Patricia Morgan , author of several studies on family break - up , said : ‘ This does not come as a surprise , and things are going to get worse .
‘ Broken families and serial fathers produce homes full of conflict and chaos and they are terrible for children . ’
Google Destroyed Feedburner
I used to see a decent amount of ad dollar revenue via Feedburner .
High quality ads , a few grand a month , all of which I plowed back into development .
Feedburner essentially paid for the new site redesign .
Then Google took them over , and its been a total clusterf * &k ever since .
They replaced a quality ad program with Adsense -- and its total shit now .
Utterly embarrassingly dreck .
How worthless it is ?
The revenue dropped about 90 % .
Gee , why are n't you folks reading TBP clicking on payday loan ads and mortgage broker leads ?
Google took a wonderful RSS feeder -- and its still an excellent RSS / email feeder -- and made it irrelevant .
Formerly strewn intelligent , higher end advertising , and completely destroyed it .
Customer service is a disaster , the interface blows , Adsense is a pain in the ass -- Feedburner has become utterly worthless as an advertising platform .
October ads threw off under $ 500 , down 75 % from the pre-Google days , despite RSS feeds more than doubling over the past 3 months .
Do n't be evil ?
How about " Do n't be sucky ? "
To give you an idea of how irrelevant the ads served by Adsense are , yesterday , the Big Picture RSS feed had 40,305 Ad Impressions , which generated a grand total of how many Clicks ?
How about 17 , or 0.04 % .
That 's about what you would get from people accidentally clicking ads when navigating their email .
Its just god-awful .
Anyone have any good alternative suggestions for another RSS feed ?
I am looking for simple RSS , with quality , relevant ads .
The RSS traffic is between 25,000 and 30,000 .

In the next three years the military plans to activate and train an estimated 4,700 service members for specialized domestic operations , according to Air Force Gen.
Gene Renuart , commander of U.S. Northern Command , which was created in 2002 for homeland defense missions .
The comments , made at the annual National Homeland Defense and Security Symposium in Colorado Springs last week , reveal more details about the recent stationing of active military personnel inside United States borders for what officials say is a mission centering around responding to catastrophic emergencies .
In September the Army Times reported that the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team — a unit based in Fort Stewart , Ga. , that most recently spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle gear — would be put under the control of Northern Command , located on Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs .
Military representatives claim that the unit , now referred to as the Consequence Management Response Force , is only supposed to assist in responding to terrorist attacks or natural disasters , but that has n’t stopped numerous civil liberties advocates from speculating just how closely the military will be involved with law enforcement issues falling under a state ’s jurisdiction .
“ This is n’t a military police brigade or a civil affairs brigade .
This is actually a combat brigade being assigned a domestic mission , ” said Mike German , national security counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union ’s legislative office in Washington . , D.C .
The ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act Request last week with the Department of Justice and the Pentagon asking for records relating to the assignment of domestic forces to the Northern Command .
“ One of our founding touchstones of democracy is that the military is not to be used against the American people .
Over a hundred years ago that sentiment was put into law in the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibited the military from being involved in law enforcement functions , ” German said .
“ Our hope is to find as much information as we can to challenge whether this is appropriate or not and to create some public awareness about what ’s going on ”
Now the commander of Northern Command claims that at least two more military units will be stationed inside the county in the next two years , contributing to an estimated total of 4,700 specially trained service members .
“ It ’s to help us manage the consequences of a large - scale event , ” said Renuart .
“ We have one [ unit ] now trained and equipped and assigned to the Northern Command .
We ’ll grow a second one this calendar year of 2009 and a third one in the calender year 2010 so we can provide the nation three sets of capabilities that could respond to an event of the size of 9/11 or larger . ”
According to Renuart , that means the units will have unique training in the logistics and medical fields .
“ These are medical personnel , they ’re chemical decontamination teams , they ’re engineering teams , they ’re logistics folks , ” Renuart said .
“ It is really a force designed to respond to an event of catastrophic size .
There have been some who say that this is designed as a law enforcement activity or that it will somehow be used to take away the authorities of a governor or a state , and that ’s absolutely not the case . ”
But German is n’t convinced .
“ It ’s fine for the general to say that , ” the counter - terrorist operations specialist said .
“ But we want to know what the policies actually are , what the roles are and what the regulations are to see whether this is actually complying with the law . ”
During the symposium Renuart admitted that the Northern Command has assisted regularly with law enforcement activities in the past .
“ Here in Colorado every day we ’re integrated with 45 other federal agencies in our headquarters planning for not only the natural disasters , but what would happen if a chemical attack was brought into our country by a terrorist organization , ” Renuart said , emphasizing the command ’s roles with intelligence and supporting anti-drug efforts .
“ How do we track intelligence information that might identify networks of terrorists that might be around the world trying to get to us ?
How do we support law enforcement every day in the fight against narcotics entering illegally in our southwest borders ?
All of these things are part of the Northern Command mission . ”
Said German , “ It seems to be an incremental approach where the military is being used for narrow missions , but then more and more types of narrow missions until they all combine into one overarching mission . ”
It is currently unknown what units may be assigned to domestic tasks in the next two years , but members of Northern Command will undergo a large - scale exercise this month simulating a destructive earthquake in southern California .

When does autorelease release ?
Calling autorelease on an object will call that object to be release d just after the current run loop has finished running the current event , for example after your mouseDown returns control back to the runtime .
That way , autoreleased objects get killed quickly .
BUT creating a “ top level ” autorelease pool in main .m before NSApplicationMain starts will cause objects to be released after NSApplicationMain returns , that is when your application quits and you release the pool you created .
int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { //
Create our pool id pool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; //
Call some code that will alloc and autorelease objects ... //
Run app int r = NSApplicationMain ( argc , ( const char **) argv ) ; //
Release our pool : objects allocated and autoreleased before NSApplicationMain will get killed here [ pool release ] ; return r ; }
This can be problematic if you want your objects to be released sooner .
Luckily , we can create and destroy autorelease pools whenever we want , so we can release that first pool as long as we keep a global reference to it .
@implementation MyAutoreleasePool static id autoreleasePool ; + ( void)allocAutoreleasePool { autoreleasePool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; } + ( void)deallocAutoreleasePool { [ autoreleasePool release ] ; } @end
[ MyAutoreleasePool allocAutoreleasePool ]
main.m
[ MyAutoreleasePool deallocAutoreleasePool ]
awakeFromNib
Callin , then callin ( for example ) the application delegate's .
You 'll then need to create a new autorelease pool , and that one will behave like you expect : killing objects on time .
US report paints grim outlook on Afghanistan Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008

WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Fears over the Afghanistan conflict rose another notch Thursday , amid reports of a bleak draft US intelligence assessment detailing its slide into corruption , drugs and insurgent violence .
" The trends across the board are not going in the right direction , " Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters at a breakfast .
" It will be tougher next year unless we get at all these challenges . "
The New York Times said the draft National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) casts doubts on the ability of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to stem the resurgence of the Taliban Islamic militia .
A spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence would not acknowledge the existence of such an NIE on Afghanistan .
And a US intelligence official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told AFP the assessment process was still in its early stages and " its conclusions are premature . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she expected to be briefed soon on the classified assessment , which represents the consensus view of 16 US intelligence agencies .
" We have asked for the intelligence community to take a look , it 's important that it do so , " Rice told reporters during a meeting in Washington with Maris Riekstins , Latvia 's foreign minister .
" I would just cite that Afghanistan is a difficult place .
It has made progress since 2001 .
We have all talked about new circumstances that have arisen there , and we are doing a review to see what more we can do , " she added .
A US military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told AFP that the downbeat " tone and direction " of the intelligence assessment was not unexpected .
" We heard about this for several weeks , and ( were ) not surprised by the tone it conveyed -- that the situation in Afghanistan was getting worse , certainly not better , and that a lot more attention was needed to try to remedy what is going on , " said the official .
The White House has already launched an urgent strategy review led by Lieutenant General Douglas Lute , a deputy national security adviser and coordinator of the US war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Defense Department , State Department , Treasury and other key government agencies are taking part in the review , US officials have said .
Rice said the State Department was reviewing its operations , including those involving the Provincial Reconstruction Teams where civilian experts travel with military protection to remote parts of the country to help rebuild it .
" We are looking also at what we can do to be more supportive of the ministries that President Karzai has put up , " she added .
Lute will lead a team of specialists to Afghanistan to review the situation , the Times said , citing a senior administration official .
General David McKiernan , the top US commander in Afghanistan , has asked for four more combat brigades and support forces -- as many as 20,000 more US troops -- to beef up the 33,000 - strong US force battling an intensifying insurgency .
So far , the administration has promised one combat brigade by February , citing constraints imposed by the war in Iraq .
Military commanders have warned that a political solution is needed , but that corruption and a flourishing narcotics trade are undermining public support for the central government .
The draft intelligence estimate concludes that the breakdown in central authority in Afghanistan has been accelerated by rampant corruption within the Karzai government and by increasingly sophisticated insurgent attacks from safe havens in Pakistan , the Times said .
The report says the heroin trade by some estimates accounts for 50 percent of Afghanistan 's economy , it said .
Militant networks operating from Pakistan , meanwhile , have coalesced into a more complex insurgency capable of more sophisticated military operations , US military officials have said .
The Washington Post said the NIE describes a Pakistan - based extremist network with three elements : Pakistani extremists allied with Kashmiri militants ; Afghan Taliban ; and traditional tribal groups in western Pakistan that assist the other groups .
" Al - Qaeda , composed largely of Arabs , and increasingly , Uzbeks , Chechens and other Central Asians , is described as sitting atop the structure , providing money and training to the others in exchange for sanctuary , " the newspaper said .
Bad Credit and Loan Opportunities : The Basics
There are problems with the current lending industry .
It seems as though the people with the most money and the least need for a loan are the ones that can walk into a bank anywhere and instantly get an offer for credit .
However , if you ’re dealing with an emergency situation , and you ’re one of the millions of us that only have a basic income , loans are hard to come by .
Loans that you can get into your bank account quickly are practically impossible .
That ’s because credit agencies and financial companies are reluctant to forget any issues that their clients might have had with money in the past .
Whether you accidentally forget to send a payment to a creditor on time one month , or you got into a bad situation and defaulted on your loan , that ’s something that ’s going to stay with you for years .
Credit scores are some of the most complicated and stressful things that we need to deal with as adults in search of financial independence .
However , even if you do n’t have the best credit going , you might still be able to get your hands on the lending opportunities that you need .
You just need to look in the right places .
Whenever you apply for a loan , whether it ’s offline or online , the company that you ’re going to be borrowing from will need to make a judgement about who you are , and how trustworthy you might be .
They may ask you to answer a few questions about your current lifestyle and lending habits , but most of the time , there ’s only one thing that ’s going to make or break their decision : your credit score .
Your credit score is essentially the information that tells a bank , credit union , or any other lender whether you ’re reliable enough to get a loan .
Unfortunately , while it takes years to develop a positive credit score , and a lot of hard work , one mistake can very easily bring your entire credit rating crashing down on top of you .
In fact , you might even have a bad credit score if you have n’t had any loans in the past at all .
A thin credit file is almost as bad as a poor credit rating , because it means that there ’s no evidence to prove whether you ’re going to be trustworthy with your cash or not .
Whether you ’re struggling with a thin credit file , or just a bad score , your opportunities for getting loans will be limited .
You wo n’t be able to simply apply for the best deals that your banks and other lenders have to offer , because you ’ll have nothing to prove yourself with .
However , that does n’t mean that you ’re completely out of luck .
The complexity of credit scores , and the fact that all of us sometimes need a little extra help with money has lead to the creation of something called “ bad credit loans ” .
What Kind of Loans Can You Get with Bad Credit ?
So , what is a bad credit loan ?
Well , the first thing you need to know is that it ’s not a loan that allows a provider to simply ignore your credit score entirely .
In the US , no such loan exists .
Every company will be forced to check your credit rating before they give you a loan – to ensure that you can afford their services .
Alternatively , poor credit loans are opportunities that have been designed specifically for people who have n’t had the best relationship with their finances in the past .
These credit options might pay less attention to your credit score than traditional lending opportunities , or they might give the lender extra security in the form of something that you agree to give up if you ca n’t pay what you owe .
The most common forms of bad credit loans available include :
Secured loans :
With a secured loan , you agree that you ’ll give the lender something of value that you own if you default on what you borrow .
This might be your car or your home .
With a secured loan , you agree that you ’ll give the lender something of value that you own if you default on what you borrow .
This might be your car or your home .
Guarantor loans :
If you do n’t have any security to offer , then someone else can promise to pay your debt for you or put their own home or property up as security .
If you do n’t have any security to offer , then someone else can promise to pay your debt for you or put their own home or property up as security .
Payday loans :
These are the fastest form of bad credit loans with no guarantor , where lenders consider whether you ’re earning enough money right now to pay back what you borrow , rather than focusing entirely on your credit history .
Often , the fastest and least stressful way to borrow money if you do n’t have good credit is with a payday loan .
Unlike with the other options , which require you to agree to meetings with financial advisors , and deal with long application processes , a payday loan can take a matter of minutes .
You fill out a form online and get approved within hours .
What ’s more , you can even get your money sent to you within a day by some companies .
There ’s no need to worry about putting your property up as collateral with a payday loan either .
That ’s because these loans are “ unsecured ” .
Since you ’ll be paying everything you owe back in one chunk , rather than over a long period of time , there ’s a lot less risk to worry about for your lender .
How Do You Apply for a Bad Credit Loan ?
If you ’re looking for a loan as quickly as possible when you ’re struggling from bad credit , your best option will always be to go for a payday loan .
Not only are these loan options much easier to apply for , but they come with far fewer stipulations too .
With a payday loan , you do n’t need to convince anyone that you need to borrow the money for a specific reason .
Provided that you ’re located within one of the states where it ’s possible to take out a payday loan in the US , then all you need to do is track down the company that you feel most comfortable borrowing from .
You can check out a number of alternative options and pick the one that gives you the best customer service , the lowest fees , and the best interest rates .
Do n’t forget to pay attention to the terms and conditions that are laid out on the website of the company that you ’re applying for a loan with too .
There will usually be a page on the website that highlights the factors that the loan provider will look for in a borrower .
Examining these terms before you begin your application can boost your chances of success significantly .
Although every business will have it ’s own specific requirements , most will look for :
Evidence that you ’re living within the US and that you ’re an official citizen
Evidence that you have a long - term job that pays you a regular wage
Information on how much you earn each month
Proof that you have n’t had any recent bankruptcies to worry about
A current account that your money can be paid into
An email address and contact number
Remember , the rules and regulations around payday loans and short - term lending can differ significantly depending on where you are in the United States .
It ’s worth checking what the rules are in your state before you make any applications .
Is it Hard to Get a Loan with Bad Credit ?
There are a lot of loans that are very difficult to access when you do n’t have ideal credit .
Bank loans like personal loans are often a common problem for many people .
Even getting a guarantor loan or a secured loan can be difficult , depending on your history with your finances .
However , a payday loan is something else entirely .
If you ’re lucky enough to be located in one of the states that approve payday lending , then you can save yourself a lot of pain and headaches by applying for a payday loan instead of any other short - term lending options .
Not only will this solution help you to rapidly get the money you need in an emergency , but it will also simplify your loan opportunities significantly too .
Taking out a payday loan could actually benefit your credit situation too .
Although there are a lot of other ways that you can work on improving your credit over time , the quickest way to show the credit agencies how trustworthy you are is with a loan .
When you take out a short - term payday loan , you can show the agencies that you have what it takes to stick to the rules and regulations laid out by your loan provider .
What ’s more , because you ’re paying off the loan in one chunk after your next payday , you do n’t have to worry about what might happen to your credit score if something goes wrong with your income in the months to come .
Unlike with a traditional loan , you ’ll be getting in and out of debt within a month or less , so you do n’t even have to change your budget long - term .
You can get the money you need , boost your credit score a little , and do it all with extra speed too .
Is now the perfect time for you to consider your own short - term loan ?

Adam Gadahn , a California native now living in Pakistan who has been indicted in a Los Angeles court for treason , said in a half - hour video speech that the economic woes serve as evidence of punishment to the " enemies of Islam . "
" A crisis whose primary cause , in addition to the abortive and unsustainable crusades they are waging in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iraq , is their turning their backs on Allah 's revealed laws , " he stated .
Arab and Muslim leaders also expressed joy over the American crisis .

A quickly released follow - up test build of Mac OS X 10.5.6 comes with no known problems and points to Apple getting much closer to a finished patch .
Build 9G38 , whose seed notes were posted online late Saturday by HMBT , is said by Apple to have no known issues and comes just three days after build 9G35 , which had only only a few problems to target of its own .
The removal of any known glitches from these lists is n't by itself an indication that 10.5.6 is ready but does show Apple in the very last stages of its development cycle , which usually only leave a small amount of testing for those areas of the software the company believes may still contain hidden bugs .
Apple 's fixed item list is relatively small and touches on synching as a whole , problems with DVI output and the Superdrive , and downloading playlists .
As with the version released earlier in the week , 9G38 is said to focus on MobileMe and the automatic sync process , especially with those networks where lag and bandwidth are known concerns .
It also asks testers to check transfer performance when they sync from Me.com rather than a computer or a mobile device .
An extra focus is on sending mail either partly or entirely in non-Latin languages , such as Chinese or Hangul .
Apple 's engineering team also reportedly wants to hear of any problems that hard - lock the system in a kernel panic or freeze .
Tesla Motors , the fledgling maker of electric sports cars , admitted today it is losing money and in a “ critical phase ” financially .
An undisclosed number of Tesla ’s 250 employees will be laid off ( and the current chief executive will move to the board of directors ) , and its Detroit - area office will be shut down .
Further delays and setbacks for the company ’s production and growth plans were also announced .
Interestingly , these developments come at a time when the public ’s interest in electric cars seems to have taken off , given the reaction to General Motors ’ recent showing of the production - ready Chevrolet Volt and the introduction of several new electric protypes at the Paris Motor Show this month .
Elon Musk , the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has been the chief investor in Tesla , said in a blog posting Wednesday on the company ’s Web site that with SpaceX , his separate project to develop private - enterprise rockets for outer space , having achieved its first successful launch , he now has more time to devote to turning Tesla into a profitable venture .
So Mr. Musk is taking over as chief executive officer of the company .
He described the moves as “ a modest reduction in near - term headcount ” at the company ’s San Carlos , Calif. , headquarters and a further reduction resulting from a “ consolidation ” of satellite operations .
Other factors — beyond the recent difficulties of raising capital — may be involved .
In a separate posting last month on her blog , Mr. Musk ’s wife , Justine , a novelist , said she is divorcing him .
It is unclear what effect a divorce , and its impact on Mr. Musk ’s holdings , might have on financing for new - product development and manufacturing .
Mr. Musk has previously held the titles of product architect and executive chairman , since joining the company in 2004 , a year after its founding .
The former chief executive , Ze ’ev Drori , will stay on Tesla ’s board of directors , Mr. Musk said .
Mr. Drori had taken over the chief executive duties last November after the company ’s founders , Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning , left .
Opinions vary as to whether they were pushed out or quit .
Either way , the turmoil - roiled company ’s first vehicle , its $ 100,000 Tesla Roadster , has now endured many delays .
The first production model was finally delivered ( to Mr. Musk ) in February .
General production , which began in March , has been slowed by reports of a balky transmission , which is being replaced , and in turn , a slow ramp - up in production capability .
As of mid-September , the company said 27 vehicles had been delivered to customers .
The company announced in August 2006 that it had successfully solicited $ 100,000 deposits from 100 prospective buyers , to whom delivery was promised beginning in mid-2007 .
As of last May , Tesla reported that it had 600 firm orders for its cars , and 400 more customers on waiting lists .
The latest delays push back until at least December the point at which Tesla will have the production capability for up to 100 vehicles a month , Mr. Drori had noted recently in a separate announcement .
Tesla also is continuing a profitable venture , producing powertrains for other car companies , Mr. Musk noted .
Development has been suspended , Mr. Musk said , on the company ’s next vehicle , the Model S , while the company awaits funding from promised federal loan guarantees .
“ If all goes reasonably well , ” Mr. Musk said in his blog posting , “ we will receive that approval in Q2 next year . ”
That funding is contingent upon completion of a planned San Jose plant , and its passing environment certification .
That should delay the new model about a year from its originally promised production date , until mid-2011 , he said .
Mr. Musk thanked customers , who he said have stuck with the company “ through thick and thin , ” and promised to reward them with a secret viewing of the Model S prototype .
No time frame was promised , however , for that sneak preview .
" The whole country is calling each other . "
" We did it . "
" It 's over . "
" He 's already won . "
" I thank my lucky stars
I got you in my arms . "
said she teared up after voting today .
She said she was proud of our president — finally , for the first time in her adult life .
And as I drove to Oakland , it was obvious she was n't the only one .
One city over , a crowd of people were counting down the seconds to 8:00 , when results would be announced , at the Democratic Club in Alameda .
But I walked in the door as it came up on the screen : Barack Obama was our next President .
Everyone cheered .
Several people wiped their eyes .
My cell phone rang — it was my girlfriend — but I could n't call her back , because cell phones stopped working everywhere , because everyone was already calling their friends with the news .
" President Obama , " someone said .
" I told you .
President Obama .
" A black woman in a dirt - colored windbreaker watched to the left of me .
She had a birth mark on her face , and her hair was pulled back in a frizzy pony tail .
" I never had a doubt , " she said .
" I never had a doubt .
" A young black boy smiled , held his arms over his head , and said " Yes we can . " " Yes we did , " someone said .
" God bless America .
" People were jumping up and down , and there was hugging .
Most of the people in the room were white , and mostly young , but I saw an older blonde woman with a big necklace around her neck .
She was tearing up .
So was an older guy in a baseball cap .
So was the woman in the pony tail who'd said " I never had a doubt . "
So was I.
At the side of the room was a smiling cut - out of Barack Obama .
" California made him win , " someone said .
" California is what did it . "
A woman raised her fist over her head .
" Obama , y'all ! "
On the street , I heard a stranger shouting " Obama .
Whooo ! "
And then I left to drive to a celebration party at Everett and Jones , a big barbecue restaurant near Oakland 's Jack London square .
At the restaurant , people had screamed when the victory was announced .
A news crew filmed people jumping , hugging , waving flags , dancing , and weeping .
" Thank you Jesus , " the restaurant 's owner said , over and over again , clapping her hands .
" 400 years !
We won ! "
" I wish my mother and father was here , " another woman said .
" My mother always worked at the polls , and she always told us to vote .
And to believe in ourselves .
" Near the restaurant , one street had been blocked off , where a band was performing .
There were small balloons woven into an arc — red , white , and blue .
Cars drove by honking .
Even a truck honked its horn .
One honking jeep drove by with two American flags .
I heard later they were honking horns in Washington D.C. , and in New York .
All across America , horns are honking .
Three hours later , I 'd hear horns start honking again .
A black guy stood at the side of the street dangling an Obama t- shirt to the passing crowds .
Later he started dancing — squatting and then kicking .
I saw a black kid on his parents shoulders waving an American flag .
I had trouble finding parking , and the barbecue joint was so packed it was nearly impossible to move around .
The TV showed a shot of Sarah Palin , and some people booed and held up downturned thumbs .
We could n't hear McCain 's concession speech , but were only seeing his expression .
Someone said that " He never had a chance .
" I saw two black women leaving the crowd .
Their eyes looked moist , and that made me mist up too .
A young white woman from the Oakland Tribune asked me questions about the election — are you excited ?
What do you expect Obama to do ?
What 's the first thing you 're going to do tomorrow ?
I started to say that I 'd watch everything tomorrow that I missed tonight — that it seemed sad to watch TV tonight when you could be out with the people .
I told her I 'd been there when they 'd counted down to 8 o'clock , and when they 'd said Obama was President .
I choked up .
She thanked me , and moved to someone else .
" This is history right now , Oakland , " a woman said from the stage .
" This is what we do .
" Everywhere I looked I saw cell phones and PDAs .
Everyone was still calling everyone else .
I found the line for barbecued food — but it was long .
After I 'd waited for five minutes , I saw the man in front of me greeted by one of his friends .
They were both black , and the friend said " I 'm so proud .
This has been a long , long coming . "
He did n't say " time " — just a long , long coming .
A reporter from the Oakland Tribune was interviewing a grey - haired black man behind me .
Five minutes later , they were still talking .
A lot of the crowd were proudly wearing Obama t- shirts .
I saw an " Obama on the cover of Time magazine " t- shirt .
And an " Obama on the cover of Ebony " t- shirt .
One shirt just said " Black man running , and it ai n't from the police .
" There was a bright light in the sky .
It took me several seconds before I realized it was a helicopter sweeping the crowd .
Everyone cheered and waved .
Three different people held their hands over their heads , making the " O " sign .
A younger man with dreadlocks and a goatee said " I never really thought I 'd see something like this happen in my lifetime . "
A local news crew filmed him saying Obama had the support not only of African Americans , but everybody .
" So America can be what it 's destined to be — a melting pot .
" A woman from the restaurant was cooking dozens of big dinner sausages on a wide outdoor grill , wearing a sequined " Uncle Sam " hat .
The band sang a funk song .
I heard the reporter from the Tribune say he was out of ink .
Yes we can .
NICE , France  President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia retreated Friday from his threat to deploy missiles on Europe ’s borders , but only if President - elect Barack Obama joined Russia and France in calling for a conference on European security by next summer .
At a meeting in Nice hosted by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , Mr. Medvedev backed away from the bellicose speech he gave last week , just hours after Mr. Obama won the United States presidential election .
On Friday , the Russian leader argued instead that all countries “ should refrain from unilateral steps ” before discussions on European security next summer .
Mr. Sarkozy , who presided over the meeting between Russia and the 27 European Union nations in his capacity as the union ’s president , helped ease the way for Mr. Medvedev ’s retreat .
The French leader supported the idea of talks on a new security architecture for Europe and suggested that they could be held by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in June or July .
Both Russia and the United States belong to the organization .
Mr. Sarkozy made clear that he wants the United States to think again about the missile defense systems that it plans to build in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Mr. Medvedev last week threatened to respond by stationing missiles in Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave bordering Poland and Lithuania , both of which are members of NATO and the European Union .
I wanted to be a digital nomad before anybody -- before the term existed ; before the technology existed ; before most people even imagined that it would someday be possible to earn a living without ever being in the same place as your coworkers , bosses , customers , or clients .
Other people may have become digital nomads before I did , but nobody wanted to be one before I did .
Three obstacles define the three paths to being a digital nomad .
First , there was the technological barrier -- one that has been largely overcome by the earliest digital nomads .
The Road - Warriors
People whose regular job required constant travel -- salesmen , executives , managers and technical folks with far - flung teams -- were nomads before they were digital nomads .
It was on their behalf that the technology was gradually beaten into submission .
I knew a lot of these folks -- people who paid top - dollar for a computer ( just ) small enough that it would fit into a suitcase and ( barely ) light enough to be carried by one person .
An excellent article in a recent Economist , quotes Paul Saffo as saying that " nomads " is the wrong term for those early strivers :
Since these machines , large and small , were portable , people assumed that they also made their owners mobile .
Not so .
The proper metaphor for somebody who carries portable but unwieldy and cumbersome infrastructure is that of an astronaut rather than a nomad .
Exactly so .
The technological barrier is down , now .
The equipment is small , cheap , and highly functional .
( Although there are still challenges even with modern high - tech gear .
For some nitty - gritty details on actually getting things done while on the road , see High - Tech and Homeless . )
I never wanted to be a road - warrior , though .
Having to show up every day at one specific workspace was bad enough -- I most definitely did n't want to put myself in the position of having to show up at dozens of different specific workspaces .
It was one of the paths that has eventually led to a kind of digital nomad , but not the path for me .
Long before the technology really supported the road - warrier , it became good enough ( and cheap enough ) that it was practical to create a fully functional workspace that was n't at the office .
The technological barrier , although not yet down , had become low enough that it could be easily stepped over .
But close behind was a series of management and personal barriers .
The Telecommuters
People whose regular job can be done on a computer were digital before they were nomads .
For almost twenty years now , the technology has been good enough that pretty much any digital job could be done at home , or really , anywhere -- as long as " anywhere " was one specific place where the equipment could be set up and a data connection established .
Bosses never liked telecommuting -- if they could n't walk over and see you working , they were pretty sure that you probably were n't .
And , since the sort of jobs that could be done entirely on a computer over a data link tended to also be the sort where managers -- even managers with a good bit of technical savvy -- had no idea how much work was actually involved in any particular task , there was n't really any other way to tell if someone was working hard or hardly working .
The result of all that was that most managers would only let certain employees telecommute -- the ones they trusted to work hard without supervision , and certain other key technical people who might leave the company if their whim to telecommute was n't indulged .
Once the equipment got cheap -- especially after it got cheap enough that employees could afford to buy their own -- employers were quite prepared for employees to have workspaces at home .
But that was just so that the employees could work more , not so they could quit coming into the office .
Still , telecommuting has grown .
Lots of people do it now .
Especially since fuel got so expensive , there has been a surge in people working at home one or two days a week .
Obviously that saves time and fuel , while still giving the boss the chance to observe them working on the other days .
With the technical barriers down , though , the mere telecommuter can now be a digital nomad .
The boss may imagine you sitting in a home office , working on desktop machine not much different from the one in your cubicle , but there 's nothing to keep you from taking your laptop to the library or the coffee shop or the public park -- anywhere you can get a network connection .
In fact , if there 's no danger of being urgently called into the office , there 's nothing to keep you from taking your laptop literally anywhere -- even halfway around the world .
Telecommuting is a second path to being a digital nomad .
I did a little telecommuting , but it was n't for me .
To thrive as a telecommuter you need to be both self - motivating and self - limiting .
Too little of the former , and you 're not productive .
Too little of the latter and your home office turns into a home sweatshop .
( It 's very easy to find yourself working from 6 AM until 10 PM , checking email at all hours , feeling pressure to be always - accessible since people can't just catch you in the hallway at the office . )
With just a little experience at it , I found that I suffered from both those deficiencies , so I avoided telecommuting after that .
The hard work of crossing the managerial barrier is largely done -- telecommuting is a fact and most companies have policies allowing limited forms already .
You can't really look to others to cross the personal barriers for you -- you have to do that yourself .
If you find your way past those , there 's really only one remaining barrier -- money -- that keeps people off the ultimate path for the digital nomad .
The Freelancers
The technology is cheap and easy .
If you do n't have a regular job , you do n't need to get anyone 's permission to telecommute .
As a freelancer , you can work wherever , whenever , and however you want .
The limiting factor is earning enough money to support yourself .
You can freelance at just about anything .
Software is big , as is writing ( fiction , non-fiction , screenplays , poetry , blogs ... ) , and the arts ( graphic design , photography , music , sculpture , painting , drawing , architecture ... ) .
Especially big are the specific tasks that came of age at the same time as the technology of the digital nomad -- freelance web design , for example .
There are freelance researchers , freelance editors , freelance accountants , freelance technical support .
Of course , you 're really only a digital nomad if a large fraction of your freelance work can be done digitally -- there 's not much call for digital massage therapy or digital hairstyling -- but the range of things that can be done on - line keeps growing .
If you 're of an entrepreneurial bent ( or know someone who is ) , you can go the route of the " virtual corporation " -- put together ( or join ) a small team of people who come together to create a new product , outsource anything that they do n't have the expertise to do themselves , and once they 're done , go their separate ways .
( This sort of thing is very scalable .
See Tim Ferriss 's
The 4 - Hour Workweek for some examples of what amounts to one - person versions of this sort of business .
There 's also some info in my review of the book from last year . )
You can make money at any of these things .
Some people can make a lot of money doing freelance work .
But for most people , freelance work is going to pay less than they can get working a regular job .
To make it pay even a large fraction as much will likely require working a whole second parallel job ( marketing your freelance service ) plus a third parallel job ( managing the business -- invoicing , collecting , accounting , etc ) .
This is why I talk so much about frugality .
Maybe you can earn a lot of money and maybe you can 't -- but anybody can get by on less money .
And , if you can get by on what you can earn freelancing as a digital nomad , you can be as free as anyone has been since hunter - gatherers took up agriculture .
It 's what I 've always wanted to do .

Brain Connections
Diffusion spectrum imaging , developed by Van Wedeen at Massachusetts General Hospital , analyzes magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data in new ways , letting scientists map the nerve fibers that carry information between cells .
These images , generated from a living human brain , show a reconstruction of the entire brain ( 1 ) and a subset of fibers ( 2 ) .
The red fibers in the middle and lower left of both images are part of the corpus callosum connecting the brain hemispheres .
Mapping Diffusion
Neural fibers in the brain are too tiny to image directly , so scientists map them by measuring the diffusion of water molecules along their length .
The scientists first break the MRI image into voxels ( 3D pixels ) and calculate the speed at which water is moving through each voxel in every direction .
Then they can infer the most likely path of the various nerve fibers ( red and blue lines ) passing through that spot .
The result is a detailed diagram like that of the brain stem ( 3 ) .

Buffing the Brain By Bryan Appleyard
The Sunday Times , November 16 , 2008 Edited by Andy Ross
The brain is crème caramel mix of fat , water , and proteins .
This is a problem for baby - boomers .
The selves they love are just so many crème caramels soon to pass their sell - by date .
In the early 1990s , with the development of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , we found out how to watch the brain at work .
If MRI delivers half of what many people expect it to deliver , these could turn out to be the most revolutionary machines in human history .
Mark Jung Beeman , a professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois , is one of a group trying to understand genius using MRI and EEG .
There are two ways of solving problems : analytic and inspirational .
With analytic you just plod your way through the work , reasoning your way to the solution .
When you stop , new connections can be formed .
Finally you reach the eureka moment , you say " Aha ! " and your problem is solved .
Beeman : " Although all problem - solving relies on a largely shared cortical network , the sudden flash of insight occurs when solvers engage distinct neural and cognitive processes that allow them to see connections that previously eluded them . "
The process seems to be centred on the anterior superior temporal gyrus .
At Goldsmiths College in London , Dr Joydeep Bhattacharya says the real issue is not the " Aha ! " moment itself , but the way it is produced in the brain : " We need to know the brain processes involved , to find how this moment is strong enough to reach consciousness .
We know insight does not come from the sky . "
There is a link between musical improvisation and the " Aha ! " moment .
Improvisation is found to be accompanied by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex .
The prefrontal cortex is to the brain what a conductor is to an orchestra .
It pulls the whole show together .
The dissociated pattern echoes the loosening of connections that precedes the " Aha ! " moment .
Insight and creativity , perhaps even genius , seem to be linked to a brain that can disorganise itself and freewheel , making new and unexpected connections .
Divergent thinkers habitually wander around their own minds , looking for links , however absurd or surreal .
In 1788 , one of the greatest of all examples of divergent thinking came into the world .
It was Mozart 's last symphony , the Jupiter .
There has always been a link between madness and genius , and too much divergence can undoubtedly drive you crazy .
High creativity is not linked with schizophrenia but with mood disorders — notably bipolar disorder or manic depression .
For a boomer with brain rot , the short answer is use it or lose it .
The plasticity of the brain means that it is able , in the face of injury or decay , to find ways of adapting itself to preserve strong patterns of activity .
Read good books — nothing works better .
In the end you die , and your crème caramel dies with you .
Mozart spent most of his 35 years giving the best ever account in music of why your life is worth living .
A New Theory of Mental Disorders By Benedict Carey
The New York Times , November 10 , 2008 Edited by Andy Ross Bernard Crespi , a biologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada , and Christopher Badcock , a sociologist at the London School of Economics , have published a theory of brain development that may change the way mental disorders like autism and schizophrenia are understood .
Their idea is that an evolutionary tug of war between genes from the father 's sperm and the mother 's egg can tip brain development in one of two ways .
A strong bias toward the father pushes a developing brain along the autistic spectrum , toward a fascination with objects , patterns , mechanical systems , at the expense of social development .
A bias toward the mother moves the growing brain along a psychotic spectrum , toward hypersensitivity to mood , increasing a child 's risk of developing schizophrenia later on , or of mood problems like bipolar disorder and depression .
Autism and schizophrenia are at opposite ends of a spectrum that includes most psychiatric and developmental brain disorders .
Emotional problems like depression , anxiety and bipolar disorder appear with schizophrenia on Mom 's side , while Asperger 's syndrome and other social deficits are on Dad's .
The theory leans heavily on the work of David Haig of Harvard , who argued in the 1990s that pregnancy was in part a biological struggle for resources between the mother and unborn child .
Natural selection should favor mothers who limit the nutritional costs of pregnancy and have more offspring , but it should also favor fathers whose offspring maximize the nutrients they receive during gestation .
Evidence that this struggle is being waged at the level of individual genes is accumulating .
An epigenetic effect changes the behavior of the gene without altering its chemical composition .
This occurs by muffling a gene with a marker that makes it hard for the cell to read the genetic code .
To illustrate how such genetic reshaping works , Crespi and Badcock point to a remarkable group of children .
Those with the genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome typically have a jerky gait , appear unusually happy and have difficulty communicating .
Those born with a genetic problem known as Prader - Willi syndrome often are placid and compliant as youngsters .
These two disorders stem from disruptions of the same genetic region on chromosome 15 .
If the father 's genes dominate in this location , the child develops Angelman syndrome .
If the mother 's do , the result is Prader - Willi syndrome .
The former is associated with autism , and the latter with mood problems and psychosis later on , just as the new theory predicts .
Progressive enhancement has become an established best - practice approach to standards - based development .
By starting with clean , semantic HTML , and layering enhancements using JavaScript and CSS , we attempt to create a usable experience for everyone : less sophisticated devices and browsers get a simpler but completely functional experience , while more capable ones get the bells and whistles .
Article Continues Below
That ’s the theory , at least .
But in practice , enhancements are still delivered to most devices , including those that only partially understand them — specifically older browsers and under featured mobile devices .
Users of these devices initially receive a perfectly functional page , but it ’s progressively “ enhanced ” into a mess of scripts and styles gone awry , entirely defeating the purpose of the approach .
So how do we build enhanced experiences while making sure all users get a functional site ?
By testing a device ’s capabilities up front , we can make informed decisions about the level of experience to deliver to that device .
Testing for capabilities #section2
Not long ago , we found that we could test portions of a device ’s CSS support using simple JavaScript .
It started with a simple box model test : we injected an element into the page , applied various styles to the element , and then used JavaScript to check whether the element was rendered properly .
function boxmodel ( ) { var newDiv = document.createElement ( 'div ' ) ; document.body.appendChild(newDiv ) ; newDiv.style.width = ' 20 px ' ; newDiv.style.padding = ' 10 px ' ; var divWidth = newDiv.offsetWidth ; document.body.removeChild(newDiv ) ; return divWidth == 40 ; }
Using the function above , we can pose the question , if ( boxmodel ( ) ) to find out if a browser properly supports the CSS box model .
If a feature is properly supported , we can safely enhance our page using this feature .
With this idea in mind , we wrote additional functions to test support for other CSS properties , such as :
float
clear
position
overflow
line - height
But testing CSS support does n’t cover everything .
Fortunately , we can also use techniques such as object detection to test a browser ’s JavaScript support .
We wrote additional functions to test commonly used JavaScript Objects , such as :
document.createElement ( )
document.getElementById ( )
xmlHttpRequest ()
window.onresize ( )
window.print ( )
We found that by running all of the tests above , we could get a good idea of whether or not a device would properly display the enhanced version of most of our clients ’ web applications .
Following up on this premise , I , along with my colleagues at Filament Group , developed testUserDevice.js , which tests the capabilities of a device before providing enhancements .
This script runs independently of any JavaScript libraries , weighs in at around 5 kb , and executes in five or six milliseconds .
The tests run by testUserDevice.js can be modified , added , or deleted to meet the requirements of a given website .
There are even options that allow you to run multiple test cases or a subset of tests to create multi- level user experiences .
Making use of the test results #section3
Integrating testUserDevice.js into a page is simple , just attach the JavaScript file to your page and call the following :
testUserDevice.init( ) ;
This will tell testUserDevice to begin running all available tests as soon as the body element is available in the DOM .
If all tests return with a passing score , the script will proceed to make enhancements .
For the sake of this article , let ’s take a look at a moderately complex form with some opportunities for enhancement .
First , we start with the most basic HTML and a simple linear layout .
Demo 1
CSS enhancements#section4
Once a device has successfully passed a given set of tests , testUserDevice.js will enable page enhancements in a number of ways .
By default , the following DOM modifications are made :
The class name enhanced is added to the body element .
is added to the body element .
Alternate stylesheet links with title attributes of ( title= “ enhanced ” ) are enabled .
) are enabled .
Inversely , all stylesheet links with title attributes of ( title= “ not_enhanced ” ) are disabled .
These page modifications provide several hooks that will allow you to set up layers of progressive enhancement .
For starters , the body class can be used along with CSS selectors to make small experience enhancements .
For example , you might have three div s that are stacked vertically at page load :
body div.example { margin : 1em 0 ; }
If the user ’s browser or device passes the test , these div s could be repositioned into three floated columns :
body .enhanced div.example { float : left ; width : 30 % ; margin : 0 ; }
Divs repositioned into three floated columns .
This works well for pages that contain only a few enhancements , but it would n’t make sense to write an entire advanced stylesheet using these conditional selectors .
For large enhancements , you can store advanced styles in alternate stylesheets .
By giving these alternate stylesheets a title of enhanced , they will be enabled in the event of a passed test .
For example , this :
< link rel= " alternate stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " enhanced.css " title= " enhanced " />
becomes this :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " enhanced.css " title= " enhanced " />
Of course , this is nothing more than a basic stylesheet switch , but the important point is that we ’ve set up our enhancements to show only in devices that can handle them properly .
As mentioned earlier , testUserDevice.js will also disable any stylesheets specified by a title attribute of ( title= " not_enhanced " ) .
This may not be necessary in most cases , but if you have basic stylesheets that will conflict with the enhanced ones , this is a nice way to keep them separated .
The following demonstration revisits our form example , now with a layout that is progressively enhanced with CSS in capable devices .
Demo 2
Although the demo above uses relatively simple CSS , it ’s still important to test for device capabilities first since the layout may be unusable in a device that renders the CSS improperly .
JavaScript enhancements#section5
Many page enhancements use JavaScript .
Fortunately , testUserDevice.js allows you to specify scripting that you would like to execute in your enhanced experience as well .
This is done by simply passing in a function as an argument into our script , as follows .
testUserDevice.init( function ( ) { /* fancy stuff goes here */ } ) ;
As you can see , we ’ve passed an anonymous function as an argument to our init method .
If our test passes , the scripting enclosed in the function argument will execute immediately .
Keep in mind that this is likely to occur before your typical JavaScript library ’s DOM ready event will fire , so DOM - related scripting should still be enclosed in an event that waits for elements to be available before executing ( such as jQuery ’s ready event or the body .
onload event ) .
Our final demo page displays the same form as before , now progressively enhanced using JavaScript ( in devices deemed capable ) to its full feature set :
The birthday field has a date - picker component .
The preference selections are now sliders .
In the favorite pet fieldset , the “ breed ” fields are conditionally enabled by the chosen radio item .
, the “ breed ” fields are conditionally enabled by the chosen radio item .
The “ breed ” fields use auto - complete .
The form now uses Ajax for submission .
Demo 3
Once is all you need … #section6
Upon the completion of a test , testUserDevice.js drops a cookie recording the results of each test case and uses it on future page loads , which means less processing and better performance for users .
But the opportunities to optimize do n’t stop on the front end : with a little PHP handy work , you can actually look for these cookies on the back - end and serve pages knowing a device ’s capabilities already !
This means you could serve your page with an enhanced class already on your body element , enable your advanced stylesheets from the start , and execute advanced scripting immediately at page load .
<? php // check for cookie ( enhanced=pass ) , and set the stylesheet rel depending on its value $ cssRel = ( $ _COOKIE [ ' enhanced ' ] == " pass " ) ?
" stylesheet " : " alternate stylesheet " ; echo '< link rel= " ' .
$ cssRel . ' " type =" text/css " href="css/enhanced.css " title= " enhanced " />' ; ?>
Advanced usage#section7
testUserDevice.js includes options for handling custom test cases and adding your own tests .
Writing custom test cases #section8
Using testUserDevice ’s default behavior of running a single test case is likely to be enough for most projects , but if you ’d like to make multiple experience divisions , the option is available .
For example , if we intended to make only two enhancements on our demo page :
Form submission via ajax
Select menus are converted into sliders
By default , we would test for all of the features required for these enhancements , and then enhance the entire page if the device passes all the tests .
In contrast , we may want Ajax to work regardless of whether the selects are sliders or not ( and vice versa ) .
This is what I call multiple experience divisions .
For this , we ’ll need to write a custom test case , such as the following case which only tests a device ’s Ajax support .
testUserDevice.init ( [ { testName : ' ajaxCapable ' , pass : [ ' ajax ' ] , scripting : function ( ) { useAjax ( ) ; } } ] ) ;
Instead of passing a function into our init function as we did earlier , we ’re now passing an array as an argument instead .
This array contains one or more objects each containing three settings : testName ( string , name of test ) , pass ( array of test names corresponding to available tests ) , and scripting ( function to execute upon passing test case ) .
These test case objects can be used to make enhancements that only require a subset of features , letting you skip the all - or - nothing test .
Keep in mind that each test case ’s testName property will be used to make DOM modifications in the same way our default test used the name “ enhanced ” .
This means that upon passing test case above , our script will add a class of ajaxCapable to the body element , stylesheets will be enabled and disabled based on title attributes containing the word ajaxCapable , and a cookie will be saved as ajaxCapable=pass .
Adding your own tests #section9
All of the tests included in testUserDevice.js are stored in a tests object that can be easily modified to your needs .
testUserDevice.js also comes with a handy helper function to let you add tests in a clean , separated manner .
This helper function can be reached by calling testUserDevice.add( testName , testScript ) .
For example , to add a test that makes sure a user ’s browser supports a simple JavaScript confirmation , you could write :
testUserDevice.add ( ' confirm ' , function ( ) { if ( window.confirm ) {return true ;} else { return false;} } ) ;
Or , more concisely …
testUserDevice.add ( ' confirm ' , function ( ) { return ( window.confirm ) ?
true : false ; } ) ;
The add function ’s first argument contains a string representing the name of this test .
The second argument is the test itself , which must be a function that returns true or false ( true for a passing grade ; false for failure ) .
Developing for tomorrow , today # section10
As the device and browser landscape continues to grow and developers continue to find ways to implement more features and functionalities , our job of making universally usable websites will remain challenging .
Integrating capabilities testing into our development process allows us to take full advantage of state - of - the - art features without ruining the experience for the users of less capable browsers and devices .
It ’s important to remember that the approach described in this article does not endorse the use of any particular set of tests — just the idea that you should test to make sure capabilities exist before trying to use them .
We welcome any ideas and suggestions on how our approach can be improved and extended .
WASHINGTON - Planned Parenthood loves Sarah Palin .
Not for her stance on abortion - she 's strongly opposed - but because her presence on the Republican ticket is helping the group raise money .
An e-mail urging people to donate to Planned Parenthood Federation of America " in honor of Sarah Palin " has generated more than 31,000 donations totaling $ 802,678 as of Saturday , the group said .
The e-mail , which has been promoted on some liberal blogs for weeks , asks people who are unhappy with John McCain 's running mate to donate to Planned Parenthood .
Donors are asked to list the address of the McCain campaign headquarters or the Alaska governor 's office , which receive a card recognizing any donation made in Palin 's name .
Calls to the McCain - Palin campaign went unreturned .
A spokesman from Planned Parenthood said the group was n't the source of the original e-mail .
The spokesman forwarded an entry from The Huffington Post blog in which Los Angeles Times columnist and radio host Patt Morrison took credit for the idea .
Morrison said she started a campaign in 2001 to protest newly elected President Bush 's opposition to abortion and raised more than $ 1 million in his name .
In her recent blog entry , Morrison said she was delighted that her idea had been revived for Palin , who opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest .
Jim Roderick , president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of North Texas , said the spike in donations " speaks to the tenor of some people 's concern about our issues , " which include not just abortion but emergency contraception , family planning and testing for sexually transmitted diseases .
Such issues are especially important in Texas , Roderick said , because the state has the highest rate of first - time and second - time teen pregnancies in the U.S .

Yes , I think I can prove this mathematically .
And it ’s not that complicated .
Follow along .
If a = b , and b = c , then a = c .
No one is arguing right ?
Next step .
Let ’s define our variables .
a = John McCain said that “ Sarah Palin knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America . ”
b = Palin likes the Obama energy plan , as evidenced by the following press release in the news archives of the State of Alaska ’s official website from August 4 , 2008 , mere weeks before Palin was tapped to be McCain ’s running mate .
Palin Pleased with Obama ’s Energy Plan
Includes Alaska ’s Natural Gas Reserves
August 4 , 2008 , Fairbanks , Alaska – Governor Sarah Palin today responded to the energy plan put forward by the presumptive Democratic nominee for President , Illinois Senator Barack Obama .
“ I am pleased to see Senator Obama acknowledge the huge potential Alaska ’s natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs , ” Governor Palin said .
“ The steps taken by the Alaska State Legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready , willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs . ”
In a speech given in Lansing , Michigan , Senator Obama called for the completion of the Alaska natural gas pipeline , stating , “ Over the next five years , we should also lease more of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska for oil and gas production .
And we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the Canadian government to finally build the Alaska natural gas pipeline , delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process . ”
Governor Palin also acknowledged the Senator ’s proposal to offer $ 1,000 rebates to those struggling with the high cost of energy .
“ We in Alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home , ” Governor Palin said .
“ This is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long - term energy plans can be put into place .
We have already enjoyed the support of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , and it is gratifying to see Senator Obama get on board . ”
c = Obama ’s energy plan .
If McCain ( a ) chose Palin in part because of her knowledge on energy , and if Palin ( b ) is on board with Obama ’s energy plan , then McCain ( a ) must be on board with Obama ’s ( c ) energy plan .
That was easy .
Next !
and I feel frustrated .
Frustrated at the government response , at the mis-information and propaganda surrounding the crisis , and at the few people taking advantage of the situation .
A few thoughts about the CoronaVirus pandemic :
It is serious : please follow the recommendations of the science community and health professionals .
[ Even though we Pastafarians are suspicious of “ science ” , better safe than sorry on this one . ]
Pastafarian top tips for reducing the spread of the CoronaVirus :
Practice social distancing
Stay home if you can
Wash your hands
Dont excessively touch stranger ’s faces and / or groins ( the face of the pelvis )
Pirate - bandana can be used as a face - mask in a pinch but it is not ideal
Avoid social gatherings , yes even Church .
If I can shame a few reilgious leaders for a moment
I do n’t want to talk shit about other religious leaders , and I ’m not even saying most , or even many , religious groups are handling this crisis wrong … but some religious leaders are being so wildy irresponsible I ’d like to mention them :
“ Maybe you ’d like to sow a $ 91 seed . ”
Here ’s Paula White , head of the White House ’s Faith and Opportunity Initiative , selling spiritual protections against the coronavirus .
Here ’s TeleEvangelist Kenneth Copeland curing his viewers of the virus through the television .
I ca n’t stress this enough : do not under any circumstances touch this man ’s hands .
TV Pastor Jim Bakker says his Silver Solution elixer will cure you of the CoronaVirus .
Looks like he may get in trouble for fraud ( again ) for this .
Here ’s Jerry Falwell Jr on Fox & Friends pushing a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus is a plot by the Chinese and North Koreans .
Falwell was forced to shut down classes at his Liberty University when the Virginia governor limited crowd sizes .
“ We ’re raising up revivalists , not pansies ” .
Here ’s a pastor encouraging people to shake hands .
Enought of that .
What should the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster do to help ?
Please send me suggestions here in the comments , twitter ( @henderob ) or email .

LAS VEGAS – Security researcher Dan Kaminsky finally revealed the full details of his reported DNS flaw .
It turns out it 's a lot worse than previously understood .
" Every network is at risk , " Kaminsky said at the Black Hat conference here Wednesday .
" That 's what this flaw has shown . "
Kaminsky disclosed the security vulnerability in the Domain Name System on July 13 but promised to withhold details of the bug for one month to give DNS server owners a chance to patch their systems .
But a week ago , some of the details leaked after security firm Matasano inadvertently posted information about it online .
That leak , though , only revealed the tip of an iceberg that Kaminsky describes as the worst internet security hole since 1997 .
Most of the focus has been on the danger that hackers could easily use the DNS bug to hijack web browsers , redirecting victims to malicious web sites .
But this was only the most obvious of many possible attacks .
In addition to browsers , attackers could target numerous other applications , protocols and services , such as the File
Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) , mail servers , spam filters , Telnet and the
Secure Socket Layer that 's supposed to make online banking safe from eavesdroppers .
Automated software updating systems like those used by Microsoft and Apple could also be subverted , allowing hackers to trick users into installing malicious software disguised as authenticated software updates .
" There are a ton of different paths that lead to doom , " he said .
In his standing - room - only presentation , Kaminsky spent more than an hour running through all the systems potentially affected by the security hole .
He said he knows at least fifteen ways to maliciously wield the DNS flaw , but as more researchers study the issue , more are likely to emerge .
Kaminsky said it ultimately was not a matter of which systems could be attacked through the flaw , but rather which ones could not .
A hacked DNS has a domino effect .
" I maybe had time ( to examine ) four or five dominos , " Kaminsky said in a press conference after his talk .
" It just gets worse . "
In just one example he gave , involving e-mail , he described scenarios in which attackers could intercept mail and copy it , or corrupt a message by replacing legitimate attachments with a malicious executable .
Another serious vulnerability involves sites that provide the ubiquitous " Forgot your password ? " link for users who find themselves locked out of their accounts .
Kaminsky showed how the DNS flaw could be exploited to provide hackers with a backdoor or " skeleton key " to the web accounts .
He worked with major sites such as Google , Yahoo , PayPal , eBay , MySpace , Facebook , LinkedIn and others to fix the issue before he disclosed information about that attack scenario today .
Kaminsky said that more than 120 million broadband consumers are now protected by patched DNS servers , which amounts to about 42 percent of broadband internet users .
Seventy percent of Fortune 500 companies have also patched , while 15 percent have tried to patch but run up against problems .
Another 15 percent have done nothing to fix the hole .
He showed a video ( below ) that mapped DNS servers around the world as they were tested and patched over the last month .
Servers that were vulnerable first appeared as red dots on the map then turned green as they patched .
The most heavily patched geographical regions were the East Coast of the United States and Western Europe .
Kaminksy has posted slides from his talk at his DoxPara web site .
https://www.youtube.com/w
Black
Hat founder and organizer Jeff Moss asked Kaminsky in a press conference following his presentation how much he thought he could have gotten for the vulnerability on the black market , if he 'd decided to sell it to hackers or criminal syndicates instead of warning the world .
Kaminsky declined to guess a figure .
" The value of this class of bugs is high enough that it justifies very extensive research , " he said .
" If there is such value by investing in the attacks , we have to invest more . "

authlogic : Another Take on Rails Authentication
There are certainly plenty of plugins available to handle authentication in Rails , with perhaps the most commonly - used being Restful Authentication .
But there 's always room for one more , and the latest I 've run across is Ben Johnson 's authlogic .
It takes a fresh approach to the problem space , with one big advantage over many existing solutions : because it 's a pure plugin rather than a generator , it does n't litter your application with a ton of code .
The key to making this approach work is that you need to define a special user session model that inherits from authlogic 's internals , rather than from ActiveRecord : : Base :
class UserSession < Authlogic :: Session :: Base end
With that in place , you can use the regular Rails generator to spin up a controller for user sessions , and write " natural " code .
For instance , logging a user in is just a matter of running @user_session = UserSession.new ( params[:user_session ] ) .
Similarly , destroying a UserSession instance logs the current user out .
In addition to the source code , you can explore an Authlogic Setup Tutorial or play with an implemented example online .
I have n't used authlogic in a client project yet , but after experimenting with it in some test code , it 's definitely on my list for the next time I need to roll out authentication as a feature .

Nixon ’s former counsel has written a scathing review of conservative Republican politics and says the McCain - Palin ticket , which “ scares the hell out of me , ” fits the mold .
How ’s this for an endorsement ? :
“ If Obama is rejected on November 4th for another authoritarian conservative like McCain , I must ask if Americans are sufficiently intelligent to competently govern themselves . ”
John Dean at FindLaw.com :
Republicans rule , rather than govern , when they are in power by imposing their authoritarian conservative philosophy on everyone , as their answer for everything .
This works for them because their interest is in power , and in what it can do for those who think as they do .
Ruling , of course , must be distinguished from governing , which is a more nuanced process that entails give - and - take and the kind of compromises that are often necessary to find a consensus and solutions that will best serve the interests of all Americans .
Republicans ’ authoritarian rule can also be characterized by its striking incivility and intolerance toward those who do not view the world as Republicans do .
Their insufferable attitude is not dangerous in itself , but it is employed to accomplish what they want , which is to take care of themselves and those who work to keep them in power .

Of all the Cassandras and soothsayers on the dangers of executive compensation , you might list Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank , perhaps , or corporate gadfly Nell Minow .
But former NYSE chief Richard Grasso ?
The man whose $ 187 million pay package launched lawsuits and years of struggle with Eliot Spitzer ?
Reuters
It makes a difference , perhaps , that the courts recently came out in support of Grasso collecting his money .
And so there was Grasso , in a Bloomberg TV interview , lecturing on the dangers of opaque compensation :
" The primary source of discipline in executive compensation has and always will lie with the boards of public companies .
You better be certain that your managers are compensated in a manner that the public understands .
The public does n't take issue if a company performs well and the stock performs well and the CEO is compensated very highly .
The disconnect comes when the CEO is compensated very highly ... and the stock declines . "
Grasso's attitude was everything in its place : " [ The Wall Street bonus structure ] is clearly something that has to be looked at .
You do n't want traders and risk managers playing with the house money and in a position not to lose ... if they are correct , their compensation goes up , and if they 're incorrect , their entities suffer . "
He called for more stock in compensation , which would represent " a tying of interests between the individual , the company and the shareholder . "

Synthesis is emphasized over analysis : lots of demos of the square wave , not much elementary explanation of the calculation of coefficients .
There is a nice presentation on sine series by Key Curriculum Press , on the Swarthmore site .
There is a complete presentation , but at the advanced undergraduate level , as part of Linear Methods of Applied Mathematics by Evans M. Harrell II and James V. Herod .
Besides Kelvin's own writings , a reference for his work in developing mechanical devices is George Green and John T. Lloyd , Kelvin 's Instruments and the Kelvin Museum , University of Glascow , 1970 .
My main reference on tidal theory and analysis is Paul Schureman , Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides , United States Government Printing Office 1958 .
1. Setting up the problem
A two - week tidal record : January 1 - 14 1884 at Bombay .
From Sir George Herbert Darwin 's article Tides , in Encyclopaedia Britannica , IX Ed. , R. S. Peale & Co. Chicago 1890 Vol. XXIII pp. 353-381
The task of tidal analysis is to take a limited sample of the tidal record , such as the two weeks readings from a tidal gauge at Bombay , and use it to predict the tides at that port in the future .
In fact , for a complete calculation , a 369 - day sample is the standard .
The method used is harmonic analysis .
Ordinarily , harmonic analysis is used for periodic functions , functions which repeat themselves exactly after a certain interval of time .
But the tidal record is not periodic .
What we know from the geometry of the Sun-Earth - Moon system is that the tide - generating force at any point on the Earth 's surface is a linear combination of sines and cosines whose frequencies come from a specific set : certain linear combinations , with small integral coefficients , of the fundamental astronomical frequencies governing the system .
It is natural to suppose that the height of the tide , at Bombay for example , should also be a linear combination involving the same frequencies .
The number of these frequencies produced by a detailed analysis is quite large .
Schureman lists some 37 different frequencies for the solar tide , and some 88 for the lunar .
In practice only about 37 in all are ever used , and most ports use around 25 , so the height of the tide can be written as
A 0 + A 1 cos(v 1 t ) + B 1 sin(v 1 t ) + A 2 cos(v 2 t ) + B 2 sin(v 2 t ) + ...
where the subscripts 1 , 2 , ... run up to about 25 , the ``speeds '' v k are known a priori and the coefficients A 0 , A 1 , B 1 , etc , depend on the port .
For example , here are the ten speeds ( in degrees per hour ) which figure most importantly in the tides of a port like Bridgeport , Connecticut :
2T -2s+2h 2T -3s+2h+p 2T T+h 2T - s+2h-p T- 2s+h h 2T - 3s+4h-p 2T - 2h s-p ( T = 15.00 s = 0.549 ... h = 0.041 ... p = 0.0046 ...)
This column will examine how Fourier analysis can be adapted to calculate , from the tidal record at a port , the coefficients A 0 , A 1 , B 1 , etc .
Then the record may be extrapolated into the future , and tides for that port may be accurately predicted .

The Obama campaign received contributions from 65,000 new donors , it said , and a total of more than 2 million people have contributed .
The Illinois senator ’s campaign has $ 65.8 million cash on hand , it said .
That was a drop from $ 72 million in cash in June .
McCain ’s campaign , which has not matched Obama ’s fundraising success , said on Friday it pulled in $ 27 million in July and had $ 21.4 million in cash at the end of the month .
The Arizona senator ’s campaign had $ 27 million in the bank at the end of June .
The Obama campaign ’s July haul was near the $ 52 million it raised the previous month , and the McCain camp ’s total topped the $ 22 million it raised in June .
“ The 65,000 new donors to the Obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the American people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in Washington , ” Obama ’s campaign manager David Plouffe said in a statement .
Obama ’s fundraising prompted him to forego public financing for the last two months of the campaign , which would have come with spending limits .
McCain is taking public funds and will get an infusion of $ 84 million from a government presidential election fund next month .
His campaign manager , Rick Davis , said the campaign also would get some $ 20 million from the Republican Party .
The political parties will continue to raise money throughout the campaign for their respective presidential and congressional candidates .
The Republican National Committee raised $ 25.8 million in July and ended the month with more than $ 75.8 million in cash .
The Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) said on Saturday it had raised $ 27.7 million in July and had $ 28.5 million in cash .
Those totals grouped the DNC ’s own amounts with two other Democratic fundraising arms .

Wait times for voters are reported to be as much as 8 hours at one early polling site in Georgia , and now the Atlanta Journal - Constitution offers this :
Wait times of four to six hours were not uncommon Monday .
In some places , the lines clipped along at 45 minutes to three hours .
Elections officials in Fulton , Gwinnett , DeKalb and Cobb counties said the state 's computer system crashed at times and was very slow , bogging down the process .
The computer system allows poll workers to verify whether voters are properly registered and whether they have already voted .
High voter turnout was one of the reasons for the slowdown , said Matt Carrothers , a spokesman for Secretary of State Karen Handel 's office .
This is early voting .
Not all polling places are open so there are only a limited number of polling sites checking in voters .
The slow - down and crashing of that system has little to do with high voter turnout .
It is once again , as it was during the primary in GA , the ironically - named Diebold " ExpressPollbook " registration check - in computer that is slowing things up .
If the system is already not working with only a limited number of poll sites open , what will happen when all polls are open on November 4th ?
UPDATE : All of that comes on top of late news that GA has illegally purged and / or flagged nearly 5,000 voters from their registration databases , incorrectly identifying them as " non-citizens " .
UPDATE FROM BRAD :
In our continuing desire to try and help bring a smile , even during these difficult times , we offer the ironic , related , very short ( appx 1 minute ) and amusing " Early Voting " video , as posted at right , just out from our friends who made the great Election Integrity documentary Free For All .
Enjoy !
UPDATE FROM BRAD
10/29/08 : RAW STORY has video of voters waiting 8 hours to vote in GA .
Thank you to those voters who were willing to hang in there !
Shame on you to those officials who set up this system that can't even accommodate the limited numbers of early voters !
God save us all next Tuesday .
Stay strong and brave people !
Will Americans Be Able to Trust the Vote Count in 2008 ?
And , What Can We Do to Protect the Integrity of Elections ?
By Kevin B. Zeese
The campaigns are in full gear , the candidates are picked , TV ads are running , and election corruption is taking hold .
Around the country , particularly in swing states , there are stories of efforts to undercut voter registration especially by poor and African American voters .
In addition , this summer has seen story after story of the potential corruption and likely dysfunction of electronic voting machines .
The combination of corruption of the voter registration system and corruption of the vote counting machinery means that 1 + 1 is not likely to equal 2 when it comes to counting the vote .
The public is better informed and more fed up than ever with these election shenanigans .
It is time to get informed and organized so that Americans will join together and refuse to accept another stolen election .
Voter Registration Corruption : Suppressing the Vote in Key States
It is the season of intensive voter registration drives – Virginia , for example , just ordered 200,000 voter registration forms because of shortages – and of voter suppression efforts as well .
Throughout the country , particularly in battleground states , Republican voter registration challenges are moving forward aggressively .
In the last two presidential elections voter suppression may have been the key to Republican “ victories . ”
( Note : I am not a Democrat or Republican .
I am a voter that does not support either of the major political parties manipulation of American democracy . )
Many have concluded that the 2000 election was corrupted in Florida by operatives in the Jeb Bush administration who suppressed the black vote and undermined the vote count , as well as by the partisan Supreme Court justices who stopped the recount .
But , now it is also evident that the 2004 election was corrupted by the Republican Secretary of State in Ohio who undermined voter registration in black communities and made sure that there were not enough election machines in Democratic Party - leaning precincts .
( If you have any doubt that the 2004 election was stolen see the film “ Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections ” available at : www.uncountedthemovie.com or “ Stealing America Vote by Vote , ” www.stealingamericathemovie.org which document election theft . )
Now , we are seeing many of the techniques used in those elections to suppress the vote in 2008 .
The McCain - Palin campaign and Republican Party are aggressively seeking ways to reduce the number of Democratic voters .
Here are a few examples :
- The chairman of the Republican Party in Macomb County , Michigan , a key swing county in a key swing state , is planning to use a list of foreclosed homes to block people from voting in the upcoming election as part of the state GOP ’s effort to challenge voters on Election Day .
Ohio Republicans are considering the same tactic .
This mean - spirited approach to denying people their vote will not only intimidate voters but will create long lines in Democratic - leaning precincts .
A coalition of faith - based , community and labor organizations protested outside of McCain - Palin ’s Michigan office against this tactic .
- In Wisconsin , Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen a Republican and co-chair of the McCain - Palin Campaign in Wisconsin , filed a lawsuit demanding Wisconsin election officials verify voters ' identity before the November election .
This could lead to frustration at the polls and exhausted clerks in a hotly contested state in the presidential race .
One million people have registered since January 1 and if successful the lawsuit would require every new registrant be checked .
- The Florida Secretary of State decided on September 8th to enforce the state 's " no- match , no - vote " law , a voter registration law that blocked more than 16,000 eligible Florida citizens from registering to vote in 2006 , through no fault of their own , and could disenfranchise tens of thousands more voters in November .
Republican Secretary of State Kurt Browning 's last - minute decision to implement the law in the final month before the registration deadline will post a significant hurdle to eligible Florida citizens hoping to vote in November .
It will disenfranchise voters who do not send or bring a photocopy of their driver 's license to county election officials ' offices after voting , even though these voters will have shown their driver 's licenses when they went to vote at the polls .
The decision will put thousands of Florida citizens at risk due to bureaucratic typos that under the ' no - match , no - vote ' law will prevent them from voting this November .
- On September 11 , 2008 Air America the Tom Hartmann
Show received calls from people in swing states who had received “ absentee ballot request forms ” from the McCain campaign .
These were being sent to people registered as Democrats or Independents , but there seemed to be errors in the forms , instructions and / or the return addresses on the envelope for mailing back the forms .
- Also in Ohio , a Republican passed election law could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters .
The Democratic Secretary of State describes it as an unconstitutional law that allows Ohio county election boards to cancel a voter 's registration solely because some election notices mailed to a home address come back undeliverable .

The most amazing paradox of 2008 is the continued growth of the U.S. economy and the sorry state of the U.S. financial markets .
Despite major financial - market problems , real GDP has increased by 2.1 % in the year ended in the second - quarter -- 3.1 % if we exclude housing .
Not everything is great , but we all must agree that the economy has remained remarkably resilient .
This paradox works both ways .
Financial problems have not yet dragged down the economy , but it is also true that the economy is not the cause of financial - market problems .
Most of the loans that have been going bad in recent months would have gone bad even if the economy had been growing twice as fast .
So what is to blame for the " worst financial crisis since the Great Depression " ?
The answer seems simple .
Mark - to - market accounting rules have turned a large problem into a humongous one .
A vast majority of mortgages , corporate bonds , and structured debts are still performing .
But because the market is frozen , the prices of these assets have fallen below their true value .
Firms that are otherwise solvent must price assets to fire - sale values .
Not only does this make them ripe for forced liquidation , but it chases away capital and leads to a further decline in asset values .
For example , the prices of assets on the books of Washington Mutual , when it was bought by J.P. Morgan at a fire - sale price , were cited as a reason to mark - down the assets on the books of Wachovia .
This , some say , forced the FDIC to arrange its sale to Citibank .
The same is true of what happened to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which had positive cash flow when they were nationalized by the Treasury .
Here 's something you wo n't believe : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have not drawn a dime from the Treasury 's $ 200 billion facility that was created to bail them out .
It was the use of mark - to - market accounting that allowed Treasury to declare them bankrupt .
On a cash flow basis , they were solvent .
Enlarge NASA via AP A NASA image provided in August shows the Phoenix Mars Lander 's solar panel and the lander 's robotic arm with a soil sample in the scoop .
NASA engineers still hope to rouse a slumbering Phoenix lander and wring the last science out of the mission to Mars ' North Pole .
The solar - powered craft landed in May , enjoying around - the - clock sunshine during the Martian summer .
Now facing winter , the lander receives eight fewer hours of recharging sunlight each day .
An unexpected dust storm last week further cut sunlight during a high - energy work day , coming at the " worst time , " says project chief Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
The storm caught the lander when its batteries were most depleted and cut communications for two days .
Goldstein compared the spacecraft to a laptop computer with low batteries that forces itself to shut down as soon as it starts up , further draining its batteries .
" Nothing we can do can fight the environment , " Goldstein says .
But " by the end of the week , I 'm hopeful we can resume science , " he says , since the dust storm has lightened enough for the lander to communicate daily with mission controllers .
The mission is two months past its original three - month planned lifetime of chemically analyzing ice frozen in the Martian Arctic .
In July , the lander confirmed that ice is in the soil ; it later saw the first snowfall spotted on Mars .
" We 're very happy we completed the primary mission .
Anything beyond that time was a bonus , " says mission scientist Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis .
If the mission continues , the lander will act as a weather station , transmitting meteorological details from the ground as the Mars northern plains ice over .
" We have snow , we have ice , we have dust storms .
There is a lot of exciting weather going on right now there , " Arvidson says .
The next step is sending power - saving instructions before the lander 's batteries go completely , which Goldstein gives 50 - 50 odds of success .

By now everyone has heard about David Kernell , the 20 year old college student who hacked into Sarah Palin 's Yahoo email account .
He was indicted this week on charges for illegally accessing Palin 's account and could get up to five years .
This case has raised a few flags to some in the public .
First it leaves one wondering why the DOJ took such an active role in going after this guy .
Email accounts get hacked on a daily basis , not to mention bank accounts and other items of higher fiscal value , yet the DOJ puts these on a low priority list .
The other big flag is that the hacker actually uncovered some violations by Palin :
The Justice Department seems to be setting one of its amazing new rules .
When a Republican political figure is damaged in her expectation of being elected to office , it is telling us , that ’s a felony .
And why is that the case here ?
Because the hacker helped establish something important : Sarah Palin has been systematically violating the Open Records Act .
As David Corn has noted at Mother Jones , Palin relied heavily on private email accounts for improper purposes .
As governor of Alaska , she was obligated to maintain as public records her communications with respect to her discharge of official duties .
Palin skirted this obligation by turning to private email accounts for government related dealings .
In fact , the hacker in question helped flush out Palin ’s violations .
The hacker also helped establish a motive for the illegal conduct : Palin regularly involved her husband in official business , and it ’s easy to understand why she did not want to leave behind evidence of her husband ’s involvement .
( emphasis added )
I 'm sure some out there would come to Palin 's defense , claiming that this evidence was n't properly obtained , however such issues have already been argued in court .
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on a similar case where a hacker turned over evidence that eventually lead to the conviction of some involved in child pornography .
The basics of the case are the same , someone used illegal means to gain access to someones personal email account .
The information obtained by those means lead to the conviction of the victims of the hack .
The court claimed it was a ' loophole ' in federal privacy law .
So why is n't Palin now facing questions about her violation of the Open Records Act ?
Hopefully more in the media will start asking her about this .

London Filmmakers ’ Oily Hemp Seed Goodness
It ’s always inspiring to hear about Londoners making a go of a dream , especially when the dream is based upon a healthy , sustainable idea .
Take West Londoners Henry Braham and Glynis Murray for example .
Not content to rest on their laurels and relish in their successes in the film industry , Braham and Murray have connected to their farming backgrounds to produce Good Oil , a “ high - quality and healthy UK product ” made of hemp seed .
According to the cinematographer and film producer partners , the reintroduction of hemp seed ( one of the oldest crops to be grown in the UK ) to British soil was just the inspiration they needed .
After years of experimenting ( and working through a few batches of not - quite - as - good - as - it - could - be oils ) , their nutritious hemp seed “ super-oil ” hit the market in 2005 .
Boasting no trans - fats but plenty essential fatty acids ( omega - 3 and omega - 6 ) , their oil is made from the harvested hemp seeds from their North Devon farm .
Oh yeah , Good Oil tastes good too !
Use it like you might olive oil and you ’re set .
Go for a little more culinary creativity ( drizzle some on ice cream or pop corn or blue cheese ) and see just how great Good Oil can be .
Good
Oil hemp seed oil is available in London at most branches of the biggie supermarkets as well as Harvey Nichols , Selfridges and a number of quality independent grocers .

The US wants to beef up its oversight of financial institutions
For decades , Wall Street has banged the drum for de-regulation .
In capitalist America , the idea that financial markets are best left alone has been dearly held .
And it has helped make America rich .
But the bomb - shell of the near collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns and the credit crunch has exploded some of that confidence in self - policing markets .
Now , the financial system here in the United States could get its biggest shake - up since the Great Depression of 1933 .
Size matters
On Thursday , America's two most powerful economic figures - the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson - addressed a Congressional panel on " Systematic Risk and Financial Markets " .
They argued the case for a new type of regulation that would look at the bigger picture .
Rather than the type of institution , the key factor would be its importance within the financial system .
The problem is you are always regulating the past
Diane Swonk , chief economist , Mesirow Financial Mr Paulson told the panel that the Bear Stearns rescue and the market turmoil it unleashed showed the " outdated nature " of the financial regulatory system .
" This has convinced me that we must move much more quickly to update our regulatory structure and improve both market oversight and market discipline , " he said .
Mr Bernanke told Congress he supported that push for change .
" The financial turmoil is ongoing , and our efforts today are concentrated on helping the financial system return to more normal functioning .
It is not too soon , however , to think about steps that might be taken to reduce the incidence and severity of future crises . "
He went on to suggest Congress may need to enact new laws to increase the Federal Reserve 's powers .
Tectonic shift
This would take America 's central bank into a new sphere .
Wall Street has traditionally preferred light touch regulation Traditionally , the Fed has regulated commercial banks but investment banks have fallen under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
So far , investment banks have been more lightly regulated thanks to a set of voluntary codes , meanwhile hedge funds have barely been regulated at all .
But the tectonic plates of US regulation shifted when the Federal Reserve stepped in to bail - out investment bank Bear Stearns .
In March , the 85 - year - old investment firm experienced a run on the bank .
In order to avoid a bankruptcy that could have destabilised the entire financial system , Mr Bernanke helped negotiate , over a single weekend , for rival JP Morgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns .
With that , the door to greater Fed regulation of investment banks was opened .
At the same time , Mr Bernanke addressed the wider liquidity crunch on Wall Street with an extraordinary measure .
He pumped more cash into the system by offering the nation 's biggest investment banks access to low - cost overnight loans , usually reserved for commercial banks only .
It was a measure that was meant to be temporary , but Mr Bernanke says he may well be extended into 2009 .
Kneejerk regulation ?
There is fear that the new regulations will go too far .
Diane Swonk , chief economist based in Chicago for Mesirow Financial recalls the last big regulatory push - in the wake of the collapse of energy trading giant Enron in 2001 .
Analysts warn that new regulations could go too far Thousands of Americans lost jobs and life savings with the collapse of Ken Lay 's company but the reaction was ill - thought out , says Ms Swonk : " The problem is you are always regulating the past , that 's what happened with Sarbanes - Oxley .
Much of Sarbanes - Oxley was overkill .
I hope there is enough memory of that for Congress to tread carefully . "
Moreover , Ms Swonk says that greater regulation risks killing the golden goose altogether .
" My concern is where we sit internationally .
The money will go somewhere , to even less regulated markets . "
Congress will no doubt take this into consideration .
Super cop
So far , the chairman of the Federal Reserve though has been praised for his work in steering the financial crisis .
Unlike Mr Paulson , Mr Bernanke did not cut his teeth on Wall Street .
But the former academic seems determined to exert greater power over America 's complex financial system and perhaps it will earn him a new nickname - the Fed 's super cop .

What are these ?
When I heard that Tony Hillerman had died Sunday at 83 , I felt that stone - heaviness of grief , as if he were a beloved great - uncle .
I felt regret , like I ’d never gotten to say goodbye or even offer a thank you for all that he gave me .
Gone was a positive influence in my life , someone who had helped me grow up and become a writer .
Considering that I never actually met Hillerman , this needs some explaining .
As a teenager growing up in rural New Mexico , I ’d hole up with “ The Blessing Way ” or “ The Dance Hall of the Dead , ” pretending to be sick to escape the misery of high school and spend the day instead with Lt. Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police .
My mother probably realized I was faking but she , too , was a huge Hillerman fan ; besides , she likely thought I ’d learn more about grammar , anthropology , history and logic by reading than sitting in a classroom .
Over the years , I must have read both those books half a dozen times .
They , of course , are just good old nail - biting whodunits , but even when I knew how the stories ended , I enjoyed going back and revisiting the world - weary Leaphorn , seeing scenes play out in my head , trying to figure out where exactly Hillerman slipped in the first clue to the murder .
In Hillerman ’s books , I found more than entertainment ; I found reassurance that someone else had the same experience of the world as I did .
A difficult place
New Mexico indeed is the “ Land of Enchantment , ” a tourist bureau ’s dream with picturesque sunsets , colorful balloon fiestas , real cowboys and Indians , and quaint old towns that look almost too photogenic to be real .
Beneath all this , I knew it as a place of profound paradox -- stunning vistas and nuclear bombs , unique cultural traditions and bone - crushing poverty , racial blending and murderous violence .
Looking at the slick cover images on New Mexico Magazine , or hearing visitors say , “ New Mexico is so spiritual and such a healing place , ” I ’d think I was missing something .
But Hillerman ’s stories reassured me that I was n’t crazy .
He saw it too .
In an essay in David Muench ’s photo book “ New Mexico , ” he writes about the state as a place influenced by “ edges ” that overlap -- the mountain and desert climates , the cultures of the Spanish , the Anglo and the tribal forces of the Navajo , the Pueblos and Apache .
His books about Leaphorn and , later , detective Jim Chee , may have been fiction , but I knew he was speaking in code about the way things really were .
Yes , New Mexico is this beautiful and this ethereal , and it is also this dangerous and this mean .
“ Enchantment ” denotes a spell cast , and if you grow up around people who whisper about Santeria and skinwalkers and kachinas , you know that ’s not something to take lightly .
Hillerman ’s writing was all the more powerful because he , like me , had been born elsewhere -- he was an Okie from a hamlet called Sacred Heart .
Those were accidents of birth , however .
I imagined Hillerman felt as I did ; we were always New Mexicans , a spell that , once cast , you can not shake .
Hillerman once said in an interview that the first time he pulled up to a trading post and saw elderly Navajos sitting on the bench outside , he felt “ right at home . ”
Like my actual great - uncles , he had served as an infantryman in World War II .
And , like my uncles also , he had killed in combat , a fact about which he was taciturn and stoic .
He had been severely wounded , and often talked about traveling through New Mexico after the war with two fellow soldiers who were Navajos , and coming upon tribe members conducting an Enemy Way ceremony to cleanse another soldier of his service .
These images stayed with him , influencing his work .
Yet it seems to me his direct experience of pain , of fear and suffering , of brutality and survival , influenced his work even more .
Hillerman always gave his characters the complexity of their humanity , good or bad .
They may have been fictional creations , but their substance was real .
It was life , it was messy .
Hillerman respected the humanity of his characters just as he respected the intelligence and life experience of his readers .
And it seems to me that such compassion -- because that ’s what it is -- is always gained at the price of tough life experience .
One more thing : I did n’t appreciate this for a long while .
After high school , I buried my love of Leaphorn and Chee .
I was trying to be an intellectual , you see .
College and all .
Reading literature , do n’t you know ?
Stories about people in Connecticut , boys at boarding school , Borges and Camus .
I hung out in New York and tried to be one of the literati .
I was as embarrassed of Hillerman as I was of my own family .
Rediscovering him
It took my own failings , moral dilemmas and pain to embrace where I came from -- Hillerman included .
And now he is gone , and I can only hope what any writer hopes : not only to write one thing that will matter half as much to one reader as Hillerman ’s many works have mattered to millions , but to write with the kind of compassion and respect he did .
And gratitude .
He called his memoir “ Seldom Disappointed ” after a saying his mother had : “ Blessed are those who expect little .
They are seldom disappointed . ”
He wrote , “ Looking back at life , I find I have often received more than I ever expected and suffered less than my share of disappointments . ”
Thank you , Tony Hillerman .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- British house sellers became increasingly desperate in November , cutting asking prices by 2.9 % from the previous month and by 7.1 % from levels seen a year ago , U.K. property Web site Rightmove reported Monday .
The average property asking price declined to 222,979 pounds ( $ 330,222 ) from 229,691 pounds in October , Rightmove 's monthly index of house prices showed .
Although the 7.1 % annual decline is the largest ever seen in November , it 's not likely to do the trick as far as hopes for some sign of price stabilization go : Rightmove indicated that agents say sales have taken place at around 20 % below the peak asking price .
" Some sellers could avoid months of disillusionment and despair if they started marketing at an asking price a lot closer to where the evidence indicates they are likely to end up , " said Miles Shipside , Rightmove 's commercial director .
" While average asking prices have fallen by 7.1 % over the past year , in most parts of the country you should look to at least double that discount to achieve a sale . "
Echoing other surveys , Rightmove said only 80,000 new sellers entered the market in November -- the lowest since 2002 -- as other potential sellers hold out hope for a price recovery .
The Bank of England earlier this month slashed its key lending rate by 1.5 percentage points , all the way down to 3 % -- the lowest level seen since 1955 .
Shipside said the low base rate and expectations for further interest - rate cuts leave room for sales volumes to pick up in 2009 as cash - rich purchases take advantage of a buyers market .
" They are in a position where mainstream buyers are still forced out of the market by restrictions on mortgage availability and lenders ' demands for bigger deposits , and this should start to ease at some stage next year , " he said .
SAN FRANCISCO 
In one of the nation ’s largest displays of support for gay rights , tens of thousands of people in cities across the country turned out in support of same - sex marriage on Saturday , lending their voices to an issue that many gay men and lesbians consider a critical step to full equality .
The demonstrations  from a sun-splashed throng in San Francisco to a chilly crowd in Minneapolis  came 11 days after California voters narrowly passed a ballot measure , Proposition 8 , that outlawed previously legal same - sex ceremonies in the state .
The measure ’s passage has spurred protests in California and across the country , including at several Mormon temples , a reflection of that church ’s ardent backing of the proposition .
On Saturday , speakers painted the fight over Proposition 8 as another test of a movement that began with the riots at the Stonewall Inn in New York in 1969 , survived the emergence of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s , and has since made enormous strides in societal acceptance , whether in television shows or in antidiscrimination laws .
“ It ’s not ‘ Yes we can , ’ ” said Tom Ammiano , a San Francisco city supervisor , referring to President - elect Barack Obama ’s campaign mantra .
“ It ’s ‘ Yes we will . ’ ”
There is a third way , of course .
Premier Vladimir Putin issued a veiled threat on Monday to impose capital controls .
Money flows out of the country would be strictly monitored , and “ corporate egotism , any kind of corruption or abuse ” would not be tolerated .
Yes , he also said that “ legal movement of capital overseas is a civilized financial transaction .
There is no question of any state bans ” .
Take your pick .

A new commercial PC game came out two days ago from a brand new game development and publishing company .
The game is called CellZenith and the company is called Faramix Enterprises .
What make this a unique story is not actually the game ( full disclosure : we 've not played the game , so we cannot comment intelligently about it ) , but the story behind the game 's making and the genesis of the company ... Three young men in their twenties , from three different states , enrolled in the online bachelor 's degree program for Game and Simulation Programming ( GSP ) with DeVry University .
Their mutual interest in games development quickly clicked with each other and they not only decided to form their own games development and publishing company , but they also started developing the company 's first game title .
This is not a make - it - big - and - quit - college - to - pursue - your - entrepreneurial - dreams type story , however .
They actively pursued their entrepreneurial dreams while still taking classes and earning their degrees -- all the while doing this from their respective locations in Los Angeles , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey .
They officially formed their company in 2007 and spent a year or so developing the title to get it ready for distribution .
Not only did they develop it , but they also published it as well .
The game , CellZenith , is currently available for download from Direct2 Drive and GamersGate for $ 14.99 .
The three students , Michael Dehen , Nathan Follmer , and Eric Totten , are still enrolled in the GSP program , pursuing their degrees .
The CellZenith game is DX9 - based arcade - like , " action - shooter " game that the developers compare to Geometry Wars .
They claim the game has the following features :
One of the founding student members , Michael Dehen of Los Angeles , is Faramix 's President and CEO .
His LinkedIn page ( requires Linked In membership to see the full profile ) indicates that the company has at least three more titles in development : Vindication is being developed for the PC , Xbox360 , and PS3 , and it is currently in " early pre-production " ; END will also be for the PC , Xbox360 , and PS3 , uses the Unreal 3 Engine , has completed " pre-production , " and " will begin production when a publisher and funding is secured " ; and the last project is merely listed as " Secret " with no pertinent details .
Our best guess is that the " Secret " title is already well into development and is covered by an NDA as a result of a distribution deal that is already in place .
One sign that these guys are serious is that they 've hired the services of a CPA to act as a virtual CFO , and that Faramix is actively seeking to hire animators , concept artists , modelers , programmers , and texture artists to work on its END title .
Keep an eye on these guys , they might be onto something -- of course we say this with the caveat that we have n't actually played any of their games yet -- but we 're thoroughly impressed with their entrepreneurial spirit .
This image taken by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope showcases the brilliant core of NGC 1569 , one of the most active galaxies in our local neighborhood .
The entire core is 5,000 light - years wide .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has helped astronomers solve a longstanding mystery as to why a small , nearby , isolated galaxy is pumping out new stars faster than any galaxy in our local neighborhood .
The loner starburst galaxy , called NGC 1569 , is 1.5 times farther away than astronomers thought , a new study found .
The extra distance places the galaxy in the middle of a group of about 10 galaxies centered on the spiral galaxy IC 342 .
Gravitational interactions among the group 's galaxies may be compressing gas in NGC 1569 and igniting the star - birthing frenzy .
" Now the starburst activity seen in NGC 1569 makes sense , because the galaxy is probably interacting with other galaxies in the group , " said the study 's leader , Alessandra Aloisi of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md. , and the European Space Agency .
" Those interactions are probably fueling the star birth . "
The farther distance not only means that the galaxy is intrinsically brighter , but also that it is producing stars two times faster than first thought .
The galaxy is forming stars at a rate more than 100 times higher than in the Milky Way .
This high star - formation rate has been almost continuous for the past 100 million years .
Puzzle pieces in place
Discovered by William Herschel in 1788 , NGC 1569 is home to three of the most massive star clusters ever discovered in the local universe .
Each cluster contains more than a million stars .
" This is a prime example of the type of massive starbursts that drive the evolution of galaxies in the distant and young universe , " said team member Roelandvan der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute .
" Starburst galaxies can only be studied in detail in the nearby universe , where they are much rarer . "
" Hubble observations of our galactic neighborhood , including this study , are helping astronomers put together a complete picture of the galaxies in our local universe , " van der Marel added .
" Put the puzzle pieces in the right place , as for NGC 1569 , and the picture makes much more sense . "
Serendipitous discovery
Aloisi and her team actually discovered the new distance by accident .
They were using Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys to hunt in NGC 1569 for the kind of red giant stars ( stars near the ends of their lives ) that shine because of fusion of helium nuclei in their cores .
These stars are dimmer than bright red giants without helium burning , but when detected , they can be used to estimate the galaxy 's age .
" When we found no obvious trace of them , we suspected that the galaxy was farther away than originally believed , " said Aaron Grocholski of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the main author on a paper describing the results .
" We could only see the brightest red giant stars , but we were able to use these stars to recalibrate the galaxy 's distance . "
Bright red giants are reliable " standard candles " for measuring distance because they all shine at the same brightness .
Once astronomers know a star 's true brightness , they can calculate its distance from earth .
Previous estimates of the galaxy 's distance made with ground - based telescopes were unreliable because they looked at the galaxy 's crowded core and were unable to resolve individual red giant stars .
" This was a serendipitous discovery , " Aloisi said .
" Hubble did n't go deep enough to see the faintest red giant stars we were hunting for because the galaxy is farther away than we thought .
However , by capturing the entire population of the brightest red giant stars , we were able to calculate a precise distance to NGC 1569 and resolve the puzzle about the galaxy 's extreme starburst activity . "
The results were published in the Oct. 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .

Commandos who stormed the Mumbai headquarters of an ultra-orthodox Jewish group found the bodies of five hostages inside , among them a New York rabbi and his wife , as a fresh battle raged at the luxury Taj Mahal hotel and other Indian forces ended a siege at another five - star hotel .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
More than 150 people have been killed since gunmen attacked 10 sites across India ’s financial capital starting Wednesday night , including 24 foreigners , officials said .
Early Friday night , Indian commandos emerged from a besieged Jewish center with rifles raised in an apparent sign of victory after a daylong siege that saw a team rappel from helicopters and a series of explosions and fire rock the building and blow gaping holes in the wall .
Inside the Chabad - Lubavitch office , though , were five dead hostages .
The Chabad - Lubavitch movement confirmed the deaths of Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg and his wife , Rivka .
They ran the movement ’s local headquarters .
The couple ’s toddler was taken out of the center by his nanny .

The Justice Department “ stands strongly behind the opinion , which is narrowly drawn and carefully reasoned , ” Erik Ablin , an agency spokesman , said in an e-mail message .
“ Most of the criticisms that have been outlined against the opinion are thoroughly addressed in the opinion itself .
Each of them lacks merit . ”
Carl H. Esbeck , a University of Missouri law professor and architect of the religion - based initiative movement , also defended the opinion , saying the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act compelled the department ’s conclusion .
“ I understand that liberal law professors do n’t like this , ” he said .
Why , he asked , should World Vision “ be denied the opportunity that everyone else has to compete for funding simply because of their religion ? ”
The Office of Legal Counsel issues interpretations of the law that are binding on the executive branch and often rules on matters that are difficult to get before a court .
Under the Bush administration , it has drawn sharp criticism for issuing opinions that provide legal cover for controversial policies preferred by administration officials .
In 2002 , for example , the office secretly signed off on the use of harsh interrogation techniques despite a statute and treaties forbidding torture .
The memorandum ’s legal reasoning was strongly criticized by legal scholars after it was leaked to the public , and the Justice Department rescinded it .
Christopher E. Anders , senior legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union , said he was alarmed by the 2007 memorandum ’s conclusion that the government does not have a “ compelling interest ” in enforcing a federal civil rights statute .
“ It ’s really the church - state equivalent of the torture memos , ” Mr. Anders said .
“ It takes a view of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allows religious organizations to get federal funds without complying with anything . ”
Professor Lupu did not go that far , but said the opinion made “ an aggressive reading of ‘ substantial burden ’ in a way that is not consistent with what courts and other agencies have done in the past , and it is designed to serve the president ’s political agenda . ”
The Broadway League had asked the FCC to refrain from approving new devices that will transmit in the " white space " radio spectrum ( currently occupied by wireless microphones ) into the public air space .
Wireless microphones are an essential tool of the live performance industry , used in the daily operations of countless theatres and non-profit performance venues , sports arenas , and concert halls across the country .
On November 4th , the issue was voted on and the FCC voted five to zero to approve opening up the " white space " frequency to public use .
A preliminary review of an FCC engineers ' report issued on October 15 , 2008 demonstrates repeated failures of spectrum sensing to recognize wireless transmissions .
While regulations that include reference to spectrum sensing technology would rely on unproven technology , the FCC may forge ahead and adopt new rules without allowing interested parties any prior opportunity to ensure the Commission took adequate steps to address the needs of all wireless microphone users .
Theatres in urban areas are at particular risk because the complex radio environment is beyond any measure of control .
Not only is the quality of the performances at risk , but also the safety of all who work in these venues will be compromised .
Accordingly , sound engineers will have no way to locate or report the source of interference should a portable device disrupt a live performance .
The Broadway League strongly urged the Commission to recognize incumbent white space users and , at the very minimum , employ basic protections to address the needs of Broadway .
The Broadway League has been working with theatres across the country to help get the message to the FCC of the many consequences of a hasty decision .
This week it also reached out to the Commission with an ad campaign to help bring attention to the serious situation this premature vote creates .
The FCC concluded in their meeting and voting that after various tests they do n't believe opening the air space to the public will interfere with the wireless microphones and sound devices used on many Broadway shows .
They plan on implementing future technology that will sense when the space is " in use " by a theater and automatically shut down other use in that area .

Several Internet and broadband companies have acknowledged using targeted - advertising technology without explicitly informing customers , according to letters released yesterday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
And Google , the leading online advertiser , stated that it has begun using Internet tracking technology that enables it to more precisely follow Web - surfing behavior across affiliated sites .
The revelations came in response to a bipartisan inquiry of how more than 30 Internet companies might have gathered data to target customers .
Some privacy advocates and lawmakers said the disclosures help build a case for an overarching online - privacy law .
“ Increasingly , there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information . . . and then selling it as a commodity to other providers , ” said committee member Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) , who created the Privacy Caucus 12 years ago .
“ Our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that , regardless of the technology , includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information . ”
Markey said he and his colleagues plan to introduce legislation next year , a sort of online - privacy Bill of Rights , that would require that consumers must opt in to the tracking of their online behavior and the collection and sharing of their personal data .
But some committee leaders cautioned that such legislation could damage the economy by preventing small companies from reaching customers .
Rep. Cliff Stearns ( R - Fla . ) said self - regulation that focuses on transparency and choice might be the best approach .
Google , in its letter to committee Chairman John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , Markey , Stearns and Rep. Joe L. Barton ( R - Tex . ) , stressed that it did not engage in potentially the most invasive of technologies — deep - packet inspection , which companies such as NebuAd have tested with some broadband providers .
But Google did note that it had begun to use across its network the “ DoubleClick ad - serving cookie , ” a computer code that allows the tracking of Web surfing .

How Archimedes and his 2,000 - year - old invention will help provide green energy
A device invented more than 2,000 years ago by Archimedes has found a 21st century use - generating ' green ' electricity .
A crumbling 99 - year - old hydroelectric plant in the Yorkshire Dales will come out of retirement thanks to the Ancient Greek 's genius .
Key to the English Heritage project is the adaptation of Archimedean screws to operate turbines .
The screw was designed to carry water upwards as it rotates , but the project at the Linton Falls plant has reversed this principle .
The river Wharfe will flow down through two screws , spinning them fast enough to generate enough renewable and clean energy to power 100 homes .
Archimedes of Syracuse ( 287-212 BC ) has been credited with inventing the screw to remove water from the hold of a ship .
The revolving screw - shaped blade inside an angled pipe was turned by a handle , scooping up water and carrying it to the top .
The same technology has been widely used to pump water from low - lying rivers for crop irrigation , as it is still used in the Nile delta in Egypt .
The method is also used to drain flooded fields , move grain in mills and powders in factories .
The tiny Linton Falls plant was built in 1909 to bring the first electricity to the village of Grassington , but has been out of action since 1948 .
Since then it has been protected as a scheduled monument because of its historical significance .
By next summer it should once more be generating electricity for the National Grid .
It will produce 510,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year , saving around 216 tons of carbon dioxide emissions compared with fossil fuel generation .
The scheme 's cost has not been revealed .
' Archimedes should be pleased , ' said Austin Flather , the project manager .
' There is sometimes a feeling that technology is everything and we must always be striving for the latest developments .
But quite often the older , tried - and - tested methods are just as good , if not better .
' I think if he saw us using his technology this way he would smile .
Frankly it is not highly sophisticated - which is a good thing .
It 's easier and cheaper to build , maintain and operate than more modern systems .
The 100 - year - old defunct hydro plant at Linton Falls is to be refurbished and put back into use to create green power
' Also , circumstances are changing and this kind of smaller installation is becoming viable where it would not have been just a few years ago .
It fits with the government requirements for green renewable energy technology .
This method takes nothing away from the river , nor adds anything to it . '
The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority is considering up to 50 sites for small hydro- electricity schemes .
Chief planner Peter Watson said : ' This project brings together two vital characteristics of the National Park - the protection of its cultural heritage and the promotion of new technologies to meet the climate change challenge and protect the environment . '

In einem scheinbar endenden Rechtsstreit zwischen der U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) und dem Nachrichtengiganten Telegram wird erwartet , dass letzterer gemäß einer vorgeschlagenen Vereinbarung eine Zivilstrafe von 18,5 Millionen Dollar an die SEC und 1,2 Milliarden Dollar Herausgabegebühr zahlt .
Telegramm stimmt der Zahlung von Disgorgement und Zivilstrafe zu
Die US - Börsenaufsichtsbehörde SEC reichte am Donnerstag ( 25 . Juni 2020 ) einen Vorschlag für ein endgültiges Urteil beim US - Bezirksgericht des südlichen Bezirks von New York ein .
Laut der Gerichtseinreichung enthüllte die SEC , dass sowohl die Kommission als auch das Telegramm am 11 .
Juni 2020 eine Vergleichsvereinbarung erzielten .
In der von den beiden Parteien erzielten Einigung ist vorgesehen , dass Telegram eine Auszahlung von 1,2 Milliarden Dollar leistet .
Von der gesamten Ausschüttung dienen 1,19 Milliarden Dollar als „ Abfindungsbeträge “ an die Investoren gemäß dem Vertrag über den Kauf von Gramm - Token .
Die Nachrichtenplattform hat vier Jahre Zeit , um den Investoren die Kündigungsbeträge auszuzahlen .
Außerdem erklärte sich das Unternehmen bereit , der SEC eine zivilrechtliche Strafe in Höhe von 18.500.00 US - Dollar zu zahlen , wobei die Aufsichtsbehörde dem Unternehmen 30 Tage Zeit gibt , die Strafgebühr zu zahlen , falls das Gericht das Urteil genehmigt .
Dies geht aus dem Gerichtsantrag der SEC hervor :
„ Beträge , deren Zahlung gemäß diesem Urteil als zivilrechtliche Strafe angeordnet wurde , sind für alle Zwecke , einschließlich aller Steuerzwecke , wie an die Regierung gezahlte Strafen zu behandeln “ .
Zusätzlich zu den zivilrechtlichen Strafen und der Ausspülung hieß es in dem Antrag , dass das Telegramm die US - Wertpapieraufsichtsbehörde benachrichtigen müsse , bevor ein Krypto - Token - Verkauf für die nächsten drei Jahre durchgeführt wird .
Dementsprechend wird das Unternehmen die SEC 45 Tage vor der Ausgabe von „ digitalen Token “ oder „ Kryptowährungen “ informieren .
Jake Chervinsky , General Counsel der dezentralen Kreditvergabeplattform Compound , kommentierte die jüngste Entwicklung des Telegram / U.S. SEC .
Der Krypto- Anwalt sagte in einem
Tweet :
„ Der Vergleich von Telegram mit der SEC scheint angesichts der Fakten und Umstände des TON - Projekts und des Grams - Angebots ( die für Telegram sehr schlecht waren ) fair zu sein , aber traurigerweise endet diese Saga mit einer verwirrten Stellungnahme des Bezirksgerichts zu Howey .
Viele von uns hofften , das Berufungsgericht würde sich einmischen “ .
Der lange Kampf mit der SEC
Im Jahr 2018 sammelte Telegram über 1,7 Milliarden Dollar von Investoren in einem ersten Münzangebot ( ICO ) für die Entwicklung seines Blockkettenprojekts , dem Telegram Open Network ( TON ) .
Der Kampf von Telegram gegen die SEC begann jedoch , als die US - Wertpapieraufsichtsbehörde eingriff , um den Verkauf seiner Gramm - Marken zu stoppen .
Der SEC zufolge wurden die Gramm - Token von Telegram als Wertpapiere betrachtet , was wiederum bedeutete , dass die ICO - Veranstaltung 2018 mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt geriet .
Später im Januar 2020 beantragte die SEC einen Gerichtsbeschluss , um Zugang zu den Finanzunterlagen von Telegram zu erhalten , was das Unternehmen sich weigerte , der Kommission vorzulegen .
Im selben Monat wies das Gericht des südlichen Bezirks von New York die Anordnung der SEC zurück , die ICO - Finanzunterlagen von Telegram einzusehen .
Eine gerichtliche Verfügung später im März verhinderte , dass Telegram seine Gramm - Marken ausgab , nachdem die Marken nach dem Howey - Test als Wertpapiere galten .
Nach so vielen Schluckaufsituationen verschob das Unternehmen die Ausgabe seiner Gramm - Marken und schloss später den Vorhang für das TON - Projekt .
BBC ' must be firmer on excesses '
Please turn on JavaScript .

The BBC must be " firmer on excesses " in the wake of the Radio 2 offensive phone call row , BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons has said .
The calls made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to actor Andrew Sachs " demonstrated the need for stricter controls " , he said .
But , he added , the BBC must " be careful we do not retrench to a position where we 're no longer willing to take risks " .
Brand has resigned , while Ross has been suspended for three months without pay .
The pair made a series of offensive calls to Sachs , 78 , on Brand 's Radio 2 show which included obscene comments about the Fawlty Towers actor 's 23 - year - old granddaughter , Georgina Baillie .
The incident led Lesley Douglas , controller of Radio 2 , to tender her resignation on Thursday .
The BBC is hoping to draw a line under the furore , which , as of last night , had attracted 37,500 complaints .
' Courage '
The Trust , the BBC 's governing body , has asked for a further report into the matter .
It wants more information on how the programme was approved for broadcast and who was involved in the final decision .
Jonathan Ross has been suspended for three months Sir Michael , however , said he was satisfied with how the matter has been handled by Mark Thompson , the BBC 's director general .
Speaking on the BBC Breakfast programme , he said Mr Thompson had acted " with courage " and had the full confidence of the Trust .
" The BBC takes its responsibilities over standards seriously and recognises what happened was completely unacceptable . "
Ofcom is conducting its own investigation into the row , which could result in a fine .
Mr Thompson , meanwhile , has said there must be " tight discipline " in the future and that " nothing like this must ever happen again " .
' Final warning '
He called Ross 's actions " utterly unacceptable " , adding that the presenter should regard his three - month suspension as a " final warning " .
He said the suspension - which will reportedly cost the entertainer more than £ 1 million - was " an exceptional step " .
Russell Brand resigned from his Radio 2 show Mr Thompson met the BBC Trust on Thursday to discuss the crisis .
The Trust has demanded an on - air apology and called for editorial standards in the BBC to be tightened , with particular attention to " high risk " programmes .
In a statement issued after their meeting with Mr Thompson , the Trust said it was " dismayed " that the broadcasts " fell so far short of audience expectations " .
It said there had been a " deplorable intrusion " into " the privacy of Mr Sachs and his granddaughter " .
They issued an unreserved apology to licence fee payers , as well as to Sachs .
' Huge mistake '
Ms Douglas said the decision to leave her job was " mine and mine alone " and was made with " enormous regret " .
Her departure dismayed many of her colleagues , one of whom - DJ Chris Evans - called her " the best boss in the world " .
Lesley Douglas began her career at the BBC in 1986 However , he said employees of the station understood the " severity of what 's gone on " .
" We do n't feel like we 've been picked on undeservedly , " he said after his show on Thursday .
" It was a huge mistake and we all wish it had n't happened .
" Andrew Sachs does n't want to be 78 years old and remembered for this .
He wants to be remembered for what he did brilliantly . "
Speaking on Five Live earlier , Radio 2 DJ Paul Gambaccini said Douglas 's departure was a " tragedy Greek in its dimensions " .

" She believed Russell Brand 's hire was a good thing for Radio 2 and she stood by him through thick and thin .
" I knew it would end in tears .
When you pick up a time bomb , one day it will explode . "
The incident , he said , demonstrated the danger of " airlifting " TV personalities into radio .
" I believed Russell did not have the talent for Radio 2 and I 've been proved right .
I felt he was not appropriate for the network . "

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , an Independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats , blasted the 42 - 13 vote this morning that allowed Joe Lieberman to keep his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , despite campaigning for John McCain in 2008 and participating in the smearing of President - elect Barack Obama .
“ I spoke against the Lieberman motion and voted against it , " said Sanders , who had made his feelings on the issue known before today 's vote .
" For me , the bottom line is that millions of Americans , with unprecedented energy , worked day and night to get Barack Obama elected and to move our country in a very new direction . "
" I think it ’s a slap in the face to these activists that someone who opposed those efforts in a very prominent way is awarded with a major committee . "
And , of course , Sanders is exactly right .
Stripping Lieberman of such a key committee chairmanship is the least Democrats should have done and many of us believe he should have been flat - out booted from the caucus entirely .
But at least we know we had Sanders and 12 unknown Democrats -- the vote was a secret ballot -- who had the guts to stand up and be counted on Lieberman and his despicable actions .
The vast amounts of food lost to spoilage and insects in poor countries , and simply tossed in rich ones , also represent an enormous stream of wasted water , according to a new report that calls for big improvements in a world heading toward 9 billion hungry , thirsty mouths .
The report , “ Saving Water : From Field to Fork — Curbing Losses and Wastage in the Food Chain , ” was issued on Thursday by the Stockholm International Water Institute , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , and the International Water Management Institute ( report pdf here ) .
It outlines ways that governments could halve the amount of food lost between field and plate by 2025 .
The amounts of waste are staggering .
In the United States , nearly one - third of the food that is produced each year , worth about $ 48 billion , is discarded .
The water it took to grow and process that wasted food amounts to about 10 trillion gallons , according to the analysis .
Many European countries have similar losses , proportional to their size .
One reason for the waste is simply that in prospering countries , as food costs have become an ever smaller proportion of total household budgets , the amount of discarded food has ballooned , according to a recent article by Andrew Martin .
Losses in poorer countries most often occur in fields and storehouses , through spoilage and damage by pests .
I wrote last year about efforts to devise low - tech methods to help preserve fruits and vegetables on the way to markets in hot climates .
Years ago , in the context of the anthrax attacks , I learned about food irradiation , which developing countries increasingly are employing to cut spoilage rates ; the technique has just been approved in the United States for spinach and lettuce .
One way or another , it ’s clear that improved efficiency in food production and water use will be needed in a world of growing populations seeking decent lives .
As the new report explains , more than a billion people now live in areas with insufficient water .
Rising demand for agricultural products that require large amounts of water , particularly beef cattle and biofuel crops , is adding to shortages .
For a close - up look at food waste at the level of the household , you can check out Tara Parker - Pope ’s interview earlier this year with the food - waste maven Jonathan Bloom .

Every couple months , an industry veteran comes forward and decries used games sales as a huge issue that is ruining the industry .
I certainly agree with many of the arguments – the less money developers get from sales of their games , the harder it is for them to take risks further down the road , let alone stay in business .
Nonetheless , a few words should be said in defense of used games .
Gamestop IS part of the games industry
An odd thing about the typical used sales debate is the assumption that the industry is not getting a cut of the profit from pre-owned games .
Of course , Gamestop is an actual part of the games industry .
One has a hard time imagining how the overall games market would be healthier without a strong retail chain dedicated purely to gaming .
How many pure music retailers are still around ?
I ’m sure I ’m not the only one who misses Tower Records .
If used games are a core piece of the puzzle for Gamestop , so be it .
Market segmentation helps our industry broaden its base
Our industry is notoriously poor at market segmentation .
Being able to sell essentially the same product at multiple price points for different groups of consumers is an important tool for maximizing revenue .
Think of the “ Home ” and “ Professional ” version of Windows or lower airline prices on weekends ( for non-business travelers ) .
Or consider the movie industry , which segments the market into full - price tickets , matinee tickets , pay - per- view , DVD rentals , and broadcast rights , each with a progressively lower price point per session .
Used game sales are the primary method by which the retail games market is segmented .
For quite a few gamers , especially younger ones , used games are their only option for buying games instead of renting them .
Keeping these price - sensitive consumers – who will often be tomorrow ’s full - price customers – in the retail system and away from piracy is a good thing all around .
The more players the better
By opening up retail sales to a larger segment of the market , used game sales mean that more people are playing our games than would be in a world without them .
Beyond the obvious advantages of bigger community sizes and word - of - mouth sales , a larger player base can benefit game developers who are ready to earn secondary income from their games .
In - game ads are one source of this additional revenue , but the best scenario is downloadable content .
A used copy of Rock Band may go through several owners , but each one of them may give Harmonix money for their own personal rights to “ Baba O’Riley ” or “ I Fought the Law ” .
Further , a move is currently underway by companies such as Epic and EA to give special bonuses only to consumers who buy the game new .
For example , every new copy of NBA Live 09 will include a code redeemable for the NBA Live 365 service , which provides daily stat updates for players over the course of the season .
Purchasers of used copies need to fork over $ 20 for the same feature .
This situation actually means that the more times the game is resold , the better it is for EA ’s bottom line .
The used games market increases the perceived value of new games
Many factors come into play when a consumer decides if a specific game purchase is worth the money , and one of those factors is the perceived value from selling it back as a used game .
In other words , people will pay more for a new game because they know they can get some of that money back when they trade it in at the local Gamestop .
Importantly , this perceived value exists whether the consumer actually sells the game or keeps it .
Wizards of the Coast has long admitted that the existence of the secondary market for Magic cards has long helped buoy the primary market because buyers perceive that the cards have monetary value .
Of course , the greatest threat to the used games market comes from digital distribution .
Games purchased over Steam , Impulse , PSN , or Xbox Live are tied to personal accounts , which means they can not be resold .
However , game publishers need to take an important step for digital distribution to finally matter .
Games purchased digitally need to cost less than their boxed , retail counterparts .
A digital version of Civ 4 currently cost $ 29.99 on Steam , yet the boxed version costs only $ 24.25 at Amazon .
Thus , with various volume or loss leader discounts , the retail version can often be cheaper than the digital one !
Because the ability to resell my boxed copy of Civ 4 increases its value to me as a consumer , digital distribution has limited appeal unless publishers are willing to give me an appropriate discount to make up for that difference in value .
Obviously , part of the problem is that publishers do n’t want to offend their retail partners .
Sony tried crossing the Rubicon by pricing the PSN version of WarHawk at $ 40 , which was $ 20 cheaper than its retail counterpart ( which did , at least , include a headset ) but eventually retreated to a single price point .
Given their inherent lesser value , digital downloads should be priced to compete with used retail games , not new retail games .
If publishers want to solve the used games problem , the answer is not to bluster about it in public and hope things change .
The answer is to bite the bullet and lower the cost of digital game downloads .
( Of course , the real answer may be to ditch sales altogether for a free - to - play , service - oriented approach , but that ’s a different story altogether … )

As expected , Nintendo has announced the new DSi at its Fall presentation in Japan .
The device features atouchscreen layout almost identical to the DS Lite , though the company is calling it a " third platform , " which means it 's complementing the existing system , not necessarily replacing it .
Looks - wise there 's not much different happening , but it 's some 12 percent thinner -- partly because it omits the GBA cartridge slot .
The displays are slightly larger , at 3.25 inches apiece , and there 's an external three megapixel camera as well as a front - facing camera located on the inside hinge .
The DSi has an SD slot and internal storage -- we 're not sure how much at the moment -- but photos can be taken directly to the Wii Photo Channel on the card .
Nintendo's also launching an online " DSi Shop , " which will sell content directly over WiFi , including a free browser app and " DS Ware " game -- and the company will offer free wireless connectivity at " Nintendo Zone " hotspots located in Japanese McDonalds .
The shop will take the newly - renamed Nintendo Points ( formerly Wii Points ) , 1000 of which will come free with the handheld until March 2010 , and content will be priced in 200 / 500 / 800 point brackets .
The DSi will come in white or black finishes , and will cost ¥ 18,900 ( $ 178 ) when it launches in Japan on November 1st -- the rest of us will have to wait until next year .
We 've added the official Japanese DSi site link , check it out !
Our brothers at Joystiq have done a comprehensive spec-check of the DSi compared to the PSP - 3000 and iPhone / iPod touch .
Be sure and take a gander .
You can also watch Nintendo's DSi demo video after the break , and trust us , it rules .

Why I put my Down 's syndrome baby up for adoption ... and the loving mother who took him in
When Nathan was born with Down's his horrified mother gave him away - a decision that 's left her scarred by guilt .
But for the woman who adopted him , he 's been an endless source of joy .
Here both women tell their haunting stories
THE BIRTH MOTHER
Sue , 45 , lives near Bristol with her second husband , Simon , and two of her children , Leanne , 24 , and Jake , 18 .
She says :
A photograph of Nathan and myself is kept by my bed .
It was taken last summer , when I took him to Disneyworld to celebrate his 18th birthday .
I 've always kept in contact with my son and seen him on his birthdays , but this was extra special - the holiday of a lifetime .
In this snapshot - my favourite picture - we are both looking horrified and thrilled as we plunge on the rollercoaster together .
Nathan with birth mum Sue , who gave him away for adoption 20 years ago
Those two weeks that I spent with my son were the happiest days of my life .
It was as if I had been taken to heaven - to be able to hold him , smell him and enjoy my boy again .
But at the end of each day , Nathan would walk to a window , look out wistfully and say : ' Can we ring Mum today ?
Can I speak to Mum ?'
And , of course , he meant Alex - the woman who adopted him after I gave him away .
Since Nathan was born , so many knives have twisted into my heart .
But , strangely enough , I did n't feel jealous that he loves Alex more - or that she is ' Mum ' to my son - because I was the one who handed Nathan over as a baby .
I handed over the right to that intense love .
All I wanted was for him to be happy - and I 'm happy that he has found someone he truly loves to raise him .
Perhaps the real sadness of my situation is that my decision to give Nathan up for adoption was made at the loneliest and most terrifying point of my life .
' The thought made me shudder '
I honestly believe that if just one person had said to me : ' Sue , you can cope .
You can manage with this baby ' , then I would happily have kept him and both our lives might have been so different .
When Nathan was born , I was 25 years old - I had no life experience whatsoever .
I had grown up in a small town outside Bristol , left school to work in a factory and at the age of 20 married my childhood sweetheart , Trevor - my first and only boyfriend at that time .
A year later , our daughter Leanne was born .
All our friends were having babies at the same time , and soon I was pregnant again .
When I was six months gone , I went to a shopping precinct .
There , walking towards me , was a woman in her 60s , with a tight perm , looking exhausted and haunted .
She wore a cheap elasticated skirt , had sandals on over swollen ankles and her shoulders were slumped .
She looked despairing .
Holding her hand was her son - a man of about 30 , with the distinctive Down 's syndrome features .
It was the first time I had seen anyone with Down 's syndrome , and I could n't get the image of this boy - man and his mother out of my mind .
I just remember thinking : ' He 's never going to leave home . '
The thought made me shudder .
Nathan :
His adoptive mother said ' He was the most beautiful baby I had ever seen '
Nathan was born on March 9 , 1988 .
They wrapped him in a blanket , put him in my arms , and my husband took a photograph .
I remember thinking : ' We 've got a little boy - lovely ' .
Then , suddenly , the midwife took him from my arms and walked out .
For three hours , I kept asking for my baby whenever a doctor or nurse came into the room , but no one would tell me what was going on .
I could only see the pity in their eyes .
I felt terrified .
Finally , we were taken to a special care baby unit , where Nathan lay in an incubator .
A nurse took my hand ; the doctor said : ' Nathan is n't going to die , but he 's a Mongol - he has Down 's syndrome . '
With that , he handed me three leaflets - with awful old - fashioned images of children with their tongues hanging out .
All I could think of was the woman in the shopping precinct with her grown son stumbling beside her .
I thought : ' Was that an image of me in the future ? '
I was in shock .
I could n't bring myself to ring my mum .
I did n't even know what to say to Trevor , and he could n't find any way of comforting me .
I actually thought : ' I 'll tell people he has died , then we can walk away from the hospital and pretend this has never happened - but I realised I could n't live a lie . '
I could n't bring myself to hold my baby either , though .
I was terrified of falling in love with him - and I knew that there would be no choice .
Already , someone had mentioned adoption .
The next day , my mother and family came in to see the baby , and someone took a photo of us all together .
I remember looking around and thinking : ' You are never going to be part of this family . '
Deep depression
We left hospital 24 hours after Nathan 's birth - and left him there .
He was still in special care , where he remained for a week .
It was almost accepted that I should just leave without him .
At the end of the week , someone rang me and said : ' We can't keep him at hospital , he 's fit now .
If you want him to go to foster care , we will arrange it . '
So it just all happened , while I sat in shock .
Not one person - the medical staff , my husband or friends - even hinted I should bring Nathan home .
Leaving hospital without a healthy child was perhaps the most miserable experience of my life .
Going home to the nursery we 'd prepared was so hard .
My next - door neighbour had just had a baby .
At night , I heard a baby crying and I would run into the empty nursery , looking for my son .
Then I would remember that he was n't perfect , and he was n't here - and it would hit me like a physical pain .
My arms ached to hold Nathan again .
But I knew nothing about children with Down 's syndrome , and it terrified me .
It only would have taken one person to say : ' Come on Sue , let 's love him , you can do it ' - but no one did .
My friends melted away from me , and my husband would n't say those words that I needed to hear .
Nathan was taken to a foster home after a week , and I was allowed to visit .
Even so , by then I 'd made my mind to have him adopted .
I tried to cram all my motherhood into those few hours - bathing him , feeding him and smelling his beautiful baby smell .
One minute I thought I would keep him , the next I swung , like a pendulum , into a deep depression .
Nathan ( right ) and Chloe , another Down 's baby adopted by Alex Bell
I was still in shock , and was left to make the biggest decision of my life with no support .
I went to see children at a local special school , and one boy with Down 's syndrome ran over and gave me a huge bear hug .
It terrified me .
At that moment , I realised I could n't keep Nathan .
I can't remember the moment I told the social workers I wanted to put my baby up for adoption .
But the decision had been made when I first heard of Alex Bell .
I was doing my ironing , crying - I wept constantly - and watching daytime TV .
There was a feature about this amazing mum from Manchester who had adopted three boys with Down 's syndrome and was looking to adopt one more .
She said : ' Somewhere out there is a baby which has been born and is destined to be mine . '
I started to shake , and I taped the rest of the programme .
I watched it over and over again .
Six weeks later , the social worker arrived to update me on Nathan 's adoption .
They had put his picture in an adoption magazine , and 200 people had applied to take him .
There was a shortlist of three , and the social worker read me brief details .
When he came to the last one , he said : ' There 's a single mother who has adopted three boys with Down 's syndrome . '
I ran to the video tape , put on the programme and pointed to Alex .
I was shaking , and I said : ' It 's her , is n't it . '
' I was a nervous wreck '
The social worker just threw his papers in the air and smiled .
The thought that Nathan would be loved by this incredible woman made such a difference .
Weeks later , when the adoption had been approved , I was told that Alex wanted to meet me .
I was utterly terrified .
I thought she 'd walk into my immaculate house and see all my nice things and think : ' She has a lovely home .
Why is she giving away her baby ? '
I was a nervous wreck .
But Alex walked in through the door and said : ' Put the kettle on and make me a tea . '
It was the first time , since Nathan had been born three months earlier , that anyone had said anything normal to me - the first time I felt I could breathe .
Looking back , at the time , I was falling apart .
Alex saved me .
She mentioned open adoption - giving me the chance to stay in contact with Nathan - and although the social workers were n't keen , we both insisted that this was what we wanted .
Nathan went to Alex when he was eight months old , having remained in foster care up to that point .
Even up until the final hour , I kept having panic attacks .
Marriage split
I can't remember the time I saw him last before handing him over - I was too grief - stricken .
By now , I was pregnant again .
I did n't want to replace Nathan , but I felt that without another baby to hold , I would just fall apart .
Alex sent me a postcard after a few weeks , and said Nathan had settled down .
On Christmas Day , she rang to thank me for a gift I 'd sent to Nathan .
On Nathan 's first birthday , she caught the train from Manchester and we met for three hours .
I hardly recognised my own son .
He was so happy and healthy , and was lying on his front and lifting his head .
I was buzzing with happiness just to see him again .
Over the years , I continued to see Nathan on his birthdays , just before Christmas , and once for a summer party at Alex 's house .
It was wonderful to see him growing up so happily - but each time I said goodbye , I would fall into an awful , catatonic depression .
My marriage split up within two years of Nathan 's adoption and I know it was largely because of my husband 's failure to support me over our baby .
I resented the fact that I had been so alone and so vulnerable .
I still live with the guilt that I gave Nathan away .
I think of him every morning when I wake , and every night as I go to bed .
When we are with him now , we have such fun together as a family - myself , my second husband Simon , Leanne and my son Jake .
I often think : ' This is what life would have been like for us .
We could have been a proper family . '
THE ADOPTER
Alex Bell , 53 , has adopted eight children with Down 's syndrome , and cares for her family in a ten - bedroom home outside Manchester .
Nathan was the fourth child she adopted .
I first saw Nathan beaming up at me from a photo in an adoption magazine .
Here was this beautiful happy little baby , and just three lines written underneath , saying : ' Three - month - old baby boy needs a new home .
Down 's syndrome .
No complications .'
Alex Bell with Matthew ( left ) and Nathan aged 13
It was as if the photograph had jumped up and grabbed my heart - I just knew that he had to be mine .
I had already adopted three older boys , all with Down 's syndrome , but I was longing to hold a baby in my arms for the first time .
I had already been approved to adopt again when I happened by chance to see Nathan 's photograph .
I immediately rang up .
I do n't judge people who hand over their babies for adoption .
How can anyone say how they would feel in that situation , if their hopes and dreams for a perfect child had fallen apart .
Often , they have their marriages and other children to consider .
Not everyone has the support that they need to raise a child who may have challenges .
But I really wanted to meet Nathan 's mother before he became mine .
I wanted to know who she was , what she was like - and get some sense of why she had come to the decision .
My chance came when I met Nathan for the first time .
The adoption had been approved , and the social workers arranged for me to come and see Nathan at his foster home .
He was the most beautiful baby I had ever seen - with enormous dark eyes .
He was friendly , happy and well cared for .
I thought of the mother who was giving him up and realised she must be going through hell .
I thought : ' She deserves to meet me , to see where her boy is going . '
So I asked the social worker to arrange a meeting .
He rang Sue , and she agreed to meet me straightaway .

We went to her house , and when she opened the door I saw the definition of hell .
Sue was in utter torment .
The agony was there in her face .
This was not someone who was handing over a baby because she could not be bothered or because she wanted a perfect child .
This was a mother who loved her baby dearly , and who was in an appalling physical and mental state .
We had a cup of tea together , and I told her about my life with the boys .
Sue seemed to relax - I liked her enormously , and I had a strong feeling that if she had more support around her , she would be raising her son herself .
We both agreed that Sue should remain in contact with Nathan .
I am always honest with my children .
They know where they came from , that they had other birth mothers .
I wanted Nathan to grow up secure in the knowledge that his birth mum had loved him , too .
A month later , I picked Nathan up and drove him home as my own son .
Sue had handed over all his baby clothes , and all the teddies and toys she had bought during her pregnancy .
At first , our contact was sporadic .
But as Nathan settled , I started to write , or telephone , just to let her know how happy he was .
We were all so happy .
For me , the joy of holding a baby in my arms and giving him his bottle meant so much .
I had never known so much contentment .
I decided I wanted to adopt children when I was 22 and working as a teacher in a special school .
I was single - I had boyfriends , but the rush of love in my life came from the children I worked with , not men that I dated .
I never felt the desire to marry , but I did want to care for a child who needed me .
It took four years to be approved as an adopter , because in those days it was almost unheard of for a single woman to adopt , and then another 12 months before they found me a child .
' I fell in love '
Finally , in the spring of 1984 the social worker called at my home , and said ' This is your child . '
She handed me a snapshot of Matthew , a little boy with Down 's syndrome who was almost two years old .
He was absolutely gorgeous , with light brown hair and blue eyes .
A week later , I was taken to see him at his foster home in Watford and I fell in love .
The first six months were tough - Matthew cried a lot - but once he settled , I knew that I wanted him to have a brother or sister .
My next son was Simon , another boy with Down 's syndrome .
He also had a heart condition though , and a life expectancy of just five .
I then applied for a third time and was given Adrian , who was nine ; he has Down 's syndrome , too , and autism .
I loved being a mother of three , but I really wanted to experience the whole baby thing - changing nappies , holding a little warm body in my arms .
That 's when Nathan came into my life .
It has been such an honour to be his Mum .
I love him just as much as I could ever love a biological child .
Perhaps my only regret is the amount of pain that Sue went through after he was born .
We both went on to have more children .
Sue had another baby boy , and I adopted another four children with Down 's syndrome .
Nathan is now a happy and much - loved brother and son .
When I see Sue and him together , I see the pain washed away from her eyes .
I never feel jealous about the time he spends with her - I want my children to feel as loved as possible .
In the end , Sue and I just both want the same for Nathan .
After all , we are both his mothers .
• A mother Like Alex is on Sky Real Lives on Wednesday , December 3 , at 9 pm .
The book A Mother Like Alex , by Bernard Clark , is published by HarperCollins .
Just last year , “ in the gleeful afterglow of his deal for The Wall Street Journal , ” said Tom Arango in The New York Times , media mogul Rupert Murdoch “ agreed to cooperate ” with Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff for the biography The Man Who Owns the News : Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch .
But now Murdoch is objecting to parts of the book .
What happened ?
“ The timing of Murdoch 's counter - thrust is odd , ” said Jeff Bercovici in Portfolio online .
But Wolff has nothing to worry about :
His “ cool response is that he has everything on tape — leading some to speculate that Murdoch 's protestations are insincere and meant only to keep his executives happy . ”
Murdoch knows exactly what he ’s doing , said Ryan Tate in Gawker .
“ Having talked at great length for Wolff and his tape recorder , he can't very well sue publisher Random House . ”
But by “ feinting in this direction , ” Murdoch “ provided Wolff a way to air in the Times those bits of information Murdoch most wanted to suppress , ” while “ promoting Wolff 's book in the same stroke . ”
Pretty clever .
Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton has cast her vote for Barack Obama , saying , " Voters have understood we need a serious president for serious times . "
The senator was asked if she felt sorry that her name was not on the ballot .
She replied : " The personal honor and privilege I had of being a candidate and coming so close is something I 'll always be proud of . "
Clinton voted Tuesday with her husband , Bill Clinton , in their hometown of Chappaqua in Westchester County .
The Democratic senator said she hoped " to be part of what I hope will be a great next couple of years for America . "
She added : " I feel very good about what 's going to happen today . "
When asked what if Republican candidate John McCain wins ?
Clinton replied : " That 's not going to happen . "
This is an old one , and I 'm sure it 's a re-post .
But , I thought I 'd share this video , just because I LMAO when I found it again .

Update : Few online events have ended as horrifically as the Lori Drew case .
Befriended by a boy on MySpace who later began bullying her , a teenager named Megan Meier hung herself , and her online friend later turned out to be the mother of a school classmate , who created the persona specifically to torment the young girl .
Lori Drew was found not guilty of conspiracy on Tuesday , but guilty of a lesser misdemeanor charge as a result of setting up the fake persona , which the court decided was a case of “ unauthorized access ” to the social networking site ( under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ) , because it was in breach of MySpace ’s terms of service .
It ’s easy to sympathize with the urge to punish Lori Drew ( Megan ’s mother has said she wants Drew to get the maximum penalty ) .
After all , her actions helped lead to the death of a young woman whose life was full of promise and potential , and that is something almost anyone would find unforgivably repugnant .
But finding her guilty of a federal offense because she created a fake MySpace account leaves the entire online world on a very slippery legal slope .
Yes , doing so is technically a breach of the terms of service for sites like MySpace and Facebook , but those rules ( which few people read anyway ) are routinely overlooked .
There are hundreds , possibly even thousands , of phony accounts on both networks — people who have created personas based on countries , religious figures , even inanimate objects .
Are all those people now guilty of a federal offense ?
If the Drew ruling stands , then legally they will be , as the New York Times points out .
In effect , they will be seen by the courts as criminal hackers .
No doubt supporters of the decision will argue that such a case is only likely to emerge if the fake account is used in the commission of a crime , such as theft or murder — at which point it could provide an easy way of nabbing a wrong - doer , in the same way that tax evasion managed to hook Chicago crime boss Al Capone .
But how do we know that it would only be used in such cases ?
We do n’t .
It could just as easily be used to prosecute users who created fake accounts for some other purpose , such as poking fun at a prominent public figure , or to protect their identity in some way .
That ’s getting awfully close to impinging on freedom of speech , and yet it would be more than possible if the Drew case stands .
Anyone who altered their name , their age , or their gender for virtually any purpose — benign as well as harmful — would be liable to federal prosecution .
And is any of that going to make social networks safer for people like Megan Meier ?
Not really .
What happened to her was definitely a tragedy , but it was not a crime .
The Drew case should be overturned .
Update :
It ’s obvious from the number of comments here — and the passionate feelings expressed in many of them — that my post has struck a nerve with a lot of people .
Some believe that finding Lori Drew guilty of virtually any crime is worth it , because of the heinous nature of her actions , but I think laws should be used when they are justified by the facts , not just because we are desperate to find a way of punishing someone .
And the fact is that the “ unauthorized access ” law was designed to apply to criminal hackers , not people who create fake personas on social - networking sites — regardless of what that persona allegedly made someone do .
If we are going to prosecute everyone who does n’t abide by the terms of service for a website , then the courts are going to be filled to the rafters .
I think @ Jeema put it well in a comment that said : “ Anyone could now be prosecuted for violating a terms of service agreement if this precedent stands , regardless of whether or not they ever intended to cause harm or not .
If we want to make a law against cyber - bullying , fine , but we should not abuse existing laws and throw away freedom of speech in the name of mob justice . ”
The reality is that the charges against Lori Drew were designed to take what she did and twist it until it fit into a specific law , so that she could be punished for something — anything — as a result of her behaviour , as noted by Diogo .
That ’s not justice , it ’s revenge .
A number of commenters have said that they do n’t think this case has anything to do with freedom of speech , since companies such as MySpace are allowed to do whatever they like .
In fact this is n’t the case , as others have pointed out .
It may not fit most of our definitions of speech , but I think it could quite easily be argued that creating a persona of your choosing for an online social network — provided you are n’t trying to hijack the identity of a real person — should fall under the protection of the First Amendment .

In a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars , scientists have found vast , debris - covered glaciers much nearer the equatorial region than anyone had expected , according to a report Friday in the journal Science .
The glaciers , estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as the entire Great Lakes , were found by ground - penetrating radar on NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft .
“ We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there , ” said Ali Safaeinili , a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge .
Scientists analyzing Martian topography have seen lots of evidence of water - caused erosion on the planet , but until now the only deposits of ice have been seen at the poles .

One of the glaciers has been estimated as being the size of Los Angeles and as much as half a mile thick .
How did the ice get there ?
The best guess , said John W. Holt , a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas , is that climate change was brought on by changes in Mars ’ rotational axis over time .
Because Mars does n’t have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable , as the Earth does , the planet can tilt dramatically , redistributing the sun ’s heat and energy and shifting the poles .
These icy deposits may have lain hidden in their current state as long as 200 million years , Holt said .
The discovery was n’t a complete surprise .
Scientists had previously noticed rocky debris “ aprons ” that seemed to flow away from steep hills as if something underground was lubricating their movements .
But there was no proof until the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ’s Italian - built radar confirmed the presence of ice .

The discovery could be one of the most significant for those who want to see a manned mission to the Red Planet , a goal that was announced by President Bush in 2004 but has since been quietly de-emphasized by NASA .
Knowing that astronauts could obtain water in the temperate regions would probably make the mission more feasible .
It is still unclear , however , whether the water is accessible from the surface .
Holt said the radar measurements indicated that it could be covered by as much as 30 feet of debris .
“ If you could get a backhoe in there , you could get at it , ” said Jeffrey Plaut , a geologist at JPL .
“ You ’d have to figure out how to get a backhoe to Mars . ”

is it really affecting the sound , or is it in my head .
When the federal government decided to direct billions of dollars into Citigroup 's coffers over the weekend , one of the easiest punching bags in the country became their sponsorship of the new Mets stadium .
The bank is supposed to pay $ 20 million a year over the next 20 years to have their name on the outside of the stadium , something that seems quite profligate in the face of the reality of their company 's status .
Two New York City Council members , James Oddo and Vincent Ignizio , are trying to make hay of the situation .
They 're saying that the name of the stadium , Citi Field , should be changed to Citi / Taxpayer Field so it better reflects where the money is actually coming from .
" Perhaps a name change is in order , since it will be the taxpayers of the country who will foot the bill for not only part of stadium , but for the company itself , " Mr. Ignizio said .
" The taxpayers are spending billions for this company to maintain its operations and deserve the recognition for their largess . "
With the understanding that neither of these guys actually care about this issue beyond the extent it helps them get their names in print , there 's a question for Oddo and Ignizio to answer .
Why should n't it be called Taxpayer Field regardless of who paid for naming rights ?
The money to actually build the stadium , after all , did n't come from Citigroup , but from public monies in the guises of various bond issues , subsidies and tax breaks .
The same is true of Taxpayer Stadium in the Bronx and just about every other new edifice constructed for sports teams in this country .
Millions of other structures with private uses are also financed this way , but it is the sponsorship that gets these guys all riled up ?
That 's not to say the stadium should remain Citi Field .
When you lay off 52,000 people and need a government bailout , you have bigger fish to fry than extravagent advertising .
It 's up to the Mets how to proceed , and they should have a better ear for what 's going on in the world around them and allow Citi to slink off and lick their wounds .
While this Lego safe is …well … made of Lego , it ’s more secure than you might imagine .
With 305 billion possible code combinations , motion sensor alarms , a weight of 14 pounds and the fact that no thief would ever think you ’d be stupid enough to secure anything of real monetary value behind Lego – it should work a treat .
The safe consists of 2.7 - inch thick walls of interlocking logo bricks ( presumably glued together ) and features a large display that shows the numbers as you twist the combination dials , secret power on / off buttons and a cool motorized door that opens and closes itself … as long as your code is correct .
One advantage to this safe is that you know that if you ever forget your code , you can always smash / cut / burn your way in , given enough time .
Check out the workings in the video below .
With a few modifications , I think this Lego safe could make an excellent decoy for thieves .
You know , put a prominent , bright LED on there reading something like “ Total Deposited : $ 869,021 ” .
If your thief bites and starts a smashing , they ’ll soon discover that canister of tear gas inside and the trip sensors they just tore through .
Do n’t forget to position a hidden camera though … great YouTube material .

LATE last year , your correspondent decided he was paying too much for long - distance telephone calls , and vowed to switch to one of the new VOIP ( “ voice over internet protocol ” ) services , which offer calls to most places in the world for a few pennies a minute at most .
At the time , his land - line carrier ( Verizon ) was charging him five cents a minute for local calls , 11 cents for long - distance , and around 16 cents for international calls .
With lots of contacts in Britain and Japan , over half his monthly phone bill was for international calls .
Many PC users got their first taste of VOIP in the 1990s when a product called VocalTec first hit the market .
But because of the technical hassles involved , making calls between two PCs connected to the internet was n't for the faint of heart .
Skype changed all that in 2003 with a delightfully simple piece of software that could be downloaded for free and used to talk to other Skype users around the world with no charge whatsoever .
Since then , close to 300 m copies of the Skype software have been downloaded , and 13 m Skypers are jabbering away cheerfully on any given day .
Reuters
You can still use Skype to talk to other users around the world for free .
That 's a terrific deal — provided , that is , the person you 're contacting is sat at a computer .
But what if you want to reach someone 's land - line or mobile number ?
No problem .
Either buy Skype credit online and pay around two to three cents a minute , or purchase a monthly subscription for $ 9.95 and make unlimited calls to other people 's phones anywhere in the world .
Best of all , Skype offers video and text - messaging as well as good old - fashioned talk .
Your correspondent first started using Skype 's video - conferencing feature in 2006 when working for several months in Japan .
He found it an ideal way to help his nine - year - old with her homework .
With so much going for it , Skype has attracted its share of wannabes .
Before deciding to hang up his land - line , your correspondent investigated a number of Skype alternatives — including SightSpeed and Gizmo Project ( now Gizmo5 ) as well as newcomers like Mobivox , iSkoot , TalkPlus , Jajah and Jangl .
With a few honourable exceptions , most looked financially fragile and have subsequently had trouble turning their technologies into worthy contenders .
Two things made Skype the obvious choice .
One , of course , was its ease of use , especially its video - conferencing facility .
Improvements in video quality — along with the capacity for full - screen video plus “ picture - in - picture ” in the latest versions — have made using Skype only more compelling .
The other clincher was the way the Skype software also runs on dozens of mobile phones as well as game consoles and other internet appliances .
Your correspondent currently uses a dedicated Skype phone that automatically logs on to any open Wi -Fi network within hailing distance — like a “ smart phone ” with a built - in Wi -Fi radio as well as a cellular connection .
Open Wi-Fi hotspots are ten -a - penny in coastal California .
Though it has saved him several thousand dollars over the past six months , your correspondent finds
Skype to be not without its problems .
In particular , the more he uses it , the more he worries about its lack of security .
Sure ,
Skype relies on some of the best encryption technology around to prevent ordinary eavesdroppers from listening in to conversations .
For a start , the user 's login is certified by the widely - trusted RSA algorithm .
And the information being transmitted — whether voice , video , text or computer data — is scrambled with the same 256 - bit AES encryption method used by the military everywhere .
But because Skype sends and receives calls with a proprietary protocol that is closely guarded as a company secret , there 's no way of knowing how tamper - proof the network really is .
There could even be a “ backdoor ” to the software , of which the people at Skype itself might be unaware .
When a network provider says , effectively , “ Trust us — everything 's fine , ” you would have to be naive not to have at least some reservations .
That 's an even greater concern when you know that anyone can join the network without having to prove his identity .
The fact is , users can set up any number of Skype accounts , each under a different fictitious name , and never be challenged .
In short , this is not the telephone system that Ma Bell made a model of trustworthiness and reliability .
Skypers are out there in the big , bad world at its ugly worst .
You can see why Skype terrifies IT managers particularly .
Because it was designed by the same bright sparks in Estonia who created the virtually unstoppable KaZaA file - sharing network — and it uses much the same proprietary form of peer - to - peer architecture —
Skype can evade practically every firewall known to man .
With messages bounced from one user 's computer unknowingly to another 's before reaching their final destination , there is no central server directing the traffic flow , logging the calls , and screening them for viruses , Trojan horses and spyware .
In short , it 's a perfect vehicle for delivering malware to the inner sanctum of any organisation , as well as sneaking corporate secrets out .
Such features hardly can escape the attention of those criminals who surreptitiously commandeer hordes of innocent users ' computers to launch devastating “ botnet ” attacks on organisations .
Then there 's a little matter of compliance .
Because of its heavy encryption , firms have no way of recording Skype 's voice and video calls to meet their financial and legal obligations under the Sarbanes - Oxley Act .
That alone can leave them wide open to criminal penalties .
If that 's not enough for IT managers as well as individual users to worry about , the blogosphere has lately been abuzz about the way Skype tracks every computer 's identity–and quite possibly its whereabouts .
Civil - liberties folks are concerned that this could provide a powerful tool for authoritarian regimes to keep tabs on annoying dissidents .
Skype , you may recall , got a black eye for helping the Chinese authorities filter conversations for sensitive words like “ democracy ” , “ independence ” , “ earthquake ” and more recently “ melamine ” .
Unless you are running the 64 - bit version of Windows , you 'll never notice a tiny file called “ 1.com ” that Skype launches when its users log on .
This tiny 16 - bit program ( which Windows 64 can't read and therefore reports as an error ) executes in a flash and unloads itself immediately — but not before reporting back the identity of the computer 's motherboard .
If you were so inclined , correlating a computer 's ID with its internet address would make tracking the movement of anyone using Skype a doddle .
Mischievously , your correspondent has sprinkled empty 1.com files throughout his Windows directory — to see whether denying Skype the chance to interrogate his computer 's identity triggers any disruptions .
So far , nothing untoward has happened .
He would be amused to hear from readers who have taken similar precautions .
Joerg Haider and Stefan Petzner enjoyed electoral success
The new leader of the party previously headed by Austrian far - right politician Joerg Haider has admitted the two men had a " special relationship " .
Stefan Petzner told Austrian radio that Mr Haider , whom he met five years ago , was " the man of my life " .
Mr Haider , 58 , died in a high - speed car crash earlier this month .
He had a high blood alcohol level .
His party , the Alliance for Austria 's Future , insisted on Thursday that Mr Petzner " was n't his lover " .
" He was a very good friend , it was n't love , " party spokesman Heimo Lepuschitz told the BBC , commenting on Mr Petzner 's remarks .
The Alliance for Austria 's Future is best known for taking a tough line on immigration and EU policies .
We had a special relationship
Stefan Petzner
Mr Petzner took over as head of the party following his leader 's sudden death .
Mr Haider had said frequently that he would like his 27 - year - old protege , and party deputy to take his place one day .
But Mr Petzner , while remaining overall party leader , is now deputy to hotelier Josef Bucher in the party 's parliamentary group .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The party spokesman said Mr Petzner had not been criticised in the party for his comments and that it was Mr Petzner 's suggestion to put Mr Bucher in charge of the parliamentary group .
Mr Petzner " will look after strategy as head of the party , " Mr Lepuschitz told the BBC .
It has been widely reported in Austria that on the night of his death , Mr Haider left a bar where he had been drinking with Mr Petzner after they had argued .
' I loved him '
Mr Petzner has described feeling a magnetic attraction to Mr Haider .
" We had a special relationship that went far beyond friendship , " Mr Petzner said in an emotional interview on Austrian national radio .
" Joerg and I were connected by something truly special .
He was the man of my life , " he added .
" I loved him as a best friend . "
There has been no comment from the Haider family .
He was married with two children .
Joerg Haider became a potent force in Austria in the 1980s and 90s , championing what he called traditional family values and an end to immigration .
More recently his Alliance for Austria 's Future enjoyed success at the polls , gaining more than 10 % of the votes in September 's general election .
Treasurer Wayne Swan says a massive drop in expected revenue has caused the Government to slash its forecast Budget surplus from over $ 21 billion to around $ 5 b .
Unemployment figures have also been revised up , with the jobless rate expected to hit 5 per cent by the middle of next year , while growth is expected to slow to 2 per cent .
Releasing the Government 's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook , Mr Swan said the global financial crisis had " smashed " a $ 40 billion hole in Budget revenue .
" There 's no point in trying to sugarcoat these figures , " he said .
" The Budget has felt the full force of the global financial crisis . "
Mr Swan said although Australia was still well placed to deal with the crisis , " there could be more to come " .
The forecast GDP for 2008 - 09 is now at 2 per cent , which is down 0.75 per cent from May .
Unemployment is set to rise to 5 per cent in June 2009 and is forecast to rise to 5.75 per cent in June 2010 .
Inflation has been forecast at 3.5 per cent for 2008 - 09 , which is up from 3.25 per cent forecast in the May Budget .
The Budget surplus , which was set at $ 21.7 b in May has now been revised down to $ 5.4 b for 2008 - 09 , which is 0.4 per cent of GDP .
The Budget forecast for 2009 - 10 has also been revised down from $ 19.7 billion to $ 3.6 billion .
Mr Swan says the decreased forecast surplus is due to " massive reductions " in tax revenue , with tax receipts revised down by $ 4.9 billion in 2008 - 09 , $ 12.2 billion in 2009 - 10 , $ 12.4 billion in 2010 - 11 and $ 7.9 billion in 2011 - 12 .
" These are all a direct consequence in what 's occurred in global equity markets and the impact of that on capital gains tax , the impacts of credit market turmoil , weaker global growth and the falling terms of trade , " he said .
Mr Swan says the figures are a dramatic reminder that the country is not immune from global financial market turmoil .
He also says the Government remains committed to reforming the pension system but there may be " tough decisions to be made " around other areas such as infrastructure .
" Given the new circumstances we are going to have to cut our cloth to suit those circumstances and we 're not going to be able to do the wishlist that many people have for us to do - it 's just that simple , " he said .
The outlook report says the crisis continues to present a serious risk to Australia 's economic outlook and the final impact of recent international events remain difficult to assess .
It also says China 's economic outlook will remain crucial for Australia if its demand for exports slows more than expected .
In December over $ 8 billion of payments will be made available to pensioners and families as part of the Government 's $ 10.4 plan to stimulate the economy , announced last month .
Mr Swan says the figures show the Government had to act quickly .
" Today 's figures make it pretty clear that the economy was crying out for the boost that the Government delivered , now backed up by an easing of monetary policy from the Reserve Bank , " he said .
Yesterday the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed interest rates by a further 75 basis points , bringing the official cash rate down to 5.25 per cent .
Opposition Treasury spokesperson Julie Bishop says the Government cannot blame everything on the global financial crisis .
" Of course Australia is not immune from the impacts of the global financial crisis but conditions have been made worse in this country by the Government 's misreading of the economy throughout the year , " she told ABC Radio 's The World Today .
She has also accused the Government of preparing to renege on spending promises .
" The Government says everything 's on the table - that 's just code for saying that they 're going to go back on whatever they said that they would do and they 're now going to say because of the global financial crisis they 're permitted to move a long way from responsible fiscal management , " she said .

BARACK OBAMA , THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL standard - bearer , dropped a bombshell Sept. 7 during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos -- and it had nothing to do with lipstick or pigs .
Obama said for the first time that , if we remain in recession in January and he is the new president , he will not raise taxes .
Instead , he will accelerate proposed tax cuts to low and middle - class wage earners through a " second stimulus package . "
We do n't know if Obama read our August 25 cover story , ( " Dueling Visions " ) , which contrasted his tax proposals with those of John McCain , the GOP 's presidential hopeful .
But it appears that he heeded our advice not to raise taxes during the worst financial crisis in 78 years .
We 're not sure if Obama reads Barron 's but his updated tax - cut and energy plans sound smarter .
His former plan to hike rates on the wealthiest Americans and raise capital gains and dividend taxes in 2009 would siphon job - creating capital out of the economy just when it needs that money the most .
We suggested that this plan would repeat the mistake Herbert Hoover made when he hiked marginal rates to 63 % from 25 % during the Great Depression .
That took investment money and put it in the hands of Washington 's bureaucrats , delaying the recovery .
Obama 's proposed hike on the rich was not nearly as dramatic .
He would have raised the top marginal rate to 39.6 % , where it was under President Bill Clinton , from the current 35 % , and he would raise capital - gains taxes to 20 % from the current 15 % .
Even so , we advised against it because it would slow growth and job creation .
Obama 's welcome change of mind , in effect , moves his tax policies from the far left and closer to the center .
In recent weeks , he 's also dropped his former opposition to expanding drilling offshore for oil and natural gas .
We hope he also rethinks his idea of using tax policy to redistribute income .
With apologies to Robin Hood , taking from the rich to give to the poor hurts the poor over the long run by keeping them in place .
Obama says he wants to grow the economy from the bottom up , in part , by giving big refund checks to individuals who currently pay little federal income tax or no taxes at all .
He would fund it at some point by raising taxes on households making more than $ 250,000 ( or $ 200,000 for individuals ) .
Not only would this strategy cause businessmen to rethink growth because of consequent higher taxes .
It would take away some of the incentive for workers to better themselves by seeking higher wages elsewhere .
And it would permit companies that pay low wages to keep them low , since their workers would in effect be receiving a subsidy from Uncle Sam .
Obama tiptoed into his new policy positions on both taxes and drilling .
He briefly mentioned his new - found support of drilling , providing it avoided environmental damage , in his acceptance speech during the Democratic Party 's presidential convention last month .
Obama vowed not to raise taxes in a recession in response to a question on a Sunday morning news program that 's watched mostly by policy wonks .
We asked Obama 's campaign staff multiple times if he would reiterate his positions .
Our inquiries remain unanswered .
( This leaves us wondering if he might try to tiptoe back out of them at some point . )
Assuming you read us , Sen. Obama , stomp your feet .
Let the voters hear your tax and drilling pledges loud and clear .
You may be amazed at how well they 'd react .
-- Jim McTague
Iraq also obtained a significant degree of jurisdiction in some cases over serious crimes committed by Americans who are off duty and not on bases .
In Washington , the White House welcomed the vote as “ an important and positive step ” and attributed the agreement itself to security improvements in the past year .
Throughout the negotiations , the Shiite parties and the prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , under pressure from forces both within and outside the country , had been trying to strike a balance in forging a viable agreement with the Americans that would guarantee Iraq ’s security and that would still stand firm against what many , including neighboring Iran , consider a hostile force that has occupied Iraq since the spring 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein .
“ This vote shows that the Iraqis have figured out how to stand up for themselves , to Iran and to the U.S. , ” said Michael E. O’Hanlon , a specialist on Iraq at the Brookings Institution .
“ They will have stared in the face at the various options and concluded that none are ideal , but the best for their security is an amount of ongoing but finite American cooperation , while also indicating their strong desire to run their own country on their own as soon as possible . ”
Image Iraqi policemen danced with a United States Army soldier in Baghdad on Sunday , the day Iraqs cabinet approved a security pact .

American officials said the accord was the result of tough bargaining by the Iraqis .
Speaking about the negotiations a few days before the cabinet vote , Ryan C. Crocker , the American ambassador , said of the 100 requests for changes sought by the Iraqi side in recent weeks : “ Some were substantive , some were linguistic , some were stylistic .
We looked at it all ; we were as forthcoming as we could possibly be in responding . ”
Some Iraqi Shiite politicians said a significant factor in the cabinet decision was the approval of the pact by Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq , who from the outset had laid down three conditions : full Iraqi sovereignty , transparency and majority support for the pact .
" Portugal posed a serious threat to Spain , not only because of the way the situation there was developing , but because of the foreign support it might ultimately receive , which could be hostile to Spain , " wrote diplomat Robert Ingersoll to the then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , in a report on the March 1975 meeting .
In the next weird thing found on -- or below -- the Red Planet , a ground - penetrating radar on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found vast glaciers under the rocky surface .
These glaciers are at the bases of mountains and cliffs , and are covered with rubble that may be protecting them from sublimating away .
The even cooler thing is that these are at lower latitudes ( nearer the Equator ) than ever seen before .
" Altogether , these glaciers almost certainly represent the largest reservoir of water ice on Mars that is not in the polar caps , " said John W. Holt of the University of Texas at Austin , who is lead author of the report .
" Just one of the features we examined is three times larger than the city of Los Angeles and up to one - half - mile thick .
And there are many more .
In addition to their scientific value , they could be a source of water to support future exploration of Mars . "
I still advocate going to the Moon for a while before heading off to Mars , but Mars does have one big advantage : that water locked up in the glaciers is not that hard to tap into .
It can be used for drinking , farming , breathing , and even as protection from solar radiation ( the hydrogen in water makes a pretty good radiation shield ) .
These underground glaciers also answer a question that 's puzzled scientists for years : the existence of aprons , or gently sloped regions surrounding tall features on Mars .
Now it seems clear that the ice at the base of these cliffs and mountains lubricated rubble descending from higher up , so instead of getting big piles , the rubble forms a smoother decline .
The radar reflections from aprons indicates they are indeed a thin layer of rubble on top of thicker ice .
We 've known for decades that Mars has water ice .
What we 're learning now is the extent of it , how deep it goes , how it 's placed across the surface , and even how wet Mars was in the past .
All of this builds us a picture of a once - dynamic planet , and one that still has lots of surprises waiting for us , literally just below the surface .
This older image shows a glacier that flowed from one Martian crater at the base of a mountain to another crater .

Updated 11/6/2008 .
An exiting army of Republican foot soldiers is faced with the prospect of selling its Washington - area homes in the worst housing bust since the Great Depression .
Many Republican - appointed officials in Washington are nested in northern Virginia , which has traditionally attracted more Republicans than suburban Maryland .
And for those who arrived near the height of the housing bubble , particularly those who came after George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004 , what a time to buy in northern Virginia it was .
Like Miami and Las Vegas , northern Virginia was frantically built up during the housing bubble .
Prices of single - family homes and condos skyrocketed .
When I first lived in the area a couple of years ago , I remember hearing the curious term “ Fairfaxed . ”
It referred to Fairfax County , Va. , an overbuilt Washington suburb .
Despite Fairfax ’s perpetual gridlock , builders continued to plant residential high - rises around the county and beyond in anticipation that housing prices would climb ever higher .
Residents in nearby Loudoun County lamented that their greatest fears were being realized :
They were , after at least a decade of warnings , finally being “ Fairfaxed . ”
Fast - forward to today .
Also like Miami and Las Vegas , northern Virginia ’s housing market has cratered .
The average housing price in the greater northern Virginia area in September declined 32.11 percent from the previous year , according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors .
And this is the market that many Republican officials , turning over the executive branch to an Obama administration , will have to sell in .
I thank my colleague Gardiner Harris for the pointer .
Update 11/6/08 :
I ’ve revised this post to address some of the reader concerns expressed in the comments .
I did not mean to indicate that I was partaking in schadenfreude ; this post was instead meant to be an observation that , because of Washington ’s scheduling quirks in residential turnover , a certain subgroup of this area likely bought high and now has to sell low .
Over all , as I mentioned in a previous post , the entire metropolitan area , including Northern Virginia , does vote Democratic ; but within that metropolitan area , the greater Northern Virginia area attracts a larger share of the region ’s Republicans .
Barack Obama beat John McCain by an 17.8 percentage - point margin in Virginia ’s Fairfax County , for example , and by a 43.7 - point margin in Maryland ’s Montgomery County ( and an 86.4 - point margin in Washington , D.C. proper ) .
As David Brooks wrote in The Atlantic a few years ago :
In the Washington , D.C. , area Democratic lawyers tend to live in suburban Maryland , and Republican lawyers tend to live in suburban Virginia .
If you asked a Democratic lawyer to move from her $ 750,000 house in Bethesda , Maryland , to a $ 750,000 house in Great Falls , Virginia , she ’d look at you as if you had just asked her to buy a pickup truck with a gun rack and to shove chewing tobacco in her kid ’s mouth .
And as I mentioned above , Northern Virginia experienced an especially intense building craze in recent years , and is busting now .
This means that the unlucky people trying to move out of the area – which will probably include a number of people who were here specifically because of relationships with the Republican administration – are stuck with a bad time to sell , especially relative to the time they bought .
The latter half of the last century taught us to forget we 're men , and the last couple of decades to be downright ashamed of it .
Watch a TV show , a political discussion or open up a newspaper .
Men at best just do n't exist .
At worst they 're monsters that children and women should steer away from .
Indeed , men themselves are being manipulated every day by the media to look down and frown upon other men .
And it 's been working .
Men themselves have bought into these hate - fuelled lies of feminism .
But things are now changing .
There is now also a growing number of men questioning these lies .
The pioneering work of Rich Zubaty , What Men Know That Women Don't , debunks the baselessness of and hysteria behind feminist ideology .
It examines the vast differences between men and women through their physiological , psychological and social dimensions -- and does it in a refreshingly humorous way .
Above all , it provides a close look at who benefits from feminism .
( Women is it ?
Think again . )
This is the THE book for men of all age groups and all backgrounds .
Toyota confirms photos making the rounds of the interwebz are are indeed shots of the 2010 Prius that no one was supposed to see until the Detroit auto show in January .
As we told you a few months ago , the next - gen Prius offers more of the same .
And indeed , the leaked pix first shown over at Priuschat.com reveal a car that looks pretty much like the Prius you ’ll find in showrooms today , but with slightly rounder edges , cat - eye headlamps , integrated fog lights and the bulbous badge Toyota ’s designers love so much .
Toyota is n’t saying much beyond " yep , that ’s the next Prius . "
" What we can tell you , however , is this :
This new Prius will retain all of the virtues of the model that precedes it , " the company writes on Open Road blog .
" It ’s about the same size as its forebear , but with more interior room and better fuel economy .
But you expected nothing less , right ? "
The interior does n’t look any roomier in the one leaked photo , but at least it ’s lost some of the space - age styling .
And while Honda cribbed from Toyota in designing the next - gen Insight , it looks like the shifter in the Prius was inspired by that weird rally shifter in the Civic Si hatchback .
Still no word on what ’s under the new skin , but the rumor is Toyota plans to give the Prius a little more oomph .
Car & Driver says it will get a 1.6 - liter gasoline engine , a slight bump from the 1.5 currently under the hood .
Motor
Trend says there will be a 1.8 - liter engine producing 100
horsepower .
Added with the output of the electric motor , total power rises from 110 hp to 150 between now and 2010 , according to MT , but the 2010 will retain the same fuel economy as the current model .
In either case , the car will most likely still use Toyota ’s tried - and - true nickel metal hydride batteries .

For the first time , a federal judge has ordered the Bush administration to release prisoners held at the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , ruling Tuesday that 17 Chinese Muslims must be brought to his courtroom by the end of the week so that they can be set free .
U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina said that the government ’s authority to hold the men had “ ceased ” and that they were entitled to be released .
He said he would hold a hearing to decide on the conditions for releasing the men .
Several religious and social groups , including 20 church leaders from Tallahassee , Fla. , said they would help the men resettle in their community .
The 17 are Uighurs who fled persecution in the far western reaches of China .
U.S. authorities , fearing what Chinese officials would do , have refused to send them back to China , and no other country has been willing to take them .

The judge ’s order came more than six years after the men were sent to Guantanamo and more than four years after the Pentagon cleared most of them to be released .
The Supreme Court ruled four months ago that judges can order the release of prisoners wrongly held at Guantanamo .
Soon thereafter , a federal appeals court reviewed the case of one of the Uighurs , Huzaifa Parhat , and ruled that the government had no basis for believing he was an “ enemy combatant . ”
That decision set the stage for Urbina ’s ruling Tuesday .
Civil liberties advocates hailed the order .
“ This is a historic day for the United States , ” said Emi MacLean , a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights .
“ Finally , we are beginning the process of taking responsibility for our mistakes and fixing them . ”

But Bush administration lawyers have insisted that judges have no authority to interfere with the handling of foreign military prisoners .
On Tuesday , they also argued that immigration laws prohibit the release into the United States of individuals alleged to have terrorist ties and asked for an emergency order to block the release .
Administration officials “ are deeply concerned by and strongly disagreed with ” the decision to release the men , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement .
Human rights lawyers have described the 17 Uighurs as among the most egregious examples of wrongful imprisonment at Guantanamo .
Natives of an area they call East Turkistan , the Uighurs fled from oppression by the Chinese government , including its policy of forced abortions , and settled in Afghanistan in 2001 .
But after U.S. bombing raids hit their camps , they fled to Pakistan , where they were taken into custody by locals , who turned them over to U.S. troops offering $ 5,000 bounties for suspected foreign fighters .
The U.S. military alleged that the Uighurs had received military training , and they were suspected of ties to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement , which the State Department had designated a terrorist group .

But the Uighurs strongly denied any ties to the Taliban , Al Qaeda or other enemies of the United States ; their only enemy , they said , was the government of China .
They said they had initially welcomed being in U.S. custody , hoping they would be safe and treated humanely .
Instead , 22 Uighurs were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 .
Five were released and sent to Albania two years ago , but the rest remained in custody because no country was willing to accept them .
Lawyers spent years in court arguing for their release .
“ The U.S. government has long recognized these men did not pose , and really never posed , a threat to the United States , ” said Jennifer Daskal , a lawyer for Human Rights Watch .
Tuesday ’s ruling was significant , she said , because a judge “ rejected the Bush administration ’s theory that its own determination can trump judicial review and constitutional rights . ”
Neil McGaraghan , a Boston lawyer who worked on the Uighurs ’ case , said the men would be released from military custody Friday , barring a last - minute order from the appellate court .

Since 2002 , the Pentagon has approved the release of more than 500 prisoners from Guantanamo , including the five Uighurs sent to Albania .
More than 250 are still being held , including about 60 who would be freed if the U.S. government could find countries willing to take them .

A former substitute teacher in Connecticut has reached a deal that calls for her to lose her teaching licence after exposing students to online pornography .
Forty - one - year - old Julie Amero pleaded guilty on Friday in Norwich Superior Court in Connecticut to misdemeanor disorderly conduct .
She will also pay a $ US100 fine .
Pornography appeared on her classroom computer in 2004 in view of seventh - graders .
Several computer experts believe the machine was infected with programs that caused the images to pop up beyond her control .

This is incredibly annoying for some of us , especially for me which is why I ’m ranting here .
The moment Google released their ( awful ) German translation for their RSS reader , I was served the German version just because I have a Swiss IP address .
Here in Switzerland , we actually speak one of three ( or four , depending on who you ask ) languages , so defaulting to German is probably not of much help for the people in the french speaking part .
Additionally , there are many users fluent in ( at least reading ) English .
We always prefer the original language if at all possible because generally , translations never quite work .
Even if you have the best translators at work , translated texts never feel fluid .
Especially not when you are used to the original version .
So , Google , what were you thinking to switch me over to the German version of the reader ?
I have been using the English version for more than a year , so clearly , I understood enough of that language to be able to use it .
More than 90 % of the RSS feeds I ’m subscribed to are , in fact , in English .
Can you imagine how pissed I was to see the interface changed ?
This is even worse on the iPhone / iPod frontend , because , there , you do n’t even provide an option to change the language aside of manually hacking the URL .
Or take desktop applications .
I live in the German speaking parts of Switzerland .
True .
So naturally I have set my locale settings to Swiss German .
You know : I want to have the correct number formatting , I want my weeks to start on Mondays .
I want the correct currency .
I want my 24 hours clock I ’m used to .
Actually , I also want the German week and month names , because I will be using these in most of my letters and documents , which are , in fact , German too .
But my OS installation is English .
I am used to English .
I prefer English .
Why do so many programs insist to use the locale setting to determine the display language ?
Do you developers think it ’s funny to have a mish - mash of languages on the screen ?
Do n’t you think that me using an English OS version may be an indication that I do not want to read your crappy German translation alongside the English user interface of my OS ?
Do n’t you think that it feels really stupid to have a button in a German dialog box open another , English , dialog ( the first one is from Chrome , the one that opens once you click “ Zertifikate verwalten ” ( Manage certificates ) is from Windows itself ) ?
In Chrome , I can at least fix the language – once I found the knob to turn .
At first , it was easier for me to just delete the German localization file from the chrome installation because , due to being completely unused to German UIs , I was unable to find the right setting .
This is really annoying and I see this particular problem being neglected on an incredibly large scale .
I know that I am a minority , but the problem is so terribly easy to fix :
All current browsers send an Accept - Language header .
In contrast to the earlier times , nowadays , it is actually correctly preset in all the common browsers .
Use that .
Do n’t use my IP - address .
Instead of reading the locale setting in my OS , ask the OS for its UI language and use that to determine which localization to load ( actually , this is the recommended way of doing things according to Microsoft ’s guidelines at least since Windows XP which was 2001 ) .
Using these two simple tricks , you help a minority without hindering the majority in any way and without additional development overhead !
Actually , you ’ll be getting away a lot cheaper than before .
GeoIP is expensive if you want it to be accurate ( and you do want that .
Do n’t you ? ) , whereas there are ready - to - use libraries to determine the correct language even from the most complex Accept - Language - Header .
Asking the OS for the UI language is n’t harder than asking it for the locale , so no overhead there either .
Please , developers , please have mercy !
Stop the annoyance !
Stop it now !
Celebrities are notorious for saying some of the most outrageously asinine things that can be imagined .
Tom Cruise , the master of glibness , has a streak of about 20 years of this , as does Jon Voight .
These are n’t sane men , at least not if their silly comments are a peek into their actual worldview , and not just moments of confusion in front of the cameras .
It does n’t matter what their political views are , bat - shit insane extends throughout the whole spectrum .
We expect this from them , and the other people famous for memorizing lines of dialogue , but Sarah Palin ?
She has a special place in the bat - shit insane category –a place reserved for those that should know better , but are just far too dumb to understand .
Politicians seeking the highest offices of the nation are supposed to be intelligent .
They need to have the wherewithal to analyze and solve problems of such magnitude that history is affected by their decisions .
A sound base of understanding and capability to piece together the various doctrines set forth by the forefathers and the preceding great administrators of our democracy is absolutely mandatory to make such decisions .
One of the most basic of these doctrines is the Bill of Rights .
We should be able to expect that someone put forth as a major party candidate has a firm understanding of the Bill of Rights .
It ’s only twenty seven amendments that need to be understood , and one of those was repealed , simplifying the task .
With sixteen years in politics , no matter the level she was serving at , one could reasonably expect Sarah Palin to have a firm grasp of these simple concepts .
However , she has fallen far short of reasonable expectation , and her latest insight into the Bill of Rights leaves us no doubt as to the level of idiocy she has attained .
For those that have refused to read , or even take a quick gander at the Bill of Rights , here ’s the First Amendment :
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
There ’s six main points within the this amendment , so let ’s just take “ Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech … ”
Sarah Palin , in all of her glory , stated today :
If [ the media ] convince enough voters that that is negative campaigning , for me to call Barack Obama out on his associations , then I do n’t know what the future of our country would be in terms of First Amendment rights and our ability to ask questions without fear of attacks by the mainstream media .
How monumentally idiotic is this statement ?
Not all of the marble quarries , in all of the countries on earth , could possibly provide the material to celebrate this idiocy with a monument fittingly large enough .
It ’s that convoluted , that moronic , and that far off from what the First Amendment deals with .
We expect more from a major party nominee for Vice President .
Let ’s just deal with her First Amendment right to free speech , for the time being .
She has the right to say a lot of things –there is no denying this –and she ’s speaking very , very freely .
Some could argue that she ’s even riding a fine line between free speech , and speech that is slanderous ( per se ) .
I wo n’t go into that here , as slander is tort law , and we ’re just dealing with the First Amendment in a more pure state .
She has n’t been stopped , by any party , from speaking .
Many , if not most , of her speeches are televised , broadcast around the country , and the world , for billions to hear .
There has been no speech filter placed between herself and the masses huddled in front of the evening news , and no attempt to stop her from spouting off what she wants to on the stages constructed for that purpose .
Her freedom of speech has not only not been denied , it has been amplified far beyond the common person ’s ability .
Her assertion that the the press is threatening her ability to exercise her freedom of speech is ludicrous .
She cites the “ fear of attack ” by the ‘ mainstream media ’ as that threat to her freedoms .
Nowhere in the First Amendment does it state , nor in any precedent , that the press cannot examine and analyze the speech made by an individual to the point of making that person fearful to speak freely .
On the contrary , the press is guaranteed to do such things , right there after the individual ’s right to the freedom of speech .
The press needs to be free to criticize Sarah Palin ’s various opinions and statements put forth in order for our democracy to function well .
It ’s not a matter of getting her to stop speaking , or to dissuade her from do so , but to inform the general public of the veracity ( or lack thereof ) and implications of the various statements she makes .
The freedom of the press , especially in disseminating information and opinion contrary to that which is put forth by our politicians , is not only in the best interests of the public , it is mandatory for the continuation of informed voting .
This cockamamie argument that the press labeling some of her speech as ‘ negative campaigning ’ is abridging her freedom of speech is not only wrongheaded , but a dangerous mischaracterization of the First Amendment .
Her speech has not been infringed upon in the slightest , and to posit that criticism of her statements by the press is harmful to her First Amendment rights is laughable .
That same press , that ‘ mainstream media ’ that she is attacking is the same press that gives her hour upon hour of coverage … in her own words .
She could have even more camera time , if she so chose , but her ineptness as answering even the simplest of questions has made the McCain campaign limit the outlets of her free , and mind - numbingly foolish , speech .
Sarah Palin , spare us your horrifically idiotic interpretations of the First Amendment .
Your ignorance knows no bounds .
Your freedoms have not been threatened , but if you get elected all of our freedoms will be threatened by your idiocy .
When late - night bulletins report that the state security police have raided the home of a senior spokesman for the opposition and placed him under arrest , you find yourself looking out of the window for reassurance that we are not living in Harare , Minsk or Rangoon .
The detention of Damian Green , for the terrible crime of doing his job as a parliamentarian , is worse than an outrage .
It is insanely stupid .
Dissident civil servants have been leaking government documents to members of the opposition since the Xerox corporation manufactured the first photocopier in 1949 .
Actually , it goes further back still .
It was thanks to a flow of official secrets from the War Office that Winston Churchill made his reputation in the 1930s as the man who saw Adolf Hitler coming when most of the rest of Britain 's leading politicians were appeasing the Third Reich .
Neville Chamberlain was so furious that his government attempted to bug Churchill 's phone conversations .
What they did n't do was send in the goon squad to have him arrested .
For a more contemporary example , there is the leading Labour politician - one Gordon Brown - who made his name in the 1990s by skilfully exploiting the many Whitehall documents that fell into his hands during the Thatcher and Major governments .
The young Brown would stand in the Commons waving leaked Treasury papers in the reddened faces of Tory Ministers .
Under Prime Minister Brown , he would have had the anti-terror unit coming through his door .
Politicians of every stripe will always want to cover up their bungles , idiocies and fibs .
They will have accomplices in these cover-ups in their senior bureaucrats .
Freedom of information legislation is not muscular enough to uncover all the dirty little secrets and the filthy big whoppers that skulk in the dark corners of Whitehall .
Being able to use leaked information is one of the few ways in which Parliament can hold a mighty executive to account .
Fear of exposure by leak is a deterrent which makes ministers and civil servants think twice before behaving badly .
Our famously unwritten constitution does not draw precise lines between the virtuous leak and the unvirtuous one , but most of us can distinguish one from the other when we see them .
Reasonable people will agree that there are some secrets that must stay secret .
No British newspaper or opposition party would publish the identities of MI6 agents who have penetrated al - Qaeda .
In cases which do not touch on national security , our democracy has previously relied on an understanding across the parties that the police are not sent in with both heavy feet in the case of leaks which merely discomfit the government .
The arrest of Mr Green shreds that consensus .
There is absolutely no suggestion that he has done anything to endanger the safety of the nation .
He revealed that thousands of illegal immigrants had been given security clearance to work within Whitehall and one had also been employed in Parliament .
That exposed law - breaking by officialdom and a reluctance by ministers to admit to it in public .
This was helping national security by exposing a potential weakness created by the sloppiness of government .
This was whistle - blowing which was powerfully in the public interest .
Another leak was of a letter from Jacqui Smith to Gordon Brown warning that the recession would lead to an increase in crime .
All that really revealed is that there are too many people at the Home Office employed on research into the bleedin ' obvious .
Then there was the leak that disclosed that the Home Office was keeping a list of potential Labour rebel MPs .
I expect that led to more raised voices in the ministerial suite , but again it did not touch on national security .
Mr Green was not detained under the Official Secrets Act .
The authorities resorted to a catch - all law about ' procuring misconduct in public office ' , a piece of blunderbuss legislation which dates back to the 18th century .
On this basis , not only would Winston Churchill have been banged up in the Thirties and Gordon Brown thrown in the slammer in the Nineties , many more of our leading politicians and their spin doctors would be doing time .
Politicians are always leaking .
In government , they simply change the verb to briefing or spinning .
If leaking is now to be treated as a severe criminal offence to be policed by the anti-terror squad , some of Labour 's most celebrated spin doctors could be facing consecutive life sentences .
The context of this affair is a heightened level of aggravation across government about Whitehall 's inability to keep its secrets .
Labour , once the masters of manipulating information , absolutely hate being beaten at the game they taught the world .
They are very frustrated that Alistair Darling 's crisis Budget failed to generate the positive headlines that Gordon Brown had hoped for .
' Yes , it 's been pretty poor , ' one of the Prime Minister 's senior aides remarked to me about the hostile media coverage .
Number 10 wanted the headlines to be about the tax cuts scheduled for Christmas , not the tax rises to come later and the eye - watering scale of the deficit .
The crisis Budget got that poor reception because the goodies in it had already been leaked to the media .
You read about the temporary VAT cut in last Sunday 's Observer , 24 hours before the Chancellor stood up .
I have no idea whether Downing Street is correct to suspect that the Tories have a mole in the Treasury ; I do know they are utterly convinced that they are being undermined by an enemy within .
When fury combines with paranoia , the result is never sound judgment .
This affair has put several reputations on the line .
A shiver will be troubling the spines of some big names in policing , the Civil Service , Parliament and government .
The Met were called in by Sir David Normington , the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office who is known around Whitehall as ' the smiling assassin ' .
When Scotland Yard informed him that they intended to arrest a senior Conservative MP , did Sir David not ask himself whether it was really wise to let the Old Bill go crashing around in the delicate fabric of the relationship between government and Parliament ?
Another man who has just made a career - changing decision is Sir Paul Stephenson , the acting commissioner of the Metropolitan Police .
It was Sir Paul who rang Boris Johnson to tell him the police were coming for Mr Green and did n't heed the mayor 's protests that this might not be a terribly clever idea .
Sir Paul had been regarded as the favourite to succeed the little - lamented Sir Ian Blair .
I spoke on Friday to a senior and shrewd Lib Dem MP who had previously regarded Sir Paul as the right man to take over the Met .
This affair has completely changed his view .
He does not see how Sir Paul can become the next commissioner now he is such a highly politicised figure .
' He has burnt all his bridges with the Conservatives . '
I 'd also be very nervous in the buckled shoes of the Speaker and the Serjeant at Arms .
They would be well - advised to fit a bulletproof lining to their ceremonial outfits before MPs return to the Commons .
There is a statue of Oliver Cromwell near the gates to remind MPs that it took a civil war to establish Parliament 's protection from autocrats sending heavies into the Commons to arrest its members .
Outraged MPs are demanding an explanation from the Speaker about why he and the Serjeant at Arms proved to be such feeble guardians of Parliament 's rights .
The politician who may have least to worry about is Damian Green .
His wife appeals to our sympathy when she quavers that her ' blood ran cold ' when the police raided their home .
The Tories exaggerate for effect when they describe it as ' Stalinesque ' .
I am sure it has not been a happy experience for the MP for Ashford and his family , but he has not been carted off to a gulag .
He has been presented with a gift - wrapped opportunity to cast himself as a victim of state bullying and a hero of liberty .
I bet David Davis is inflamed with jealousy that he was n't arrested as well .
He would have insisted on the police leading him away in irons .
The political losers are the government .
Number 10 says that Gordon Brown only knew about the arrest hours after it had happened .
Jacqui Smith insists that she played no part in sanctioning it .
Pleading ignorance gets them off one hook only to impale them on another .
The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary are the bosses of the senior civil servant who triggered this episode and the clumping police commanders who executed it .
Do Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith really think it is a sensible idea for the police to go around arresting members of the opposition who have caused a bit of mild embarrassment to the government ?
They need to tell us .
The Prime Minister and Home Secretary cannot cast themselves as pathetically powerless bystanders when a privy councillor is taken into custody .
This is not Zimbabwe , Belarus or Burma .
One reason I know that is because I have just heard Tony Benn on the radio saying that we are living in ' a police state ' .
He would not be free to say that if we actually were .
Britain is not a police state , but some people , notably in the Met and Whitehall , are beginning to behave as if it were .
Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith need to get them under control .
They will do that immediately if they have any care for their own reputations and that of their country .

Are you in an up and coming band ?
We might be just the girls for you .
Now , I know what you 're thinking : " What ? " you 're thinking , " Why in the hell would I want some floosie Georgetown Yoko 's to waltz into my studio , screw half my band , and laugh hautily while they watch us break up ? "
Well , to that I say " ha ha , " and I say it laughingly .
Now I 'm not saying that everyone wants they 're band to break up , I 'm just saying that we 're well versed in the intricacies of breaking up bands .
I 'm serious .
We 're really good at this .
Well , I am anyway , but my roomates are ready and eager to learn how to assimilate their incomparable powers of destruction to band members .
I do n't know , dude .
Maybe you 're a spunky , talented lead guitarist who can't stand up to your lead singer .
Maybe you 're a drummer with a better offer .
Look , I 'm not a fortune teller , but I do have a haunted vagina , notches on my bedpost that total over 100 , and I can help you break up your band if you do n't have the balls to do it yourself .
Amanda has had her share of bicycle club shenanigans , and Crystal , although she does n't have specific band - breaking - up experience , has general destruction capabilities that have here to fore been unrivaled in this , the west side of the Missisippi .
Together , you best believe that we can Yoko the crap out of any non assuming band in less than a fortnight .
That 's 14 days , guys .
And hey .
Maybe you just want to do it .
That 's cool too , but we are by no means guaranteeing that your band will stay together after having known us .
Just ask the neighbors .
Come on guys , let 's bochinche ( read : party naked with music ) .
Love , Miranda , Amanda and Crystal

Via The New Yorker :
( New York ) -- Legendary investor Warren Buffett warned Congressional leaders Saturday night of " the biggest financial meltdown in American history " if they did not act to secure the financial system .
Buffett , by telephone , was consulted by lawmakers who were in marathon talks on Capitol Hill to forge a deal on the administration 's $ 700 billion economic bailout plan , according to two sources .
One lawmaker in the negotiations said that the participants called Warren Buffett to get his help in gauging potential market reaction .
Congressional leaders said shortly after midnight Saturday that they had reached a tentative deal .
Members of both parties and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson were aiming to craft final legislation by Sunday evening -- in time for the start of financial markets around the world .
Assuring markets , especially credit markets that lend to businesses and consumers as well as between banks , is seen as a vital part of getting a deal done quickly .
The marathon negotiations on Saturday culminated several chaotic - and at times politically divisive - days on Capitol Hill as lawmakers and administration officials tried to quickly find common ground on a complicated proposal .
Earlier in the week , Buffett also warned that the financial crisis is " everybody 's problem , " not just Wall Street's .
The potential collapse of financial institutions would cause industry to grind to a halt , he told CNBC Wednesday , and could have " gummed up the economy . "
On Tuesday Buffett 's company Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) invested $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
The cash gives one of the last - remaining Wall Street investment banks a much - need boost as credit has tightened .
Buffett 's move also helped shore up confidence in financial stocks .
Buffett , whom Forbes magazine has placed at No. 2 on its 2008 list of richest Americans , is worth an estimated $ 50 billion .
In 2006 , he pledged to donate most of his fortune to charity .
Calls to Berkshire Hathaway seeking comment from Buffett were not immediately returned .
America 's Money Crisis
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - American Express
Co said on Thursday it will cut 7,000 jobs , slash expenses and scale back investments to save $ 1.8 billion next year , in its biggest restructuring since 2001 as it struggles with bad loans and surging funding costs .

The expected cost savings lifted the company ’s shares 2.3 percent on Thursday morning .
The credit card company was among the first to warn at the beginning of the year that customer spending was slowing and delinquencies were rising and analysts said the coming months will not be any easier .
U.S. consumer spending shrank at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the third quarter , the first decline since the last quarter of 1991 , a government report said on Thursday .
American Express ’ cutbacks “ will help us to manage through one of the most challenging economic environments we ’ve seen in many decades , ” said Kenneth Chenault , chairman and chief executive , in a statement .
The fourth - largest U.S. credit card lender said the layoffs , which amount to 10 percent of its workforce , will result in a pre-tax charge of $ 370 million to $ 440 million in the fourth quarter .
These restructuring charges would be American Express ’ biggest since 2001 , when the September 11 attacks cut into travel spending and forced the company to take $ 631 million in re-engineering charges over two quarters .
The charge , which is $ 240 million to $ 290 million after taxes , is primarily linked to severance and other charges from cutting staff .
“ It ’s certainly a step in the right direction , ” said James Ellman , portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital .
“ The company realizes that it ’s going to be impacted by a consumer - led recession . ”
Cutting jobs , suspending management - level salary increases for 2009 and freezing hiring for open positions are expected to generate $ 700 million of cost savings .
The staffing reductions will take place across business units and markets and will primarily focus on management and other positions that do not work directly with customers .
American Express also expects to save $ 125 million in expenses for consulting , travel and entertainment and another $ 1 billion scaling back investment spending on technology , marketing and business development .
On October 20 , the credit card network and lender posted lower earnings for the third quarter as it set aside more money to cover growing losses in its credit card business .
GLOOMY 2009
In recent years , American Express expanded faster than rivals such as Discover Financial Services , Capital One Financial Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc by signing up more middle - class clients .
Now , American Express is paying the price of its expansion .
The default rate among its credit card clients in the United States almost doubled in the third quarter of 2008 from a year earlier .
And as the economy erodes , with unemployment rates at the highest in five years and home foreclosures at record highs , loan losses are expected to keep increasing .
In addition , the company is more dependent on short - term capital markets to fulfill its funding needs than some of its bigger rivals that can borrow through customer deposits .
American Express ’ financing costs have be hurt by a global credit squeeze .
“ The fundamentals have n’t changed , there ’s still a lot of problems economically and credit quality wise that they are going to have to deal with , so it ’s a good start , ” said John Williams , an analyst at Macquarie Research .
“ The concern is that credit quality would just continue to get worse and worse and not really showing any improvement , ” he added .
The stock jumped 65 cents to $ 25.84 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The shares have fallen around 50 percent this year , while the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index retreated 35 percent .
Obama seems a bit grave to me these days .
The death of his grandmother has edged his public mood with sadness , but this heaviness preceded it .
Compare the closing - days portraits of the two candidates in the Times : I ’d rather spend the final stretch in the company of the Republican .
McCain is ironic , gregarious , plucky ; Obama is fully hidden away within himself .
He is , we already knew , an aloof , perhaps unknowable man — you feel it even after hearing his life story told in his own remarkable voice over the several hundred pages of “ Dreams from My Father . ”
But his manner before crowds and his face in photographs seem even farther out of reach than usual .
The reason came to me when I was reading the galleys of H. W. Brands ’s new biography of F.D.R. , “ Traitor to His Class . ”
On the night of his landslide victory over Hoover , in 1932 , in the depths of the Great Depression , Roosevelt had an intimate conversation with his son James :
“ You know , Jimmy , ” Franklin said , “ all my life I have been afraid of only one thing — fire .
Tonight I think I ’m afraid of something else . ”
“ Afraid of what , Pa ? ”
“ I ’m just afraid that I may not have the strength to do this job . ”
He paused reflectively .
“ After you leave me tonight , Jimmy , I am going to pray .
I am going to pray that God will help me , that he will give me the strength and the guidance to do this job and to do it right .
I hope that you will pray for me , too , Jimmy . ”

Sorting all this out will take time , but not forever .
“ With so many experiments , we will soon know so much more about all of this , ” Dr. Weiner said .
“ In a year or two , we ’ll either not be talking about this idea at all , or it will be all we ’re talking about . ”
- Dennis Overbye ( A Whisper , Perhaps , From the Universe ’s Dark Side , NY Times , 11.25.08 .
Image : - Loomis Dean , " Shadows Of The Junior Astronomy Club Peering Through A Telescope , Greeley , CO , Life Magazine , 1955 ) .
A concatenation of puzzling results from an alphabet soup of satellites and experiments has led a growing number of astronomers and physicists to suspect that they are getting signals from a shadow universe of dark matter that makes up a quarter of creation but has eluded direct detection until now .
Maybe ... said Gordon Kane , a theorist at the University of Michigan .
Physicists caution that there could still be a relatively simple astronomical explanation for the recent observations .
But the nature of this dark matter is one of the burning issues of science .
Identifying it would point the way to a deeper understanding of the laws of nature and the Einsteinian dream of a unified theory of physics .
The last few weeks have seen a blizzard of papers trying to explain the observations in terms of things likeorortheory , and to suggest how to look for them in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider , set to begin operation again outside Geneva next summer .
said Nima Arkani-Hamed of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , who has been churning out papers with his colleagues .
On Thursday , a team of astrophysicists working on one of the experiments reported in the journal Nature that a cosmic ray detector onboard a balloon flying around the South Pole had recorded an excess number of high - energy electrons and their antimatter opposites , positrons , sailing through local space .
The particles , they conceded , could have been created by a previously undiscovered pulsar , the magnetized spinning remnant of a supernova explosion , blasting nearby space with electric and magnetic fields .
But , they say , a better and more enticing explanation for the excess is that the particles are being spit out of the fireballs created by dark matter particles colliding and annihilating one another in space .
said John P. Wefel of Louisiana State University , the leader of the team , adding , The results came on the heels of a report earlier this fall from Pamela , a satellite built by Italian , German , Russian and Swedish scientists to study cosmic rays .
Pamela scientists reported in talks and a paper posted on the Internet that the satellite had recorded an excess of high - energy positrons .
This , they said , Antimatter is rare in the universe , and so looking for it is a good way of hunting for exotic phenomena like dark matter .
Another indication that something funny is happening on the dark side of the universe is evident in maps of the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang .
Those maps , produced most recently this year by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite , show a haze of what seem to be charged particles hovering around the Milky Way galaxy , according to an analysis by Douglas Finkbeiner of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
Adding to the mix and mystery , the European Space Agency ’s Integral satellite detected gamma rays emanating from the center of the Milky Way , suggesting the presence of positrons there , but with much lower energies than Pamela and Dr. Wefel ’s experiments have seen .
What all this adds up to , or indeed whether it all adds up to anything at all , depends on which observations you trust and your theoretical presumptions about particle physics and the nature of dark matter .
Moreover , efforts to calculate the background level of high - energy particles in the galaxy are beset with messy uncertainties .
Dr. Kane said .
Dark matter has teased and obsessed astronomers since the 1930s , when the Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky deduced that some invisiblewas required to supply the gravitational glue to hold clusters of galaxies together .
The idea became respectable in the 1970s when Vera C. Rubin of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and her collaborators found from studying the motions of stars that most galaxies seemed to be surrounded by halos of dark matter .
The stakes for dark matter go beyond cosmology .
The most favored candidates for its identity come from a theory called , which unifies three of the four known forces of nature mathematically and posits the existence of a realm of as - yet - undiscovered particles .
They would be so - called wimps — weakly interacting massive particles — which feel gravity and little else , and could drift through the Earth like wind through a screen door .
Such particles left over from the Big Bang could form a shadow universe clumping together into dark clouds that then attract ordinary matter .
The discovery of a supersymmetric particle would also be a boost for string theory , the controversialand would explicate the nature of a quarter of the universe .
But until now , the dark matter particles have mostly eluded direct detection in the laboratory , the exception being a controversial underground experiment called Dama / Libra , for Dark Matter / Large Sodium Iodide Bulk for Rare Processes , under the Italian Alps , where scientists claimed in April to have seen a seasonal effect of aas the Earth goes around its orbit .
The sky could be a different story .
Dark matter particles floating in the halos around galaxies would occasionally collide and annihilate one another in tiny fireballs of radiation and lighter particles .
Dr. Wefel and his colleagues have been chasing sparks in the sky since 2000 , when they flew an instrument known as ATIC , for Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter , around Antarctica on a balloon at an altitude of 23 miles , looking for high - energy particles known as cosmic rays raining from space .
The Nature paper includes data from the first two balloon flights .
It shows a bump , over theoretical calculations of cosmic ray intensities , at energies of 500 billion to 800 billion electron volts , a measure of both energy and mass in physics .
One way to explain that energy bump would be by the disintegration or annihilation of a very massive dark particle .
A proton by comparison is about one billion electron volts .
Dr. Wefel noted , however , that according to most models , a pulsar could generate particles with even more energy , up to trillions of volts , whereas the bump in the ATIC data seems to fall off at around 800 billion electron volts .
The ATIC results , he said , dovetail nicely with those from Pamela , which recorded a rising number of positrons relative to electrons , but only up to energies of about 200 billion electron volts .
Reached in China , where he was attending a workshop , Neal Weiner of New York University , who is working with Dr. Arkani - Hamed on dark matter models , said he was plotting ATIC data gleaned from the Web and Pamela data on the same graph to see how they fit , which was apparently very well .
But Piergiorgio Picozza , a professor at the University of Rome and the Pamela spokesman , said in an e-mail message that it was too soon to say the experiments agreed .
That will depend on more data now being analyzed to learn whether Pamela continues to see more positrons as the energy rises .
Moreover , as Dr. Kane pointed out , Pamela carries a magnet that allows it to distinguish electrons from positrons — being oppositely charged , they bend in opposite directions going through the magnetic field .
But the ATIC instrument did not include a magnet and so cannot be sure that it was seeing any positrons at all : no antimatter , no exotic dark matter , at least at those high energies .
But if he is right , Dr. Wefel said that the ATIC dataYou could think of it as a hamster running around on a wheel in its cage .
We cannot see the hamster or the cage , but we can sort of feel the impact of the hamster running ; according to Einsteinian relativity , its momentum in the extra dimension would register as mass in our own space - time .
Such particles are called Kaluza - Klein particles , after Theodor Kaluza and Oscar Klein , theorists who suggested such an extra-dimensional framework in the 1920s to unify Einstein ’s general theory of relativity and electromagnetism .
Dr. Wefel ’s particle would have a mass of around 620 billion electron volts .he said in an interview .
The emergence of a sharp edge in the data , he said , “ But Dr. Arkani - Hamed said that Kaluza - Klein particles would not annihilate one another at a fast enough rate to explain the strength of the ATIC signal , nor other anomalies like the microwave haze .
He and his colleagues , including Dr. Weiner , Dr. Finkbeiner and Tracy Slatyer , also of Harvard , drawing on work by Matthew Strassler of Rutgers , have tried to connect all the dots with a new brand of dark matter , in which there are not only dark particles but also abetween them .
That theory was calledby Dr. Kane , who said he was glad it kept Dr. Arkani -Hamed and his colleagues busy and diverted them from competing with him .
Dr. Kane and his colleagues favor a 200 billion - electron - volt supersymmetric particle known as a wino as the dark matter culprit , in which case the Pamela bump would not extend to higher energies .
Dr. Wefel said he had not kept up with all the theorizing .
Dr. Picozza said that it was the job of theorists to come up with models and that they were proliferating .
Hero Royal Marine saved 130 soldiers by rugby tackling suicide bomber
A Royal Marine has been recommended for a gallantry medal after saving 130 soldiers from a suicide bomber in Afghanistan ( file pic )
A hero Royal Marine saved 130 soldiers from certain death when he rugby tackled a suicide attacker before he could detonate a huge motorcycle bomb .
The 40 - year - old Marine saw the Afghan insurgent reaching for a yellow detonator button on the bike and leapt into action to drag him away .
He foiled a cunningly planned attack in which the same motorcycle had been checked by the same troops just hours earlier when its panniers had been packed with potatoes instead of explosives .
The suicide bomb contained 70 kilograms of explosives and was so huge it would have destroyed everything within 180 metres and left a huge crater .
The 20 - year - old Taliban fighter had driven it into the middle of a group of 130 Marines and Afghan Army soldiers .
He tried to set off the first of the two bombs but it failed to go off and the Marine was
alerted by the distinctive pop of the detonator .
He spotted wires running from the bulging saddlebags to another yellow button on the petrol tank and he hauled the bomber off the bike as he reached to press it .
The Marine grappled the insurgent to the ground and comrades rushed in to detain him .
Explosives experts later made safe two huge bombs each weighing 35 kilos or five and a half stone , which were packed into each of the panniers on either side of the red 50 cc bike .
The Marine , from Devon , who has asked not to be identified , has now been recommended for a gallantry medal .
Senior officers believe he saved the lives of most of the 130 men in the area , near the Arghandab River , west of Kandahar , including all those in his own L Company of the Bickleigh based 42 Commando .
The marine said : ' I can't really tell you what was going through my head at the time .
" My immediate assumption was that he was a spotter for the Taliban who were planning an ambush .
' I just did n't want him to push the button again to detonate the other charge .
' I had my weapon on him and I shouted for him to stop in Pashtu .
He did initially and that 's why I did n't take the shot , you have to be sure .
' He then carried on walking away .
I heard a popping sound like the electric sound when you connect a car battery it was him trying to set off the first of two charges .
' I ran forward and grabbed him , pushing him over the motorbike bringing him to the ground .
' I searched him , looked at the motorbike and realised I had searched it 24 hours earlier when the saddlebags which contained the explosives were full of potatoes .
' I looked up and noticed the yellow button in the centre of the motorbike and realised what was going on .
I just went into automatic mode .
' I was angry that he tried to kill us and I was angry with myself for bringing young marines into the situation .
' We were very lucky , with that much explosive it would have caused a blast with a 180 - metre radius . '
Major Rich Cantrill , Company Commander of L Company , said the marine saved many lives .
Major Cantrill said : ' He acted with conspicuous gallantry in the situation and put himself at great peril to get the suicide bomber away from the motorbike .
' He ran over and more or less rugby tackled him to the ground .
I got on the radio and I heard mention of hand fighting .
' He had grabbed him away from the bike after seeing wires and switches .
He quickly realised the full implications of it all .
' He showed great restraint in dealing with him especially as he had tried to kill him and the other lads around him .
' It was conspicuous gallantry .
He saved multiple lives .
Everyone thinks he 's a hero .
' It was a bungled attempt at a suicide bombing but he still could have set off the other charge .
' Had it not been for this Marine 's actions there would have been a massive explosion . '
The motorcyclist entered the area on November 19 at around 12.30 pm and was looking for British , American or Afghan soldiers to target .
By the time he tried to detonate his bomb the bike had broken down and he was pushing it along the road .
At around the same time the Marines received a radio report giving intelligence of a suspected suicide bomber on a motorbike in the area .
During last week 's five - day operation , the marines of L Company also found bomb - making equipment , weapons and ammunition .
The marine and his Major were interviewed by Tristan Nicholls of the Plymouth Evening Herald who is embedded with L company .
What are Digg ’s policies about offensive comments ?
All users have to sign Digg ’s Terms of Service , which prohibit spam , defamatory comments and hate speech .
Users are permanently banned for hate speech .
We banned between 20 to 30 users who commented on Fast Company ’s article .
Sometimes if it ’s a grey area , they try to influence a person ’s behavior rather than banning them .
The problem is that people can easily set up alternate accounts .
Digg is a massive site .
How are offensive comments found and policed ?
Digg has over 30 million users every month .
It gets about 16,000 submissions on any given day , and about 32,000 comments .
We have a skeleton team of folks , one to two people on the site answering emails , deleting spam , that sort of stuff .
We basically rely on the wisdom of the crowds .
People can dig up and down comments .
People can report others – internally we call it the jerk report .
What happens when your community is largely skewed towards a particular demographic ?
Does the wisdom of the crowds still hold ?
The crowd based community management is always imperfect .
We ’ve tried to give the community as many tools to do this .
Digg does skew younger , it does skew male , it does skew early adopter .
But it ’s tough to characterize Digg as a monolithic community – there are pockets that are sexist racist , homophobic – certainly .
There are trolls and people might see over indexing of these folks .
But equally there ’s the other side of the coin .
Digg has seen a broadening of its demographic since its inception .
The site has also experienced an expansion of interest into the arenas of politics , business and the environment .
Digg represents the growth of the internet — different thoughts and ideas .
There are different micro-communities following different information .
We ’ve seen that there ’s serious stuff and funny stuff .
The comments around different issues represent what these issues are about .
Are sexist comments defined as hate speech ?
They are evaluated on a case by case basis .
Sexism in general is a cultural grey area .
We have to ask ourselves — is this using the First Amendment right to be offensive yet not crossing the line to become true bannable offense .
Kevin
Rose says that he wants the site to be a useful source of information .
Is there a discrepancy between the culture of the site as it exists , and what the staff and Digg want it to be ?
There are micro ecosystems of snarky behavior on Digg .
But nobody in the Digg office would be like yeah that ’s awesome .
I do n’t think I ’d describe the culture of Digg as sexist .
But there ’s the whole question of troll management — how do you manage this as you grow ?
There are pockets of groups that behave really badly and the anonymity of internet creates an acrimonious culture .
The question is what is our philosophy of community management ?
Are we hands on or hands off ?
The front page of Digg represents what people want to vote up – how much personality should we impose ?

“ This is ‘ it ’ , feature - complete C++0x , including the major feature of ‘ concepts ’ which had its own extensive set of papers for language and library extensions ( if you get the impression that concepts is a big feature , well , it is indeed easily the biggest addition we made in C++0 x ) . ”
As I write this , I sit by the bedside of my beloved fiancée , who at the age of 46 was struck by a near fatal health crisis .
This crisis was over two months ago now , and thankfully she is on the road to recovery herself .
Had it not been for the loving generosity of some very wonderful friends , though , she would be in a charity hospital receiving only minimal care , and likely on the road to a lifetime of confinement in a nursing home .
Let 's face it folks , in the good old U. S. of A. , you get the best health care you can afford .
I 've been " affording " an excellent private health care package for her since she was forced to quit working due to longer term health issues .
She was repeatedly denied coverage by traditional insurance companies , and is covered under what is termed the state " high risk pool " .
You do n't want to know how much that coverage costs every month .
During that first traumatic month , I was almost forced to choose between working to pay for that insurance , or being at her side where I was needed so that I could make health care decisions for her , literally at a moment 's notice .
The aforementioned friends covered that insurance payment for her so that I could be there for her .
Now to my point : Joe Klein almost went there in a a recent Time blog post :
Oh , and by the way , if government activism is now back on the table , we can begin to talk about the real answers to our entitlement problems :
Medicare and medicaid can only be solved when they 're included in a comprehensive , regulated and managed universal health insurance system .
I only have one problem with that quote .
Even he still feels the need to use the word " insurance " when describing the solution .
I am in complete agreement with the rest of his statement .
But health ?
Truthfully , the solution is not any kind of insurance .
Do you buy insurance to pay the fireman who comes to save your life in the inferno that was once your home ?
Do you buy insurance to pay the police officer who responds to the armed robbery in progress in your small business ?
No , you do n't , because those are seen , rightfully so , as basic services provided by government in order to " " of the people .
Why then must we continue to talk of " insurance " for one of the most basic of " general welfare " needs of our people ?
It 's simple really .
This need is being driven by the profit motive , rather than the altruism of the first fire departments , or the " protect and serve " motive of our police departments .
Why is that ?
How did it come to be that altruism is not the driving factor of the practice of medicine ?
I do n't really know , and in all honesty , it 's not why I come before you today .
Rather , I come to you simply with the proposition that health care IS properly a basic need that is at least as important as fire and police protection .
In both those instances , you do buy recovery insurance , and perhaps there is a place in my grand scheme for health recovery insurance .
I contend though that the quality of treatment of a life threatening condition should not be determined by what you can afford to pay .
The time you spend waiting for diagnosis should not be determined by the inverse of your bank balance .
No family should ever be forced to choose between being at the side of a gravely ill loved one and being able to pay for the best possible care .
So long as the word " insurance " is part of the national health care discourse , so long as the profit motive is more important than the , we will never get to where we as a nation must ultimately go .
Health care reform begins with removing that word from the conversation .
How do we do that ?
By enacting HR 676 as soon as possible .
UNFIT ….
John McCain was presented with a choice : lose the election or lose his honor .
As has become painfully clear , McCain chose the latter .
It ’s oddly reassuring to see others reach the same conclusion .
Josh Marshall :
All politicians stretch the truth , massage it into the best fit with their message .
But , let ’s face it , John McCain is running a campaign almost entirely based on straight up lies .
Not just exaggerations or half truths but the sort of straight up , up - is - down mind - blowers we ’ve become so accustomed to from the current occupants of the White House .
And today McCain comes out with this rancid , race - baiting ad based on another lie… .
There ’s clearly no level of sleaze this guy wo n’t stoop to to win this election .
And let ’s be frank .
He might win it ….
But what is already apparent is that John McCain is running the sleaziest , most dishonest and race - baiting campaign of our lifetimes .
So let ’s stopped being shocked and awed by every new example of it .
It is undignified .
What can we do ?
We ’ve got a dangerously reckless contender for the presidency and a vice presidential candidate who distinguished herself by abuse of office even on the comparatively small political stage of Alaska .
They ’ve both embraced a level of dishonesty that disqualifies them for high office .
Democrats owe it to the country to make clear who these people are .
No apologies or excuses .
Andrew Sullivan :
On core moral issues , where this man knew what the right thing was , and had to pick between good and evil , he chose evil . [… ]
McCain has demonstrated in the last two months that he does not have the character to be president of the United States .
And that is why it is more important than ever to ensure that Barack Obama is the next president .
The alternative is now unthinkable .
And McCain — no one else — has proved it .
Joe Klein :
Do you see the election results as a repudiation of your politics ?
Our new president - elect won one and a half points more than George W. Bush won in 2004 , and he did so , in great respect , by adopting the methods of the Bush campaign and conducting a vast army of persuasion to identify and get out the vote .
But what about your great dream of creating a permanent Republican governing majority in Washington ?
I never said permanent .
Durable .
Do you think John McCain attacked too much or not enough ?
Dissecting the campaign that way is not helpful .
Have you met Barack Obama ?
Yes , I know him .
He was a member of the Senate while I was at the White House and we shared a mutual friend , Ken Mehlman , his law - school classmate .
When Obama came to the White House , we would talk about our mutual friend .
With the world economy in shambles many businesses are already battening down the hatches expecting rough seas ahead .

Idaho students chant ' assassinate Obama ' on school bus : Report David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Madison County , Idaho was once dubbed " the reddest place in America " by Salon , but that did n't make it any less shocking when elementary school children allegedly started chanting " assassinate Obama " on the school bus .
Matthew Whoolery told KIKD
News he found out about the chanting from his second and third graders , who had no idea what the word " assassinate " meant .
" They just had n't heard anything like this before , " Whoolery stated .
" I think the thing that struck us was just like , ' Where did they get the word and why would they put that word and that person together ? ' "
Whoolery , a psychology professor at Brigham Young University in Rexburg , is not an Obama supporter , but he was shocked that any public official would be threatened in that way .
" I do n't think that the majority of people in Rexburg have extreme ideas like that , but we were just surprised that it would go that far , " Whoolery told KIKD .
The Madison County School District has sent out an email saying that students are to be told this sort of behavior is unacceptable .
According to an article which appeared in Salon in 2006 , " You 've heard of Jesusland , but Rexburg , Idaho , is something more .
It 's not just a small town in rural Eastern Idaho .
It 's a small town in rural Eastern Idaho completely dominated by a fast - growing Mormon college , Brigham Young University - Idaho . "
" Through this conservative convergence , " the article continues , " Rexburg and surrounding Madison County may well be the rosiest place in all of red America .
Need numbers to prove it ?
In the 2004 presidential election , 93 percent of Madison County 's votes went to George W. Bush or minor - party conservative candidates -- arguably the reddest result of any county in the entire country . "
The population of Madison County is not only heavily Republican but also 97.7 % white .
One of Rexburg 's lone Democrats , a professor at the university , told Salon that " she remembers the time when a group of classmates followed her third - grader home , shouting out ' baby - killer ' all along the way .
She took it up with the teacher , who did n't seem to mind . "

Gov. tells state agencies they must prepare for the impacts of climate change , especially those caused by rising sea levels .
[ social_buttons ]
California ’s water supply and coastal resources , including valuable natural habitat areas , are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise over the next century , and according to an executive order issued by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday , the state could suffer devastating consequences if adaptive measures are not taken .
In a first - of - its - kind executive directive , Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has ordered the state to begin taking immediate action to mitigate the impending damage to state resources caused by climate change .
“ Given the serious threat of sea level rise to California ’s water supply , population and our economy , it ’s critically important that we make sure the state is prepared , ” Schwarzenegger said in a written release .
“ We have to adapt the way we work and plan in order to manage the impacts and challenges that California and our entire planet face from climate change , ” said Schwarzenegger .
Executive Order S -13-08 says that “ California must begin now to adapt and build our resiliency to coming climate changes through a thoughtful and sensible approach with local , regional , state and federal government using the best available science . ”
The order also requires state agencies that build new transportation infrastructure , such as roads and bridges , to factor in rising sea levels in their planning .
The executive order comes a day after the release of a report by a University of California economist predicting that if the state fails to act , it could suffer tens of billions of dollars in damage to its real estate , transportation systems and industries from water , fire and other climate - driven catastrophes by the end of the century .
Per the order , the state will request a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences to determine the most threatening infrastructural vulnerabilities .
The data collected — which should be available by 2010 — would then be used for long - term planning of state infrastructure projects .
Environmental groups have reacted positively to the Schwarzenegger move , applauding such aggressive policies that mitigate and adapt to climate change .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Former Lehman Brothers CEO
Richard Fuld on Monday blamed the collapse of his firm on a " crisis of confidence " that spread throughout the banking sector .
" This was not a lack of confidence in just Lehman Brothers , but part of what has been called ' a storm of fear ' enveloping the entire investment banking field and our financial institutions generally , " said Fuld , in prepared testimony released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Fuld was grilled by a House panel investigating the financial crisis .
" I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took , based on the information that we had at the time , " he said .
" With the benefit of hindsight would I have done this differently ?
Yes , I would have . "
Fuld added that he has yet to stop thinking about the demise of the firm that he headed for the past 15 years and worked for since 1969 .
" I wake up every single night thinking about what I could have done differently , " said Fuld .
" This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life , regardless of what comes out of this committee , regardless of what comes out of the record book when it finally gets written . "
The committee , chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , is examining the cause and effect of the Sept. 15 bankruptcy of Lehman - and who is to blame for it .
Lehman executives understood the seriousness of the firm 's dire financial state but " did n't act fast enough " to prevent the collapse , Waxman said .
The firm , in the days before it filed for bankruptcy , sought board approval to pay three departing executives more than $ 20 million , according to Waxman .
" Even as Mr. Fuld was pleading ... for a federal rescue , Lehman continued to squander millions on executive compensation , " Waxman said .
Added Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md. : " I do n't know how [ Fuld ] sleeps at night . "
Waxman said " the repercussions " of Lehman 's bankruptcy have been felt across the economy .
He said it triggered the recent credit crisis and made the $ 700 billion bailout enacted Friday necessary .
The blame game
Fuld pointed the finger at a host of other factors , including so - called naked short selling , that have dogged the finance industry .
Naked short selling differs from regular short selling in that the investor does n't actually borrow the shares being shorted , making it easier to drive prices lower .
Last month , the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to ban the practice , which has been blamed for some of recent wild market swings .
The SEC also recently issued a temporary ban on short selling all financial stocks .
Lawmakers put Fuld on the spot for referring to his company as " strong " in 2007 .
Also , Fuld said that no one predicted the impending crisis , noting that he still owned 10 million shares in the company .
" No one realized the extent and magnitude of these problems , nor how the deterioration of mortgage - backed assets would infect other types of assets and threaten our entire system , " said Fuld .
" With the benefit of hindsight , I can now say that I and many others were wrong . "
Some members of the committee took particular issue with Fuld for his salary and bonuses .
Fuld received a $ 22 million bonus in March .
Waxman added that Fuld " will walk away a wealthy man . "
Waxman displayed a chart that detailed what he said was $ 480 million in compensation since 2000 and pointed out that Fuld owned a $ 14 million oceanfront home in Florida , an extensive art collection and another home in Sun Valley , Idaho .
" Your company is now bankrupt , the economy is in a state of crisis , yet you get to bring home $ 480 million , " said Waxman .
" Is this fair , when the CEO of a company that 's bankrupt has made that much money ? "
Fuld disputed Waxman 's tally of his earnings , claiming it was inaccurate .
Fuld said that Waxman 's figure included stock holdings , while Waxman insisted it did not .
" I could have sold my stock , " said Fuld .
" I did not , because I firmly believed that we were getting back to profitability . "
At times during the testimony , Fuld appeared strained , particularly when Rep. John Mica , R - Fla. , referred to him as a " villain . "
When Waxman concluded the hearing , he frowned on the fact that Fuld seemed to come out on top , despite his sleepless nights .
" Just saying that the system works because you lost a portion of your shares does n't sound right to me , " said Waxman .
The FBI has begun a preliminary investigation of Lehman to determine whether its executives misled investors about the firm 's financial condition , according to a report Monday in the Wall Street Journal .
The House committee 's hearing on Monday is the first of several that will scrutinize the dire situation on Wall Street .
On Tuesday , the committee will hold a hearing on AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , the insurance giant that the government bailed out with an $ 85 billion credit line .
On Oct. 3 , AIG said it had already used $ 61 billion worth of the loan and was selling off parts of its business to help pay it off .
On Oct. 16 , the House will hold a hearing on the regulation of hedge funds .
An Oct. 22 session will focus on the breakdown of credit rating agencies , and a hearing on Oct. 23 will scrutinize the role of federal regulators .
Any self - respecting gadget hound knows that China is responsible for packing millions of shipping containers with the consumer electronics we crave .
What you may not know is what we ship in return : our waste for recycling .
Of growing concern is e-waste , resulting from the deluge of PCs , cellphones , televisions and crapgadgets we churn through at an accelerating clip each year .
While domestic recycling programs are good - intentioned , often the most toxic of our e-waste is shipped illegally back to China and boiled down for its precious metals under some of the most crude conditions you can imagine .
When faced with the choice of familial poverty or the slow accumulation of poison in their bloodstream ( for $ 8 per day ) , it 's not hard to imagine what many rural Chinese people will choose .
So while we give Greenpeace 's self - congratulatory promotions and oft - subjective " Guide to Greener Electronics " company ratings the occasional hard time , their attempts to raise e-waste awareness are commendable .
Now go ahead , check the video from 60 Minutes ' intrepid reporters after the break and let the guilt wash over you . :
As noted by reader Jason , a more thorough ( and disturbing ) exploration of these e-waste dumps can be found in a Current TV video shot last year in the same region .
Tuesday could be a long day for election officials in states relying on electronic - voting machines to record votes in the U.S. presidential election , if early reports of malfunctions are any indication .
Problems with e-voting machines were reported early on election day in several U.S. states , including Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia , which are identified as battleground states where the outcome of the vote could tip the presidential race in favor of either Democratic Sen. Barack Obama or Republican Sen. John McCain .
According to voter reports on the ground and from watchdog organizations , there were problems with getting e-voting machines up and running in these key states and others , and in some cases the machines would crash during the voting process and had to be rebooted .
Pennsylvania and Virginia were among states Verified Voting , an advocacy group focused on improving voting systems , and other watchdog organizations said they would keep a close eye on for voting problems .
Neither state had early voting before Nov. 4 , nor do they require paper - trail backups with the touchscreen electronic - voting machines in place at polls .
Critics of e-voting say that without a paper trail , there 's no way to audit the results of a touchscreen machine , often called DREs , or direct recording electronic machines .
Here is a look at problems with e-voting .
Some polling locations can give voters so - called " emergency " paper ballots , but this is not the case in all locations , said Pamela Smith , executive director of Verified Voting , in an interview early Tuesday .
" There is no clear policy on emergency paper ballots , or on when to distribute them so voters can still vote , " she said .
Moreover , if there is widespread failure with machines , locations with paper ballots are " concerned they 'll run out , " Smith said .
This , in fact , happened at one location in northern New Jersey Tuesday morning , where emergency paper ballots were gone by as early as 9:30 a.m. local time .
Polling officials began making photocopies of paper ballots because people who came to vote were leaving the site , frustrated by the delay .
One poll worker at the site who asked not to be named said , " I do n't have much faith in these machines , " and voters interviewed on - site were concerned their votes would not be recorded properly because they were on paper .
William Grafton , an IT professional , left the line at a polling site in Maplewood , New Jersey , a town just outside of New York , because an e-voting machine was not working ; he said he would return at lunch to try again .
Grafton said people in the area are " worried " their votes will not be counted because they would be on paper ballots and not on the e-voting machine .
Other voters said they preferred to use a paper ballot even if they voted via e-voting machine because they felt having a paper trail to record votes was more secure .
" It 's two minutes to do the electronic , so if you have to do the paper I would do it too , to make sure the vote counts . " said Sylvia Green - Robinson , a certified nurse 's aid who waited two hours to vote at a polling site in Irvington , New Jersey , about six miles from New York .
Interviewed outside of that polling site , Irvington Councilman David Lyons also said that he 's heard concerns from voters about the security of votes without a paper trail , including worries that " people might be able to hack " into voting machines and there will be no record of actual votes .
Unlike older machines that have been used to vote in the state , with New Jersey 's new e-voting machines , " if there 's a problem there 's no paper trail to actually show how people may have voted , " he said .
" Elections in this country should be fair and clean .
There should n't be any fear of people worrying about whether their votes were going to be cast , or whether someone can hack in and change things .
Lyons also grumbled about the fact that there was only one e-voting machine in his district , which predominantly consists of African - American voters who were expected to turn out en masse this election because it marks the first time an African - American , Obama , is a major party 's candidate for president .
He said that election officials should have been more prepared for high voter turnout .
" I mean , this municipality is mostly African - American , " he said , complaining that voters were being squeezed into polling places that lacked the resources to handle them .
" I did n't know how it is that they did n't prepare for this . "
By 10 a.m. local time , the Richmond Times - Dispatch newspaper in Virginia reported on its blog of voting news that it received widespread reports of e-voting problems , including trouble with the wireless communication systems of voting machines in Godwin , which the registrar there was quoted as attributing to human error .
While that issue was fixed by about 6:45 a.m. , other e-voting miscues were cited by the newspaper , as well as reports of a problem with ballots jamming in the feed of a machine that reads marked ballots .
By mid-morning Eastern Standard Time the State Board of Elections in Virginia reported in a press statement its call centers were " experiencing an unprecedented number of calls " from voters about the election .
State officials urged voters to call their local registrars for assistance with voting or use the state 's Web site rather than call the election board .
Mike Litterst , a spokesman for the board , confirmed that there were problems reported with optical - scan machines in the state , but called them " isolated " incidents and attributed them to the weather .
It was raining through much of the state , he said , which resulted in wet ballots that were jamming the machines .
" People 's hands were wet filling out the ballots , and there would be a pucker in the paper when they voted " and it would jam the machine , " Litterst said , adding that there were no problems reported so far with touchscreen machines .
Despite these reports , he said that the state had " the utmost confidence " that the vote would be fair in Virginia .
" People 's votes will be counted , " Litterst said .
" The weather is not helping , and certainly there are lines , but that is not unexpected . "
Despite Litterst 's optimism , one nonpartisan watchdog group , the Election Protection Coalition , was calling for polls in Virginia to stay open two hours later than scheduled because of the problems reported there .
" Virginia is emerging as a major hot spot , with tens of thousands of voters at risk , " the coalition said in a press statement , adding that it received hundreds of calls to the Election Protection Hotline reporting , among other things , " massive machine failures across the state . "
Other problems reported , according to the group , were late openings at more than two dozen precincts , voters being turned away and voter intimidation .
By late morning voters in Michigan also began reporting that machine malfunctions were contributing to long lines and that some polling sites had to use paper ballots , according to the Our Vote Live blog .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation developed Our Vote Live as a way to document voter problems reported to the Election Protection Coalition , .
The southern part of Florida also was developing as a hotbed of problems for voters .
In the area , which was the epicenter of voting problems in the controversial 2000 presidential race that put President George W. Bush in office , voters reported broken optical scan machines and long lines , according to Our Vote Live .
Voter - registration problems also were being widely reported to election watchdog groups by voters in Virginia , as well as in Florida , Pennsylvania and other key states .
Crowds swelled at polling places , and police in many locales were called to help direct traffic around voting sites .
However , official reports were at odds with some of those watchdog reports during the morning .
The Election Protection watchdog site had reports or problems with e-voting machines from " numerous polling locations " in Columbus , Ohio .
Asked about those , Jeff Ortega , the spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , said that office had not received reports of major problems regarding machine problems there .
" The polls opened on time , the average longest wait is about an hour -- in many cases , it 's much shorter than that , " he said , adding that there were " no major problems to speak of . "
However , the Associated Press reported that there were problems when a " handful " of machines malfunctioned in Fairfield County , which is southeast of Columbus , while the wrong paper ballots were sent to two precincts , according to Debbie Henderly , the elections director there .
In Philadelphia , someone who answered the phone in the deputy city commissioner 's office said there were " no more problems than usual " with e-voting machines in that area , though it was one in which there were numerous reports of machine malfunctions .
A direct call to the office of Deputy City Commissioner Fred Voigt was not returned Tuesday morning .
Illinois was another state where voters were reporting problems with machines , Verified Voting 's Smith said .
However , Illinois is not considered a battleground state , as it is the home state of Democratic presidential candidate Senator Obama , and he is widely projected by pollsters to win the election there .
The race between the two candidates is closer in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Florida and Virginia , according to polls taken before election day .
Marc Ferranti in New Jersey and Nancy Weil in Boston contributed to this report .

Should we really reward such irresponsible behavior by Ford ?
Obviously Ford CEO
Mulally was n’t worth the excessive pay since the company is now hitting the street begging for money .
This is the problem with these bailouts , whether for Detroit or Wall Street .
The executive teams have been showered with money beyond the dreams of most Americans and yet that was n’t enough .
They are sitting on massive personal wealth made at the expense of others in the company – you know , the people who have been fired or had cutbacks to benefits – but in Mulally ’s America , none of that matters .
He wants hard working Americans to fund projects that America has wanted for decades but Ford wanted their gas guzzling , polluting SUVs .
Normal Americans would be ashamed to pull such a stunt on the backs of taxpayer money but no , not Mulally .
How ’bout he cuts his salary and benefits and lives like the rest and then come back for that free ride ?
Otherwise , go ask someone else for a loan and see how that discussion goes .
Congressional Democrats just announced that they want auto - industry leaders to present them with a plan before they proceed with any vote on an auto - industry bailout bill .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid :
We all can throw all the barbs we want at the three people who fly down here on their corporate jets .
But we 're concerned not about them , we 're concerned about the hundreds of thousands and millions of people who are involved in the automobile industry who want these jobs and who need these jobs , we want them to have the jobs .
We want them to work and come up with a proposal that we can get through here by Dec. 8 .
Hmmmmm .
Can we make it a stipulation of any bailout that the corporate leadership of these firms be summarily fired ( sans golden parachutes ) and replaced ?
That would be my first recommendation .

Who are the key players in Britain 's 21st - century sex industry ?
" Not me , " you 're thinking .
But the term " sex industry " is a catch - all for such a multifarious collection of sex- associated objects and activities , that there is scarcely an adult in Britain whose life it does n't touch in some way .
The sex industry encompasses anything that joins sex and commerce , be that a plastic toy bought from Ann Summers , a copy of Playboy , dialling a premium - rate number for phone sex , or paying a tenner for a hand job down a back alley , not to mention erotic fiction , porn films , stag - night strippers and lap - dancing clubs .
In terms of prostitution , the stories we tend to hear are the most tragic – such as the murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich in 2006 ; a horrific story , but a quantum leap , thank God , from the experiences of most women who sell their bodies for a living – from those working in saunas , massage parlours and brothels to escorts and companions who can earn six - figure incomes .

One in 10 British men has visited a prostitute .
Yes , that 's 10 per cent .
And who is servicing them ?
Around 80,000 sex workers , a figure that is said to include 4,000 women and children trafficked into the country to work as sex slaves .
Our laws on paid sex , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith declared , are long overdue for a rethink .
" We need to send out a message to men and to society in general , that most women do not choose to be in prostitution , whereas the buyers have free choice , " she said last week .
Transferring the burden of criminality on to the punters , or " johns " as prostitutes call them , who pay to have sex with anyone who is " controlled for another person 's gain " , is at the centre of Smith 's plan to remove the trafficking industry 's market and , with the same blow , shrink the prostitution trade .
The Home Secretary believes making examples out of unthinking punters will scare off those men who do not care whether the woman whom they are paying for sex has been smuggled in from China , or is working for a pimp or to pay off a drug dealer .
Women 's minister Harriet Harman joined the campaign yesterday , asking members of the Women 's Institute to help with the crackdown by complaining to newspapers who print adverts offering sex with foreign women .
" They 're living in a bubble , " says Samantha ( not her real name ) of the Government and its new plans .
Samantha was a teacher until her family ran into financial difficulties , and she began working for an escort agency in the late Eighties .
She was subsequently raped and tortured by a client , and won the first private prosecution for the rape of a prostitute in England and Wales .
But the blazing hoops she had to jump through to get her case to court would have scared most women off .
" You 're never going to get rid of prostitution , " she says , which may be true – but should this fact stand in the way of attempts to contain and regulate it ?
" To try and criminalise the men , our clients , is extremely idealistic .
They say they 're looking at the safety of the women , and want to stop the trafficking , but all it is really is an excuse to close down brothels .
I went to a meeting held by these fundamentalist feminists who said , ' We want to save these women from being penetrated on a daily basis . '
For goodness ' sake – we have a choice about whether we want to be penetrated or not !
Sex goes on every minute of every day of every month in every year .
It 's nothing special . "
Since the beginning of time , societies have tried to clamp down on , or liberalise , the sex trade .
As a result , it has gone through numerous reinventions , but none has changed the sense of it in any meaningful way .
To clarify : paying for sex in the UK is not a crime , nor is selling sex , but various laws around the act make it difficult for prostitutes to operate safely : soliciting sex on the street is illegal , as is kerb - crawling , though pressing charges for both rely on there being persistent offences .
Keeping a brothel , where more than one person is selling sex , is illegal .
And what of the rest of the industry , which is still selling sex , if not the act itself ?
It is in rude health .
The 2003 Licensing
Act relaxed restrictions on lap - dancing clubs , which has brought them on to the high street .
As many as 300 new clubs have opened since , and the Government promised last summer to make it more difficult to open strip clubs in residential areas .
Victoria Andrews , 31 , owns the lap - dancing club Aqua : Lounge in Southampton .
She started dancing with friends when she was studying .
" I went to audition with a group of housemates and we all got the job , " she says .
" It suddenly became more real , but we all made some cash on the first night and thought , ' Wow .
This is great . ' "
Now , despite owning her own club , Andrews is studying law .
But this is to escape the stress of running her own business rather than the lap - dancing world itself .
Andrews wo n't dance again because she has a knee injury , but she loved the experience .
" It was great exercise and well controlled , " she says .
" There was never any scope for anything inappropriate . "
She asked her employees why they work for her .
" Eighty per cent of my girls are students , 10 per cent are lone parents , and the other 10 per cent work full time and want cash for luxuries or holidays . "

As far as pornography goes , the 1978 porn film Debbie Does Dallas provides mild titillation compared with hardcore freebies available online .
The porn " sector " is worth around £ 1bn , and 50 per cent of adults watch porn with their partners .
But why splash out on a top - shelf magazine when the nipple count in Nuts is more than enough to send most pulses racing ?
Rampant Rabbit vibrators are no longer in the bottom drawer , but a badge of belonging to the Noughties " we - can - do - it - too " womanhood .
Meanwhile , women 's magazines are happy to discuss whether readers prefer " pencils or mushrooms " on their front covers .
Billboards showing David Beckham wearing spray - on Armani underwear stop traffic , while S&M - themed Agent Provocateur advertisements are a staple of the glossier publications .
Every sexual aid , every accoutrement , every raunchy negligée and multicoloured condom , has been freed from its restrictive hothouse and allowed to blossom in the open air .
Sex is now on every high street , not just in the seedier areas of town .
Have we reached sexual enlightenment ?
Categorically not .
Deviant behaviour is as rampant as ever , and prostitution itself remains , in effect , illegal .
But demand is on the up , out of control even .
Do the people paying for it think that because we can talk about it pre-watershed , the moral arguments surrounding it have dissolved ?
Battle is joined by the usual protagonists : the authorities , and the sex workers .
Both say their priority is the safety of women ( and men and children , but it is mostly women ) .
In this current instance , the onus is on women trafficked into the UK and forced to have sex with men against their will .
The prostitutes , led by the English Collective of Prostitutes , see the move as a further attack on their pretty thin rights .
The new legislation will criminalise the people they work with – their partners , landlords and anyone else who gains from the money they earn as prostitutes , they say .
More to the point , they argue , trafficked women are not prostitutes : they are slaves .
Prostitutes make a choice to earn their living by selling their bodies , however fiercely people on the outside , including me , question what sort of choice this represents .
And they profit from it , but also wish to enjoy the same safe working environments that other working people have .
The new legislation seeks to drive it underground and pretend that a society without prostitution is a possibility , say the ECP .
The people who pay for sex are , unsurprisingly , loath to admit to doing so .
Everyone seems to know someone else who has visited a prostitute , but no one is quite sure who , or where , or why , or how much they paid , and they certainly can't go and ask them about it .
One person who is honest about his use of prostitutes is writer and artist Sebastian Horsley .
He has worked as an escort and run a brothel , andtalks candidly about his love of and appetite for prostitutes , estimating he has paid for sex with more than 1,000 women at a cost of more than £ 100,000 .
Horsley also admits he is chasing the libertine lifestyles of the artists he grew up in thrall to – Edvard Munch , Van Gogh and Gauguin , Oscar Wilde .
His romanticising of the practice is wildly indulgent and no doubt has little relevance for most prostitutes .
He has said he is against legalisation as that would remove the excitement of the forbidden fruit element , but is no longer sure about this : if it improved safety , he says , it would be a good thing .
One thing he is certain about rings true with the opinion of every prostitute I have spoken to : they are not victims .
" Contrary to what those foul feminists will tell you , the prostitute is not a victim , " he says .
" If you talk to them , and I 've met thousands , they do n't often find themselves victimised and exploited , but the middle - class intellectuals who formulate their opinions for them tell them that they are .
There 's a whole rescue operation going on at the moment made up of social workers , community leaders and politicians , and it's in their interests to find suffering .
There is exploitation , but there is exploitation in all industries . "
Horsley is the product of a privileged and eccentric background , and he makes a living out of his outrageous behaviour and utterings .
His attempt to recreate the depraved Parisian existence of his absinthe - fuelled artistic heroes makes him an easy target for derision , and , in fact , anger : only a poor little rich boy could play at being a prostitute and a heroin addict , and base a life philosophy on it .
But he is up - front about his behaviour , unlike the rest of those one in 10 men who must feel there is something wrong with using a prostitute , or they would n't be so keen to hide it .
" Who are we to tell someone what parts they can and cannot sell of themselves ? , " he asks .
Prostitutes are not stupid , but they have different skills .
You do n't get prostitutes telling the politicians how they should be earning a living , do you ? "
Jacqui Smith believes demand dictates supply , an argument with a clear logic , and if there were n't so many men like Horsley willing to pay for sex , women would not face the choice of entering an industry in which exploitation is rife .
The oft - cited example is Sweden , where the buying of sex was criminalised almost a decade ago .
In Lithuania and Finland it is already illegal to pay for sex with someone acting under coercion , as will happen here under the new legislation , and Norway is set to follow Sweden 's lead .
But Sweden is the example cited by those who support the Smith reforms .
When the law was passed there were around 2,500 sex workers ; now there are just 500 , and Sweden is the least popular human trafficking destination in Europe .
Making it an offence to pay for sex with anyone acting under coercion and where ignorance is no defence , even when the party paying for sex has asked and been lied to , is intended to scare a large sector of punters away from visiting prostitutes , not just trafficked workers .
" It is middle - class people with jobs trying to control deviant behaviour , " says Horsley , dismissively .
As it is , it 's very easy , and often very cheap , to find paid - for sex .
Every small town has always housed a brothel of some sort , where regulars would find sex and companionship in the arms of reliable women , but now you can go online and pick women like sweets .
If it becomes less socially acceptable – because men are forced to assume most prostitutes are working under duress – and trickier in practical terms to find sex , the theory is that , as in Sweden , the industry will shrink .
The English Collective of Prostitutes , and Samantha , do not agree .
" Where have those prostitutes in Sweden gone ? " she asks .
" They still need the money .
They 've gone underground .
Or they 've gone to work in other countries .
There is still the same number of prostitutes around .
If you do n't want to be found , you wo n't be .
They still have to pay the bills or feed a drug habit .
The reasons they are prostitutes are still there .
The further they crack down , the more underground we will have to go .
So streetworkers will take more risks to earn the same amount per night , which is horrendous .
You 're making yourself more vulnerable . "
Samantha no longer needs to work as a prostitute .
She says she began out of necessity to support her family , though it was her husband who suggested it .
He supported her during the rape trial but later turned violent and she fled the marriage .
Does she regret starting ?
" That 's the sting in the tail .
Obviously , if I could have my time again there is no way I would do it , but if I had n't , I would n't have been raped and the private prosecution would n't have been forthcoming .
I had the support to do that and other women did n't .
I would n't change that for the world . "
Would she be happy if her kids did the same ?
" The only reason to do that type of work is money .
I would be concerned if I was not supporting them . "
Someone who 's given the issue a lot of thought is Sam Roddick , a former prostitutes ' rights campaigner and owner of sex shops Coco de Mer .
She also curated , with actress Emma Thompson , an exhibition about trafficking called Journey .
" Trafficking is nothing to do with prostitution , " she says .
" It is slavery . "
Along with many others with a close interest in the business – even police , off the record – Roddick believes the only way forward is legalisation .
" It 's an extraordinarily complex issue .
There are a lot of problems because it's an unregulated industry with no ethic attached to it .
We need to inject some expectations into it and it has to be run by the women who are providing the services . "
She also has a theory about the people who use prostitutes .
" Who 's the punter ?
The punter is everyman .
And why is it growing ?
Because they 're disassociating from themselves sexually , and from their emotions .
It 's an expression of self - hate .
Men who go to prostitutes , no matter how much they think they are functional , are people who can't be honest with themselves about who they are .
When you scratch the surface and start to ask questions about their emotional relationship to their own sexuality , you find big dark holes . "
***
If there are as many dark holes as Roddick surmises , society is in deep trouble .
I went in search of some of these holes on the many websites where punters can find prostitutes , and vice versa .
The internet is manna for the would - be john .
It is n't just a forum for tracking down prostitutes , there are handy guides and FAQs which tell you exactly what to expect ( and pay ) in brothels , saunas and on the street , and how to spot a rip - off .
All this is on Punternet , where you 'll find detailed reviews of escorts , a tour calendar where women can post their whereabouts and when sex parties will be happening .
Captain 69 , Craigslist ( which has agreed to crack down on " erotic services " messages in the US ) and Adult FriendFinder are other hotspots for punters and prostitutes .
What is startling are the specifics : you can build your woman to order , stating the desired location , ethnic origin , hair colour , height , age and breast size .
None will talk to me , though , only men who think my posing as a " journalist " is roleplay .
They are , though , discussing the proposed changes in the law with each other on message boards .
A few declare themselves too scared of arrest to continue to punt , especially where it would involve putting their career and family life in jeopardy .
A few others point out how unlikely it is much enforcement will ever be forthcoming .
There is some sympathy mooted for the prostitutes working for a brothel or agent , who may be affected , but the overriding sentiment is that the move is a political scare tactic , and the sex industry will fit in with , or circumvent , any new rules .
A research paper , " Who Pays for Sex ? " , by Dr Helen Ward , was published in the British Medical Journal in 2005 .
It pointed out that the focus of studies into prostitution are always weighted towards the sellers rather than the buyers , and found that the proportion of British men paying for sex had increased , from 5.9 per cent in 1990 to 9 per cent in 2000 .
And who were these men ?
Your partner , probably .
The largest group of the men were in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties and living in London .
" Some men seem to find it attractive to have sex without emotional commitment , " explained Ward at the time .
" Others just like the excitement of paid - for sex .
I hope that by showing how common this is , we can start to demystify commercial sex . "
With so many different types of men seeking to pay for sex , there is great diversity in the sort of sex for sale , and the women selling it .
" You ca n't treat a stripper in the same way you can a street hooker , " says Roddick .
" And you can't deal with an escort as you deal with a table dancer . "
The ECP might put up a united front , but a strict hierarchy and professional code exists within prostitution , and it is well explained by a scene from Secret Diary of a Call Girl , the ITV drama starring Billie Piper , based on the blogs and books of Belle de Jour , a high - class call girl whose explicit , honest , and apparently true writings sent ripples through the worlds of publishing and prostitution when they first appeared five years ago .
In this scene , Belle has just joined a " courtesan " agency .
Courtesans are highly educated , polished and beautiful women who provide sex and companionship to a small number of clients .
" Like most professions , mine has a hierarchy , " she explains .
" The courtesans look down on the escorts ...
The flat girls get told that being an escort is dangerous and they should stay where they 're safe ...
The street girls say that the flat girls are too controlled and they 're better off staying in charge ...
And beneath all that there are women who are lied to , trafficked and forced to work debts off in squalor ... "
On top of this , call girls look down on strippers ( why work a man up if you 're not going to deliver ? ) and porn stars ( acting is fake , as are plastic breasts and peroxide curls ) .
Secret Diary of a Call Girl has been criticised for glamorising prostitution .
What its critics mean is that it is irresponsible to depict , on the television , women working in prostitution who are neither addicted to drugs nor in a controlling relationship , and who are making a very good living out of it .
I wonder if these critics are afraid to accept we have prostitutes in our middle - class midst .
Is it really possible a woman would choose prostitution not to escape poverty , but the grind and poor rewards of graduate employment ?
Like most of the girls in the Southampton lap - dancing club , 32 - year - old Elizabeth began selling sex as a student .
She has worked as an independent escort and companion for four years and charges from £ 600 for a few hours of her time up to many thousands for weeks and even months of companionship .
Nice work if you can get it , but she has crawled her way up the sex industry food chain , from a brothel to a strip club , then a massage parlour and escort and internet agencies before striking out on her own .
" My high rate cuts out the lower market I used to get , " she says .
According to Samantha , there 's now a growing number of women who hold down professional jobs and go on the game at the weekend .
These women are not on the breadline , nor are they feeding a drug habit .
No – their behaviour is a tragic indictment of obsessive consumerism .
Whither a woman 's sanctity when there 's a new pair of Manolos and a trip to Chiva - Som in the offing ?
But , as Belle makes clear at the end of her description of the prostitution career ladder : " If someone steals your passport and forces you to have sex with strangers , call it what it is ... rape and slavery .
Do n't call it prostitution . "

Helen Atkins works for the Poppy Project , which provides accommodation and support to women who have been trafficked into prostitution , and is one of the critics of Secret Diary of a Call Girl .
" Multimedia representations like this portray prostitution as a fun , easy way to make lots of money .
There are few column inches or screen time given to the reality of prostitution . "
I would argue the opposite .
Secret Diary is the only media representation which seeks to present prostitution in terms that are not sordid , impoverished and miserable .
What about Band of Gold and Sex Traffic ?
Newspapers run stories about the horrors of trafficking and the terrible Ipswich murders of 2006 , not 10 - point plans on how to be a successful escort .
But The Poppy Project works at the very sharp end of prostitution , with trafficked women .
It has received more than 1,000 referrals from the police since 2000 and supports Jacqui Smith 's proposals , only wishing the Government had gone further and aimed for complete criminalisation of the sale of sex under any circumstances .
They do not see it as a solution to trafficking , or imagine it will stop men from buying sex with trafficked women , or the trafficking of women itself .
Atkins 's interpretation of " trafficked " is wider than most of us might understand the term .
Under the United Nations ' global definition of trafficking , she explains , the three key elements are movement , coercion and exploitation , pointing to US research which finds that 90 per cent of pimp - controlled prostitution equates to trafficking .
Coercion and exploitation are evident in the relationships of many prostitutes with their partners , pimps and brothel - keepers , even if they have not been brought into the UK illegally .
Moreover , insists Atkins , grassroots organisations such as The Poppy Project do not exist to safeguard the Belles de Jour of this world .
" There 's often a conflict of interest .
The legislation could benefit one group and not another .
I think it 's imperative we place the rights of people who are exploited over the rights of those who are empowered . "
The " empowered " women are those solicitors who escort at weekends ; the exploited are the 95 per cent of street prostitutes who use heroin or crack cocaine .
The explosion of commodified sex in Britain is a smokescreen for the horrific circumstances facing many women working in the industry .
" We mistake our ability to talk about how to get a blow job as liberation , " says Roddick , " but we can't be sexually liberated as a society when the biggest area of growth within sex is trafficked women . "
That sex has evolved into an acceptable dinner - party conversation subject has increased demand for it in all its forms , including prostitution .
Without retreating into the puritanical laws that govern American public attitudes to sex , there are two ways forward for prostitution .
Either we accept it and try to build health and safety procedures into the trade , or reject it as an abuse of women and make those seeking to pay for sexual services culpable for their behaviour .
The campaign set up in Ipswich after the murders of five prostitutes in 2006 was called Somebody 's Daughter , a clever emotional brake which forces many men interested in buying sex to remember that the woman means as much to her father as their own daughters do to them .
However , that woman might also have children of her own to feed and clothe .
The evidence from areas where prostitution is legal is not promising .
Victoria was the first Australian state to legalise it , in 1984 , but its 400 legal brothels stand side by side with many more illegal ones .
Anywhere that establishes itself as a " safe zone " for prostitution draws pimps .
Yet tolerance zones in cities including Aberdeen and Edinburgh were hugely popular with prostitutes .
They became technically illegal in Scotland and similar plans in England have fallen by the wayside , largely due to local opposition .
I still can't help feeling that no one would really choose to work as a prostitute if there were other , equally lucrative options .
Yet what seems to have been overlooked , is that the Home Office is offering legislation to tackle the trade in human misery – while withdrawing funding to crack down on it .
The largest police unit dedicated to human trafficking faces closure a year after it was set up , because the Home Office has cut funding for these sorts of investigations by more than 50 per cent , from £ 4 m to £ 1.7 m .
Jacqui Smith 's proposed legislation is meaningless – designed to make men think twice before calling a prostitute , but unlikely to register in the twilight world of traffickers .
But then , legislation always comes for free , sex does n't .
Buying sex :
What the punters pay
£ 10 -£ 15 : Ten minutes with a street prostitute .
£ 20 : Sex in a " walk - up " – rooms , usually in known red - light districts , which are crudely advertised with signs on the doors or walls .
These establishments are often destinations for trafficked women .
£ 25 : Entrance to a sauna , which covers the cost of the room and use of facilities .
Sexual services are extra .
£ 40 : Probably the lowest fee to engage the services of someone advertising in a phone box .
A full hour will cost about £ 100 .
£ 50 : The minimum price for 30 minutes with a prostitute in a brothel .
£ 80 : Probably the maximum charged for full sex in a sauna .
£ 200 : One hour with a " high - class " independent escort , but they will usually ask for a minimum booking of three or four hours .
£ 3,000 : An entire day with a " high - class " independent escort .
£ 5,000 + : One day with a " courtesan " , although they are unlikely to accept bookings for less than 48 hours .
Prostitution : the facts
There are an estimated 80,000 prostitutes in Britain , of which more than 20,000 have come from abroad .
* At least 4,000 prostitutes in Britain have been trafficked .
Anti-trafficking groups say the true figure is much higher .
* Of the estimated 25,000 women who work in brothels , 85 per cent are from overseas .
It is thought 8,000 are working against their will .
* The most recent estimates ( from 2001 ) place the total earnings of British prostitutes at around £ 770 m a year .
* According to one study , 95 per cent of street prostitutes are drug addicts .
Another suggests that 87 per cent use heroin .
* The UK sex industry includes street girls , brothel and agency workers , dominatrices and high - class courtesans .
* Internet sites such as Punternet , Captain69 as well as listing sites such as Craigslist have given prostitutes a huge market online .
Many prostitutes run their own websites .
A summary of recommendations from the Home Office report " Tackling the demand for prostitution " ( published 19 November ) :
* Make it an offence for people to pay for sex with someone who is controlled for another person 's gain
* Run a campaign aimed at sex buyers to raise awareness about trafficking for sexual exploitation
* Amend the offences of kerb - crawling and persistent soliciting to allow prosecution for a first offence
* Launch a national anti-kerb - crawling campaign and support forces in reducing street prostitution
* Introduce closure powers for premises linked to sexual exploitation , allowing police to restrict access for up to three months
What ’s it all about ?
This blog is an attempt to document spending $ 30 a week on groceries for two people living in Brooklyn , NY ( yes , $ 15 each ) .
That budget goes for all of the groceries we buy to make our meals for the week .
Restaurants , alcohol do n’t get counted toward the budget , but then we usually only indulge in those one or twice on the weekends .
Dinner parties can get tricky , etc. etc. , but the point is really for us to make our best effort to transition to spending less money and more time and attention on our food ( while reducing waste ) .
If we end up spend $ 32 for a week ’s food every once in a while , so be it .
All the meals featured here are 100 % vegetarian , but will often feature eggs and dairy .
We like our cookbooks , but often make some crazy concoctions with whatever we have on hand .

MARYSVILLE , Wash. , Nov. 17 ( UPI ) -- A Washington man who told officers he fatally shot his 6 - year - old daughter while cleaning a gun had been drinking heavily , court records indicate .
Snohomish County sheriff 's deputies arrested 42 - year - old Richard Peters of Marysville following the Sunday night shooting while they considered whether to file felony first - degree manslaughter charges , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer reported Monday .

Peters called 911 after the shooting , around 7:30 p.m .
His daughter , Stormy Peters , was rushed to Seattle Children 's Hospital but she died there , the newspaper said .
Citing court documents filed in Snohomish County Superior Court , the newspaper said Richard Peters told police he had asked his daughter to bring his Colt .45 - caliber pistol from his room .
He said he had unloaded the magazine but for some reason the gun fired .
Police said Richard Peters told an investigator he " must have " pulled the trigger .
He told a detective he had been drinking " double vodkas " while he and his wife cleaned the guns , and court documents indicated he said he was probably too drunk to drive .
An 8 - year - old sibling , an infant and the girl 's mother also were in the residence at the time of the shooting , authorities said .
Richard Peters was ordered held on $ 50,000 bail .
THE Government is to launch a clampdown on the growing army of aggressive street beggars .
New measures will be aimed at Fagin - type figures who exploit young children and vulnerable women and will also focus on beggars who use harassment , obstruction or intimidation when dealing with the public .
Changes in the legislation will make it a criminal offence to place children at risk by sending them onto the streets and roads to beg .
Reforms of the existing law have been sanctioned by the Cabinet and will be published today by Justice Minister Dermot Ahern .
A new offence will carry a maximum penalty of a month in jail and a € 700 fine .
The current legislation was introduced at the time of the Great Famine in 1847 and is now seen as completely unworkable in dealing with an increasing problem .
The reforms have been drawn up in the wake of a High Court judgment , which found the law to be unconstitutional .
Gardai are to be granted new powers to arrest and charge people who fail to comply with an order to stop begging .
This will become a public order offence if it is accompanied by harassment , obstruction or intimidation .
However , the law will also recognise that circumstances can arise where asking for help cannot be regarded as begging , according to justice officials .
They said it was not the intention to criminalise a young person who did not have the money to pay a bus fare late at night , provided the appeal for help did not involve an attempt at intimidation .
Officials said Mr Ahern held the view that there were a number of reasons why the law on begging needed to be overhauled .
Many people , particularly the elderly and vulnerable , found it upsetting to be approached by somebody who was begging , especially if there was a threat of violence .
Begging could damage business and was seen as hurting the country 's image as a tourism and business destination .
Challenge
The High Court challenge to the 1847 legislation was taken by 33 - year - old graduate , Niall Dillon , who had been charged with begging on Parliament Street , Dublin , in September 2003 .
Mr Dillon said he was sitting outside the shop with a cup in a quiet and peaceful manner when he was arrested .
The judge made an order preventing his trial on the basis that section 3 of the act excessively interfered with Mr Dillon 's right of freedom of expression .
The Department of Justice is satisfied the new legislation will meet the constitutional concerns identified by Mr Justice De Valera .
Mr Ahern will publish the bill early in the new year .

AUSTIN —
The state ’s top law enforcement agency asked Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott for a ruling on the legality of setting up statewide driver ’s license checkpoints .
The Houston Chronicle reported 15 lawmakers said such a move would be unauthorized immigration policymaking .
The proposed checkpoints would stop drivers to review their licenses , vehicle registrations and proof of insurance .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A number of state legislators argue the Department of Public Safety Commission overstepped its authority Aug. 25 by issuing new rules requiring applicants to prove they are legally in the U.S. before they can receive a Texas driver ’s license or identification .
Two weeks later , lawmakers were further disturbed after learning the commission ’s chairman , Allan B. Polunsky , wanted a ruling on the checkpoints .
State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte , D - San Antonio , and 14 other Texas lawmakers sent Abbott a letter asking him to ignore the commission ’s legal opinion request because the Legislature has not authorized a DPS checkpoint program .
— Checkpoints have n’t been allowed in Texas since the state Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in 1994 they must be authorized by a “ politically accountable governing body at the state level . ”
— Spokeswoman Allison Castle said Gov. Rick Perry favors the checkpoints .

What do rat poison and the HPV vaccine have in common ?
The answer is a hazardous chemical known as sodium borate .
Savvy readers may wonder what a toxin that is commonly used to kill rats is doing in the ingredient list for the HPV vaccine that is currently being pushed on girls as young as nine and is even being considered for men and boys .
Unfortunately , the answer is n't very comforting , especially for new U.S. residents for whom the HPV injection containing sodium borate is now mandated .
Sodium borate , a boric acid salt also known as borax , has many common uses .
In addition to its use as a rat poison , it is also used in laundry detergents , cosmetics , enamel glazes , flame retardants , and buffer solutions in chemistry .
However , sodium borate also has antifungal properties , which means that its probable reason for being in the vaccine is to act as a preservative .
Sodium borate is used as a food additive in some countries , but it is now outlawed in many places .
For example , one Australian government recall site notes : " Product is Borax ( sodium borate ) which is a non permitted food additive and is harmful to health . "
So , if it 's " harmful to health , " why is it being added to the HPV vaccine ?
The U.S. National Library of Medicine states in an article that boric acid is " no longer commonly used in medical preparations . "
It 's a good thing , too , considering that the U.S. National Library of Medicine also reports that this substance used to be used to disinfect and treat wounds and that individuals " who received such treatment over and over again got sick , and some died . "
In fact , the U.S. National Library of Medicine provides the number for Poison Control for people exposed to this chemical and notes that treatment for those exposed to it may include gastric lavage ( stomach pumping ) , dialysis , and liquids by mouth or IV .
Sadly , the information about sodium borate gets even scarier .
Another government website article states that exposure to sodium borate can cause convulsions and other ill health effects .
Interestingly enough , young girls who receive the HPV vaccine have reported similar symptoms to those that appear in cases of sodium borate poisoning .
This particular government site provides the following warning regarding this chemical : " WARNING !
HARMFUL IF SWALLOWED , INHALED OR ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN .
CAUSES IRRITATION TO SKIN , EYES AND RESPIRATORY TRACT . "
Given this information , is sodium borate really something that should be injected into humans ?
This is something the reader should carefully consider , along with the previously reported information , before choosing to receive the controversial HPV vaccine .

The commander of the Delta Force team has now written a book which tells what he says is the true story of what went wrong .
He appeared anonymously on CBS 's 60 Minutes on Sunday to summarize that story .
Bin Lad More ..en was known to be holed up at Tora Bora on a ridge with an elevation of 14,000 feet .
The Delta Force team 's initial plan was to come at him from the direction he'd least expect , climbing over the mountains at his back , but that plan was n't approved by the higher - ups .
Their second idea , to drop hundreds of landmines along the mountain passes to Pakistan to impede bin Laden 's retreat and then bring in helicopters , was also turned down .
" How often does Delta come up with a tactical plan that 's disapproved by higher headquarters ? "
CBS 's Scott Pelley asked the commando leader .
" In my experience , in my five years at Delta , never before , " he replied .
The only remaining option was a frontal assault by 50 US Delta Force members plus their Afghan guides -- and the Afghan warlord accompanying the commandos frankly told them , " I do n't think you guys can handle it . "
A few million dollars from the CIA quickly secured his cooperation , but only to a degree .

Sienna Miller Single and Happy
Actressis single and content .
Her most recent romance was with actor .
The two hooked up in July and were pictured in a compromising situation on a yacht , setting off a media scandal .
Sienna was photographed topless and kissing married Balthazar .
The photos surfaced in every magazine and web outlet which caused Balthazar to make a statement indicating that he and his wife were indeed separated at the time .
Miller ended up suing the photographers who took the photos on the grounds of breach of privacy .
Getty was not the only one taking a hit in the relationship .
Miller 's home was vandalized and someone wrote the word " slut " on her home .
Miller 's photo above was taken Friday night at the Hollywood Dominoes VIP Launch in London .
She took a minute to talk with reporters about her love life .
" I am single at the moment , and I 'm completely happy with that .
It 's nice not to have a relationship that the press constantly wants to scrutinize and discuss .
I 'm cool with being on my own . "

Everything here is an expression of this continuum .
Otherwise , the only certainty is change .
“ Frankly , I ’d rather take the medicine , ” said Dr. Robert C. Gallo , director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , referring to antiretroviral drugs .
Moreover , the chances of finding a donor who is a good tissue match for the patient and also has the rare genetic mutation that confers resistance to H.I.V. , the virus that causes AIDS , are extremely small .
Nonetheless , the man has been free of the virus for 20 months even though he is not using antiretroviral drugs , and the success in his case is evidence that a long - dreamed - of therapy for AIDS  injecting stem cells that have been genetically re-engineered with the mutation  might work .
The cure was announced Wednesday by Dr. Gero Hütter and Dr. Eckhard
Thiel , blood - cancer specialists at Charité Hospital in Berlin .
The case was described last week in The Wall Street Journal .
Attempts to use bone - marrow transplants in AIDS treatment have been made since the 1980s .
In one case , a patient with both AIDS and lymphoma died of the cancer two months later , but was found to harbor no H.I.V. ; it was not known if something in the transplant had protected him .
And in a famous 1995 case , Jeff Getty , a prominent San Francisco advocate for AIDS patients , received bone marrow from a baboon , which is resistant to the human virus .
He survived 11 years , but died of AIDS and cancer ; the transplant had not protected him but antiretroviral triple therapy had been invented in time to help .
In first post-election interview , Obama promises exit from Iraq , Gitmo closure Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday November 16 , 2008

For a full transcript of Obama 's appearance on 60 Minutes , see CBS News .
WASHINGTON ( AFP )  President - elect Barack Obama vowed to pull troops out of Iraq , crush Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan and shut down the Guantanamo Bay camp as part of a dramatic foreign policy break with George W. Bush .
In his first major post- election interview , with CBS program " 60 Minutes , " the Democrat signaled no retreat from expansive campaign promises that have pleased US allies , even while adding little detail to how he will fulfill them .
Repairing the stricken US economy will be priority number one , and at least one Republican will fill his cabinet , Obama said in the broad - ranging interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday .
Following his election triumph of November 4 , Obama confirmed that he had met former Democratic primary rival Hillary Clinton last week but refused to comment on speculation linking her to the job of secretary of state .
As soon as he succeeds Bush on January 20 , Obama said , " I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff , my national security apparatus , and we will start executing a plan that draws down our troops " from Iraq .
" Particularly in light of the problems that we 're having in Afghanistan , which has continued to worsen .
We 've got to shore up those efforts , " he said .
On the campaign trail , Obama vowed to pull one or two combat brigades out of Iraq every month until after 16 months , only a residual security force of unspecified size remains .
Some of those brigades would head to Afghanistan .
He told CBS that from his inauguration , " it is a top priority for us to stamp out Al - Qaeda once and for all " and that killing or capturing the group 's mastermind Osama bin Laden was " critical " to US security .
Obama also pledged to make short work of tackling offshoots of Bush 's " war on terror " -- the internment camp operated by the US military at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and harsh interrogations of captured terror suspects .
" I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo , and I will follow through on that , " the president - elect said .
" I have said repeatedly that America does n't torture .
And I 'm going to make sure that we do n't torture .
Those are part and parcel of an effort to regain America 's moral stature in the world , " Obama added .
But he did not elaborate on where the Guantanamo prisoners would be taken , whether they would be transferred to civilian custody in the United States itself , put on trial , or released .
Redeploying troops out of Iraq or shutting down Guantanamo could be done effectively by decree using Obama 's presidential prerogatives , and the president - elect is examining a slew of " executive orders " signed by Bush .
Obama said that in Congress , his first legislative priority was getting another stimulus package passed to prop up the enfeebled economy if Democrats in the outgoing legislature fail to overcome Republican opposition .
As already shown in excerpts released by CBS , Obama said it would be a " disaster " for the government to stand by and let the cash - strapped General Motors and the auto industry in general collapse .
In line with the outcome of a summit Saturday of the world 's 20 biggest economies , the president - elect said forging new regulation of the financial markets was essential to restoring the trust of consumers .
Obama appeared unconcerned about the sea of red ink engulfing the US government 's finances , arguing that economists from left and right agreed that " we have to do whatever it takes to get this economy moving again . "
" And that we should n't worry about the deficit next year or even the year after .
That short term , the most important thing is that we avoid a deepening recession , " he said .
This video is from CBS ' 60 Minutes , broadcast Nov. 16 , 2008 .

John Riccitiello hates DRM .
That 's the rather surprising pronouncement from the Electronic Arts CEO this week - surprising not because there 's anything particularly likeable about DRM , but because of his own firm 's immense attachment to the widely disliked ( and utterly useless ) technology .
Admittedly , Riccitiello 's comments go a lot deeper than that convenient headline .
Despite the fact that he " hates " DRM , he goes on to attempt to justify it - comparing it with locks on your door or other necessary evils which we all require for security .
The comparison is utterly flawed .
Locks and keys are indeed a trade - off which we make between convenience and security , but they are designed to protect our own security - not that of the company that sold us the door .
There is a real , tangible advantage to the person being inconvenienced .
That does n't exist with DRM .
In fact , DRM is even worse .
Not only is there no advantage to the end - user - in exchange for what can be pretty shocking inconvenience , which even Riccitiello confesses is " cumbersome " .
There 's also no real advantage to the company responsible for inflicting this inconvenience , because contrary to Riccitiello 's assertion , the DRM solutions used by the industry at large do n't actually provide any meaningful protection from piracy .
The proof ?
Well , you can take the various charts and graphs presented by the companies trying to sell you DRM with which to lock up your products - almost none of whom even claim to be able to protect you past the first few days on sale , and frankly , even those claims are rather spurious .
On the other side of the balance , you can put the fact that the Bittorrent " swarms " for Spore , EA 's most recent and most controversial DRM - locked product , were among the biggest ever seen for a new videogame .
This alone makes another of Riccitiello 's assertions look a little peculiar .
He reckons that of those who kicked up a storm about Spore 's DRM - which spilled from negative Amazon reviews into the specialist press , and even into the mainstream media in a small way - " about half " were pirates .
Why , exactly , would pirates care about Spore 's DRM ?
If your intention was to pirate the game , there was a perfectly functional copy , totally unencumbered by DRM , sitting up there for you on Bittorrent - for free - on the day of launch .
No pirate , with the possible exception of the person who originally uploaded the game to the Internet , ever saw Spore 's DRM .
This is the essential , deeply uncomfortable truth about DRM which I and many , many other commentators have been banging on about for years .
No pirate on the planet gives a damn about it , because they 're happily using an unencumbered copy .
The only people who ever see DRM - the only people who ever suffer the " cumbersome " inconvenience of these deeply flawed technologies - are your legitimate , paying , long - suffering customers .
Of course , it 's not like the videogames industry stands alone in making this mistake .
The film industry has spent years putting unskippable ads on the front of its DVDs , forcing legitimate , paying customers to endure lengthy , over - wrought messages about the evils of piracy .
Had they downloaded the film from the Internet or picked up a pirate DVD , of course , they would n't have to put up with such nonsense .
The irony is harsh , and continues to fly completely over the heads of whatever clueless individuals demand the inclusion of these ridiculous ads .
The music business , too , has made a similar error .
You may recall that Sony and other companies spent ages experimenting with ways to prevent CDs from being copied onto computers - completely ignoring the fact that most people had upgraded their portable CD players to MP3 players .
Those who legitimately bought music were being punished .
Those who downloaded it from Napster ( as then was ) or other file - sharing services experienced no such restrictions .
More recently , the music business has insisted that Apple include DRM in tracks downloaded from the iTunes Music Store .
If you are a legitimate , paying consumer of music online , you are restricted in what kind of devices you can use to listen to it , where you can listen to it and , potentially , for how long you can listen to it .
Apple would n't be the first company to turn off its DRM after the business has wound down , leaving customers ' music effectively dead on their hard drives , incapable of being copied elsewhere or played on a new system .
Attempt to circumvent these restrictions , and you 're a criminal under US law ( and the law of many other countries ) .
Had you pirated the music , certainly , you'd be a criminal in the first place - but you could do what you liked with it , and it would be yours forever .
The music business , thankfully , is waking up from this blatantly idiotic state of affairs .
Increasingly , it is offering unencumbered MP3s from online stores such as Amazon 's ( and , in some cases , iTunes ) .
John Riccitiello would presumably recoil in horror at such a concept - after all , he reckons that without the protection of DRM , EA would be " in business for free " .
Yet music companies - some of them far bigger and far , far more experienced than EA - clearly disagree .
They 've recognised an essential truth which the videogames industry desperately needs to grasp .
You cannot protect media products through technological means .
In an arms race with determined pirates - many of them simply hobbyists working from their bedrooms for no reward other than kudos , and nigh - on impossible to track down - technology firms will lose every single time .
If cunning hackers can crack the protection of closed , custom - designed hardware systems like the Xbox 360 , the Wii and the PlayStation Portable , what hope does a software system running on a completely open platform like the PC have ?
There are ways to stop pirates in their tracks , but they 're all business solutions , not technical solutions .
World of Warcraft is correctly fingered by Riccitiello as a perfect example ( although he inaccurately describes it as " DRM " , which it is n't - in fact , WoW notably contains no DRM worth a damn , and you can happily copy the game client around , install it on multiple PCs , lend the discs to your friends and so on ) .
Relying on subscriptions for your income , with upfront sales being little more than padding on the numbers , is a perfect business strategy to minimise piracy - although of course , it only works for very specific types of product .
You could also try increasing the value of your retail product to make it worthwhile to buy it , rather than stealing it .
Include one - time use codes which download in - game extras , perhaps ( although they 'll get pirated too , you 're now loading the dice in your own favour - pirates will have extra hassle to access the new content , your users will get it with ease ) .
Create limited editions with genuinely worthwhile product in them , and watch your pre-orders soar .
Hell , simply engage your community and build loyalty - consumers who like your brand and find your developers personable are a lot more likely to open their wallets than those who think you 're the Evil Empire .
But before you do any of that , there 's a Step One to this reform programme .
It 's pretty damned obvious .
First , you stop selling your legitimate customers crippled , encumbered versions of your media , versions which are notably inferior to the versions they 're being offered by the pirates .
Media companies can whinge and moan about pirates until the cows come home , but the simple reality is that while your paid - for version of a product is less functional and more annoying than the free pirate version , you 're driving your customers into the welcoming arms of Bittorrent .
If we 're really going to make inroads into converting pirate downloads into retail sales , then the industry 's executives need to start thinking with those rational business heads they 're meant to have - rather than with with their impotent sense of outrage and injustice - and drop this defective , useless technology .
In an obvious attempt to seduce impressionable teenage gamers into their armed forces the Republic of Korea will begin development of their own totally badass science fiction battle uniform early next year .
In addition to a whopping 95 % increase in awesomeness , the uniforms will feature a number of other technical enhancements , including a multifunction helmet with video transmitter , GPS display and voice recognition , a backpack with command / control and friendly - or - foe identification systems , a BDU that offers protection from nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , and the laser - guided , multi-function XK11 assault rifle , which shoots both standard NATO 5.56 mm rounds and 20 mm grenades .
Did the future just get way cooler , or way scarier ?
Or both ?
We 're not sure .
But you can check that gun out yourself in the video after the break .
Even in a city where ruins are an everyday sight , it would be absurdly premature to regard Chelsea 's defeat to Roma as calamitous in the context of their Champions League ambitions this season .
Too soon altogether to talk of the London club 's decline and fall , yet undeniably lessons will require to be learned if Roman Abramovitch ’s legions are to march once again on the Eternal City for the Champions League final next May .
Whisper it among the fawning Chelsea followers but perhaps the man in need of most tutelage is Luis Felipe Scolari , hitherto a manager unable to do wrong in true blue eyes but on a wet Roman night , exposed in more senses than one .

Scolari's first tactical error came 24 hours before a ball was kicked at the Olympic Stadium .
To talk publicly of booking the same hotel for the final which Chelsea were staying in for this group match , smacked of arrogance .
If it was meant as a smooth comforter to his players that they are modern day footballing Gods of whom the likes of modest Roma could consider themselves lucky to be allowed on the same field , then it spectacularly misfired .
True , in the early stages , there had seemed such a flow to Chelsea 's football that it seemed somehow appropriate in a city through which the majestic Tiber carries all before it .
But it was to prove merely the froth on the cappuccino ; once removed , we saw a less enticing beverage .
Three goals in rapid succession shortly before and then just after half time , two by Mirko Vucinic and the other by Christian Panucci , humbled the strolling Londoners .
Roma 's sudden renaissance merely emphasised that Chelsea must learn painful lessons , principally that they have not yet left the world of mortality .
To collapse in so complete a manner against a team 17th in Serie A which had not won for five games , must surely drag even Scolari back down to reality .
Sensible men and teams with their heads at an altitude a little lower than where 747s fly , would have banished such premature thoughts from their minds , still less make them public .
Chelsea were embarrassed by their own words just as their ultimately modest and ineffective football humbled them in this famous stadium .
Deco 's dismissal capped a poor night for the joint Premiership leaders .
Nor could they offer in mitigation that this was a setback no - one could have foreseen .
Liverpool 's victory at Stamford Bridge suggested that Scolari 's intended creation remained a work in process , rather than the finished product .
Remember , too , the industry they had to demonstrate to break down struggling Roma at Stamford Bridge .
The Italians that night looked neat and determined ; all they lacked , it transpired , was a decent break .
For Chelsea apparently to so underestimate a major Italian team that was within a whisker of the Serie A title last season and still retains most of that side , represented a mistake of childish proportions .
Talking up your team is commendable , but behind closed doors is the smart place to do it .
To poke insults , intended or otherwise , at your opponents a day before an important tie , was a misguided attempt at self confidence .
Perhaps it has aided Scolari in his earlier career but in these circumstances and in what remains a highly competitive Champions League , it looked at best crass and naïve .
Somehow , you could not imagine so fundamental an error of judgement passing Sir Alex Ferguson 's lips .
The best league in the world is back .

After the past two days , I intended something light and fun to take us into the weekend , but a number of commenters raised an important point that I have not directly addressed in this discussion of Senator McCain and age : judgment .
Assessing judgment is a tougher call than health , policy positions and factual mistakes because it is more subjective , bringing together in our minds all the speeches , interviews , reactions to events and overall demeanor we have seen in candidates .
So this post is entirely subjective and I ’m curious about your own subjective responses to Senator McCain after 19 months of intense campaigning on which to base them .
Throughout the campaign , there has been a continuing undercurrent of mean - spiritedness from McCain that is worrisome .
He is frequently testy when asked a question he does n’t like .
For years , the press gave the senator a pass , rarely questioning him closely about his positions and contradictions .
Recently the press , who you and I must rely on to report the facts and ask the hard questions for us , has stepped up their criticism of McCain whose response has been to issue blistering condemnations of the press , cancel a scheduled interview with Larry King , and there is that peculiarly snarly interview with Time magazine .
This goes along with the growing number of reports about McCain ’s temper from people who have known and worked with him over the years – that he flies off the handle easily and viciously .
Not the temperament I want in a president who must deal with a world more volatile than it may ever have been .
Senator McCain ’s response to the tricky Russia / Georgia conflict was one of immediate bellicosity , and it was further disturbing to discover that one of his paid top campaign aides is , simultaneously , a paid lobbyist for Georgia leaving me wondering whose interests he supports in his campaign advisory position , that of Georgia or the U.S.
That 's not the kind of judgment I want to see perpetuated in Washington .
Finally , there is the choice of an unsuitable vice president who , among other questionable positions ( banning library books is a big one for me ) has zero experience in national and international politics .
To defend Governor Palin ’s lack of international experience , Senator McCain made this monumentally stupid statement on ABC News a couple of days ago :
GIBSON : But as you know , the questions revolve really around foreign policy experience .
Can you honestly say you feel confident having someone who has n't traveled outside the United States until last year , dealing with an insurgent Russia , with an Iran with nuclear ambitions , with an unstable Pakistan , not to mention the war on terror ?
MCCAIN : Sure .
And one of the key elements of America 's national security requirements are energy .
She understands the energy issues better than anybody I know in Washington , D.C. , and she understands .
Alaska is right next to Russia .
She understands that .
Oh , please .
How can anyone in the U.S. want a president who asks us to believe that line of thinking or who believes it himself .
There is no way to know if Senator McCain ’s general belligerence , vindictiveness and , in my opinion , pandering choice of a running mate totally unprepared to be president should there be the need , is age - related .
But combined with his age and the ongoing , overwhelming number of factual mistakes and / or memory lapses , I do n’t believe his judgment can be trusted – even if I supported his policies .
What about you ?
[ At The Elder Storytelling Place today , Elizabeth Westmark watches with compassion the decline of A Signature Woman . ]
A reader writes :
What McCain and Palin are doing now makes the Clinton campaign look tame .
It occurs to me that they are " legitimizing " putting Obama 's life in danger by pushing this nonsense .
The first potential Black President is always going to have that problem , hell Bush had people trying to take him out , I 'm sure , but this is really raising the threat level .
Saying your opponent is unfit is one thing , suggesting that he is a evil , a friend of terrorists and a danger to the United States is something else entirely .

In 2003 , Burnie Burns got together with three friends and created Red vs. Blue — an animated comedy series set in the world of first - person shooter Halo .
Nerds loved it , and within months nearly a million people were downloading each week 's free show .
Burns & Co. decided they wanted to quit their jobs and work on the series full - time .
So they figured out a way to do it : T - shirts .
Burns appropriated the comedy 's wittiest one - liners and set up an online store to sell shirts and caps .
Within months , he was filling hundreds of orders a week , generating enough revenue to pay everyone a salary .
" The shirts , " he says , " turned us from a hobby into a business . "
Burns is not alone .
Increasingly , creative types are harnessing what I 've begun to call " the T - shirt economy " — paying for bits by selling atoms .
Charging for content online is hard , often impossible .
Even 10 cents for a download of something like Red vs .
Blue might drive away the fans .
So instead of fighting this dynamic , today 's smart artists are simply adapting to it .
Their algorithm is simple : First , do n't limit your audience by insisting they pay to see your work .
Instead , let your content roam freely online , so it generates as large an audience as possible .
Then cash in on your fans ' desire to sport merchandise that declares their allegiance to you .
We 're talking about a surprisingly big market .
According to Impressions , a clothing industry trade publication , Americans spend around $ 40 billion a year on decorated apparel .
At CafePress , a Web site that lets anyone customize and sell merchandise , users sold more than $ 100 million in goods in 2007 — pocketing $ 20 million in profits — and overall sales are growing an average of 60 percent a year .
As you might expect , the T - shirt economy is a long tail phenomenon , with comparatively few people making a full - time living while millions earn only a few hundred or thousand bucks a year .
On the high revenue end , you 've got companies like BustedTees — an offshoot of the funny - video portal CollegeHumor — which , with a staff of eight , expects to clear a 20 percent profit on sales of 350,000 - plus shirts for 2008 .
In the middle are outfits like RightWingStuff , which hawks T - shirts mocking the left .
And on the far end of the tail are people like David Friedman , a New York photographer who cooks up three or four witty ideas a year — like his series of T - shirts adorned with fictional corporate logos that are blurrily " pixelated , " as if on reality TV — and makes just enough money to cover his hosting fees , plus a bit of pocket change .
Bands have relied on merch sales for years .
But today 's instant - customization technology has supercharged the T - shirt economy by dropping the cost of entry to zero .
With a Zazzle or CafePress store , you do n't need to put down any capital ; the very first sale is profitable .
This allows artists to speculate with dozens of designs until they hit on one that catches their fans ' attention .
" When you drive the risk to zero , you really open the floodgates , " says Fred Durham , cofounder of CafePress .
Of course , it 's a little ironic that artists who 've harnessed the digital world to distribute their work have to rely on semi- disposable clothing to finance it .
And the business model does n't work for everyone .
Jonathan Coulton , a musician who sells merchandise online , says he can make more money by simply forging an emotional bond with his fans so they 'll pay cash for his MP3s .
Fair enough : Charging for bits is way more profitable than charging for atoms .
But not many consumers are willing to pay for podcasts , videocasts , or blog content — and that 's where the T - shirt economy helps out .
Creators of this media do n't need to make big bucks or bleed you dry .
They 're just looking to put their shirt on your back .

All week , we ’ve been hearing about the BLOCKBUSTER story on JOHN MCCAIN and his MANY NARRATIVES in this coming Sunday ’s New York Times magazine !
It is n’t .
Although it does track nicely the attempts the campaign made to package our next president John McCain , which grew increasingly more flailing .
Its biggest flaw is that its narrative conclusion just scrapes the magazine ’s deadline — right after the final debate .
That debate was eight days ago , a lifetime in this election .
The piece ends , in fact , with McCain ’s people thinking he won the debate .
Which they did not think so much the next day , when the polls came out .
There are three things that stood out , however !
Today is the official release date for the Hungry Scientist Handbook , a new book by Patrick Buckley and Lily Binns .
The Hungry Scientist Handbook was conceived as a sort of cookbook for geek - centric food and – using the word a different way – as an a cookbook for food - oriented electronics– as evidenced by projects varying from polyhedral pies to LED lollipops .
We met Patrick and Lily at the 2006 Maker Faire , where they invited us to contribute a couple of chapters to their project .
We did , and it ’s finally out !
( We are n’t the only ones who are excited – we ’ve seen write - ups at the LA Times and
Wired this week . )
We contributed a total of nine projects to the Hungry Scientist Handbook , some of which we have written about here .
These include the Computer Chip Trivets , Crafty fridge magnets , Edible Origami , and ( making a cameo appearance ) the Lego Trebuchet .
We also contributed a few new cooking projects that involve dry ice : Dry ( Ice ) Martinis , Fizzy dry ice lemonade , and Dry ice root beer .
( With Floating bubbles on CO2 as a bonus project . )
And … a brand new exclusive Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories electronics project that we developed just for the Hungry Scientist Handbook : Smart Coasters .
Smart Coasters are cast - plastic coasters for your drink that light up red when you put a hot drink on top and light up blue with a cold drink .
The design is fully analog– no microcontrollers and no programming – and they incorporate a solar cell so that the whole thing is hermetically sealed : waterproof and washable .
Complete step - by - step DIY instructions are included for both the electronics and the resin casting .
You can purchase the Hungry Scientist Handbook at booksellers including Amazon .
Also visit their new web site , www.hungryscientist.com.
TWICE as much carbon is locked away in the frozen soils of the earth 's permafrost regions as had been thought , raising the concern that global warming will accelerate faster than expected once the soils start to thaw .
A three - year study by an international team of researchers including Pep Canadell of the CSIRO produced the new estimate , based on cores up to three metres deep taken from permafrost regions , particularly across Russia .
Dr Canadell said temperatures near the poles were predicted to rise by as much as 8 degrees by the end of the century .
" The world could experience a major melt of large tracts of permafrost in Canada , Russia , Alaska , Norway , Sweden , Finland and Greenland . "
OK , times are tough – We all know it .
Right now , you might be worrying about how to pay for groceries or the gasoline in your car , and we can use all the help you can get to stretch each and every dollar .
Luckily , I have a few friends that have plenty of tips for saving money and I asked them to send them all to me so I could assemble a list for you – the person looking to save money .
In these times , we all need to do everything we can to save money , even if it is only a little bit .
Tiny little savings here and there can really add up !

So it seems reasonable to expect the decline rate on currently producing fields shown above should be 6.7 % .
Not so .
The decline rate in the chart above seems to be much closer to 4 % .
So what 's going on here ?
There 's more below the fold .
On this basis , we estimate that the average observed decline rate worldwide is 6.7 % .
Were that rate applied to 2007 crude oil production the annual loss of output would be 4.7 mmbpd .
Chapter 10 of IEA WEO 2008 provides a detailed overview of oil field decline rates based on 798 oil fields , but mainly based upon the IHS data base .
It is written by an industry expert and provides much insight as to how decline varies between different classes of oil field .
However , when you are working on forecasting global fossil fuel supplies , in the first instance you really want to know just one number .
Namely , what is the decline rate that should be applied to current producing fields ?
Sadly , amongst all the complex detail this vital statistic seems to be missing .
Worse than that , several conflicting and ambiguous statements are made .
The press reported before IEA WEO 2008 was released , that global decline rates were higher than previously believed , priming readers for a sensational surprise .
The views of many on oil field decline rates are formed by the CERA private report published last year called : Finding the Critical Numbers .
I had a long chat with Peter Jackson ( report author ) last year about this report where the key findings were related to me .
In simple terms , CERA divide global production into three main components :
1. Fields in build up phase
2. Fields on production plateau
3 . Fields in decline phase
What CERA found was that only 41 % of production comes from fields in the decline phase , the remaining 59 % from fields in build up and on plateau .
A significant proportion of plateau production comes from OPEC super giants .
In the decline phase , rates vary from 6 % for onshore fields to 18 % for deep water offshore fields .
CERA concluded that the aggregate global decline rate was 4.5 % - and this is the magic number we are looking for in IEA WEO 2008 .
Conflicting statements
Here are some of the summary statements made in IEA WEO 2008 on decline rates :
Executive summary , page 43 :
We estimate that the average production - weighted observed decline rate worldwide is currently 6.7 % for fields that have passed their production peak .
In our Reference Scenario , this rate increases to 8.6 % in 2030 .
This statement clearly applies to post - peak fields , which following the IEA terminology includes fields on plateau ( like Ghawar ) and those in decline .
But what about fields in build up ?
Chapter 10 , page 243
On this basis , we estimate that the average observed decline rate worldwide is 6.7 % .
Were this rate to be applied to 2007 crude oil production , the annual loss of output would be 4.7 mb/d .
This statement is more ambiguous , applying 6.7 % to the whole stack of current production .
And then in Chapter 11 , page 255 we have this :
The overall average annual fall in output at existing fields is proportionately much smaller in OPEC countries , at 3.3 % , than in non-OPEC countries , where it is 4.7 % , reflecting the fact that most OPEC fields are onshore .
Surprisingly , and very frustratingly the average for OPEC and non-OPEC " average annual fall " is not given .
However , weighting these figures for 2007 production ( OPEC = 31.1 mmbpd and non-OPEC = 39.1 mmbpd , Table 11.1 page 251 ) gives an aggregate " average annual fall " = 4.08 % .
Is this the magic number we are looking for ?
If it is then it is lower and not higher than the CERA figure .
Chart analysis
Using Mac OSX
Preview grab , we inserted the IEA production model into an XL chart , extracted the data by hand from which this clone is made .
Exponential decline rates were then variably applied to the " current producing " stack to try and replicate the IEA chart .
It was not possible to get a perfect fit , but the best approximation was for an exponential decline rate of 4.05 % , which is essentially the same as the 4.08 % figure discussed above .
Using a decline rate of 6.7 % provides a much more sobering picture of future liquid fuel supplies , especially considering that the natural gas liquid , discovered undeveloped and yet to find components all appear to be rather optimistic .
A least squares fit of the IEA decline data extracted from their chart suggests that a decline rate value of 4.35 % may in fact have been used .
In which case their analysis has reached the exact same conclusion as CERA .
Conclusion
The IEA are to be applauded for conducting and reporting a detailed analysis of global oil field decline rates .
This is truly vital data for understanding and predicting the future course of global energy supplies upon which the future of Mankind is based .
No doubt the mainstream media , international policy makers and politicians will be suitably impressed by the rigor and detail contained in this report , that they do not understand .
As far as we can establish , the IEA analysis shows that global decline rates are actually lower or the same as those reported by CERA last year .
We have sent two emails to Dr Birol requesting clarification on the points raised in this report and are awaiting his reply .
The key information required is this :
What % of current production comes from fields in production build up phase and what decline rate ( presumably negative decline ) is applicable to that production increment ?
What % of current production comes from fields in the post peak / plateau / decline phase and what is the weighted average decline rate applicable to that production increment ?
How have these variables evolved in the past , and how are they set to evolve in future ?
In recent weeks some prominent conservative intellectuals seem to have discovered they have two hands after all .
In column after column , these writers have alternately praised the virtues of John McCain and Sarah Palin and lamented their shortcomings .
The syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker , for example , wrote in National Review on Sept. 26 that Governor Palin is “ clearly out of her league ” and should bow out of the campaign .
( The conservative biweekly chose not to run a subsequent column in which Ms. Parker offered advice to Senator Barack Obama on how to win votes in Appalachia . )
On Oct. 4 , one of the most influential conservative pundits , the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer , rapped Senator McCain for his “ frenetic improvisation ” and , in what some interpreted as an endorsement of Senator Obama , praised his “ first - class intellect and a first - class temperament , ” adding that these strengths “ will likely be enough to make him president . ”
This came after another conservative beacon , George F. Will , compared the “ Palin bubble ” to the irrational exuberance of the deflated high - tech and housing bubbles and said Senator McCain was “ behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high ” in the way he responded to the financial crisis .
He all but pronounced the Republican ticket finished after the final presidential debate last Wednesday night .

There wo n’t be any balloons dropping from the ceiling to mark this milestone .
And if there are any bells and whistles , it will only be from the metal detector .
The American Civil Liberties Union held a news conference this morning to commemorate what it says is the addition of the millionth name to the nation ’s terrorist watch list .
The number is a calculation based on a 2007 Justice Department inspector general report , which said the database had 700,000 records and was growing by an average of 20,000 a month .
Since then , the ACLU has dutifully kept a tally on its Web site .
The event and the counter are mostly symbolic -- a theatrical way for the ACLU to call attention to " bloated watch lists " that have caused traveling trouble for Nelson Mandela , Sen .
Ted Kennedy , federal air marshals and lots of people named Robert Johnson .
“ Members of Congress , nuns , war heroes and other ‘ suspicious characters , ’ with names like Robert Johnson and Gary Smith , have become trapped in the Kafkaesque clutches of this list , with little hope of escape , ” Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , said in a statement .
But are there really a million people on the terrorist watch list ?
“ No , ” says Chad Kolton , spokesman for the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center , which manages the list .
There are only 400,000 on it , and 95 percent are not U.S. “ persons . ”
( Persons = citizens plus others with a legal right to be in the U.S. )
The “ million ” number refers to records .
The difference is a result of listing several different aliases or spellings for a suspected terrorist .
“ That is not the same as 1 million names or 1 million individuals , ” Mr. Kolton said .
“ It ’s a little bit frustrating because I feel like they are getting away with muddying up the terms . ”
The ACLU ’s focus on the number clouds the success of the program , he added .
Screening and law enforcement agencies encountered the actual people on the watch list ( not false matches ) more than 53,000 times from December 2003 to May 2007 , according to a Government Accountability Office report last fall .
“ The watch list has enhanced the U.S. government ’s counterterrorism efforts by ( 1 ) helping frontline screening agencies obtain information to determine the level of threat a person poses and the appropriate action to take , if any , and ( 2 ) providing the opportunity to collect and share information on known or appropriately suspected terrorists with law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community , ” the auditors wrote .
The addition of 20,000 names a month is a sign of increased military and intelligence efforts in the Middle East and Southeast Asia in the past few years , Mr. Kolton said .
He noted that with 6.7 billion people in the world , “ the small fraction of a fraction that are involved in terrorist activities still yield very large numbers . ”
Still , 400,000 names .
That ’s one terrorist for every 16,775 people in the world .
That large net ensnares many innocent travelers , leading to an erosion of civil liberties , the ACLU argues .
People flagged by the watch list have reported having to go through extra screening or having to answer numerous questions to prove they are who they say they are .
Others have been prevented from getting on planes .
Akif Rahman , a computer consultant who spoke at the press conference , said he has been repeatedly detained at airports and border crossings when trying to re-enter the country , according to a copy of his comments provided by the ACLU .
Once , after visiting relatives in Canada , “ I was detained for more than five hours – extensively questioned , physically manhandled by a federal officer and shackled to a chair , ” he said .
“ I was afraid , angry and humiliated .
I simply could not believe this – I was born a U.S. citizen , simply re-entering my own country . ”
The FBI and the Transportation Security Administration , which handles security at airport checkpoints , say they recognize passengers ’ frustration and are doing what they can to stem false hits .
Frequently - stopped passengers who want to clear up the confusion about their identity can log on to a Department of Homeland Security Web site , where they can provide more information about themselves .
In addition , after three false matches , the Terrorist Screening Center checks the record in the watch list to see if the information is correct , if there ’s any new information and if the person needs to be on the list at all , Mr. Kolton said .

Write Cocoa apps in Javascript !
JSCocoa bridges Cocoa to JavascriptCore ( WebKit 's JS engine ) .
It allows you to call C code , ObjC code , use C structs , and build Javascript classes inheriting from ObjC classes .
2010 03 22 Unicode names for classes and selectors I guess JSCocoa is really fully unicode now !
This only works well on the JSCocoa side , as on the ObjC side you 'll have to get the class with objc_getClass ( [ @ " ファイナン ス " UTF8String ] ) .
I can't get it to call selectors yet .
Still looks nice though !
2009 12 12 Catch ObjC exceptions in Javascript Following Rentzsch 's post about how JSCocoa was broken , you can now catch ObjC exceptions in Javascript .
try { var outOfRangeObject = [ [ NSArray arrayWithObjects :@ " a " , @ " b " , nil ] objectAtIndex : - 1 ] } catch(e ) { // Prints NSRangeException log( e.name ) } JSCocoa also had a 32 bit bug when converting a number to an unsigned int , yielding 0 when converting - 1 .
This is fixed .
2009 10 03 Objective - J syntax Trailing Objective - J and JSTalk , JSCocoa has a brand new way to call ObjC methods .
This syntax works just like Objective - C , but in Javascript : // Standard Javascript way NSApplication.sharedApplication.delegate = myDelegate // ObjJ way [ [ NSApplication sharedApplication ] setDelegate : myDelegate ] //
Mixed way [ NSApplication sharedApplication ] .
delegate = myDelegate // Multi param call var url = [ NSURL instanceFileURLWithPath:@ " /tmp " is Directory : true ] // Create a Javascript array containing an NSURL var array = [ [ NSURL instanceFileURLWithPath:@" /tmp " is Directory : true ] ]
This new syntax is done thanks to JSLint .
Because of this , your code needs to conform to JSLint standards — if it does n't , it wo n't run .
You can disable JSLint ( not recommended ) with [ yourJSCocoa setUseJSLint : NO ] .
Here 's some colored code with lintex :
2009 09 22 Explore the Cocoa runtime List loaded classes , protocols , frameworks with these : JSCocoa.classes list all Cocoa classes
list all Cocoa classes JSCocoa.protocols all protocols
all protocols JSCocoa.imageNames all loaded frameworks
List class data with these : MyClass .__subclasses a list of all classes inheriting from MyClass .
Use MyClass.__subclassTree for a human readable version
a list of all classes inheriting from .
Use for a human readable version MyClass.__classImage name of framework defining the class
name of framework defining the class MyClass.__derivationPath list superclasses
list superclasses MyClass.__methods , MyClass.__ivars , MyClass.__properties , MyClass .__protocols pretty much everything you wanted to know about a class !
These methods list all data from a class and from its superclasses .
To get only this class ' data , use the own - prefixed methods : MyClass.__ownMethods lists only methods defined by MyClass .
Looking for methods // Find all NSArray methods starting with ' init ' log ( NSArray.__methods.filter(function ( method ) { return method.name.match(/^init/ ) } ) ) //
Same code , but only print method name log ( NSArray.__methods.filter(function ( method ) { return method.name.match(/^init/ ) }).map(function(o) {return o.name} ) ) //
Find NSObject methods defined in the AppKit framework log ( NSObject.__methods.filter(function ( method ) { return method.framework.match(/AppKit/) } ) )

The new JSTalk website JSTalk is a way to script applications in Javascript .
It 's built on top of JSCocoa .
Give it a try !
2009 09 06 Use JSCocoa in place of the existing WebKit bridge The WebKit bridge ( isSelectorExcludedFromWebScript , isKeyExcludedFromWebScript , ... ) lets you call ObjC methods from Javascript .
It gets the job done , but has a few limitations : it does n't bridge hashes and does n't let you use structures .
By using initWithGlobalContext , JSCocoa can now be used inside a WebView in place of the WebKit bridge .
This is the full JSCocoa monty in a webpage , with a small difference : there 's a global OSX object to retrieve objects .
//
This is JSCocoa called from inside a WebView ! var objCDate = OSX.NSDate.alloc.init var point = new OSX . NSPoint ( 123 , 456 ) var delegate = OSX.NSApplication.sharedApplication.delegate var array = delegate.testArray ( [ ' hello ' , ' world ' , [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] , 'end ' ] )
Restricting access
To prevent the webpage from calling certain methods , use JSCocoa 's delegate methods .
canGetGlobalProperty , canGetProperty , canCallFunction , canCallMethod will let you write anything from toll free passage to full lockdown .
Check out JSCocoa / WebView sample code , by Fabien Franzen .
2009 09 06 x86_64 , 64 bit support JSCocoa can now be used in 64 bit applications .
Your code should mostly remain intact except for methods dealing with pointers :
In 64 bit , CGFloat is now a double , so CGPoint , CGRect , NSColor all use doubles .
Therefore when using methods like NSColor.
getRed :( CGFloat *) red green :( CGFloat *) green blue :( CGFloat *) blue alpha:( CGFloat *) alpha or NSBezierPath.elementAtIndex:( NSInteger) index associatedPoints :( NSPointArray ) points , make sure to allocate doubles , not floats .
Call JSCocoa.runningArchitecture to know what you 're running on .
JSCocoa runs on x86_64 , i386 , PPC , iPhone and iPhone simulator .
2009 09 01 libffi-iphone
This is under - the - hood stuff libffi allows calling any C- function or ObjC method at runtime .
libffi-iphone is a stripped down version of libffi , tailored just for the iPhone .
libffi-iphone includes source code for both the iPhone simulator and the iPhone itself .
JSCocoa uses libffi-iphone internally .
You may need it if you 're porting a scripting language to the iPhone .
2009 09 01 JSCocoa works on the iPhone !
You can now use JSCocoa both on the iPhone and on the Mac. JSCocoa will give you runtime access to ObjC objects and let you call any method of any class .
There are a few differences when creating your own ObjC classes in Javascript and when calling C functions , but you can work around these easily .
the iPhone has no BridgeSupport files
On the Mac , structures , enums , C functions can be used thanks to BridgeSupport files describing them : NSPoint , kCFAllocatorDefault , NSMakeRectRect are read by JSCocoa and made available in the Javascript context .
On the iPhone , BridgeSupport files do not exist .
You can still use structures , enums , C functions but they must be described in your own BridgeSupport file .
On the Mac , structures , enums , C functions can be used thanks to BridgeSupport files describing them : , , are read by JSCocoa and made available in the Javascript context .
On the iPhone , BridgeSupport files do not exist .
You can still use structures , enums , C functions but they must be described in your own BridgeSupport file .
the iPhone has no mprotect
To create a new ObjC class in Javascript , JSCocoa must create a new ObjC method for each method your overload .
These methods are stored in a static pool , but they can be reused by any number of methods at runtime .
Check out the iPhone sample on Github .
JSCocoa works on the iPhone thanks to Philippe Charrière , Tim Burks , Jay Freeman , and Gary Hayenga .
Thank you guys !
2009 08 11 Safe dealloc
You can now safely overload dealloc in your classes .
This was previously disabled as objects are deallocated when JavascriptCore triggers Garbage Collection , forbidding any script execution at collect time .
To work around that , JSCocoa releases objects on the next run loop cycle , which calls dealloc at a safe time .
This means any binding , notification request made can now be dismissed in dealloc , just like standard ObjC code . //
A class whose targetValue will be bound with Cocoa Bindings class BindingsTarget < NSObject { //
Dealloc will be called in the next run loop cycle right after JavascriptCore GC - ( void ) dealloc { this.unbind (' targetValue ' ) } //
Declare a targetValue key Key targetValue } // Instantiate and bind to a source value var target = BindingsTarget.instance ( ) target.bind_toObject_withKeyPath_options('targetValue ' , source , ' sourceValue ' , null )
2009 08 09 Manipulate WebViews with JSCocoa
The WebKit bridge allows you to insert your own objects into a web page .
JSCocoa now has a reverse bridge of its own , which allows you to manipulate a WebView 's document .
You can therefore load a web page then query it with code like log( window.document.body.innerHTML ) .
This is done with WebFrame 's globalContext .
// Register a load delegate var loadDelegate = WebViewLoadDelegate.instance ( ) view.frameLoadDelegate = loadDelegate // Load a web page webView.mainFrameURL = ' http://google.com'
//
Delegate class class WebViewLoadDelegate < NSObject { //
WebKit will call this method upon page load completion - ( void ) webView : ( WebView *) sender didFinishLoadForFrame : ( WebFrame *) frame { // Global context is frame 's window object var window = sender.mainFrame.globalContext //
Change the background color of an element window.document.getElementById('someElement').style.backgroundColor = ' lime ' //
Call a Javascript method defined in the page window.callSomeJavascriptMethod(' hello ' , 8 ) } }
2009 08 07 JSCocoaLoader allows you to create Espresso actions in Javascript using JSCocoa .
Also check out Narwhal - jsc , a JSCocoa loader for Narwhal ( server side Javascript ) .
Both of them are open source on GitHub .
2009 04 11 Swizzle !
JSCocoa now lets you swizzle methods : class NSButton { //
Swizzle an instance method of an existing class Swizzle - ( void ) drawRect : ( NSRect ) rect { //
Draw something behind the button ... //
Call original swizzled method , this will call NSButton 's drawRect : this .
Original ( arguments ) // Draw something in front of the button NSBezierPath.bezierPathWithOvalInRect( rect ) . stroke } } swizzling is replacing a method 's implementation with our own .
This example swizzles NSButton 's drawRect : with a Javascript function : each time a button must be drawn , the ObjC runtime will call this Javascript function .
If you want to modify the behaviour of existing classes without deriving , swizzling is the way to go !
Thanks to JRSwizzle for the code .
Add Swizzle in front of a method definition to swizzle it .
To call the original method , call this .
Original ( arguments ) .
2009 03 27 Introducing JSTalk , an alternative to AppleScript .
Gus Mueller has released the first version of JSTalk , a way to make your application scriptable in Javascript .
It also supports an Objective - C syntax .
// JSTalk - enable your application [ JSTalk listen ] ; //
From the JSTalk editor you can then script it in Javascript var sketch = JSTalk.application ( " Sketch " ) ; var doc = sketch.orderedDocuments ( ) [ 0 ] ; var rectangle = doc.makeNewBox ( ) ; rectangle.setWidth( 100 ) ; rectangle.setHeight( 100 ) ; //
Or use an ObjC syntax var bezierPath = [ NSBezierPath bezierPath ] ; [ bezierPath curveToPoint:pointA controlPoint1:pointB controlPoint2:pointC ] ; [ bezierPath fill ] ; Get JSTalk from Github !
2009 03 10 Use delegate methods to customize JSCocoa behaviour .
//
Check if getting property is allowed - ( BOOL ) JSCocoa :( JSCocoaController *) controller canGetProperty :( NSString*) propertyName of Object :( id ) object inContext : ( JSContextRef)ctx exception :( JSValueRef *) exception ; // Custom handler for getting properties // Return a custom JSValueRef to bypass JSCocoa // Return NULL to let JSCocoa handle getProperty // Return JSValueMakeNull ( ) to return a Javascript null - ( JSValueRef ) JSCocoa :( JSCocoaController *) controller getProperty :( NSString*) propertyName of Object :( id ) object inContext :( JSContextRef)ctx exception : ( JSValueRef * ) exception ;
These methods allow you to restrict access or customize behaviour .
If you want to use JSCocoa as a plugin engine , implement canCallMethod to restrict method call , or canGetProperty and canSetProperty to restrict properties access .
canGetGlobalProperty restricts access to ObjC classes , functions , structs and enums .
After restricting access with the can * methods , you can use getProperty , setProperty , callMethod to bypass JSCocoa and implement custom behaviour to return custom values to Javascript .
canLoadJSFile , canEvaluateScript restrict script loading .
willEvaluateScript gives you a change to transform the input script before evaluation : use it to implement a custom syntax or expand your own macros .
2009 02 18 New class syntax inspired from Cappucino //
Define a new class class MyClass < NSObject { // instance method - ( int ) addX : ( int ) x and Y :( int ) y { return x + y } // class method + ( float ) addFloatX : ( float ) x and FloatY : ( float ) y { return x + y } // Interface Builder outlet IBOutlet outlet1 // Interface Builder outlet using a Javacript notification IBOutlet outlet2 ( newValue ) { log ( ' new value of outlet2 = ' + newValue ) } //
Interface Builder action , using sender as default parameter IBAction clickMe { log (' Button clicked= ' + sender ) } // Interface Builder action , using custom parameter name IBAction clickMeToo ( notifier ) { log (' Button clicked= ' + notifier ) } }
There 's some limitations on parameters ( right now it 's classes , structs , raw int / char / float ) but these should go away in the future .
2009 02 18 JSLocalizedString defers localization to Javascript functions .
2009 02 13 Using Pointers JSCocoa can now handle pointers and memory buffers .
// Functions like NSOpenGLGetVersion ( int* , int* ) expect two pointers to int // JSCocoa detects pointer types and auto allocs required size var major = new outArgument var minor = new outArgument NSOpenGLGetVersion ( major , minor ) log(' OpenGL version : ' + major + '.' + minor ) // Using with structures var rect = new NSRect ( 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ) var rect1 = new outArgument var rect2 = new outArgument NSDivideRect ( rect , rect1 , rect2 , 5 , NSMinXEdge ) log (' Divided rect1= ' + rect1 ) //
Using with ObjC methods : scanning a string with NSScanner var scanner = NSScanner.scannerWithString ( ' 4.56 123 ' ) var extracted Float = new outArgument scanner.scanFloat( extractedFloat ) log ( ' extracted= ' + extractedFloat ) // //
Memory buffers : manually allocating memory and using it as data source or sink // // Data source : copy color components into our buffer // Allocate room for 4 floats var buffer = new memory Buffer ( ' ffff ' ) //
Extract components of a NSColor into our buffer color. get ( { red : new outArgument ( buffer , 0 ) , green : new outArgument ( buffer , 1 ) , blue : new outArgument ( buffer , 2 ) , alpha : new outArgument ( buffer , 3 ) } ) log (' Extracted red= ' + buffer [ 0 ] ) //
Data sink : copy point coordinates into a NSBezierPath element // Allocate room for 3 points var buffer = new memory Buffer ( ' ffffff ' ) //
Set new point values buffer [ 0 ] = 10.0 buffer [ 1 ] = 5.0 ... ... //
Fill a NSBezierPath element with our new coordinates path.setAssociatedPoints_atIndex ( buffer , 1 ) Under the hood , JSCocoaOutArgument and JSCocoaMemory Buffer handle all this .
2009 02 04 Write Cocoa plugins in almost anything Want more than Javascript ?
Grayson Hansard wrote PluginManager , a project that enables you to write Cocoa plugins in AppleScript , F - Script , Javascript , Lua , Nu , Python and Ruby .
" PluginManager is a series of classes that provides support for a vast number of scripting languages as well as standard Cocoa bundles .
It is designed based on AddressBook 's applescript plugin support but can be used in a wide number of ways .
If nothing else , this project should provide an example into calling of scripts that you can adapt to your own applications . "
2009 01 17 iPhone libffi
Here 's a better way than prederivation : Tim Burks advocates a pool of reconfigurable handlers .
These handlers can be shared about amongst classes : first , gather the method type encodings from the classes ' methods then generate Javascript callbacks from them .
Great strategy !
2009 01 16 Elysium , a midi sequencer , uses JSCocoa for scripting .
Check it out !
2009 01 15 iPhone JSCocoa now compiles on the iPhone , thanks to the Nu language 's libffi .
It crashes because it can't create Javascript methods callable by ObjC. ( mprotect ing the closure for libffi fails ) .
Looks like there are 3 possibilities : Create an iPhone app and classes in ObjC then use JSCocoa to script these classes
Create dummy derived classes with dummy methods each calling their Javascript counterpart
Somehow make mprotect work
Any other ideas ?

2009 01 12 Multiple interpreters support JSCocoa can now create multiple versions of itself , each independant — just like each page in Safari has its interpreter .
A document application can host one instance of JSCocoa in each document , each having its own variables separate from the others .
2009 01 10 Gus Mueller on JSCocoa and Acorn Plugins in JavaScript
2009 01 08 JSCocoa moves to Github Fork , branch , push and pull away !
I love Git , it 's really a " what 's changed " manager for directories used as source control .
Files referenced once will exist only once , files moved will keep refering to the same object , and it 's easy to use :
git add .
to add the current directory ,
git commit - a -m " new version ! " ; git push to send the new version to Github .
You can tag releases , easily branch from them , all of that locally !
If you do n't know git it 's worth to spend time to learn how it works .
From Github you can fork JSCocoa and the fork queue will show branches and I 'll be able to incorporate your changes back in JSCocoa .

Just like in Ruby , call functions with or without parentheses .
object .a( ) .b( ).c( ) becomes object.a.b.c
Alas , if ( a.b.c ) wo n't work — use if ( a.b. c ( ) ) until toBoolean ( ) arrives
Cocoa NSString * appName = [ [ [ NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace ] activeApplication ] valueForKey : @" NSApplicationName " ] ;
JSCocoa var appName = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace.activeApplication.NSApplicationName
Instance
Tired of the alloc / init dance ?
Use instance to get an object allocated , inited , and retained by Javascript 's Garbage Collector
Cocoa [ [ NSButton alloc ] initWithFrame : NSMakeRect ( 0 , 0 , 100 , 40 ) ] ;
Need to [ release ] when done
JSCocoa NSButton.alloc.initWithFrame( NSMakeRect(0 , 0 , 100 , 40 ) )
Need to release ( ) when done
NSButton.instance ( { withFrame : NSMakeRect(0 , 0 , 100 , 40 ) } )
Handled by Javascript's GC
Get /Set
Instead of calling setVariable ( newValue ) , use Javascript 's setter syntax : object.variable = newValue
Cocoa NSString * title = [ window title ] ;
[ window setTitle : @" Hello ! " ] ;
JSCocoa var title = window.
title
window.title = ' Hello !'
Call
Use a jQuery - like syntax to call multiple parameter methods
Cocoa [ obj callWithParam1:@" Hello " and Param2 : " World " ] ;
JSCocoa obj.call( { withParam1 :' Hello ' , and Param2 :' World ' })
obj [ 'callWithParam1:andParam2 :'] ( ' Hello ' , ' World ' )
obj.callWithParam1_andParam2(' Hello ' , ' World ' )
Fully Unicode
Name your variables in your native language !
JSCocoa function 追加す る( 最初の , 次の ) { return 最初の + 次の }
var 結果 = 追加する ( ' こんにちは ' , '世界 ' )
NSApplication.sharedApplication.keyWindow.title = 結果
Derive
A hash will define classes in one go , but you can add methods anytime after
Cocoa
In .h @interface MyButton : NSButton { IBOutlet NSButton * myOutlet ; } - ( IBAction ) myAction : ( id ) sender ; @end In .m @implementation MyButton - ( IBAction ) myAction : ( id ) sender { ... } @end
JSCocoa defineClass (' MyButton < NSButton ' , { myOutlet : ' IBOutlet ' , myAction : [ ' IBAction ' , function ( sender ) { ... } ] })
Shorthand Overload
A quick way to overload methods : define a new class , use NSClass [ method ] = fn to overload methods like drawRect :
To call the parent method , one single syntax : this .
Super( arguments ) — no need to rewrite the method name !
JSCocoa MyButtonClass [ ' drawRect :'] = function ( rect ) { // super call this .
Super ( arguments ) //
Add some custom drawing ... }
Integrate in Interface Builder
There 's a catch here !
JSCocoa works with NIBs , but you 'll need to manually add IBOutlet s and IBAction s while creating your interface .
If you 've ever wondered why there are + and - buttons in the Identity Inspector , wonder no more ! :)

Comment Another huge heaving grunt of a move as Microsoft shifts its great fat rear to sit more comfortably on the changing furniture of the computing industry and offer cloud computing services .
It could be very bad news indeed for the storage industry .
Microsoft's Azure Services Platform - ASP as in ' we 've been here before , surely ' - lets customers have their data centre applications run in Microsoft data centres .
Ray Ozzie , Microsoft 's chief software architect , said he was building an infrastructure for the next fifty years : " We need to lay the groundwork with new types of system and storage applications for a world of parallel computing . "
Microsoft joins Amazon and Google in offering cloud computing services and cites IDC , which says cloud computing will grow 16 per cent a year through to 2012 .
That 's grim .
The thing is that cloud computing users buy less storage .
Think about it .
If Microsoft gets 10,000 customers for its remote data centre services then Microsoft buys servers and storage for the 10,000 , while the 10,000 do n't buy servers and storage for their apps that now live in the Redmond cloud .
Let 's suppose that Amazon , Google and Microsoft get 250,000 customers each .
That 's 750,000 businesses not buying servers and storage for their remotely run apps .
Add in Dell , HP and IBM - they 're just bound to pile in - and we could have six major cloud computing suppliers with half a million customers each by 2012 , meaning 3 million fewer customers directly buying servers and storage for their apps , because they 've been transferred to the Cloud .
Cloud computing means fewer and larger storage buyers .
The server industry has already savagely consolidated .
The storage industry has yet to do so .
Judged from a server industry point of view the storage industry is ridiculously over - supplied .
Let 's list the tier one and two storage array suppliers - Dell , EMC , HP , HDS , IBM , and NetApp , then 3PAR , Compellent , Pillar and Sun .
We can add in tier 3 suppliers ( NEC , OnStor , Infortrend etc ) and the virtual tape library ( Overland , Quantum etc ) , de-duplication ( Data Domain ) and reference data ( Copan , Nexsan ) people and say there are getting on for twenty storage array suppliers .
Fewer buyers of storage who buy in larger numbers will encourage storage industry consolidation .
Count the number of backup software suppliers - there are far too many .
Every customer who moves over to the cloud will stop buying data centre storage hardware and software .
They wo n't purchase arrays to store the data they do n't hold any more , or business continuity and disaster recovery software to shift to backup data centres they no longer have , backup software , backup reporting software , security software for files they no longer need to protect , replication software for the data they no longer need to replicate ... you get the picture .
What has happened in the disk drive industry , in the disk array subsystem market and in the tape automation market - meaning supplier consolidation into fewer and fewer hands - will happen in the drive array and drive array - based software areas .
A mass take - up of cloud computing will be a disaster for the storage industry as we know it .
Unless you are guaranteed a place as a supplier to successful cloud computing service providers then you should start praying it all flops .
Clouds rain , they bring thunder and lightning , hurricanes even .
News that cloud computing is set to grow is bad news for the storage industry , bad news indeed . ®

Audio : On Outsourcing , The Economy and the US
If you ’ve missed the economic disaster that ’s gripped the world over the last few months , you ’re probably capable of forgetting to breathe .
Then again , if you ’ve been following the free fall of the US stock market you ’ve probably stopped breathing all together .
The economy is on everyone ’s mind and a popular blogging subject .
As such , I was a little hesitant to write on it .
However , I ’ve yet to see anyone discuss the big picture and very few American news outlets are taking a realistic look at what ’s really going on .
The Global Environment
Simply put , you ca n’t understand the economy until you understand recent world history .
The collapse of the USSR in 1990 set off a series of dramatic changes .
With the death of the Soviet Union the US lost its major competitor and the world saw one of its largest and most powerful economies vanish .
This provided a fantastic opportunity for the US to solidify its presence on the global stage .
In 1993 the European Union was formed and began to fill the void that the USSR ’s collapse had created .
By 1999 the Euro was introduced and by 2002 most of the member countries had switched to it as their exclusive currency .
As intended , the EU and its currency created a new world economic superpower able to face off with and stand side - by - side with the US dollar .
Meanwhile , the widespread adoption of the internet , and decreases in the cost of shipping / phone communication and the like made it economically beneficial to outsource to places like India and China .
Russia ’s collapse offered a valuable opportunity for China .
By devaluing their currency China was able to establish and maintain itself as one of the world ’s greatest exporters – fueling an industrial revolution unlike any the world had seen for over 40 years .
With a wealth of natural resources , nearly endless population , and government able to undertake massive / risky projects , China catapulted itself onto the world stage .
By the late ’90s China had truly come into its own as an economic power .
A fourth historical factor essential to an understanding of the current economic crisis is the concept of world currency .
In 1945 international currencies were pegged to the US dollar which helped secure US dominance and established the dollar as the world currency .
With the collapse of the gold standard in 1971 most of the world currencies were un-pegged from the dollar .
Despite this , most international transactions were still carried out in dollars due to our position as the world ’s economic superpower .
The Power of Currency
As the dollar has been the world ’s unofficial currency , the United States has been able to operate as the central economic node through which most international business is carried out .
This poured money into the US and helped fuel our economy .
The difficult trade off is that it also provided for a strong dollar which slowly made a lot of our industry unprofitable .
As a result , our exports began to drop and our imports began to rise .
A brutal and difficult transition .
These decreases were , however , balanced by the thriving tech industry in the US .
Our creativity , drive and forward - reaching thought provided the internet and new technologies which we were able to export and sell while re-tooling our economy to the early stages of the next wave :
The digital revolution which replaced the industrial revolution .
As our exports continued to diminish , outsourcing thrived and the debate – which had picked up steam in the early 2000s – eventually came to a head around the time of the last presidential election .
Outsourcing became a dirty word , unpatriotic and an affront to the American public .
The administration decided something needed to be done to bring American manufacturing jobs back to the US and by George they did it .
They began a series of actions which resulted in the gradual suppression of the US dollar .
A practice which is similar to what China has done to keep the value of their currency low and exports high .
The idea was to de-value the dollar to increase the price of imported goods while creating incentives to fuel American industry .
Ironically , this has worked .
Companies like Toyota , BMW and others have opened a number of plants in the US over the last year and a half , and industry has poured back into the US .
Unfortunately , not as fast as necessary .
There are a few catches .
Our standard of life has been based on living in a post - industrial nation .
Our consumption rates , wages , etc. are all vastly different than those of the factory worker who fueled America ’s 2nd industrial revolution and exponentially different than those of the Indian and Chinese workers fueling their country ’s current industrial revolutions .
Technology and automation have drastically changed the way manufacturing and assembly jobs are executed , streamlining the process and reducing the demand for manpower .
Unhappily , both of these factors pale in comparison to the real catch .
Our role in the global economy .
Unlike China , Japan , India , Mexico or any other foreign nation , the US is not truly an independent currency .
As the de -facto world currency , the US dollar is the central quay to which all of the world ’s other currencies are tied .
When we began artificially deflating our currency we began destabilizing the world economy .
Instead of offering a quay that the world economies could tie to , we quickly became a lead weight pulling them down .
We ca n’t have it both ways .
We ca n’t be the world ’s economic super power / global currency of choice AND at the same time be de-valuing our dollar to drive up exports .
This process began destabilizing the world economies and has , in my opinion , resulted in a lot of the credit and economic issues we ’re currently facing .
It also helps explain why the US is suffering , but stock markets around the world are in equally – if not worse – shape .
The Stock Market & Housing
The common perception and discussion within the US paints the current stock market turmoil and economic trouble as being largely limited to / caused by the US .
While it ’s obviously hitting us hard and in many ways started with US , it ’s not only a US problem .
Further , the political dialogue has attempted to imply that the difficulties essentially stem from legislation established to put poor people in houses .
Poor people who are now defaulting on their loans and going into foreclosure .
While this is , in part , true , it ’s a small portion / side effect of the real issue .
It ’s not the somewhat limited cross section of lower income Americans who were able to realize the American dream by purchasing a home that created the housing bubble .
In reality it is the fault of middle and upper class Americans who took out home equity loans and ARM loans to purchase 2nd and 3rd properties .
Properties which were purchased as investments in the rush to cash - in on the soaring real estate market .
These were properties purchased with the expectation that they could be re-sold for profit in months or at the most a few years – all this to be done before the ARM ’s interest rate kicked in and the price skyrocketed .
These are the individuals who threw the dice and took a gamble every bit as risky as any stock market investment … and lost .
These are the individuals , many of whom are now faced with paying 2 or 3 mortgages in this bad economy who stand to lose both their speculative investment and their primary home .
Many in the the middle class made the mistake .
They jumped on the bandwagon and now we ’re paying the price .
Back to Currency
I talked earlier about how suppressing the dollar does n’t make sense / work .
Consider that since July the Dollar has turned around its downward march and rebounded forcefully .
To illustrate this point , consider the gains made by the dollar against the following international currencies :
July : 1.04 October : 1.44 – Australian dollars 28 %
July : .63 October : .73 – Euros 16 %
July : .50 October : .57 – British Pound 14 %
July : 1048 October : 1390 – South Korea Won 33 %
July : 79 October : 110 – Icelandic Krona 39 %
July : 1.49 October : 1.79 – Fijian Dollar 20 %
July : 10 October : 12 – Mexican Peso 20 %
July : 1.59 October : 2.36 – Brazilian Real 48 %
July : 1.01 October : 1.12 – Canadian Dollar 11 %
July : 516 October : 611 – Chilean Peso 18 %
July : 1924 October : 2281 – Colombian Peso 19 %
July : 149 October : 187 – Hungarian Florin 26 %
July : 1.31 October : 1.67 – New Zealand Dollar 27 %
July : 5.07 October : 6.12 – Norwegian Kroner 21 %

So , the question begs – what ’s the macro message we should take away from this ?
In the modern global economy nothing is quite what it seams .
For my part , I ’ll be watching the international markets every bit as closely as I watch the markets here in the states .
As always , I value your thoughts and feedback !
Please , keep in mind that these thoughts are a summary of my observations and nothing more .
I ’m not an economist – only a curious mind trying to make sense of things .
You are here : Home / Cool Stories / The 5 Reasons Luke Skywalker Is a Complete Idiot
We all know Luke Skywalker as the main protagonist throughout the original Star Wars movies and onward into the novels of questionable quality .
We all grew up wanting to be himâ € ” learning to use the Force , blowing up the Death Star , saving the galaxy .
But the thing is , despite all his badass moments , he actually kind of sucks .
Perhaps not as much as his father Anakin , but that could be due to Mark Hamillâ €™s acting ability , in that he can act .
Sure with the emotional music and all the screen time Luke Skywalker seems to be the hero , but really heâ€™s an idiot who makes bad decisions and has a series of terrible ideas , and he ’s lucky it all kind of works out for him , his friends , and the Rebel Alliance in the end .
5 ) Trusting the Force to Help Him Blow Up the Death Star
I have never really figured out what was so special about Luke using the Force in attacking the first Death Star .
As far as I could tell , it did nothing but give Darth Vader a slightly higher level of difficulty in blasting his X - Wing , which he seemed to aptly overcome as he blew up R2 - D2 , and proceeded to almost blow the crap out of Lukeâ€™s X - Wing had Han Solo not saved his ass with the Millennium Falcon .
Some might say his use of the Force involved him turning off his targeting computer and trusting himself to shoot the exhaust port .
If thatâ€™s using the Force then I am using the Force every time I turn off my cruise control in my car .
I mean , they make targeting systems for a reason , Lukeâ € ” and chances are , the Rebel ’s would prefer to trust your X - Wing ’s highly sophisticated on - board computer than a mystical power you spent a few hours learning yesterday afternoon .
4 ) Refusing to Listen to the Only Living Jedi in the Galaxy
Luke gets a vision of his dead mentor Obi-Wan telling him to go to Dagobah to get training from the Jedi Master , Yoda .
Luke obeys , goes out to Dagobah , finds Yoda , and then proceeds to ignore him at every important turn .
Yoda tells him not to go into the scary cave with weapons , Luke doesnâ€™t listen .
Yoda gives him a lesson about overcoming great obstacles , and Luke doesnâ€™t take it to heart , canâ €™t lift his own X - Wing and gets all pissy .
Yoda and the Ghost of Obi-Wan both tell him not to go running off to Bespin to save his friends as heâ€™s going to endanger everything they fought for .
Luke doesnâ€™t listen , goes off to Bespin , helps nobody and gets his damn hand chopped off .
Well done , Luke .
Why should â€ œObi-Wan coming back as a ghost to give important instructionsâ€ convey any significance to you ?
Why should not pay attention to the one muppet who knows how to use the Force ?
You ’re just a jerk who nearly turned into a Hoth - sicleâ € ” you surely know better than both of ’em !
3 ) His Insanely Stupid Plan To Rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hutt
Let us imagine that Luke Skywalker is trying to tell you his plan to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt .
Luke : â€ œOkay so , first we get Lando Calrissian posing as a guard inside Jabbaâ€™s Palace.â€ 
You : â€œHow do we do that ?â€ 
Luke : â€ œWe just get him a costume and heâ € ” just walks in.â€ 
You : â€ œUm , okay , say itâ€™s that easy .
So then Lando gets
Han out of the carbonite and we pick them up and get away ?â€ 
Luke : â€ œNo .
What happens next is that I put my lightsaber in a hidden compartment in R2 - D2 and send R2 - D2 and C3PO to Jabba the Hutt as gifts.â€ 
You : â€ œWait , why - â€ œ
Luke : â€ œJust listen .
Next we have Leia pose as a bounty hunter arriving at Jabbaâ€™s palace with Chewbacca captured .
Sheâ€™s going to hand over Chewbacca to Jabba.â€ 
You : â€ œWait , why ?
Wouldnâ€™t that mean we would now have to rescue Han Solo , Chewbacca , R2 - D2 and C3PO ?
That just makes it more difficult , right ?â€ 
Luke : â€ œJust go with me here .
Next , Leia is going to sneak around at night and get Han Solo out of the carbonite , but get captured .â€ 
You : â€ œWhat ?
Why would we get everyone captured like that ?â€ 
Luke : â€ œNow Iâ€™ll show up , use my Force powers to get in to Jabbaâ€™s fortress , get past the guards to an audience before Jabba and then use my Jedi mind trick to get Jabba to release everyone .
If that doesnâ€™t work , then Iâ€™ll get captured .â€ 
You : â€ œOkay , if you can just use your Force powers to get in to the palace and all the way to Jabba , then let ’s just have you go in right now and get Han out . ”
Luke : â€ œNo , that ’s stupid .
Iâ€™m going to get myself captured .
Because then you see , weâ€™ll be taken to the sarlacc pit and then , when weâ€™re on the skiff , Iâ€™ll get sent out first and then R2 - D2 will manage to get to the top of Jabbaâ€™s sail barge and shoot out my lightsaber , and then with Landoâ€™s help , weâ€™ll justâ€ ” rescue everyone and then everything will be fine !â€ 
You : â€ œThat is the stupidest plan Iâ€™ve ever heard of.â€ 
Luke : â€ œIâ€™ve thought of everything .â€ 
You : â€ œClearly you didnâ€™t.â€ 
2 ) Throwing Away His Lightsaber in Front of the Emperor
So Luke decides not to put his lightsaber through Darth Vaderâ€™s head once he realizes that heâ€™s going along the same dark path as his father .
So what does he do next ?
He tosses away his lightsaber and then proclaims to the Emperor that he is a Jedi .
Thus , he has no way to defend himself when the Emperor blasts him with lightning and if it wasnâ€™t for his Father saving his butt ( please note how many times Luke gets saved by someone else ) he would have been a charred piece of Tatooine bacon .
Okay , yes , tossing away the lightsaber makes a definitive statement of renouncing Father - killing , but what did he think would happen other than the Emperor kicking his ass ?
Did Luke think that perhaps he would proclaim â€ œI am a Jedi , like my father before me , â€ and the Emperor would suddenly shout â€ œNo !
You are the purest good !
I am nothing in the presence of your light !â€ and then fling himself backward into the chasm ?
Why didnâ€™t Luke just try to give the Emperor a big hug and kisses and call him a â€˜snookle bear.â€ ™
Heâ€™s a master of the Dark Side , so of course heâ€™s going to kick your ass .
Luke was warned not to underestimate the Emperor…so of course , he does exactly that .
1 ) Not Joining the Dark Side
No , seriously !
Luke gets dumped on his whole lifeâ€ ” his adoptive parents get killed , all his friends get injured or killed , the girl he falls in love with turns out to be his sister , his father turns out to be one of the most evil people in the galaxy , his hand gets cut off .
Then he gets a chance to co-rule the galaxy .
Who would n’t take that offer at that point ?
What has Luke had to look forward to after the original trilogy ?
Mostly trying to start up the whole Jedi Order by himself , which is a ton of work , and watching Han have almost constant sex with Leia .
Between that and ruling with Vader , it ’s not unlike a choice between working in your local library and becoming President .
Not really much of a choice there .
And ou can comment all you want about the Dark Side being a path to pain and suffering and a loss of humanity , but letâ€™s face itâ € ” the Dark Side is simply cooler .
Members of the Sith have neat custom lightsabers , get to slap everyone around , and just plain look cooler .
For Halloween , how many Luke costumes do you see people wearing nowadays ?
Zero .
How many Darth Vader costumes do you see ?
Still too many to count .
Bad is good , baby .

Still , his central point ( that the irrational dismissal of logic encouraged by religion often leads to tragically irrational behaviour , such as blowing yourself up on the tube or listening to Christian rock ) seems pretty valid from where I 'm standing , ie cowering on the sidelines of a fight I did n't pick , and which seems to be escalating out of control .
Life on Earth would be simpler and less blowy - uppy if religion did n't drive so many of its followers crazy - so why is n't anyone researching a drug that can cure it ?
It can't be that far - fetched .
After all , there 's no shortage of boggle - eyed drug - guzzling bores out there willing to describe their spiritual experiences at punishing length .
They can crack on for hours about the time they took a nuclear strain of hallucinogen they found on the internet .
They ran outside in the moonlight , glanced down at a bit of old stick on the floor , and suddenly found themselves journeying inside its mind - suddenly the air tasted of wood , they felt bark growing on the outside of their brain and they slowly realised that when you really bloody think about it , we 're all sticks , in a way , and let me tell you that revelation was bloody life - changing , it absolutely was .
Do you want some ?
Do you ?
Do you want to take some now ?
Go on .
I need someone to talk to , someone on my level .
TAKE THE PILL !
If we 're smart enough to create drugs that tickle the spiritual node in the brain , perhaps we can create a few new ones that 'll shut it down completely .
I 'd make it mandatory for all schoolkids , worldwide .
Actually sod that - I 'd pump it into the water supply myself .
Imagine !
Nothing to kill or die for !
And no religion too !
It 's amazing , literally no one 's ever had that thought before .
Okay , so there 's always the possibility that the same part of the brain that handles fuzzy spiritual feelings is the same part that handles love and sorrow and pity and joy ; the same part that makes us create songs and jokes and books and art and brightly coloured computer games in which an animated weasel collects starfish in a fountain ; so once we wipe it out we might all be left scampering around the planet like thick , bipedal , cultureless mice - rutting , foraging , scratching behind our ears and doing very little else .
But look on the bright side .
No more religious conflict AND no more novelty ringtones .
Two almighty evils erased for the price of one .
Bargain .
