Like the Little Engine that Could , for the past year , a group of four librarians have chugged on against the might of the FBI in a case against the Patriot Act .
In spite of the best efforts of the Justice Department , the librarians have struck a blow for free speech and won .
Our tale begins on February 15 , 2005 , in a still - undisclosed small town library in Connecticut .
Between 4:00 and 4:45 pm on that day , a patron apparently accessed a computer and used it to announce some sort of terrorist threat .
The FBI swung into gear , tracked the source of the threat to a particular computer , and sent a National Security Letter ( NSL ) to several librarians associated with Library Connection , Inc. — a service which supplies Internet access to 26 public libraries , including the one in question .
The NSL is a legal oddity of the Patriot Act , and it allows the FBI to make a unilateral demand which would usually require court oversight .
In effect , an NSL requires the FBI to police itself , making it similar to asking the fox to watch a mirror .
Although exact figures are impossible to come by , it is estimated that some 30,000 NSLs are now sent out each year .
An NSL also comes with the added bonus onus of never allowing the recipient to publicly discuss its contents , topic , or even existence .
In other words , the recipient is supposed to get the NSL , comply with it , and pretend nothing ever happened .
In this case , what did happen was that one of the librarians , George Christian , brought the letter before the executive board of Library Connection .
That board contacted the ACLU , and in August that organization filed a request to lift the gag order on the grounds that it prevented the librarians from exercising their First Amendment rights .
In September , a judge had ruled in favor of the librarians , but the FBI appealed , preventing the gag order from being lifted until a higher court could rule on the case .
For the next several months , the FBI continued the investigation of the case while the librarians refused to turn over any records .
Christian pointed out that , had his organization been provided with a court order , it would have been " as cooperative as possible . "
Instead , due to the nature of the NSL , Library Connection felt compelled to test the Constitutionality of the request .
The legal process dragged on .
In March , with the librarians still gagged and unable to testify before Congress , the federal government renewed the Patriot Act with minor revisions .
In April , the government dropped its case against the gag order .
By May , federal attorneys officially lifted the gag order , allowing the librarians to go public with details on the case .
Now , the government has announced that it is closing the investigation altogether , saying that it had determined through other means that the case was meritless .
While it 's good to see a win for the First Amendment , it 's worth looking at the other side of the case as well : the US Attorney for Connecticut points out that the librarians , while winning in the end , hindered an investigation into what may have proven to be a real terrorist threat .
That 's true , yet the issue the librarians had with the case was not with the investigation itself , but the fact that the law invoked is one that they felt was suspect due to its continuing and controversial potential for abuse .
In that way , those four people risked prosecution while taking a stand for the continued freedom of all Americans .
Furthermore , in the renewed version of the Patriot Act passed this year , an NSL has an automatic gag order of only one year , although that can be extended on an annual basis in the case of ongoing investigations .
That revision mitigates — although it does not remove — some of the First Amendment conflicts inherent in the original Patriot Act .

If Tech Companies Made Sudoku
Sudoku is perfect .
It can be as engaging , addictive , and flow - inducing as the flashiest real - time rendered , explosion - filled game on the planet .
But I can't help imagine what would happen if someone like , say , Microsoft had designed it .
Or rather , if some developers ( leaf - nodes ) at Microsoft designed it -- perfectly -- and then upper management stepped in ...
I 'm just having a little fun with Microsoft ; )
( they 're an easy target ) , but it 's not just MS that might do something like this :
Team ,
We 've reviewed the design doc for your new game code - named Sudoku , and we 're giving you the green light to build the alpha .
We 've made just a few revisions to the spec ( see attached annotated picture ) .
Marketing is still working up some final names ( the target market would have trouble spelling and pronouncing Sudoku ) , but the top two candidates are :
Grid Masters IV ( we know this is the first version , but the " IV " gives it some punch )
DeathNum Continuum , Special Edition ( the VP loves this one )
Frankly , we 're a little baffled that your original design was so ... simple .
I 'm sure we all recognize that our target market demands a much more media - rich , interactive , high - action experience .
Love the whole grid thing , though .

I 'm with Brad .
This posting is too much of a knock - off of the iPod packaging video that came out recently .
Posted by : Bob | May 16 , 2006 8:05:24 PM
Brad : that definitely makes the video more interesting ... on a lot of levels .
Bob : that was the point ( and why I linked to that video ) .
But this " if [ whoever ] edited [ whatever ] " has been one of my ( and others ) favorite spoofs for as long as I can remember .
I made a similar one for the back of my EJB book , with hand - written annotations ( supposedly by marketing and design ) marking up fictional " rough draft " cover designs .
[ The actual cover designer did not find it amusing , but we could n't resist . ]
My favorite example , though , was at an ad agency I worked at where designers took a book of famous works of art and marked them up in the style of their worst agency clients .
My personal pick was " reduce head 20 % " pointing to Michelangelo 's David ; )
The original inspiration for the one I put in my EJB book was this VERY fun book :
Rough Drafts .

Microsoft is touring with WinFX at the moment .

This post made me laugh , but it was definitely a rather wry laugh , since there is likely to be a whole heap of truth in what you say .
As a sudoku addict , I would have to say : it ain't broke - do n't fix it !
When it comes time to unwind there 's nothing better than a cup of coffee and a sudoku in the sunshine .
Of course , the sunshine makes it difficult to play onscreen , so I tend to opt for hard copy , pencil and eraser .
How retro !

FYI , Microsoft has already released ( on MSDN ) a version of Sudoku and I believe it will be bundled on future Tablet PC versions or at least on the Origami / UMPC editions .
And despite what you might think , it 's actually very slick .

Posted by : Dave | May 17 , 2006 8:21:18 AM
Ha ! so true .
Kathy , i know you always like things that stretch your brain - try playing Sudoku with shapes or colors rather than numbers .
I swear it works a different set of neurons ...
I have this app for my treo ->
http://software.everythingtreo.com/product.asp?id=1211
it lets me toggl the board to shapes , flags or digits .
Or you can also create a legend from any traditional sudoku puzzle and transcribe the board yourself .
Being the nerd I am I actually kept puzzle times on a mini excel sheet doing the same puzzles via three different methods - there were interesting , consistent results .
I wo n't spoil it - you gotta try yourself .

You do n't seriously think Microsoft would come up with names like that , do you ?
They are way too short and fun-sounding .
Something more along the lines of " Number Gathering Calculation Grid Foundation Server " would be my best guess . ;)

You can't seriously expect us to believe annotation comments from Microsoft marketing did n't include :
" is it skinnable ? " !
NOTHING is a good product for Windows unless it allows " skins " .
Never mind how useless it is .

Have you played the Washington Post 's online version of Sudoku ?
It 's great .
I 'm pretty passionate about it I guess .
It does have sound and animations though .... but the effects make it fun and give meaningful feedback instead of being fluff .

I do n't like Sudoku because I find it antisocial .
With crossword puzzles , you can ask your neighbor , " What 's the capital of Topeka ? " etc. , i.e. , you can involve someone else , start a little chat .
Where 's that with Sudoku ?
Nowhere .

Well , Sudoku is a name for Latin Squares ( developed by Howard Garns ) , except it has a few guidelines as to how many numbers the " player " can start with and where they can go .
But thinking of it as Latin Squares helps to emphasize what the real puzzle is .
It 's not one square with 28 numbers you need to complete , it 's finding the square the most given numbers that have two solutions .
Thats where the fun begins .

Orwell lässt grüßen Birgit Gärtner
Die Fußball - Weltmeisterschaft dient in Hamburg als Vorwand für umfangreiche Überwachungs - und Sicherheitsmaßnahmen
Überm Dach die Aufklärungsflugzeuge AWACS , vorm Haus die Bundeswehr beim Inlandseinsatz , ringsum Deutschlandfahnen in Schaufenstern und auf Balkonen , dazwischen grölende Fußballfans - dieses Szenario erwartet im Juni Millionen Menschen in den deutschen WM - Städten .
Flugzeuge , Bundeswehr und die grölenden
Fans werden nach der WM wieder verschwinden - die Fahnen hoffentlich auch .
Anderes wird jedoch dauerhaft erhalten bleiben : In Hamburg u.a. ein eigens für die WM errichtetes Polizeigefängnis und die durchgängige Videoüberwachung der Reeperbahn , die am Donnerstag begann .
“ Die Kamera - Bilder werden live auf einer Videowand in der Polizeieinsatzzentrale dargestellt .
So wird im Bedarfsfall eine schnelle Reaktion von Polizeikräften sichergestellt “ , schreibt die Behörde für Inneres zu diesem Bild
In der Hansestadt werden vier Vorrundenspiele sowie ein Viertelfinalspiel stattfinden , dazu werden mehr als 300.000 Fans aus aller Welt erwartet .
Dass Fußballfans nicht nur Gutes im Schilde führen , ist gemeinhin bekannt .
Entsprechend umfangreich sind die Vorkehrungen , die seitens der Hamburger Innenbehörde getroffen werden , um auch in dieser Ausnahmesituation Recht und Ordnung durchzusetzen .
Hilfreich ist dabei das Polizeigesetz vom Juni 2005 , dass es erlaubt , Personen zur Gefahrenabwehr vorübergehend in Gewahrsam zu nehmen .
„ Vorübergehend “ heißt maximal 14 Tage , statt bisher 24 Stunden - außer Hamburg hat lediglich Bayern ein derart restriktives Polizeirecht .
Laut Innensenator Udo Nagel ( parteilos ) werden die Kosten für die Sicherheit den Etat der Hansestadt mit etwa 8,8 Mio. € belasten .
150 Plätze zur Unterbringung von Personen , von denen „ akut potentielle Gefahr ausgeht “ , will die Innenbehörde in einem Sammelknast schaffen .
Dazu wird die Waschanlage der ehemaligen Polizeidirektion West in der Stresemannstraße für ca. 300.000 € umgebaut , die Höhe der entstehenden Betriebs - und Personalkosten ist nicht bekannt .
Die Abgeordnete der Grün-Alternativen - Liste ( GAL ) , Antje Möller , veranlasste das zu einer kleinen Anfrage an den Senat .
Sie möchte u.a. wissen , welche Kosten über den Umbau hinaus anfallen und aus welchen Haushaltstiteln diese beglichen werden sollen .
Innensenator Udo Nagel : „ Die Polizei wird die Technik verantwortungsbewusst einsetzen , sie erfolgt für die Sicherheit der Bürger in Hamburg .
Sie können sich im Bereich der Reeperbahn künftig noch sicherer fühlen , weil sie sicherer sind ! “
Erst kürzlich hat die Anti-Folter - Kommission des Europäischen Rates Hamburg wegen mangelnder Rechts - und Sicherheitsstandards in den dortigen Knästen gerügt .
Möller fragt deswegen nach , ob die Vorgaben der Kommission in Bezug auf Rechtsbeistand , medizinische Versorgung , Besuchsmöglichkeiten , etc. in dem neuen Sammelgefängnis eingehalten werden .
Die Abgeordnete interessiert , ob den Gefangenen die Möglichkeit für einen regelmäßigen Aufenthalt im Freien gegeben wird .
Diese Frage lässt sich durch einen Blick auf das vorgesehene Areal leicht beantworten : Der Komplex liegt in einem dichtbebauten Wohn - und Industriegebiet , zwischen einem großen Hotel und einer Tankstelle , direkt an der berühmt , berüchtigten Stresemannstraße , einer der am meisten befahrenen Straßen Nordeuropas mit entsprechenden Schadstoffemissionen .
Zwar gibt es einen kleinen gepflasterten Innenhof , doch der ist dem Fuhrpark der Wache vorbehalten .
Außerdem fragt Möller nach , aufgrund welcher Erkenntnisse dieser Sammelknast überhaupt gebaut wird , da es sich um ein Modell handelt , das z.B. in Berlin wegen mangelnder Auslastung geschlossen worden sei .
Die Berliner Behörden setzen auf dezentrales Einbuchten , d.h. , sechs kleinere Sammelstellen wurden eingerichtet , die von allen Orten in Berlin in höchstens 15 Minuten erreichbar sind .
Berlins Innensenator Erhart Körting ( SPD ) sieht der WM scheinbar gelassen entgegen .
Die Berliner Polizei habe mit Ereignissen wie z.B. dem 1 . Mai genügend Erfahrungen gesammelt , erläuterte er gegenüber den Medien .
Das lässt aufhorchen .
Richtig , auch in Hamburg geht es im Kern nicht um Fußballfans , sondern um ein „ Basisinstrument “ ( Möller ) der Polizei , missliebige Personen wegzusperren .
„ Die WM ist nicht der Grund , sondern der Anlass für den Umbau “ , bestätigte der Pressesprecher der Innenbehörde Marco Haase gegenüber den Medien .
Er unterstrich , dass die Einrichtung auch nach der WM bei Demonstrationen und Großveranstaltungen genutzt werden soll .
Die WM dient der Hamburger Innenbehörde indes nicht nur als Vorwand zur Errichtung des Polizeigefängnisses , sondern auch für die lückenlose Videoüberwachung der Reeperbahn .
Am Donnerstag begann die Testphase : An 12 Standorten sind Videokameras installiert , die mittels Schwenk - und Zoomfunktionen jeden Winkel der Amüsiermeile filmen werden .
Das Material wird in der Polizeidirektion gesammelt und vier Wochen lang aufbewahrt .
Die Aktion ist die erste Totalüberwachung eines kompletten Straßenzuges in Hamburg .
Angeblich können die Kameras zwischen „ privat “ und „ öffentlich “ unterscheiden .
Laut Innenbehörde sollen die Bildschirme in der Zentrale schwarz und die Datenübertragung umgehend gestoppt werden , sobald z.B. ein Wohnzimmerfenster ins Visier gerät .
Die offensichtliche bunte Mischung aus Privat - und Geschäftsräumen auf der Reeperbahn lässt daran jedoch starke Zweifel aufkommen .
Standorte der Überwachungskameras .
Bild : Hamburger Behörde für Inneres
Als Begründung für diese Maßnahme gab Nagel Kriminalitätsprävention an : Gewalttaten , vor allem im Zusammenhang mit Alkohol - und Drogenkonsum sollen so verhindert werden .
Dass dieses Konzept greift , wird von Experten bezweifelt .
Der Hamburger Kriminologe Stefan Czerwinski prognostiziert , dass geplante kriminelle Aktivitäten sich dann einfach auf andere Plätze verlagern werden .
Affekttaten könnten durch Videokameras sowieso nicht verhindert werden , betont Czerwinski .
Für ihn bedeutet Nagels Präventionsmaßnahme eine massive Einschränkung demokratischer Rechte .
Die Unschuldsvermutung werde umgekehrt , da Menschen pauschal unter Generalverdacht gestellt würden , monierte er .
Laut Hamburger Polizeigesetz besteht die Möglichkeit visueller Überwachung von Orten , " soweit an diesen Orten wiederholt Straftaten begangen worden sind und Tatsachen die Annahme rechtfertigen , dass dort auch künftig mit der Begehung von Straftaten zu rechnen ist " .
Damit kann im Prinzip alles als ein gefährlicher
Ort definiert werden und der Verdacht drängt sich auf , dass „ die sündigste Meile der Welt “ nicht von ungefähr als Testobjekt ausgesucht wurde .
Die Kameras suggerieren den Eindruck , dass es sich um einen gefährlichen
Ort handeln muss , sonst bräuchte er nicht überwacht zu werden .
So lässt sich das Gefühl der Unsicherheit medial schüren und das vermeintliche Allheilmittel propagieren : Der starke Staat mit seinen Videokameras und Verwahranstalten , in denen Störenfriede umgehend weggesperrt werden .

Getting organized , focused and productive does n't have to cost an arm and a leg .
We 've reviewed thousands of time - saving applications and gadgets here at Lifehacker over the past year and a half , but a handful really shine when it comes down to getting your stuff done , and most of them are simple , widely available , free or almost free .
Here are my top 10 picks for best free and cheap productivity tools , in no particular order .
Advertisement
1. Pen and paper
Whether you 're an index - card carrying Hipster PDAer or if you simply prefer a paper planner over a Blackberry , the plain fact is writing things down in the moment is the key to capturing your ideas and moving forward on them .
Keep pens and pads all over the house , in the car and in your bag so you can snag that fleeting thought , get it off your mind and move forward on it later .
( Cheap , no computer required )
Advertisement
2. Plain text
In an age when storing your information on someone else 's web site or in someone else 's software can have dire consequences in the event of a crash , software upgrade or broken internet connection , lots of lifehackers are going retro with plain text .
Keep a personal todo.
txt , grocery list , bigideas. txt , or expense log using a simple text editor available anywhere , online or off .
( Free , computer required )
You 're building a library of data and documents on your hard drive at a faster rate than any other generation .
Rather than wasting your time meticulously filing it all into a complicated folder system , Google Desktop lets you guiltlessly pile , not file , because one well - constructed query can retrieve whatever you 're looking for in a flash .
Works especially well with the contents of your . txt files ( see # 2 . )
Mac users , you 've got Spotlight .
( Free , Windows only . )
Advertisement
Script any block of text or sequence of keystrokes with AutoHotkey to perform repetitive tasks at the press of a button .
It takes some time to write your AHK scripts , but once they 're set up , you 'll whiz through canned email responses , eradicate common spelling errors automatically , and drop pieces of frequently used text - like blog post HTML snippets or message signatures - faster than ever .
Mac users , TextExpander will do a lot of what AutoHotkey does on OS X. ( Free , Windows only . )
Advertisement
Quicksilver 's tag line is " act without doing , " and once you 've begun using this application launcher and total Mac commander , you 'll understand what that means .
Append to text files ( see # 2 ) without opening an editor , email documents , launch web sites and much much more with Quicksilver and its bevy of app - specific plugins .
Sorry Windows users , there just is n't a QS counterpart for you worth mentioning , though some have settled for AppRocket .
( Free , Mac OS X only . )

You can drop some serious cash on a fancy ring binder planner that includes a calendar , to do list and other forms for organizing your stuff .
But when you do , you 're committing to the brand and forms offered by one system and one company .
The D*I*Y Planner web site , however , offers an extensive library of PDF templates for refilling that can 't - live - without paper planner with just your printer and hole punch .
Whether David Allen or Stephen Covey 's your guru , if you 're into Mind Mapping , book journaling , or storyboarding , the D*I *Y planner has something for you .
( Cheap , paper / ink / printer required . )
Advertisement
Tons of space , powerful search , great spam filtering , keyboard shortcuts , labels and advanced filtering all make Gmail the choice for keeping any public , high - traffic email account under control every day .
While I still love and use Thunderbird for my personal mail , I 'd still be digging out of messages from Lifehacker readers sent last April if it was n't for Gmail .
( Free . )

8 . Your cell phone
That little device you have " just to make phone calls " probably does a hell of a lot more than you think .
Getting information via SMS on the go - or even just emailing yourself a URL , book recommendation or killer idea - is possible with most modern mobile phones .
A camera phone is n't just for taking embarrassing snaps of your buddy wearing a tutu ; you can also use it to develop your digital photographic memory .
See also previously - published Power texting tips for more on putting your cell phone to work for you .
( Cost depends on your model and plan . )
Advertisement
9 . A filing cabinet
This one 's the most expensive on the list , but a well - maintained filing cabinet is the key to tracking and finding important paperwork in your life .
There are n't a lot of shortcuts here - get yourself a sturdy , attractive filing cabinet , a label maker and extra folders which make filing easy and fun .
See more the Extreme makeover , filing cabinet edition for more on setting up your perfect filing system .
( Cost varies . )
Advertisement
10 .
An inbox and " next actions " tray
If incoming and in - progress paperwork are still piling up on your desk even after your filing cabinet is set up , get yourself a simple set of at least 2 paper trays .
One will be your inbox - for anything incoming you have n't had a chance to look at yet , like mail - the second will be items you need to move forward on a project ( " next actions , " for your GTD 'ers . )
A clear workspace ( and a clear mind ) is one of the best productivity tools you can have , so make spaces for that stuff that 's piling up into distracting clutter .
( Get one for as little as 3 bucks . )

This list could 've been pages longer , as tons of little tools help me get through my work day .

Keith Ferrazzi enters your life like a circus coming to town -- the two ringing cell phones , the two PalmPilots , the multiple conversations in which he seems to be listening and talking simultaneously .
The way he walks and looks , all tanned and fit , with the styled hair and custom suit and black Prada shoes .
The deals that are hanging in the air , the favors being extended or secured , the sideshows , the laughter , the juggling .
That irresistible balloon of energy .
We 've just bolted from the Yale Club and are hustling through midtown Manhattan in a cab , heading for Rockefeller Center and a lunch we 're already late for with an important television executive .
A Ferrazzi friend .
I 'm here because Ferrazzi is said to have a gift .
In addition to heading up a young Los Angeles company called YaYa that 's generating more than its share of buzz , Ferrazzi is a networker , a great networker .
Indeed , some of the world 's best networkers say that the still - only - 36 - year - old Ferrazzi may be the best of all .
Ferrazzi is something else , too : an archetypal American story , the poor kid -- born to a steelworker and a cleaning lady -- who works his ass off to get into Yale and Harvard B- school ; who becomes the youngest elected partner at Deloitte Consulting and then the youngest Fortune 500 chief marketing officer , at Starwood Hotels ; who gets tapped by famed financier Michael Milken and others to become CEO of YaYa , a pioneering company in the creation of on - line games as custom - marketing vehicles .
In two years Ferrazzi has transformed YaYa from a clever idea into a thriving business .
He 's got game , as they say .
But the exact nature of that game -- the magic of it , everyone claims -- is networking , the acquisition and cultivation of influential connections .
And yet , sitting with Ferrazzi in the cab , I am aware of what many company owners will think of all this .
Networking ?
Give me John Wayne individualism and the aggressive single - mindedness that 's required to build something , to lead , and to do it all alone .
Schmoozers are brownnosers , sycophants more suited to middle management than to the Wild West of the entrepreneurial world .
Would it be a surprise if entrepreneurs recoil at the thought of consciously courting any person who has more power and money than they have ?
In the cab I 'm thinking I 'll press Ferrazzi on that issue , lead him carefully through my list of questions , get to the bottom of networking 's unseemliness .
But it wo n't happen that way .
Instead , in the course of following Ferrazzi throughout the day , at lunch and during a few hours of phone calls and a discussion that can only be described as a lecture , I will become a pupil .
Keith Ferrazzi will teach me how the inner circle operates .
He 'll teach me how even I can operate .
He 'll teach me the system .
" Have you ever thought of broadcast journalism ? "
Ferrazzi is asking me now as we sit in traffic .
He asks many such questions , personal and probing , and he does it with such an easy charm and sincerity that I find myself answering them .
" I guess I 've considered it , " I say .
" Well , this lunch will be great for you , " he says .
" She 's a terrific woman who happens to be very powerful .
This is your opportunity to start practicing your networking skills . "
But halfway through our meal in the Rainbow Room 's members - only lunch club , all is not well .
I 'm polite but passive , asking a few questions but nothing more .
Ferrazzi , on the other hand , manages the conversation like a yogi -- all deliberate , delicate movements , his listening as assertive as his banter .
And now I 'm about to face my first test .
Choosing a moment when he and I are briefly alone in the buffet line , Ferrazzi leans in and whispers , " You 're a fucking loser if you do n't walk out of here with some reason for getting in touch with her again . "
Later , when he is painstakingly explaining the practice of his system -- the rules of elite networking -- he 'll also explain the critical difference between what he does and what most people do .
He 'll try to explain the nuances that the Rolodex builders and card passer - outers fail to grasp .
But he 'll admit that in the beginning it was more straightforward even for him .
EYES ON THE PRIZE :
It was his father 's pluck that got Keith Ferrazzi out of his working - class suburb .
As a kid he caddied at the local country club for the homeowners and children living in the wealthy town next to his , and it made him think often and hard about those who succeed and those who do n't .
He came to believe that business , like life , is a game , and that the people who play it best will win .
And the rule in the game that trumps all others , Ferrazzi became convinced , is that he who knows the most people , and knows them well , becomes a member of the club , not a caddy .
Hence his gradual construction of a plan , a set of existential operating procedures that today has bred a network of oceanic proportions .
Whether you want to speak with Michael Milken or Bill Clinton or celebrity doctor Dean Ornish or CEO Barry Diller , Ferrazzi can open the door .
" So how'd I do ? " I ask him when we 're back at the Yale Club , his base when he's in New York , after our Rainbow Room lunch .
" Awful , " he reports .
And it 's true .
The entire experience had the feel of a first date .
When I did manage to speak , I actually stuttered .
My questions were n't particularly passionate or insightful .
And when at the very last moment I went in for the metaphorical kiss , I instead got a chummy punch on the shoulder .
Ferrazzi stepped in -- because I 'd forgotten my business cards -- to say he'd get us in touch .
I now ask him to grade my performance .
He gives me a preposterously charitable C-minus .
" You can do better , " he says .
" You just have to work on it . "
Rule 1 : Do n't network just to network .
" Well , what do you want ? "
Ferrazzi will ask any would - be networker seeking instruction in the art .
What do you want ?
" If your aspirations lie with the crème de la crème , " he says , " that is , if your aspirations are to be one of the top x people in the world in whatever you do , if you 're so bold as to want to be president of the United States or a respected CEO in the Fortune 500 , I would argue that you wo n't get there by knowing a lot of middle - level people . "
You need to know the right people , for the right reason .
As a Yale undergrad , Ferrazzi , who grew up outside Pittsburgh , thought he wanted to become the governor of Pennsylvania .
So he became the president of Yale 's political union .
When he was looking to join a fraternity , he researched which one had the most active politicians as alumni .
( Sigma Chi was n't chartered at Yale , so he founded a chapter . )
When he was a sophomore , he ran for New Haven City Council , but lost .
From 1991 through 1999 at Deloitte Consulting , his first job after Harvard Business School , he desperately wanted to distinguish himself from the other striving postgrad consultants .
Since Michael Hammer of " reengineering " fame was the guru of the moment , Ferrazzi befriended him and helped Deloitte ride Hammer 's fame .
Ferrazzi became the youngest person ever elected partner at Deloitte Consulting .
The more focused Ferrazzi 's goal was , the more outrageous his networking fortunes became .
In November 2000 the YaYa board named Ferrazzi CEO and handed him two goals : establish a viable business model , and then either find a major investor or sell the company to a well - heeled strategic acquirer .
At the time , YaYa had the tech capability to invent on - line games that corporations could use to attract and educate their customers , but the company had no customers -- or revenue .
" I was hired to get a new concept heard for the first time in the marketplace , " Ferrazzi says .
He mapped out the most important players in the on - line - games industry , from CEOs and journalists to programmers and academics .
He knew almost all of them within a year .
And in 2002 , YaYa recorded $ 8 million in sales .
Rule 2 : Take names .
" I 'm constantly ripping out lists in magazines .
I was one of Crain 's ' 40 under 40 ' when I was 30 .
Interestingly enough , I had been ripping out 40 - under - 40 lists for years and continue to do so .
Those are individuals who somebody has spent enough time to identify as an up - and - comer , a mover , an intellectual , and these are the kinds of people I want to surround myself with .
I rip out lists of top CEOs , most admired CEOs , regional lists .
A recent book by Richard Saul Wurman lists the 1,000 most creative people in the United States .
It 's fantastic . "
Either Ferrazzi or his assistant enters the gathered names into a database .
He has call sheets by region , listing the people he knows and those he'd like to know , and when he's in town , he phones all of them .
The numbers are also put into his two PalmPilots , one that has names strictly relating to the particular business he 's involved in at the moment ( YaYa now ) and another that contains his own personal contacts .
There are more than 5,000 contacts in all , some of them people Ferrazzi does n't know yet .
Those are what he calls " aspirational contacts . "
He pulls out his Palm and shows me the contact information for Richard Branson , chairman of the Virgin empire .
" I do n't know him .
But I want to , " he says .
Then he scrolls down and comes to Howard Stringer , CEO of Sony Corp. of America .
" He was on my aspirational list once .
I now know Howard , " he notes .
Rule 3 : Build it before you need it .
Back in 1999 , when Ferrazzi arrived at Starwood Hotels from Deloitte , his goal was to become president or even CEO of the multinational hospitality corporation .
But by early 2000 things were n't going well .
The company , under the mercurial leadership of chairman and CEO Barry Sternlicht , was known for the early defections of its top executives .
Ferrazzi's relationship with Sternlicht was " strained , " according to one insider , and Ferrazzi realized he had no future at Starwood .
On his last day at the company -- as on most days -- he made more than 40 phone calls , one of which was to Sandy Climan , a well - known Hollywood player who once served as Michael Ovitz 's right - hand man at Creative Artists Agency and who now runs an L.A. - based venture - capital firm called Entertainment Media Ventures .
What 's interesting about the call , and the dozens of others like it that Ferrazzi made that day , was that long before they knew Ferrazzi , many of the people he spoke with had been on one of his lists .
ANCHOR MAN : " What you do , " says Ferrazzi , " is find somebody in your peer set who has a friend who is two levels above -- the anchor tenant . "
Three months later , Ferrazzi had five job offers .
Climan had him meet with people from YaYa , one of the companies in his firm 's portfolio .
It did n't hurt that one of the other investors with a stake in YaYa , Knowledge Universe , was backed by Michael Milken .
Milken had been on a list for years , until Ferrazzi finally connected with him through a nonprofit cause .
Ferrazzi has since come to consider Milken a mentor .
" You build your network before you need it , " says Ferrazzi .
" When someone comes to me for advice on how to build a network because they need a job now , I tell them it 's useless .
People can tell the difference between desperation and an earnest attempt to create a relationship . "
Rule 4 : Never eat alone .
The dynamics of status in a business network are similar to those in Hollywood : invisibility is a fate worse than failure .
Above all , never , ever disappear .
" Keep your social and conference and event calendar full , " Ferrazzi tells me .
" I give myself one night a week for myself , and the rest is an event or dinner . "
Is this a life ?
Ferrazzi , who has no children but has been in a 10 - year relationship with another man , spends almost all his time working .
" I wake up around 5 or 6 in the morning , and I go until 1 in the morning , " he says .
" Every free moment is a chance to E - mail or call someone .
But I do n't consider that work .
That 's my true joy .
I have balance , but it 's my own version .
My career and my community - service stuff have always taken a front seat to my personal life .
But , in a sense , that is my personal life .
There 's no distinction for me .
Yes , I 'd like to go to church more and meditate more .
And it 's been a while since I 've taken a real vacation .
But do I feel like I 've sacrificed anything ?
No . "
Rule 5 : Be interesting .
To show that he was smart yet unconventional , Ferrazzi used to wear a bow tie to conferences .
To emphasize his charitable nature , he is always passionately involved in one philanthropic cause or another .
He is keenly aware that perception drives reality and that we are all , in some sense , brands .
All his choices -- his Prada suits , his conversational style , his hobbies -- help him fashion a distinctive identity that is both interesting and attractive .
And the cornerstone that supports the design of a person , he instructs , is content .
" Being known is one thing , but being known for content is something else entirely -- and much better , " he says .
" You have to have something to say to be interesting to people . "
" If you 're so bold as to want to be president of the United States or a respected CEO in the Fortune 500 , I would argue that you wo n't get there by knowing a lot of middle - level people . "
In college , that something was politics .
At his first job , at Imperial Chemical Industries , he mastered the ins and outs of total quality management .
( He persuaded the industrial giant to craft a new position for him called head of TQM in North America . )
Later , when he worked at Deloitte , reengineering was his hook .
Today it 's on - line games and " how the new medium will impact society and corporations . "
What sets Ferrazzi apart from everybody else is the relentlessness he brings to learning and packaging and selling these hooks .
YaYa 's board knew that that characteristic would prove vital for a company whose market and product were totally untested .
The on - line - games industry has always been driven by hits , by competing in a race for the latest , greatest diversion .
But Ferrazzi began to trumpet the industry as the next powerful communications medium , an untapped $ 20 - billion marketing vehicle perfect for product placements , branded gaming events , custom games - related training for businesses , and on and on .
It was n't long before he was not only attending games conferences but speaking at them , " which is always preferable , " he says .
Once the pitch is perfected , getting attention is never a problem .
Journalists are powerful ( the right exposure can make a company ) , needy ( they 're always looking for a story ) , and relatively unknown ( few have achieved enough celebrity to make them inaccessible ) .
It 's a combination that Ferrazzi has learned to exploit .
He knows people in top positions at almost every major business magazine in the country .
Which is why it 's little surprise that in less than a year after Ferrazzi took over YaYa , with barely a shred of revenue to its name , the company -- and , more important , the content -- appeared in places like Forbes , the Wall Street Journal , CNN , Brand Week , and the New York Times .
Fame sells .
An executive at Honda motors spotted the article in Brand Week , and YaYa had its first big account ; it would create for Honda a multiplayer on - line racing game to help sell the new Acura .
Rule 6 : Manage the gatekeeper .
Artfully .
Last summer Ferrazzi met Jane Pemberton , a former Disney executive , while flying first - class , as always .
" That 's where the decision makers sit , " says Ferrazzi .
( See " Where to Meet the Power Elite , " at right , for Ferrazzi 's recommendations regarding the most fertile venues for top - shelf networking . )
Pemberton suggested that Ferrazzi might like to get to know Michael Johnson , president of Walt Disney International .
There was n't anything obvious that Johnson could do for Ferrazzi or YaYa .
There rarely is when Ferrazzi reaches out .
But it could n't hurt for Ferrazzi to know him , and who could say whether Disney would someday become a potential suitor ?
The only problem was getting through Johnson 's gatekeepers ; that 's often the only problem -- but not for Ferrazzi .
" When you do n't know someone , the first concept is getting past the secretary , " he says .
" So Johnson 's secretary says , ' I 'm sorry , Mr. Johnson is traveling , he 's traveling all month . '
And I say , ' That 's OK .
Why do n't you tell him a friend of Jane Pemberton 's called ?
Tell him to call me back if he has some time . '
I did n't push .
The first call you do n't push , because the admin does n't know you , and you never want to get the admin pissed off at you ; they 're the gateway .
" Second call is almost the same thing : ' Hi , this is Keith Ferrazzi .
I 'm just calling back because I have n't heard from him , ' as if the presumption is that I would have .
It 's totally innocuous , no obligation .
On the third call , she 's getting a little pissed .
' Listen , ' she says with a little strike in her voice , ' Mr. Johnson is very busy .
I do n't know who you are ....'
I counter : ' I 'm just a personal friend of a friend , I just moved into the city , Jane suggested that I should meet Michael , and I do n't even know why , besides Jane being a good friend of Michael's .
Maybe it 's all wrong , maybe we should n't meet .
I apologize . '
That puts her on the defensive .
Now she thinks that she 's been a dick to a personal friend of a friend of her boss .
She backs off , and I make a proposition : ' Why do n't I just send Michael an E- mail ?
What 's his E - mail address ? '
And at this point she thinks , ' I want to be out of the middle of this thing . '
She gives me the E-mail address .
" The E - mail is simple : ' Dear Michael , I 'm a friend of Jane 's , and she suggested I talk with you .
Fifteen minutes and a cup of coffee is fine .
Jane thinks we should know each other . '
I get a cordial ' Of course we can ' response .
" So now I go back to the secretary with the ' Of course we can . '
Now it 's not if , but when , we 'll meet .
Now it 's ' Michael would like to set up this meeting , just let me know when . '
And finally it happens . "
Rule 7 : Always ask .
This is the story Keith Ferrazzi tells about his father :
Pete Ferrazzi , a steelworker whose world was hard hours and low wages , knew he wanted more for his son .
He knew his boy 's life would be better if he could find a way out of their working - class Pittsburgh suburb .
" Keep your social calendar full , " says Ferrazzi .
" I give myself one night a week for myself , and the rest is an event or dinner . "
But the elder Ferrazzi did n't know the exits .
He 'd never been to college .
He knew nothing of country clubs or private schools .
He could picture only one man who might have the sort of pull that could help : his boss .
Actually , the boss of his boss 's boss -- Alex McKenna , CEO of Kennametal , in whose factory Pete Ferrazzi worked .
The two men had never met .
But the elder Ferrazzi had an idea about how the world worked .
He 'd observed that audacity was often the only thing that separated two equally talented men and their job titles .
Pete Ferrazzi asked to speak with McKenna , who , upon hearing the request , was so intrigued that he took the meeting .
In it , he agreed to meet Pete 's son , Keith , but not to do anything more .
However , it turned out that McKenna liked the precocious adolescent -- especially because of the way young Keith had come to his attention .
McKenna was on the board of a local prep school where he sent his own children , by reputation one of the best schools in the country .
Strings were indeed pulled , and Keith entered a new world , on scholarship , that set him on an entirely new course , just as his father had hoped .
" I got one of the best educations America has to offer , " Ferrazzi says today .
" Starting with elementary school , prep school , on to Yale and Harvard -- it would never have happened if my father had n't believed that it never hurts to ask .
The worst anyone can say is no .
Not many people believe that .
Embarrassment and fear are debilitating . "
Totally fearless is how Joshua Ramo , an editor at Time Inc. , describes Ferrazzi .
Ramo remembers a moment at the Davos economic forum , where the two first met , when Ferrazzi walked onto a hotel bus , saw Nike founder Phil Knight , and made a beeline for the seat next to his .
Boldness , and its particular genius , was the father 's gift to his son .
Rule 8 : Do n't keep score .
Successful networking is never about simply getting what you want .
It 's about getting what you want and making sure that people who are important to you get what they want , too .
Often , that means fixing up people with one another .
Take , for instance , this unsolicited E- mail message that Ferrazzi sent to two key executives in digital gaming :
Steve and John ,
I wanted to introduce the two of you .
John , I 've bragged about Steve to you already .
And Steve , John is the president and COO of EA [ Entertainment Arts ] , the largest games company in the world .
John has been an outspoken believer that the future of games will converge with ITV and that EA is the kind of company that will be at the forefront given the leadership of someone like John , the size of EA , and power of their content .
I know , Steve , that you get the power of games as the one who allowed G4 to come to life .
It would seem that the two of you would benefit from some conversations about your mutual visions .
Not to mention that I suspect that you 'll really like each other as well .
Best ,
Keith Ferrazzi
" It 's about a personal connection that makes you feel a sense of reciprocity , " Ferrazzi says .
" Superficiality is not networking .
There are people who have lots of superficial connections , and people call that networking .
But that 's not successful .
You feel dirty when you talk to someone like that .
The outcome of good networking is the capacity to have a conversation with anyone you want to have a conversation with and then to leave that conversation with a lasting connection of some sort . "
The best sort of networking occurs when Ferrazzi can connect two people who do n't know each other .
Which drives home a surprising implication : the strength of your network derives as much from the diversity of your relationships as it does from their quality or quantity .
Most of us know the people within our own profession and social group , and little more .
Ferrazzi makes a point of knowing as many people from as many different worlds as possible .
The ability to bridge those worlds is a key attribute in managers who are paid better and promoted faster , according to an influential study conducted by Ron Burt , a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business .
The care and feeding of contacts is a relatively new concept for the business networker .
In Power !
How to Get It , How to Use It , a 1975 self - help screed on the secrets to becoming a corporate chieftain , Michael Korda advised that " masters players ... attempt to channel as much information as they can into their own hands , then withhold it from as many people as possible . "
That is , 30 years ago old - style connectors attained power through a monopoly of information , whereas today people like Ferrazzi view the system as social arbitrage , a constant and open exchange of favors and intelligence .
It 's a sort of career karma , too ; how much you give to the network determines how much you 'll receive .
Rule 9 : Ping constantly .
Eighty percent of success , Woody Allen once said , is just showing up .
Eighty percent of networking is just staying in touch .
Ferrazzi calls it " pinging . "
It 's a quick , casual greeting .
He makes hundreds of phone calls a day .
Most of them are simply quick hellos that he leaves on friends ' voice mail .
He sends E-mail constantly .
He remembers birthdays and makes a special point of reaching people when they have one .
When it comes to relationship maintenance , he is , in the words of more than one friend , " the most relentless , energetic person I know . "
Rule 10 : Find anchor tenants .
Feed them .
By now , an invitation for an evening at Ferrazzi 's is a hot ticket .
Nearly once a month influence peddlers from different worlds gather to gossip , talk business , and schmooze at his Hollywood Hills home .
But in the early days , before his dinner parties had cachet , Ferrazzi had to develop a very deliberate strategy for attracting the right people .
" You , me , every one of us -- we have our peer set , and we can always have dinner parties with our peer set , but if you keep having dinner parties with your peer set , why would somebody two levels above your peer set ever come to your dinner parties ? " he asks .
" The point is , you do n't randomly invite somebody two levels above your peer set to your dinner and expect them to come , because they wo n't .
They want to hang around people of their peer set or higher .
This is a crass way of talking about it , but this is the formula . "
So Ferrazzi developed his theory of the anchor tenant .
" What you do , " he says , " is find somebody in your peer set who has a friend who is two levels above -- the big swinging dick of the group , the anchor tenant .
You get them to come and , in all invitations subsequent to that , you use the anchor to pull in people who otherwise would n't attend . "
On a typical evening last summer , all the guests at Ferrazzi 's could have been considered anchors .
And the function of the festivity remained the same as it had been back when Ferrazzi was trying to land just one big name : mixing different people for good fun , lively conversation , and perhaps a few mutually beneficial encounters to boot .
The doing of deals was inevitable .
But so was a sing - along around Ferrazzi 's baby grand .
The evening started with champagne , followed by cocktails served " early and heavy . "
On this night , political columnist Arianna Huffington stopped by for drinks but left before dinner .
Other notables included Chrysler vice - president Jeff Bell ; design impresario and TED conference founder Richard Saul Wurman ; Disney president of interactive games Jan Smith ; and Paul Bricault , senior vice - president at William Morris Consulting .
Around the long dining - room table Ferrazzi had placed name tags in an effort to orchestrate a symphony of successful interactions .
A wealthy CEO might sit next to an official of a nonprofit that 's looking to raise money , or a potential YaYa investor who is a rabid Republican might find herself next to a GOP heavy .
On this night , Bell , a film buff , was seated next to a well - known movie director .
As always , the meal was hearty and down - home to make people feel cozy .
After dinner , led by a hired piano player , the guests retired for some singing and port wine .
Several days later , Bricault called to thank Ferrazzi .
" My wife told me , " he swooned in a voice - mail message , " she wants to be Keith Ferrazzi when she grows up . "
We 're back at the Yale Club , and my tutelage is coming to an end .
The afternoon is edging into night , and Ferrazzi is still networking away with the restless energy of an obscure presidential hopeful -- indeed , among those he 's dancing with at this particular moment is the obscure presidential hopeful Governor Howard Dean of Vermont .
( Ferrazzi is arranging a fund - raiser for the governor in L.A. , and , as a small favor , he 's asking if Dean might take on a fellow Yalie 's wife as an intern . )
We 're in Ferrazzi 's regular suite , and he 's standing at the desk , one leg propped up on a chair , two phones buzzing , E - mails pinging , his fingers constantly fidgeting with a PalmPilot .
In the course of three hours he 's spoken to or left messages for some three dozen people in addition to Dean , including the managing editor of Forbes , the president of Martha Stewart Living , and the chairman of DuPont .
I 've followed Ferrazzi for months now , talking or E - mailing at all hours , becoming accustomed to " Ferrazzi Time , " a zone of operations in which the switchboards are always open .
Deals , companies , jobs : they come and go -- the ringmaster of the Big Top remains .
Yet , nearing the end of my time with him , I realize that one of the most basic questions in my notebook remains unanswered .
What about the manipulation , the gamesmanship , the using of people ?
Does n't he ever feel uncomfortable , like a phony ?
Well , no .
This is simply who Keith Ferrazzi is .
And I can see that he's is a little disappointed in me , a little saddened that maybe I have n't completely understood .
Sitting there with him , I realize that two scenes have stuck with me .
One is a memory that Ferrazzi related of getting picked up at his prep school by his mother in a beat - up old Nova while other children were ducking into limos and BMWs .
" And I 'd be teased about my clothes , the lack of money ....
It really set a hard line in my head .
It fundamentally made me pissed off at the old - boy network because I was n't an inheritance kid .
It put the biggest fucking chip on my shoulder .
And one of these days I will have surpassed all of them in terms of success . "
So here he is , more successful than his father ever dreamed , still bearing the weight of that mighty chip .
Then there is the tale he told of his own aspiring group of mentees , young men in their twenties .
Inevitably , Ferrazzi says , there comes a time when he can a make a difference in their lives .
He can open a door or place a call or set up an internship -- one of those simple acts by which destinies are altered .
But too often the offer is refused .
" They 'll say one of three things .
They wo n't take the favor because they can't pay me back or because they do n't want to be obligated to me , or they 'll insist right there and then that they do me a favor of some kind in return , " he says .
To Ferrazzi , nothing is as infuriating as encountering such blindness in people he cares about as to how things work .
What he does , he 'll say , has nothing to do with quid pro quo , with a running equation in which you give just so you can get .
For Ferrazzi , networking may be the power tool for somehow , someday , dislodging that heavy chip .
But it 's something much more : a way of engaging with the world .
For Ferrazzi , networking is about making a difference , exploring , learning , connecting .
For Ferrazzi , it 's the conscious construction of his life 's path .
As conversations with Ferrazzi and his peers reveal , the network functions precisely because those with money and power know the rules .
There 's recognition of mutual need .
There 's certainty that investing time and energy in building personal relationships with the right people will pay dividends .
And here is the point : the majority of " one percenters , " as Ferrazzi calls the ultrarich and powerful who inhabit the territory he now travels , are one percenters because they understand this dynamic -- because , in fact , they themselves used the network to arrive at their present station .
They are forthright in their pursuits , almost unconsciously conspiratorial in their collective and mutual understanding that real networking -- life - permeating networking -- is a requisite part of the game .
It 's not crass .
For those who wield this kind of power , it 's mandatory .

Where to Meet the Power Elite
Keith ferrazzi's favorite places to hang with other people on the rise .
Young Presidents ' Organization ( YPO ) .
The organization is for executive managers under the age of 44 and has regional chapters across the United States .
Political fund - raisers .
Although Ferrazzi once ran for office as a Republican , he no longer openly discusses his political affiliation .
Why ?
So he can have access to both parties .
He does 3 to 10 fund - raisers at home each year , supporting both regional and national politicians .
It 's easy pickings at the nexus of money and passion .
Conferences .
" Have something unique to say and become a speaker " is Ferrazzi 's hard - and - fast rule on attending business conferences .
Networking is never easier than when people are coming to you .
Davos World Economic Forum .
Held at the end of January or beginning of February each year , Davos is where corporate chieftains and political heavies discuss making the world better while slaloming the Alps .
Your best chance of being invited is if you run a multinational or know someone who does .
Many of Ferrazzi's most important relationships -- including Nike 's Phil Knight -- have come from Davos .
Nonprofit boards .
Ferrazzi suggests starting out by finding four or five issues that are important to you and then supporting them locally .
Eventually , the goal is to become a board member .
Renaissance Weekend .
Bill Clinton 's favorite New Year 's event ( and , not surprisingly , the place that generated quite a few political appointments ) is arguably the network of networks .
If you 're not a celebrity , a politician , or a friend of a friend , tough luck .
This party , held in Charleston , S.C. , is invitation only .
Any airplane 's first - class cabin .
First class is where the bigwigs sit when they fly .
When Ferrazzi was at Deloitte Consulting , he 'd pay for his own upgrades , and he eventually generated enough business to get the company to pay his way .
There 's a trick , however , to making it work .
" You 've got one shot at starting a conversation , " he says , " and that 's when someone is eating .
They 're bored and more receptive than at any time during the flight . "
TED Conferences .
This annual gathering in February in Monterey , Calif. , brings together the well - connected nerd set under the theme " Technology , Entertainment , and Design . "
It 's not hard to get an invitation , and the players come out for the heavy mingling , deal making , and often - interesting , if esoteric , seminars .
Allen & Co. 's Conference .
New York investment banker Herb Allen organized the first event in 1983 to bring media moguls together at a lush ski resort in Sun Valley , Idaho , to do one thing : make deals .
Very big deals .
It looks like the raid on The Pirate Bay and confiscation of its servers upset somebody .
That 's one conclusion to be drawn from the sudden unavailability of the web site of Sweden 's national police .
Beginning last night , the the site came under a widespread and intense denial of service attack , according to National Police Administration Director Lars Lindahl .
" Our homepage had to handle 500,000 visits per second and it's obviously not going to handle that .
It 's sort of like 10,000 people calling the same phone switch at once . "
According to Lindahl , the attack began at 9:30 pm local time .
Judging by the time it 's taking to load polisen.se , the attack seems to be still going on in full force , despite assurances that the site would be back up by now .
The Swedish police are investigating the origin of the attack .
Warner Music and Sony's web sites were also attacked , but in this case , a single Turkish hacker is thought to be responsible .
It 's doubtful that the hack is related to the DoS broadside against the Swedish police , although the timing is interesting .
The Pirate Bay is arguably the largest and most popular torrent site in the world , and news of the raid was met with great dismay by fans of the site .
Piratpartiet , a Swedish political party affiliated with a view on copyright very similar to The Pirate Bay , has called the raid illegal .
They have also accused the Swedish government of responding to pressure from American media companies , a concern shared by others in the country .
" We want to find out whether pressure from the U.S. government was behind the action , " Center Party spokesman Johan Linander said .
" I think all of this smells of direct political influence and we want to reach clarity about who really did what . "
Three people affiliated with the torrent site were taken into custody after the raid and have since been released .
Swedish police say that despite their release , they still face possible criminal charges .
The Pirate Bay maintains that the raid was a violation of Swedish law and that the site will be back up " soon , " operating from another country this time .
In the meantime , Piratpariet and the Pirate Bureau are organizing " Pirate Demonstration Saturday , " a protest in Stockholm beginning at 3 pm local time .
" This is no longer about just a raid on the Pirate Bay , but has become a major justice scandal .
We have contacted all Parliamentary parties and their youth organizations regarding a demonstration we are planning , " says Pirate Bureau spokesman Marcin de Kaminski .
Let 's be clear about one thing : taking a law enforcement site offline with a DoS attack is bad , m'kay ?
That said , it is apparent that the action against The Pirate Bay has struck a nerve with the public .
It 's doubtful that this marks the start of any widespread backlash against Hollywood , the MPAA , and the RIAA .
But in Sweden , this looks to be turning into a major political scandal , as accusations of knuckling under to US influence are growing .

I 've compiled a list of 10 things every first time Mac owner , particularly Mac Mini owner , should know about their new computer and operating system .
This article should answer some burning questions , enlighten you about some features you did not know about OS X and just all around be helpful .
Enjoy .
Any questions can be directed towards me here .
I wrote this for 123MacMini .
256 Wo n't Cut It
Upgrading to 512MB of DDR RAM is suggested and will get you off to using a Mac on the right foot while an upgrade to 1GB will really unleash some speed .
More RAM means you can have more applications open at the same time and decreased boot times .
I recommend 1GB for photoshop or other intensive application users .
Any memory rated DDR333 or higher will suffice .
If you can find one with a CAS latency of 2 or 2.5 , get that over one with a CAS of 3 .
If you 're not sure to go Crucial 's Mac section should be just what the doctor ordered .
No Need to Defrag
Whenever a PC is acting sluggish the first thing you hear people ask is " Have you tried defragging the hard drive ? "
However , this is not the case with Macs .
Based on the proven and reliable Unix architecture with a Mac OS Extended Journaled file system , you do n't have to worry about defragmenting your hard drive to boost access / reading / writing times ; it is done for you automatically .
( Technically , it is not being defragged but things are just put in their place with journaling )
Whenever your mac detects that it is fairly idle or you attempt to use a heavily fragmented file , it will start fixing up your filesystem .
This might explain some noises coming from your computer in the middle of the night ( assuming you left it on ) .
Although , if you feel so inclined there is an excellent program by the name of iDefrag , which I reviewed .

The Mac equivalent of CTRL - ALT - DEL to bring up a system tasks profiler for force quitting unresponsive tasks is CMD - OPTION - ESC ( or Windows - ALT - ESC if you are using a PC keyboard ) .
Just select the frozen application and hit Force Quit .
If a program is completely frozen , it will appear in red text .
Where Did That Window Go ?
You will quickly learn that when you minimize your applications , they go to the dock .
Specifically the items to the right of the bar in the dock menu are open finder windows or applications .
This is similar to the area where minimized applications go in the windows task bar .
Also , if a finder window is not minimized , but behind another open window you can bring it up by clicking on the finder icon in the dock .
Updates
You will want to occasionally check for updates from Apple by accessing the Apple menu and clicking on Software Update .
I recommend heading over to Apple > System Preferences >
Software Update and setting your Mac to automatically check for software updates weekly and download important updates in the background .
System Profiler
The System Profiler , accessible via Apple > About This Mac >
More Info , is the one stop shop for finding out anything about your Mac. Similar to Windows XP 's Administrative tasks and Device Manager , the System Profiler is easy to navigate and offers you a plethora of system information from application versions to the MAC address of your ethernet card .
Expose
Apple introduced Expose to OS X to make your life easier , so go ahead and use it to your heart 's content .
Go to Apple > System Preferences >
Dashboard & Expose and play with some of the settings to make those menial tasks more convienient to execute .
My favorite Expose tip is setting an active corner to open up Dashboard .
One simple mouse movement and Dashboard launches .
Login Items
A major annoyance with some applications is that upon installation they will automatically set themselves to run when you boot your computer .
For Windows XP , you would usually run msconfig to remedy this problem .
However in OS X you can access a similar menu in Apple > System Preferences > Accounts > Login Items .
From here you can add , remove and hide items that launch when you login .
Eject Optical Media
This is probably only a problem for those that are using non-Apple keyboards , that lack a CD Eject key .
Press and Hold F12 for 2 seconds to eject any CD or DVD .
An alternate method is dragging the CD icon on the desktop to the trash .
This will not delete it .
You can also use the Command - E keystroke .
Keyboard Shortcuts
If saving time and being productive is the name of the game , then keyboard shortcuts are for you .
The next time you are browsing around the menus of your favorite applications , take a glance at the right side of the menu to see if you find any shortcuts that can help you out .
Here are a few to get you started .

Oil from soybeans is the usual starting material for biodiesel .
Now , ARS scientists have found commercial potential for the glycerol that is a byproduct from making biodiesel .

New Citric Acid-Based Polymers for Agricultural Applications
By Sharon Durham
August 24 , 2005
A biodiesel fuel byproduct called glycerol and an agricultural commodity called citric acid can be chemically combined to produce biodegradable polymers that could be used in produce packaging and other products , according to Agricultural Research Service scientists .
Justin Barone , a chemist at the ARS Environmental Quality Laboratory in Beltsville , Md. , made the discovery while studying processes for improving the effectiveness of insecticides that contain citric acid as an active ingredient .
Citric acid washes away very quickly in the environment , limiting its effectiveness .
Barone found that molecules containing hydrogen and oxygen -- such as glycerol , sorbitol or polyethylene glycol - - reacted with citric acid to produce polymers with citric acid groups in them .
The materials formed are biodegradable polyesters .
Further study showed that the viscosity of the material can range from the consistency of paint to a slow - to - dissolve , glasslike product , depending on how the chemical reaction takes place .
The new biodegradable polymers may provide the biodiesel industry with a new use for glycerol , which is now disposed of after the biodiesel is made .
In addition , citric acid is used in the food industry as a retardant to browning in cut fruits and vegetables .
The new citric acid - based polyesters may prove useful as a packaging material .
Studies are under way to determine whether the new polymers would work as well as pure citric acid in these applications .

When Google purchased @ Last software , makers of an obscure but powerful 3D modeling tool called SketchUp ( not ketchup ) , it was n't clear what Google wanted to do with it .
Though a plugin for placing SketchUp models inside Google Earth maps already existed , it just did n't make sense to sell US $ 500 software packages when most everything else Google does is available for free .
Well , now SketchUp is free , too .
A scaled down version of the software is now available for download ( Windows only , with a Mac version in the works ) , with an attractive $ 0 price and no registration required .
It 's meant for personal use , and the more expensive Pro version is still there with more features and a license to make 3D models for commercial use .
Now anyone can play around with the modeling package to their heart 's content , as opposed to the eight - hour trial version that used to be the only way to experience Sketch Up for free .
Company representatives think that this is a world - changing moment , of course .
" Visionaries , utopians , virtual world builders : your time has come , " says the announcement in the Official Google Blog .
" The new Google SketchUp is for the do - it - yourselfer , the hobbyist — really anyone who wants to build 3D models for use in Google Earth . "
There are some nice demos and tutorials available , and they really do make 3D modeling look easy and fun .
Through the use of a traditional toolbar speckled with buttons and some contextual menus , you just click - drag and drag - drop things around to shape your model outlines , pull a box out of a rectangle , and massage the edges into new shapes .
The texturing is equally simple , and both textures and models can be downloaded from a central online repository called Google 3d Center .
Now the business idea is starting to make sense .
Google may have looked at the success of mod communities , mashups , and open APIs , and thought that encouraging a massive influx of modeling help for Google Earth could help drive traffic to the mapping tool .
Right now , I do n't see any way to make your own 3D version of the street you live on an official feature in the public Earth maps , but something tells me that it 's coming sooner or later .
What you can do is make your model , enter information about it , and upload it to the 3D center for everyone to use .
Mapping data could be added fairly easily , and if you built your model on top of a Google map to begin with , mapping coordinates and the like could be part of the model 's metadata already .
It would then be a simple matter of approving models for official use .
That could be a quick and easy way for Google to get us users to build accurate VR version of the Las Vegas strip or the art deco district in Miami Beach .
When the touristy locations have been built , the company could drop down to having a couple of volunteers approve the next tier of importance as time permits .
Maybe there could be multiple versions of some locations —
New Orleans before and after Katrina , for example .
And with the business tie-ins and advertising possibilities that Google Earth brings to the table , enticing people to take virtual strolls down virtual streets , storefronts and all , could be a very profitable proposition .
It seems to be another example of Google thinking like a master marketer , not a one - trick search engine .
SketchUp could be just another cog in the big machine , and maybe a few years from now , Google can go all Snow Crash on us with a fully fleshed - out virtual reality .

A recent study examining how the brain reacts to different types of image has found that women show a quicker reaction to erotic images than other image types .
This is the first time that a difference in brain activity for erotic images has been found in women .
The research was led by neuroscientist Andrey Anokhin and used a technique that measures electrical activity from the brain by recording event - related potentials or ERP .
ERP is not very good at detecting which exact areas activity comes from , but can detect changes over very short periods of time ( less than a millisecond ) .
This makes it very good for determining differences in when the brain reacts .
Previous studies have found that men tend to show a stronger physiological response to erotic images than other images , as well as having larger areas of brain active when viewing such images .
Until now , no difference between erotic and non-erotic images had been found in women .
The study found that erotic images differently activated the mid part of the female prefrontal cortex ( the red area in the image on the left ) when compared to other images , within 185 ms .
Interestingly , this was regardless of how arousing or emotionally strong the images were .
185 ms is an incredibly short time for the brain to differentiate between image types , and is almost certainly an automatic response .
The prefrontal cortex is known to be involved in attention , and the authors suggest this activity reflects a vigiliance for socially relevant visual scenes .
When taken with the other research in the area , these findings suggests that men and women show differences in both where and when brain activity occurs when viewing erotic images .
However , it is still not clear what these differences might mean , and more extensive studies will need to be conducted to better understand this response .
It is also interesting that Anokhin and colleagues did n’t ask the female participants about sexual activity , orientation or a number of other things ( such as stage in the menstrual cycle ) that might affect reaction to erotic images .
It may be that these might have their own unique effect upon the new form of response reported in this study .

We can report that the skies over South East England have been swarming with Spitfires and Hurricanes this month .
Is there a war on ?
Well , yes .
In 1991 , the historian Howard Zinn described the two →
BEIJING , July 27  A violent protest erupted last weekend at a factory in southern China that makes toys for McDonald ’s and other international companies , a rights group said Thursday , and the local police were called to the scene to restore order .
China Labor Watch , a New York - based labor rights group , described in a news release a riot by more than 1,000 workers protesting low pay and poor living conditions at the factory in the industrial city of Dongguan .
However , a distributor for the factory said the unrest was not about wages or conditions but was instead prompted by a disgruntled worker who had been laid off .
Efforts to reach factory workers on Thursday were unsuccessful .
A police officer in Dongguan confirmed by telephone that officers had been summoned to the factory , but he refused to describe what happened .
An account of the matter posted at Tianya Club , a popular Chinese Internet forum , told of a violent clash between workers and security guards that had spilled out of two dormitories .
The anonymous writer said workers had opened fire hydrants to push back guards and cars were overturned and computers smashed until the riot police finally took control of the factory .
Christian group backs off case against blog parody
By Jon Swartz , USA TODAY
SAN FRANCISCO  A Christian group that promotes heterosexuality Thursday quietly dropped its beef against a blogger who poked fun at it .
Exodus International initially claimed the altered image of one of its billboards by Justin Watt infringed its copyright .
But Exodus is no longer pursuing the matter after Watt stopped using its " watermark " logo , Exodus President Alan Chambers said .
Watt , operator of the Justinsomnia blog , says he exercised free speech when he parodied the Exodus billboard , which says , " Gay ? Unhappy ? www.exodus.to. "
Wyatt re-created the billboard on his site so it read , " Straight ?
Unhappy ? www.gay.com. "
( Exodus uses " .to " as its domain suffix because " .com " was not available . )
Watt , 26 , a Web developer in Northern California who enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union and high - powered law firm Fenwick & West , has posted his blog for four years .
He posted the parody Sept. 19 because he found Exodus ' message " offensive . "
A lawyer representing Exodus sent Watt a cease - and - desist letter on March 2 .
The dust - up has made Watt a cause célèbre among bloggers .
More than 40 other websites now carry the spoof .
Had the dispute escalated , it would have extended the debate over fair use of copyrighted material beyond print and electronic media and to blogs , says copyright attorney Tom Zellerbach .
Companies frequently ask websites to remove images and text out of concern they infringe copyrighted material .
But high - profile cases involving bloggers have been rare , Zellerbach and other lawyers say .
The incident gained attention because Watt understood his rights and contacted an attorney , said ACLU lawyer Ann Brick , who represented him .
" We do n't know how often people get cease - and - desist letters and pull material without knowing their rights , " she said .
" Just as the First Amendment allows Exodus to post its billboard , it gives Justin the right to post a parody , " Brick said .
There is a thriving black market in babies in China
The advertisement was reportedly placed on eBay 's Chinese website , Eachnet .
Boys were advertised for 28,000 yuan ( $ 3,450 ) while girls were offered for 13,000 yuan ( $ 1,603 ) , Eachnet manager Tang Lei told the China Daily .
The offer could have been a hoax , but it comes as baby trafficking is seen as an increasing problem in China .
China 's strict " one child " birth control policy , coupled with the traditional bias for male children , has led to widespread reports of child abductions , and several people have been sentenced to death for their part in smuggling rings .
According to Eachnet , the advertisement was registered in Shanghai on 16 October .
The seller , under the user name " Chuangxinzhe Yongyuan " or " innovator forever " , said the babies would be available within 100 days of their birth .
The seller said the service was being provided for the benefit of China 's millions of infertile couples .
All the children were described as coming from Henan province in central China .
Although no deals were struck , more than 50 people browsed the listing before it was removed , including one who left an enquiry .
According to Tang Lei , the website automatically screens all the postings it receives .
But the word " baby " is not seen as a forbidden term because so many baby products are advertised on the site .
Mr Tang admitted the posting may have been a hoax - but he added that , if not , the person responsible for the attempted sale could face many years in prison or even the death penalty .
I am my own worst enemy when it comes to achieving my deadline goals .
These are tips / reminders I ’ve found useful through work experience .
Most of the tips are general , but some are specifically suited to programmers / engineers in situations with long compile / simulation phases ( compiling is the act of building an executable , simulation is the act of running it to completion ) .
Do I follow these ?
Of course not .
But I should .
General Office Productivity Tips :
Procrastination .
It comes down to inertia and momentum .
Understand the problem .

Just do it .
Attack the problem , no matter how feeble the attempt .
Even if you throw out the work , it increases your understanding .
It is better try fail than to waste time on something unrelated .
Like writing a blog post or checking the InterWeb .

Go for a walk .
Ca n’t focus ?
Get away from your desk and stimulate the blood flow to your brain .
A change of scenery can unplug a mental block .
Interruptions .
What is of concern is n’t the time lost servicing the interrupt , it is the time spent context switching back to the original problem .
Interrupting someone in flow can take 15 minutes for them to get back to the point they were at before the interruption occurred .
Net connectivity .
Close email , web browser and any messenger programs .

Maximize use of time .
Know what time of day you are most effective and schedule the interruptions / meetings to the time when you are not .
Environment .
The key is to create a work environment that is free of distractions so that when you ’ve achieved flow you can maintain your focus on the problem at hand .
Noise .
Noise cancellation headsets or headphones with music can cut down on the distracting nature of open concept cube farm hell .
Be kind to your co-workers and never use a portable radio or your computer speakers unless you are working late alone .
If you ’re going to have an extended discussion with someone move to a break room or an empty conference room .

Snacks .
Have food around so that hunger can be satisfied without leaving the building .
Do n’t let your belly be a source of distraction .
Nothing that will rot should be left out of sight .
Some good low - fat choices : apples , cans of tuna , microwave popcorn , turkey sandwiches ( if you have access to a fridge ) .

Hydration .
Have a bottle / cup of water on your desk that you can sip from throughout the day .
The short term gains made from drinking coffee is n’t worth the long term loses on memory , dehydration , and the productivity lose from caffeine crashes .
Non -caffeinated herbal teas such as peppermint can be useful for weaning yourself from coffee .

Clutter .
I am not hypocritically recommending clean desks , but file away any papers that are n’t germane to the problem at hand .
When it comes time to search the mountain of looseleaf , at least you will be looking at stuff related to what you are working on .
Manage Expectations .
The biggest secret to getting more work done is having less work to do .
Give feedback .
Do not tell management what they want to hear , tell them what you think will happen .

Under commit and over deliver .
Realistic schedules give room to do a better job instead of fighting to keep your head above water .
Avoid Burnout .
This is the most important tip .
Meet the deadline in a sane manner .
Ever waste half an hour because you were looking at the wrong results ?
Ever make a minor two character typo that drastically changed results and was very insidious to find because it ‘ looked right ” ?
If you were more alert that would not have happened .
Relax .
Find the balance between enough stress to motivate but not so much stress that you lose the ability to see the simplest solutions and recognize time sinks before you fall into them .

Minimum overtime .
An hour of overtime is less than a regular hour of work because you ’re reducing your overall ability to produce when you do n’t get proper rest .
Find a balance between working hard and working smart .

Do n’t force alertness .
Much like a sleep debt , forcing alertness with caffeine or other stimulates will eventually develop a dependency on them to achieve a baseline state .
Programming Specific Tips :
Complexity .
Do n’t create more work for yourself than is needed .
Only code what is needed .
If a feature ‘ might be useful ’ then code it later when it is necessary .
If a feature ‘ might be useful ’ then code it later when it is necessary .
Simplest solution is the best solution .
K.I.S.S. Every line coded is a line that potentially has to be debugged .
Focus your debugging effort on solving the problem , not on debugging bells and whistles that do n’t contribute to the deadline .
More time is lost in debugging an unnecessarily complex feature then in designing it .

More time is lost in debugging an unnecessarily complex feature then in designing it .
Notes to yourself .
Put comments in your code with standard identifiers such as “ TODO ” and “ FIXME ” that you can come back to later to add the improvements you did n’t add the first time .
Putting the date you added that comment is optional , but can help during a code cleanup ( sorry , I mean “ refactoring ” ) five years later .
Multiple build / project directories .
“ Hey , can you check out the latest version of this file to see if my changes work ? ”
Except it ’s never just one file , and the changes never work the first time .
Checking code out into your working copy is not just an interruption , but can lose an entire afternoon trying to re-achieve the state you were at before updating that “ one file ” .
Having multiple directory trees ( hard drive space is cheap ) can remove this problem .
Working .
What you currently have checked out any are working on .
Only checkout code when you ’ve already verified it works using the Stable / Branch directories .

Branch / Current .
The absolute latest checked in version of all code .
Decompose .
Problems seem more daunting when you ca n’t see the trees for the forest .
Breaking it up into smaller tasks not only reduces procrastination , but it also can increase performance time .
Design assumptions .
Create small unit proofs of any design assumption upfront so that you know the design will work before investing time and energy .

Strawman Integration .
When rapidly prototyping a smaller subset of the design you are pushing the integration issues until the end .
It is best to do an upfront integration of a strawman of your design to make sure there are n’t any major gotchas and then continue with the prototyping .
Reduce dependencies .
Debugging a rapid prototype can be much faster because you do n’t have as many sources of errors to look at .

Smallest solution space .
Reduce the unit testbench to only what is necessary to run your prototype .
The goal is to reduce the time between starting a simulation run and getting results during development .
Keep the inherent downtime in your job from interrupting your flow .
You should n’t have time to think about something other than the problem at hand ( ie : Checking Slashdot .
Checking this blog is okay ) .

Symbolic links .
Set up the file structure such that you can run your small unit testbench in parallel with the main design , ie : symbolically link to where any files will exist in the real design .
It may still be useful down the road when you want to isolate a problem .

Metrics .
It is much easier to grab profiling / coverage metrics from a smaller testbench that you can iterate many , many times more often then the main design .
The statistics might not be “ real world ” , but they can still be helpful .

The statistics might not be “ real world ” , but they can still be helpful .
Design for debug .
Litter your code with error assertions when they receive unexpected values or hit unexpected states .
If necessary add a debugging define so that these assertions can be turned off in the production code but turned on again when you encounter a problem .
Assertions to test inputs and outputs for illegal values and raise a big red flag will save you a lot of time when integrating .
Parallelism .
If you have access to multiple CPUs or a server farm then use them !
Pipeline .
If the compile / simulate / debug flow has dead cycles where you are “ waiting for results ” , then you can make use of those cycles by breaking the work down into distinct units that can be pipelined in parallel .
This keeps you actively solving the problem instead of getting caught up in procrastination and servicing interrupts .

Tracking .
Keep a piece of paper ( or use your engineering lab book ) beside your desk to write down reminders of where you left off in the parallel problems .

Always run something .
The goal is to always have something running in the background while you develop during the cycles where you would instead be waiting for results .
It could be as simple as seeing if what you are working on compiles properly while you ’re working on something else .

Factor CSS
for web developers � web interface , Linux
This tool takes a CSS stylesheet on input and produces an almost equivalent stylesheet on output , but with rulesets split , combined , and reordered to " factor out " common declarations .
This helps reveal shared components .
The resulting stylesheet may also be smaller .
The only known case where the output is not equivalent to the input is when the stylesheet depends on the order of rules ( see CSS 2.1 6.4.1 ) .
The Haskell source is available .

Anti-cartoon protests have taken place all over the world
The attacks typically replace home pages with pro-Islam messages and condemn the publication of the images .
Hack attack monitoring group Zone - H said the defacements were done both by hacker groups and individuals .
Zone - H said some hackers left moderate messages but many called for a violent response to the cartoons ' publication .
Fast response
" We have never seen so many defacements that are politically targeted in such a short time , " said Roberto Preatoni , founder and administrator of Zone - H .
" What is extraordinary for this Danish case is the speed in which the community united , " he added .
Mr Preatoni said monitoring of hacker chat channels revealed that hackers and groups in different Islamic nations had banded together to make the protests more effective .
Attacks were known to have come from groups in Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Oman and Indonesia .
Many of the groups involved in the attacks were well known , said Mr Preatoni , but some new ones had emerged as the attacks unfolded .
There was even evidence that the protests had brought one older hacker out of retirement just to make his feelings known .
Hackers used net chat channels to co-ordinate attacks
Many of the messages that replaced the home pages on hacked sites simply condemned the publication of the cartoons in Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten on 30 September 2005 .
Some messages called for boycotts of Danish goods .
Other messages warned against mocking Muhammad and some told the Danes to expect a violent response .
More than 900 Danish websites have suffered defacement during the wave of attacks , said Mr Preatoni .
He added that a further 1600 Western sites have also been attacked and defaced as part of the same protest .
Many of the defacements were cleared up quickly , said Mr Preatoni .
" Generally a defacement , if it 's happening on a home page , is usually replaced within a day . "
However , he added , secondary defacements buried within a website can last for months or years before they are found and removed by website administrators .
It was likely that many of the Western sites hacked came from ready prepared lists of sites that were vulnerable to attack .
However , said Mr Preatoni , readily available scanning tools made it easy to find and profile those Danish sites ripe for defacement .
Most of the sites targeted were run by small organisations and companies that do not have dedicated security workers and cannot keep up with the latest alerts and patches for vulnerabilities .
So far , said Mr Preatoni , there was little evidence that western hacker groups were taking any action in retaliation for the Islamic attacks .
There are no such things as marrows in the United States .
Americans call them something else .
This may seem an insignificant matter to you , but it became very vexing indeed to Nick Park when he was working on his new Wallace & Gromit film with Hollywood money .
" You see , in the film , Gromit is growing his own prize marrow for a giant vegetable competition at Lady Toddington 's manor house , " says Park .
So what 's the problem ?
" At one point Wallace says , ' How 's your prize marrow ? ' "
Park overaccentuates the pronunciation of the word " marrow " to show the mouth shape necessary .
" We 'd already animated that scene .
We 'd done all the work fitting the mouth shape , second by second , to the word ' mar - row ' .
But it turns out that marrow is called squash in America . "
Park mouths the word " squash " to show what a different mouth shape the word would require if you had to , as he and his animators did , set those shapes in Plasticine .
Such is claymation , Park 's chosen form of expression , a technique in which Plasticine is minutely changed from shot to shot to give the illusion of 3D movement .
A reshoot could have taken days , perhaps even weeks .
It did n't matter .
Jeffrey Katzenberg , CEO of DreamWorks Animation , the Hollywood studio that has bankrolled Wallace & Gromit's $ 80 m ( £ 44 m ) feature film debut , told Park , not unpleasantly , that there was a big marrow issue and it needed to be sorted out .
It was to be one of several culture clashes between the diffident , Plasticine - sculpting Englishman and the plain - speaking American studio boss during the five years it took to make Wallace & Gromit : The Curse of the Were - Rabbit .
The film is the second release in the five - picture deal between DreamWorks and Aardman Animations .
The first , Chicken Run ( whose stars were also made of the putty stuff ) , took over $ 100 m in the US alone , making it one of Britain 's most successful films .
Katzenberg was clearly delighted : he saw big money in Plasticine .
But by then , years had passed since Wallace and Gromit had had their last adventure and Park was obviously getting withdrawal symptoms .
Chickens had provided a temporary respite , but it was clear that working with the toothy northern nerd and mouthless dog was where Park 's heart lay .
So Wallace and Gromit were released from their temperature - controlled store and their first feature - length film was born .
And with it , one imagines , a slight unease at DreamWorks HQ .
W&G has a very British sensibility about it - Wensleydale cheese , flat caps and , of course , marrows are likely to be lost on much of American market .
" If there is a culture clash , " says Park , " it mainly comes from the fact that DreamWorks are looking out for the American audience .
It 's not so much the east and west coasts , but that big majority in the middle .
They 're always reminding us of the difficulty they have in understanding British accents or terminology or labels for things .
So we had a big thing with marrows .
And we did n't want to compromise . "
But it was n't just a matter of creative compromise , or of Park and co-director Steve Box staying true to Wallace 's Lancastrian character .
There were practical issues at stake .
Park ,
Box and their team of 30 animators would have had to unplug Wallace 's Plasticine mouth , fit another one with a different shape , re-sculpting the Plasticine several times .
Given that one day 's work , at best , yields around two seconds of film , this was not a small matter .
So what did they do ?
" We eventually agreed to change it , " says Park , " but only for the American audience , from ' marrow ' to - " he pauses for effect " - ' melon ' ! "
Why ?
" Because it 's the only appropriate word we could find that would fit with the mouth shape for ' marrow ' .
Melon apparently works over there .
So we have Wallace saying , ' How 's your prize . . . melon ? "
In a telling indication of the way things are going , Aardman 's animators have been moved en masse to DreamWorks '
Burbank studios to work on their next feature : an entirely computer - generated affair called Ratropolis , in which Park is not involved .
Park has managed to stay in Bristol with his Plasticine and keep DreamWorks at arms ' length .
So how has he managed to continue working with Katzenberg , a man not noted for being backward in coming forward ?
" We got on quite well , actually .
He 's a nice guy .
But in any case , the fact that a guy over in Hollywood has such faith in Wallace & Gromit and Aardman that he will support us is an incredible situation . "
He was , he says , on the phone to Katzenberg pretty much every day during the film 's five - year production .
" And then he flies over every 10 weeks on his private jet .
He lands at Filton [ aerodrome near Bristol ] and comes in for eight hours of viewing .
He comes to script meetings .
It 's basically story stuff he gets involved in .
He does n't really get involved in technical things .
But he often makes comments and we either ignore them . . . no , I do n't mean that !
We do listen .
But some things we just can't do .
He seems to respect that . "
Not that it 's always easy .
" Jef frey 's also very good at coming in and making quite cutting comments .
Being American , he just says everything with great belief and no self - doubt at all .
There 's no ' Well , erm , would n't it be better if . . . ' or ' Maybe not , that 's just my opinion . '
There 's none of that .
It 's : ' This is the way .
You should do this . '
But I 've learned that he does n't expect me to do everything he says . "
The film has an A - list voice cast including Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes - but the idea for it came when Park and Bob Baker ( who wrote Wallace & Gromit adventures The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave ) were in the more humble setting of their local pub .
" At first it was called Wallace & Gromit and the Veggieburglars , and it was about these rabbits who keep invading Wallace and Gromit 's vegetable plot , and then we started to develop that into an idea of a great rabbit beast who comes to town .
A were - rabbit as opposed to a werewolf , because it seemed to fit the Wallace and Gromit world . "
Park and Baker were inspired by the venerable cycle of Universal studio horror movies .
" They 're all filled with blood and guts and we thought that that could really suit Wallace and Gromit 's world because it 's absurd .
It 's about people locking up their vegetables rather than their children . "
Park says that the reason he originally decided to express himself in Plasticine - a medium that requires such a meticulous temperament - rather than anything less arduous or more glamorous , came down to the simple question of economics .
" Plasticine was available when I was a teenager and started doing animation .
I wanted to be like Disney , trying to film with plastic cels , but it was all too expensive .
I did n't have enough money to buy cels , at least not enough to make more than four - and - half seconds of animation .
But Plasticine was around , user - friendly and available to the masses .
It was great because all you needed was camera , an Anglepoise lamp and a table .
And you would make whatever you like come out of a blob of Plasticine . "
He was inspired by Peter Lord and David Sproxton , who themselves had been drawing cartoons and animating clay as a hobby .
The pair managed to sell a 20 - second cartoon featuring a deadpan superhero called Aardman to the BBC TV programme Vision On .
This success led them to establish Aardman Animations in 1976 , and to develop a claymation character called Morph , who appeared in the children 's art series Take Hart .
" I used to see what Pete and Dave were doing with their early stuff on TV for Vision On , which was a great , inspiring programme , " says Park .
" In a way my ambitions were n't to do anything more than Morph , really .
I just wanted to come up with ideas . "
The 46 - year - old Preston - born animator started making the first Wallace & Gromit film , A Grand Day Out , when he was a student at Sheffield City Polytechnic ( now Sheffield Hallam University ) .
After working with Sproxton and Lord for a couple of summers while he was studying at the National Film and Television School , Park was taken on at Aardman , and finished A Grand Day Out .
He also worked on the short animated film Creature Comforts , in which an off - camera interviewer asks claymation animals what they think about living in a zoo .
It won Park an Oscar for best animated short film , the first of three - the others were also for Wallace & Gromit adventures : The Wrong Trousers in 1993 and A Close Shave in 1995 .
In one interview , Sproxton said that his ideal was to make something for the Magic Roundabout slot on BBC1 , that buffer between children 's programmes and the adult early evening news in the 1970s .
Did Park have similar kidult aspirations ?
" I 've never heard the phrase ' kidult ' before !
But I think I know what it means .
I think I 've always had a strong memory of what I loved as a child , the kinds of things I grew up with and the atmospheres in films I loved .
The magic evoked by films in the music or the lighting and the stories . "
And you wanted to evoke those memories in your own work ?
" Very much so .
I grew up with a lot of eastern European films on BBC2 .
The Singing Ringing Tree , The Tinderbox - I loved those .
And all the animation from Canada .
But I was also inspired by all sorts of films , especially thrillers , and a lot of Hitchcock ; I saw The Birds as a child and it inspired me .
" As a teenager , I was split in about 10 different directions .
Part of me wanted to be like Ray Harryhausen .
Part of me wanted to be like Terry Gilliam , that really bizarre , surreal stuff .
I was such a big fan of his .
And I wanted to be like Bob Godfrey who did Roobarb and Custard .
I loved the fuzziness . "
If you were a kid now , would you be working in CGI rather than Plasticine ?
" I probably would want to have a go at it .
I fundamentally like drawing cartoons really and that 's gone into Plasticine form .
But there 's something I like about just making characters out of clay . "
Are you not tempted to make a live - action film with real actors ?
" Not really .
I have been offered stuff , actually , but I do n't really have much ambition to do live action , because I think I would be a bit out of my depth .
Well , I would n't mind having a go , but I would n't like to try anything too big . "
But he already has tried something very big .
Park has spent five years making a big - budget , feature - length film , while other movie directors churn out at least one a year , rarely with the same loving attention to detail that he insists on .
His art may be the cinematic equivalent of slow cooking , but his efforts have taken their toll .
He looks very tired .
" I 'm sleeping all the time now , " he says with the look of a man who should be lying in a darkened room with slices of giant cucumbers from Gromit 's vegetable patch over his eyes .
Are you happy with the film ?
" I think so .
I think we 've really hung on to that small , quirky Britishness -" his tired eyes twinkle for a moment " - made with Hollywood money ! "
A love affair played out in Plasticine
1976 Aardman Animations is founded in Bristol by Peter Lord and David Sproxton .
The following year they create Morph for the BBC 's children 's programme Take Hart .
1985 Nick Park finishes his postgrad course at the National Film and Television School and joins Aardman .
1986 The company creates a groundbreaking pop video for Peter Gabriel 's Sledgehammer .
Park contributes the dancing chicken sequence .
1989 Britain gets its first sight of Park's Creature Comforts , one of five short animations commissioned from Aardman by Channel 4 , and the first Wallace & Gromit film , A Grand Day Out , is shown at the British Short Film festival .
It was Park 's graduation project at the NFTS and cost £ 11,000 .
Lasting 23 minutes , it was made with characters built from Plasticine supported on metal frames .
Creature Comforts and A Grand Day
Out are nominated for best animated short at the following year 's Oscars .
Creature Comforts wins .
1990 Park 's series of commercials for Heat Electric airs on British television .
Closely based on Creature Comforts , they use the same technique of fitting vox pops of real people to animated characters .
The campaign is a great success but is often remembered , wrongly , as being for British Gas .
1993 The Wrong Trousers , Park 's second Wallace & Gromit film , is the highest - rated programme on the BBC's Christmas schedule .
At 30 minutes , and with a budget of £ 650,000 , it is Aardman 's most ambitious project to date , complete with dramatic lighting and Hitchcockian mise - en - scene .
" I really wanted The Wrong Trousers to have the look of a mini feature film , " says Park .
It wins an Oscar .
1995 A Close Shave is another huge Christmas success .
Although it is still only half - an - hour long , the film requires a much larger production team in order to be finished on deadline .
The budget this time is £ 1.3 m .
It wins another Oscar .
2000 Chicken Run is released in June , the first of Park 's five - picture deal with DreamWorks .
Based on The Great Escape , the film is 84 minutes long , costs an estimated $ 42 m and stars Mel Gibson .
It is a hit , but as it is not a short , it does n't win an Oscar .
It is credited , however , with bringing about the new Best Animated Feature category .
2003 In February , BBC3 launches on digital television , featuring a series of Creature Comforts - style animated " blobs " , created by Aardman , as its channel ident .

CROMWELL -- Local worm salesmen , beware .
As 13 - year - old Joe Cadieux learned recently , Cromwell can be a hostile environment for those looking to break into night crawler vending - particularly if they advertise with a yard sign .
A worm business that Joe has operated since he was 10 was shut down two weeks ago when Cromwell 's planning and zoning commission issued a cease - and - desist order because the teenager 's sign violated local zoning regulations .
" It 's ridiculous , " said the middle school student , who made $ 5 to $ 10 a month selling worms collected from his front yard , where they are plentiful after spring rainstorms .
Most of the worms he sold went to local fishermen , though Joe said one repeat customer dissected the worms with his Boy Scout troop .
He kept the worms in a basement drawer filled with bedding , and sold them in small blue containers .
" It 's not really like I 'm doing anything wrong , " he said .
But the town 's planning commission sees it differently .
The sign Joe stuck in his front yard on Washington Road to advertise his business , commission members said , violated local regulations on home businesses .
Joe 's stepfather , August Reil III , described the sign as a placard about 18 - by - 18 - inches , that read " Nite Crawlers " and listed Joe 's phone number .
" What kind of town am I living in where they 're going to put the kibosh on a 13 - year - old 's worm business ? "
Reil said .
" It was just to teach him the values of working and getting paid for it . "
Commission member Al Diaz said he mentioned the sign during a discussion of illegal business signs in town .
He said he told Cromwell 's zoning enforcement officer to deal with the problematic worm sign , which he said could hurt the residential character of the Washington Road area .
Diaz had seen the sign for years while driving through the area , he said .
" In a residential zone , if you want to put up a business and work out of your home you really need a special permit , " Diaz said .
" You come before the commission and state your case ... and then a decision is made .
Chiropractors do that , lawyers do that , doctors do that , and then you 're allowed to put up a sign . "
But is a night crawler business - whose 13 - year - old operator could n't even buy a full tank of gas for the family car with his summer earnings - like a doctor 's office , or is it just a creepy - crawly version of selling lemonade ?
Town Planner Craig Minor said town regulations are vague on businesses such as lemonade and farm stands .
In his opinion , the stands are allowed because they are considered customary use of property - just like a backyard barbecue , which does n't require an assembly permit , or a doghouse that does n't need special approval .
[ COMMENTARY ]
But the zoning regulations , he acknowledged , do not explicitly allow Joe 's night crawler placard .
While Diaz stood behind his decision Thursday , other town officials say the commission exceeded common sense in issuing the cease - and - desist order .
Just let the boy have his night crawler stand , said First Selectman Paul Beaulieu .
Reason , he said , should have stepped in when the regulations were vague .
" There 's the letter of the law , but there 's also common sense , " he said .
" This was over the top .
Kids selling night crawlers and lemonade are part and parcel of life in small - town Connecticut . "
Minor said the affected worm salesman can appeal the order to the zoning board of appeals , but Reil said the $ 130 fee to appeal is prohibitive for the night crawler business - Joe would have to sell over 500 worms just to break even .

The first full - scale audit of how Britain and its G8 partners have performed on their promises to the world 's poor since last year 's Gleneagles summit has revealed that rich countries are failing to meet almost all the targets they set themselves .
A year after billions watched last summer 's Live 8 concerts , the report , published by Data ( Debt , Aids , Trade , Africa ) - the organisation set up by Bob Geldof and the U2 singer Bono - said the industrialised countries had delivered on only one of their three priorities , debt relief .
They were " completely off track " on trade and were doing less than half of what was needed on aid .
On current trends , more than 1.5 million people would be deprived of treatment for HIV / Aids by 2010 .
Launching the report yesterday , Mr Geldof demanded Britain and the other rich countries of the G8 make good their promises in full amid this evidence of backsliding since last year 's summit .
" The full promises must be implemented and nothing else will do " , he said at a press conference .
" To the people who are backsliding , I say this : we are not going to give up . "
The Gleneagles summit was the high point of Britain 's presidency of the G8 in 2005 and - after strong pressure from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - the meeting agreed to cancel debts owed by the poorest countries to the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the African Development Bank , to increase aid by $ 50 bn ( £ 27.6 bn ) a year , and to agree a trade deal that would help African nations to export .
The government has been pressing other G8 nations to keep their promises , and Mr Blair this week set up a monitoring group chaired by Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , to ensure the momentum is maintained .
Britain , however , was one of the countries told by Data that it needs to do better on meeting the Gleneagles agenda .
France , the lobby group said , was the only G8 country that had met its aid commitment , with Britain using debt relief granted to Nigeria to swell its development assistance .
Nigeria paid $ 11bn to western creditors to rid itself of debt , including $ 3 bn to Britain - the equivalent of the UK 's entire aid budget for sub-Saharan Africa .
Once Nigerian debt relief was stripped out , UK aid had increased by only $ 211 m in 2005 , less than was needed to meet the Gleneagles goal .
" In order to keep its commitment , the UK must increase aid to Africa in 2006 by not less than $ 778 m , to a total of $ 4.249bn . "
Hilary Benn , the international development secretary , said : " The UK's aid budget is rising and will continue to do so .
Last year , our assistance to Africa increased by £ 140 m - and we have tripled aid to Africa since 1997 .
The Department for International Development exceeded its target to spend £ 1bn in Africa this year and this will rise to £ 1.25 bn in 2007 - 08 .
We 're the first government in British history to commit to a date to achieve the UN target of providing 0.7 % of national income as aid .
We 've set a timetable to reach 0.7 % by 2013 , two years ahead of the EU target of 2015 . "
Data said that given UK leadership and " its strong ownership of the overall Gleneagles pledge " , the pledge should be brought forward to 2010 .
In a foreword to the report , Nelson Mandela urged the millions of campaigners from 2005 to keep up the pressure .
" Because you came together and acted as one , world leaders made promises that have the potential to help millions escape the prison of poverty .
That is a great achievement .
But now we face the difficult task of making our governments turn their promises into the actions that will save millions of lives .
Do n't give up now - let your politicians know you are watching every step they take .
They made promises - now they must make them good . "
In a keynote speech this week , Mr Blair accepted that much of the $ 25 bn increase in aid in 2005 had been the result of debt relief to Nigeria and Iraq .
" We know that this means - for some - there is a real challenge to ensure aid figures do n't fall again in 2007 or 2008 .
But we are facing up to that challenge .
The truth is we have done a lot .
But we have got to do even more . "
Jamie Drummond , Data 's executive director , said the report showed that recent increases in effective aid were already saving lives .
" What 's also clear is that the G8 are not yet doing enough - or what they promised - to build on this proven success .
The G8 are completely off track on their trade promise to Africa and rates of increase are less than half what was promised on development assistance and the fight against HIV / Aids .
Thankfully , they have kept their debt promise .
" The challenge now is clear : to get back on track , the G8 must aggressively pick up the pace and offer not less than a $ 4bn increase in development assistance to Africa in 2006 and each year through to 2010 .
They also must demonstrate a far greater sense of ambition , urgency and focus on Africa in world trade talks . "
Delivering on the G8 promises would mean that by 2010 four million Africans with HIV / Aids in urgent need of life - saving treatment would have access to anti-retroviral drugs , 600,000 children 's lives would be saved from malaria and 30 million more children would go to school .
The Tory leader , David Cameron , yesterday used a speech to Oxfam to praise the prime minister and the chancellor for their efforts to combat global poverty and insisted the opposition would match Labour 's spending commitments on aid .
Mr Cameron said he would investigate giving aid vouchers to poor people , which would be redeemable for development services .
A finite set of registers , A , B , C , ... , each of which contains a natural number .
A list of numbered instructions .
Increment : increment takes two parameters : a register , and an instruction number .
It increments the value stored in the specified register , and then jumps to the instruction at the number .
Decrement : decrement takes three parameters : a register , and two instruction numbers .
If the value in the register is 0 , it jumps to the instruction at the first number ; if the value in the register is greater than zero , it decrements it , and jumps to the instruction at the second number .

3 : Incr( B,4 )
4 : Halt
I 've said before that all computing systems are ultimately equivalent .
This is something known as the Church - Turing thesis .
It 's interesting to look at one or two machines other than the Turing machine , just to get some idea of why we believe that , and what other computers might look like .
There 's a really fun computing machine designed by Marvin Minsky , an incredibly smart and prolific computer scientist .
He just called them " program machines " when he first proposed them ; most of us call them " Minsky Machines " .
I really like Minsky machines ; I find their programs much easier to read and write than Turing machine programs , and their behavior is closer to real computers .
The minsky machine is astoundingly simple : even simpler than the turing machine .
A minsky machine consists of : There are only three instructions in a minsky machine :
You start with the instruction at position 0 , and keep going until you hit a Halt .
Here 's a subtraction program for a minsky machine with two registers .
It takes two numbers in registers A and B , and leaves the result in A .
If it halts with anything but 0 in B , then it 's an error .
First , it decrements the value in register B ; if B is zero , then the subtraction is done , so it jumps to halt .
If B is greater than 0 , then it subtracts one from B , and then tries to subtract one from A .
If A is already zero , then it adds one to B ( to be sure that B != 0 ) and halts .
If A is n't zero , then it decrements it , and goes back to the beginning .
Now , here 's a question : is this really equivalent to a turing machine ?
Intuitively , you can problably get a sense that this is a complete effective computing system .
But how do we prove it ?
Well , we know that a two - stack push - down automaton is completely equivalent to a turing machine : the two stacks can simulate the parts of the tape on either side of the head .
And we know that if something can be done with a turing machine , it can be done with a binary ( two symbol ) turing machine .
So - we need to show that we can simulate a two - stack binary push - down automaton using a minsky machine .
A pushdown automaton is really just a FSM with two stacks .
Since we already showed we can implement fully general natural number subtraction with a Minsky machine , we know that we can implement an FSM : subtraction is strictly harder than anything an FSM can do - so if our machine can implement a general subtraction , it can implement an FSM .
So what we need to do is show that we can implement the stacks .
And that 's easy .
Here 's how you implement a stack with two registers : one register holds a binary number .
That binary number is the stack .
To push a value on the stack , you multiply by two , and add the value .
To pop the value on top of the stack , you take divide by two ; the result of the division is the popped stack , and the remainder is the value that was on top .
So you 've got the stack data in one register .
You need a second register to use to implement the multiplications and divisions .
So , if you 've got four registers , then you 've got two stacks .
Poof .
You 've got a turing machine .
Going the other direction , it should be pretty easy to see how to implement a Minsky machine with a turing machine .
To make things easy , we can use a multi- tape turing machine ( since we know that that 's no more powerful than a one - tape ) .
Each register is one tape , containing its value in unary ; and one tape contains the program .

POL COLUMNS « Sovereign Immunity Some Lessons from Washington State | False Claim »
Why New Vaccines Are Scarce By Theodore Dalrymple Reprinted from City Journal , 3/6/06
While mass immunization against infectious disease is one of western medicine 's great triumphs , it has always given rise to considerable anxiety and opposition .
In Britain , for example , opponents of vaccination against smallpox managed for 70 years to sustain a vigorous and popular political movement , as well as a journal with a wide circulation .
Supporting them were such ignorant luminaries as George Bernard Shaw and a number of doctors who claimed , among other things , that vaccination caused leprosy , quite apart from outbreaks of the very disease it supposedly prevented .
Immunization fears have swept through the western world ever since .
The dangers of immunization have sometimes appeared more real to the parents of young children than the dangers of traditional killers such as diphtheria , measles , and whooping cough .
Even the best scientific evidence never seems completely to refute the scare stories in the public mind : it is as if something had programmed most people to believe that there could be no smoke without fire .
In his enthralling The Cutter Incident : How America 's First Polio Vaccine Led to the Growing Vaccine Crisis ( Yale University Press ) , Paul Offit , professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania , tells the story of a genuine disaster caused by mass immunization �a disaster that was , however , embedded in an overall medical and scientific triumph : the elimination of polio from much of the world .
The incident was historically important not only because of the children damaged , but because it led to a legal ruling that subsequently inhibited pharmaceutical companies from developing and manufacturing vaccines .
If America now routinely has a shortage of vaccines , it is in part the long - term consequence of the Cutter Incident .
The basic research to produce a polio vaccine took place under the auspices of a voluntary association , the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , which organized the famous March of Dimes .
The foundation oversaw and funded more research on polio than did the rest of the world put together .
It was the foundation that carried out the first field trial of Jonas Salk�s vaccine and established that the vaccine ( which contained polio virus killed by formaldehyde ) was safe and effective .
It was the largest medical trial ever conducted , involving more than 400,000 participants .
It seemed that polio , which at the time terrorized parents ( my best friend was one of the last children in Britain to contract it , and my parents spent several weeks in dire fear that I had suffered infection also ) was about to go down to defeat .
At this point , the foundation withdrew and handed over its project to the government .
Five companies received licenses to produce the vaccine , including the Cutter Company of California .
The licensing authority , the Laboratory of Biologics Control , also issued instructions about how to produce the vaccine , but unfortunately those instructions proved in two respects less stringent than those that the foundation had issued prior to the first trial of the vaccine .
The foundation had stipulated that the manufacturers should report any difficulties in eliminating live virus from their vaccine , and also that they should be able to produce 11 successive lots of vaccine without live virus in it .
The Laboratory of Biologics Control made no such stipulation .
The Cutter Company , the smallest of the five producers , followed the instructions to the letter , which proved insufficient to guarantee the vaccine 's safety .
The company also made a couple of unfortunate technical mistakes , for which in the then current state of knowledge one could not blame it , with the result that live virus survived in some of its vaccine .
Seventy thousand of the immunized experienced the transient flu - like symptoms of mild polio , 200 wound up paralyzed by polio , and 10 died because of it .
In the modern world , when tragedy strikes , can tort be far behind ?
The plaintiffs ' lawyer was Melvin Belli , then the most famous and flamboyant tort lawyer in America .
The trial outcome was in a sense a draw , rather than an outright victory for the plaintiffs , but it established a principle that would be nearly fatal to the production of vaccines .
The trial established beyond reasonable doubt that Cutter had not been negligent .
But the judge stated �as a matter of law , so that the jury was powerless to disagree �that the company was liable for damages , even if it had done nothing wrong , simply because its product had harmed its recipients .
This principle of absolute liability soon found itself defended in legal journals on the grounds that a large company was best able , via its insurance , to distribute the costs of risks among all the relevant parties , and society as a whole would benefit from the arrangement .
Quite apart from its repugnance to natural justice , this principle has been disastrous to the manufacture of vaccines .
It opened the way for huge claims against the manufacturers .
Since the courts are often cavalier in their complete disregard of scientific evidence , awarding huge damages against companies not only innocent of any negligence but whose products have done no objectively demonstrable harm , it is not surprising that pharmaceutical companies have largely withdrawn from the vaccine market .
For them , the potential profits are small , and the risks great .
SmithKlineGlaxo , for example , one of the world 's largest vaccine producers , withdrew its safe and effective vaccine against Lyme disease because of the expense of defending it against speculative tort actions of no merit .
Offit suggests a sensible remedy : an extension of the powers of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , to the exclusion of all tort litigation surrounding vaccines .
Unless a remedy of this sort applies , he says , the sectional interest of a small group of people , the tort lawyers , will continue to inflict damage upon public health .
The Cutter Incident is an absolute model of its genre .
It is so tautly written that it reads like a good thriller , such that one is eager to find out what happened next .
Offit conveys the science with admirable clarity , and he presents the philosophical and legal issues simply but without simplification .
It is the best kind of medical history .

OVER the course of history it has been artists , poets and playwrights who have made the greatest progress in humanity 's understanding of love .
Romance has seemed as inexplicable as the beauty of a rainbow .
But these days scientists are challenging that notion , and they have rather a lot to say about how and why people love each other .
Is this useful ?
The scientists think so .
For a start , understanding the neurochemical pathways that regulate social attachments may help to deal with defects in people 's ability to form relationships .
All relationships , whether they are those of parents with their children , spouses with their partners , or workers with their colleagues , rely on an ability to create and maintain social ties .
Defects can be disabling , and become apparent as disorders such as autism and schizophrenia — and , indeed , as the serious depression that can result from rejection in love .
Research is also shedding light on some of the more extreme forms of sexual behaviour .
And , controversially , some utopian fringe groups see such work as the doorway to a future where love is guaranteed because it will be provided chemically , or even genetically engineered from conception .
The scientific tale of love begins innocently enough , with voles .
The prairie vole is a sociable creature , one of the only 3 % of mammal species that appear to form monogamous relationships .
Mating between prairie voles is a tremendous 24 - hour effort .
After this , they bond for life .
They prefer to spend time with each other , groom each other for hours on end and nest together .
They avoid meeting other potential mates .
The male becomes an aggressive guard of the female .
And when their pups are born , they become affectionate and attentive parents .
However , another vole , a close relative called the montane vole , has no interest in partnership beyond one - night - stand sex .
What is intriguing is that these vast differences in behaviour are the result of a mere handful of genes .
The two vole species are more than 99 % alike , genetically .
Why do voles fall in love ?
The details of what is going on — the vole story , as it were — is a fascinating one .
When prairie voles have sex , two hormones called oxytocin and vasopressin are released .
If the release of these hormones is blocked , prairie - voles ' sex becomes a fleeting affair , like that normally enjoyed by their rakish montane cousins .
Conversely , if prairie voles are given an injection of the hormones , but prevented from having sex , they will still form a preference for their chosen partner .
In other words , researchers can make prairie voles fall in love — or whatever the vole equivalent of this is — with an injection .
A clue to what is happening — and how these results might bear on the human condition — was found when this magic juice was given to the montane vole : it made no difference .
It turns out that the faithful prairie vole has receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin in brain regions associated with reward and reinforcement , whereas the montane vole does not .
The question is , do humans ( another species in the 3 % of allegedly monogamous mammals ) have brains similar to prairie voles ?
To answer that question you need to dig a little deeper .
As Larry Young , a researcher into social attachment at Emory University , in Atlanta , Georgia , explains , the brain has a reward system designed to make voles ( and people and other animals ) do what they ought to .
Without it , they might forget to eat , drink and have sex — with disastrous results .
That animals continue to do these things is because they make them feel good .
And they feel good because of the release of a chemical called dopamine into the brain .
Sure enough , when a female prairie vole mates , there is a 50 % increase in the level of dopamine in the reward centre of her brain .
Similarly , when a male rat has sex it feels good to him because of the dopamine .
He learns that sex is enjoyable , and seeks out more of it based on how it happened the first time .
But , in contrast to the prairie vole , at no time do rats learn to associate sex with a particular female .
Rats are not monogamous .
This is where the vasopressin and oxytocin come in .
They are involved in parts of the brain that help to pick out the salient features used to identify individuals .
If the gene for oxytocin is knocked out of a mouse before birth , that mouse will become a social amnesiac and have no memory of the other mice it meets .
The same is true if the vasopressin gene is knocked out .
The salient feature in this case is odour .
Rats , mice and voles recognise each other by smell .
Christie Fowler and her colleagues at Florida State University have found that exposure to the opposite sex generates new nerve cells in the brains of prairie voles — in particular in areas important to olfactory memory .
Could it be that prairie voles form an olfactory “ image ” of their partners — the rodent equivalent of remembering a personality — and this becomes linked with pleasure ?
Dr Young and his colleagues suggest this idea in an article published last month in the Journal of Comparative Neurology .
They argue that prairie voles become addicted to each other through a process of sexual imprinting mediated by odour .
Furthermore , they suggest that the reward mechanism involved in this addiction has probably evolved in a similar way in other monogamous animals , humans included , to regulate pair - bonding in them as well .
You might as well face it ...
Sex stimulates the release of vasopressin and oxytocin in people , as well as voles , though the role of these hormones in the human brain is not yet well understood .
But while it is unlikely that people have a mental , smell - based map of their partners in the way that voles do , there are strong hints that the hormone pair have something to reveal about the nature of human love : among those of Man 's fellow primates that have been studied , monogamous marmosets have higher levels of vasopressin bound in the reward centres of their brains than do non-monogamous rhesus macaques .
Other approaches are also shedding light on the question .
In 2000 , Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki of University College , London , located the areas of the brain activated by romantic love .
They took students who said they were madly in love , put them into a brain scanner , and looked at their patterns of brain activity .
The results were surprising .
For a start , a relatively small area of the human brain is active in love , compared with that involved in , say , ordinary friendship .
“ It is fascinating to reflect ” , the pair conclude , “ that the face that launched a thousand ships should have done so through such a limited expanse of cortex . ”
The second surprise was that the brain areas active in love are different from the areas activated in other emotional states , such as fear and anger .
Parts of the brain that are love - bitten include the one responsible for gut feelings , and the ones which generate the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine .
So the brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of people experiencing strong emotions , but instead like those of people snorting coke .
Love , in other words , uses the neural mechanisms that are activated during the process of addiction .
“ We are literally addicted to love , ” Dr Young observes .
Like the prairie voles .
It seems possible , then , that animals which form strong social bonds do so because of the location of their receptors for vasopressin and oxytocin .
Evolution acts on the distribution of these receptors to generate social or non-social versions of a vole .
The more receptors located in regions associated with reward , the more rewarding social interactions become .
Social groups , and society itself , rely ultimately on these receptors .
But for evolution to be able to act , there must be individual variation between mice , and between men .
And this has interesting implications .
Last year , Steven Phelps , who works at Emory with Dr Young , found great diversity in the distribution of vasopressin receptors between individual prairie voles .
He suggests that this variation contributes to individual differences in social behaviour — in other words , some voles will be more faithful than others .
Meanwhile , Dr Young says that he and his colleagues have found a lot of variation in the vasopressin - receptor gene in humans .
“ We may be able to do things like look at their gene sequence , look at their promoter sequence , to genotype people and correlate that with their fidelity , ” he muses .
It has already proved possible to tinker with this genetic inheritance , with startling results .
Scientists can increase the expression of the relevant receptors in prairie voles , and thus strengthen the animals ' ability to attach to partners .
And in 1999 , Dr Young led a team that took the prairie - vole receptor gene and inserted it into an ordinary ( and therefore promiscuous ) mouse .
The transgenic mouse thus created was much more sociable to its mate .
Love , love me do
Scanning the brains of people in love is also helping to refine science 's grasp of love 's various forms .
Helen Fisher , a researcher at Rutgers University , and the author of a new book on love* , suggests it comes in three flavours : lust , romantic love and long - term attachment .
There is some overlap but , in essence , these are separate phenomena , with their own emotional and motivational systems , and accompanying chemicals .
These systems have evolved to enable , respectively , mating , pair - bonding and parenting .
Lust , of course , involves a craving for sex .
Jim Pfaus , a psychologist at Concordia University , in Montreal , says the aftermath of lustful sex is similar to the state induced by taking opiates .
A heady mix of chemical changes occurs , including increases in the levels of serotonin , oxytocin , vasopressin and endogenous opioids ( the body 's natural equivalent of heroin ) .
“ This may serve many functions , to relax the body , induce pleasure and satiety , and perhaps induce bonding to the very features that one has just experienced all this with ” , says Dr Pfaus .
Then there is attraction , or the state of being in love ( what is sometimes known as romantic or obsessive love ) .
This is a refinement of mere lust that allows people to home in on a particular mate .
This state is characterised by feelings of exhilaration , and intrusive , obsessive thoughts about the object of one 's affection .
Some researchers suggest this mental state might share neurochemical characteristics with the manic phase of manic depression .
Dr Fisher 's work , however , suggests that the actual behavioural patterns of those in love — such as attempting to evoke reciprocal responses in one 's loved one — resemble obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
That raises the question of whether it is possible to “ treat ” this romantic state clinically , as can be done with OCD .
The parents of any love - besotted teenager might want to know the answer to that .
Dr Fisher suggests it might , indeed , be possible to inhibit feelings of romantic love , but only at its early stages .
OCD is characterised by low levels of a chemical called serotonin .
Drugs such as Prozac work by keeping serotonin hanging around in the brain for longer than normal , so they might stave off romantic feelings .
( This also means that people taking anti-depressants may be jeopardising their ability to fall in love . )
But once romantic love begins in earnest , it is one of the strongest drives on Earth .
Dr Fisher says it seems to be more powerful than hunger .
A little serotonin would be unlikely to stifle it .
Wonderful though it is , romantic love is unstable — not a good basis for child - rearing .
But the final stage of love , long - term attachment , allows parents to co-operate in raising children .
This state , says Dr Fisher , is characterised by feelings of calm , security , social comfort and emotional union .
Because they are independent , these three systems can work simultaneously — with dangerous results .
As Dr Fisher explains , “ you can feel deep attachment for a long - term spouse , while you feel romantic love for someone else , while you feel the sex drive in situations unrelated to either partner . ”
This independence means it is possible to love more than one person at a time , a situation that leads to jealousy , adultery and divorce — though also to the possibilities of promiscuity and polygamy , with the likelihood of extra children , and thus a bigger stake in the genetic future , that those behaviours bring .
As Dr Fisher observes , “ We were not built to be happy but to reproduce . ”
The stages of love vary somewhat between the sexes .
Lust , for example , is aroused more easily in men by visual stimuli than is the case for women .
This is probably why visual pornography is more popular with men .
And although both men and women express romantic love with the same intensity , and are attracted to partners who are dependable , kind , healthy , smart and educated , there are some notable differences in their choices .
Men are more attracted to youth and beauty , while women are more attracted to money , education and position .
When an older , ugly man is seen walking down the road arm - in - arm with a young and beautiful woman , most people assume the man is rich or powerful .
These foolish things
Of course , love is about more than just genes .
Cultural and social factors , and learning , play big roles .
Who and how a person has loved in the past are important determinants of his ( or her ) capacity to fall in love at any given moment in the future .
This is because animals — people included — learn from their sexual and social experiences .
Arousal comes naturally .
But long - term success in mating requires a change from being naive about this state to knowing the precise factors that lead from arousal to the rewards of sex , love and attachment .
For some humans , this may involve flowers , chocolate and sweet words .
But these things are learnt .
If humans become conditioned by their experiences , this may be the reason why some people tend to date the same “ type ” of partner over and over again .
Researchers think humans develop a “ love map ” as they grow up — a blueprint that contains the many things that they have learnt are attractive .
This inner scorecard is something that people use to rate the suitability of mates .
Yet the idea that humans are actually born with a particular type of “ soul mate ” wired into their desires is wrong .
Research on the choices of partner made by identical twins suggests that the development of love maps takes time , and has a strong random component .
Work on rats is leading researchers such as Dr Pfaus to wonder whether the template of features found attractive by an individual is formed during a critical period of sexual - behaviour development .
He says that even in animals that are not supposed to pair - bond , such as rats , these features may get fixed with the experience of sexual reward .
Rats can be conditioned to prefer particular types of partner — for example by pairing sexual reward with some kind of cue , such as lemon - scented members of the opposite sex .
This work may help the understanding of unusual sexual preferences .
Human fetishes , for example , develop early , and are almost impossible to change .
The fetishist connects objects such as feet , shoes , stuffed toys and even balloons , that have a visual association with childhood sexual experiences , to sexual gratification .
So love , in all its glory , is just , it seems , a chemical state with genetic roots and environmental influences .
But all this work leads to other questions .
If scientists can make a more sociable mouse , might it be possible to create a more sociable human ?
And what about a more loving one ?
A few people even think that “ paradise - engineering ” , dedicated to abolishing the “ biological substrates of human suffering ” , is rather a good idea .
As time goes by
Progress in predicting the outcome of relationships , and information about the genetic roots of fidelity , might also make proposing marriage more like a job application — with associated medical , genetic and psychological checks .
If it were reliable enough , would insurers cover you for divorce ?
And as brain scanners become cheaper and more widely available , they might go from being research tools to something that anyone could use to find out how well they were loved .
Will the future bring answers to questions such as : Does your partner really love you ?
Is your husband lusting after the au pair ?
And then there are drugs .
Despite Dr Fisher 's reservations , might they also help people to fall in love , or perhaps fix broken relationships ?
Probably not .
Dr Pfaus says that drugs may enhance portions of the “ love experience ” but fall short of doing the whole job because of their specificity .
And if a couple fall out of love , drugs are unlikely to help either .
Dr Fisher does not believe that the brain could overlook distaste for someone — even if a couple in trouble could inject themselves with huge amounts of dopamine .
However , she does think that administering serotonin can help someone get over a bad love affair faster .
She also suggests it is possible to trick the brain into feeling romantic love in a long - term relationship by doing novel things with your partner .
Any arousing activity drives up the level of dopamine and can therefore trigger feelings of romance as a side effect .
This is why holidays can rekindle passion .
Romantics , of course , have always known that love is a special sort of chemistry .
Scientists are now beginning to show how true this is .

JP Trenque was the winner in our Photographer of the Year 2005 competition with this captivating photo .
Here we present more of JP 's work in which he has chosen to continue to focus on the underwater environment .
Some hot topics come and go : the End of History ; Imperial Overstretch ; Europe as Venus , the US as Mars .
And some keep coming back , sometimes after long pauses .
The Rise of China is back , with a vengeance , in the papers , on television , in magazines , conferences , seminars , and so on .
It is as though people have suddenly woken up to the fact that China is a major power again , and it may be that both the benefits and perils of this phenomenon are being exaggerated .
This tends to happen whenever the west feels challenged by a non-western people .
It may also be that western fears are not exaggerated , but simply misplaced .
For the past several hundred years , China has been either a " sleeping dragon " or on the rise .
Many people might prefer the sleeping mode .
Either way , the Chinese dragon is seen as a fearsome beast that has excited the greed , envy , terror and fascination of many generations of Europeans and Americans .
Much of the reporting in the west about China 's extraordinary economic growth - skyscraper cities sprouting like concrete forests , entire industries taken over , massive markets opening up - has a tone of awe , sometimes tempered by environmental worries and the odd caveat about human rights .
" Nine per cent growth , " said one American observer , " is not a boom , it is a transformation . "
But there is a strong hint of anxiety , too : will China dominate the world ?
What can the west do to compete with this strange and ancient civilisation of worker bees and autocrats ?
Fear of the far east probably goes back at least to the fifth century , when Attila the Hun 's warriors left a trail of devastation from the Eastern Roman Empire all the way to what is now France .
Then Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes reached the outskirts of Vienna in 1241 .
But the modern idea of yellow peril is commonly ascribed to the Americans .
The influx of Chinese immigrants , in the late 19th century , provoked fears of economic competition ( those worker bees ) , heathenism , and racial pollution .
To protect his purity and livelihood , the white man had to save civilisation from the oriental menace , represented in the 1920s by Sax Rohmer 's Dr Fu Manchu .
In fact , as is the case with so many New World prejudices , yellow peril also has a European provenance .
Kaiser Wilhelm II was obsessed by it .
He sent ferocious messages to his cousin Nicky , the Russian tsar , urging him to defend the borders of civilisation against " the yellow danger " .
These missives were often illustrated by the kaiser himself with cartoons of flying Buddhas emerging from thunderclouds to destroy the western world .
Kaiser Bill 's outbursts were usually provoked by the murder of Christian missionaries in China .
When the Boxers attacked missionaries in 1900 , he sent German troops to China as part of a western ( and Japanese ) effort to crush the rebellion .
Seeing off his soldiers at Wilhelmshaven , he couched the expedition in oddly religious terms .
" Show yourselves Christians , " he cried , " happily enduring in the face of the heathens ! ...
Give the world an example of virility and discipline .
Anyone who falls into your hands falls on your sword !
Just as the Huns under King Etzel created for themselves a thousand years ago a name which men still respect , you should give the name of German such cause to be remembered in China for a thousand years that no Chinaman , no matter whether his eyes be slit or not , will dare look a German in the face . "
Huns were hardly Christians , of course , but never mind .
In fact , the Christian factor is with us still .
Americans , in particular , have a history of missionary zeal in China .
The vast empire of heathens was always a temptation for religious entrepreneurs who wished to bring hundreds of millions of souls to the bosom of the Lord .
When George Bush recently visited China , he said little about human rights , but what little he did say mostly concerned the rights of Christians .
" May God bless the Christians of China , " he wrote at a church in Beijing .
This was entirely in keeping with a certain tradition in east - west relations .
Western fascination with China was , however , not always hostile , inspired by religious zeal , or even fearful .
For much of European history , China was far enough away to be an abstraction , a kind of fantasy kingdom , an exotic utopia , where everything seemed to be back to front or upside down .
This was true as late as the 18th century , the great era of literary and artistic chinoiserie , even though there had been enough accurate accounts of China to get a more realistic picture by then .
But exoticism has its own merits .
It allows one to dream of an ideal model that can be contrasted with the discontents and imperfections of one 's own part of the world .
A true Romantic will insist on things being different and see any mark of western influence as an abomination .
One of the great literary dreamers of China , who actually knew the country quite well , was the French writer Victor Segalen ( 1878-1919 ) .
He insisted on difference , on mystery , on a world that was literally impenetrable .
The creeping uniformity of the modern world , driven by commerce and tourism , and everything people once described as " progress " and now call " globalisation " , was insufferable to him .
China was the last frontier of exoticism , but even then , in the 1910s , it was already tainted in Segalen 's eyes .
In a letter to a friend , who was about to visit China for the first time , he wrote : " Trust me : scorn the coast .
Forget Shanghai and the ports along the lower river .
The edge of China has ' advanced ' like the bruised surface of a fruit .
Inside the pulp is still delicious . "
This pulpy dream of Chinese authenticity was , for Segalen , largely aesthetic : ancient inscriptions on stone monuments , the flowery manners inside the imperial court , the stylised conventions of the Peking Opera , that kind of thing .
China , or rather the idea of China , especially in the 18th century , was not always so quaint , however .
To Voltaire and his fellow philosophers of the Enlightenment , China represented a model of rationalism .
They saw China as a society of superior wisdom , run by gentlemen selected purely on scholarly merit .
Unlike France , say , which was still under the thumb of an absolute monarch , surrounded by obscurantist priests .
Voltaire found " the religion of the men of letters of China ... admirable .
No superstitions , no absurd legends , none of those dogmas which insult reason and nature ... "
Never mind that China was ruled by a monarchy no less tyrannical than the court of Louis XIV .
And Voltaire was not blind to the superstitions of Chinese clerics .
But the idea of a great society run by scholars was bound to appeal to intellectuals .
And the tyrannical aspect of imperial politics , far from being a black mark , added to China 's mystique .
Intellectuals often have a weakness for strongmen , because they can take hold of ideas and actually carry them out , unfettered by the messy compromises of more libertarian regimes .
Dictators " get things done " .
This was one of the reasons Chairman Mao enjoyed such a good press among western intellectuals such as Jean - Paul Sartre , Raymond Williams and André Malraux .
Like a true emperor , Mao , often presented as the epitome of the Oriental philosopher king , who wrote classical poetry in his idiosyncratic calligraphy , could transform a backward society .
And blessed with the wisdom and subtlety of his ancient civilisation , he could even help to transform the world .
There were echoes of Voltaire in this type of Mao worship : China as a model of reason , led by men of ideas who did their best to sweep away religious superstitions and other cobwebs from the dark , feudal past .
Few of the worshippers were especially interested in actual life in China .
To them , as with the philosophers two centuries before , China was an abstraction to be held up in protest against the prevailing conditions back home .
In fact , you did n't have to be a Maoist , or even a leftist , to be awed by the mystique of Chinese power .
Henry Kissinger was so impressed by Mao , and especially by his loyal paladin , Zhou Enlai , that he behaved rather like a fawning bearer of tribute to the imperial court .
And the notion that Chinese authoritarianism may be a little rough , but at least gets things done , is still a common feature of western writings in praise of China .
Many a rightwing fat cat will tell you that the Chinese capitalist transformation could only have happened under the stern rule of the Communist party of China .
Rupert Murdoch , among others , is of that persuasion , as are some people who used to be devoted Maoists .
It may actually be true , but what does this tell us about the nature of China 's political economy , that sinister combination of crony capitalism and political dictatorship ?
This is where greed comes in .
Of all the potential markets in the world , China has long been seen by western merchants as the biggest prize of all .
The sheer size of its population is one reason .
And the Chinese have had a long reputation as born business people .
This rested less , in the past , on the experience of doing business in China proper than on encounters with Chinese traders in south - east - Asian port cities .
And yet , for one reason or another , China has a history of refusing to let foreign traders pluck its juiciest fruits .
In the 19th century the guns of the Royal Navy had to blast China open for trade , then mostly in opium .
The main barrier to trade in China has always been the traditional role of government .
Chinese officials , keen to preserve their privileges , tried to keep the merchant class under firm bureaucratic control .
To trade with China in the imperial past required kowtowing to the Chinese court , and the presentation of many gifts .
When Lord Macartney embarked on a trade mission to the Chinese emperor in 1793 , he was followed by 600 packages of presents , borne by 3,000 coolies .
But his refusal to go down on both knees to the Chinese sovereign meant that his request for permission to open Chinese ports to British trade was turned down .
" Our empire , " he was informed , " possesses all things in prolific abundance . "
Things have changed , of course , but not entirely .
The way some western capitalists indulge Chinese Communist party officials with flattery and tributes , often putting up with snubs and other indignities that they would never tolerate in their own countries , has strong echoes of the ill - fated Macartney mission .
And just as they did in trading ports before the Opium War , Chinese officials still often conspire with local businessmen to limit unwelcome foreign competition .
But lust for that great Chinese market is still enough of an incentive for the foreigners to keep on trying .
The promise of market - driven riches is surely the main reason why democratic governments have pretty much given up on trying to press the Chinese rulers to improve human rights and liberalise their politics .
The potential prize is simply too great to get distracted by such trifles as forced labour camps , the lack of free speech , the torture of religious people , the oppression of ethnic minorities , or the nonexistence of independent trade unions .
Western politicians and some business people say that business is actually the surest route to political freedom .
They repeat the old mantra about capitalism expanding the middle class , and the middle class demanding democracy .
But the rise of China may not conform to this pattern .
The Chinese middle class is indeed expanding , just as happened in Japan more than a hundred years ago .
But China is not becoming more democratic .
The Chinese Communist party appears to have struck a bargain with the educated urban elite , the very people whose children demonstrated on Beijing 's Tiananmen Square , and other cities all over China , in 1989 .
In exchange for political obedience , for relinquishing democratic rights , the middle class is promised stability , order , and ever increasing prosperity .
It is in some ways a traditional east - Asian bargain , based on a certain reading of Confucianism .
The Singaporeans have accepted it , and to some extent even the Japanese .
It is an authoritarian capitalist alternative to liberal democracy , and its success should be a cause for concern , at least for those , in and out of China , who care about democracy .
If China keeps on rising economically , without opening up its politics , the Asian model will be a boon to all those who believe that democratic politics are redundant , or even a noxious threat to stability .
All those who believe that societies should be run by autocrats and technocrats , by media moguls and dictatorial managers , who know what is best , will be heartened by the Chinese example .
We already see the tendency in Thailand , ruled by the media tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra .
We see inept shades of it in Berlusconi's Italy , and even in America ; think of the way Bush dismisses any opposition to his policies as " just playing politics " , as though it were a form of sabotage rather than the stuff of democracy .
It is sometimes said that businessmen form one of the pillars of democracy .
But the popularity of Pinochet in business circles , and among certain Tory politicians , showed that autocracy can be just as congenial , if not more so .
Who would not like to do business in a country with no trade unions ?
Far from being a threat , the rise of China , for many businesses , is an opportunity .
But if the success of the Chinese model is worrying to democrats , its collapse could prove no less of a danger .
The most disturbing thing about autocratic capitalism may not actually be its purported stability , but its inherent instability .
Centuries of fearful , fascinated or greedy mythology about China has given us the idea that China is unique .
But it is not .
Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm II , the father of yellow peril , had struck a similar deal with its expanding middle class : order and industrial growth in exchange for a retreat from politics .
The problem with this system is that a sudden drop in economic prosperity creates intense disorder , with no free political institutions to absorb the shock .
This can easily lead to revolution and wars .
It has before .
China may well continue to rise for a long time , and the drop in prosperity may not be an immediate prospect .
But when it comes , it would be safer for China , and the rest of the world , if the Chinese had the freedom to express critical opinions , vote out the rascals , and find ways to cope with a crisis that rest on popular consent .
This means that business with China should continue , but not at the price of political acquiescence , of keeping quiet about human rights and civil liberties .
The Chinese middle class , for the time being , may have no other choice .
Western governments do .
Many Americans see the Internet as a lawless frontier , a haven for criminals and sexual deviants that use anonymity to commit crimes without fear of retribution .
The dynamic nature of the Internet produces a number of unique regulatory challenges that test the patience and ingenuity of legislators and law enforcement agents .
Regulation of sexual content on the Internet has always been a controversial issue .
The recent increase in parental concern about the nature and accessibility of unwholesome content compelled the federal government to evaluate new options and place a stronger emphasis on regulation of this perceived threat .
Last month , the FBI began implementation of an anti-obscenity initiative designed to crack down on those that produce and distribute deviant pornography .
According to FBI headquarters , the war against smut is " one of the top priorities " of Attorney General Gonazalez and FBI Director Robert Meuller .
Although law enforcement agencies have always been aggressive when it comes to prosecuting exploitative child pornographers , this new initiative is unique in that it targets Internet pornography featuring consenting adults .
According to the Washington Post , the new anti-obscenity squad , which will consist of eight agents , a supervisor , and assorted staff , will be responsible for accumulating evidence to use against those that produce and distribute criminally obscene content .
So what constitutes criminal obscenity , and how does that relate to our first amendment rights ?
Under current American law , the Miller test is the means by which the courts determine if content is obscene and consequently not eligible for first amendment protection .
The Miller test evaluates the literary , artistic , political , and scientific value of content as well as contemporary community standards .
If content or expression is well within accepted community standards or it has intrinsic value , it does not constitute criminal obscenity .
According to an electronic memo from FBI headquarters , established legal precedents indicate that conviction is most likely in cases where the content " includes bestiality , urination , defecation , as well as sadistic and masochistic behavior . "
Despite a growing deficit and considerable budget concerns , the federal government will soon be paying FBI agents to surf the web in search of questionable content , a job that many Arsians would gladly do for free .
An even greater irony is that , only one day after the FBI announcement , House Majority leader Tom DeLay declared victory in the war against wasteful government spending .
In the past , government attempts to regulate Internet pornography have been met with tremendous resistance from civil liberties advocates .
Many laws proposed to control Internet pornography are patently misguided and inherently destructive .
I 'm sure many of you remember the short lived Communications Decency Act of 1996 , which blatantly violated first amendment rights and established vague provisions that could easily have extinguished free speech on the Internet .
Some critics of the new anti-obscenity initiative argue that it could lead to greater government censorship , and others are concerned about costs and priorities .
An article in the Washington Post featured a few cynical responses from law enforcement agents :
" I guess this means we 've won the war on terror , " said one exasperated FBI agent , speaking on the condition of anonymity because poking fun at headquarters is not regarded as career - enhancing .
" We must not need any more resources for espionage . "
There are also a number of people that strongly support this new initiative .
According to the same Washington Post article , the Family Research Council affirmed " a growing sense of confidence in our new attorney general " in response to the heightened law enforcement emphasis on Internet smut .
Concerned parents argue that our society has become increasingly tolerant of pornography and socially questionable material , and many of them blame the Internet for the degradation of traditional American values .
Conservative columnist Benjamin Shapiro argues in favor of the initiative in a recent article , and he comments on the concerns of those that oppose the initiative :
They find the anti-pornography crowd disturbing because they believe that policing pornography violates fundamental rights .
This has become the dominant view in our society :
As long as what I do does n't harm you personally , I have a right to do it .
It 's a silly view and a view rejected by law enforcement policies all over the country .
Mr. Shapiro's dismissal of modern deontological ethics and the categorical imperative does n't impress me much .
Last time I checked , our legal system was supposed to protect the rights of morally autonomous individuals .
As a Libertarian , I tend to be skeptical of government regulation .
Internet pornography is an enormous , profitable industry ( which happens to provide the government with massive amounts of tax money ) and I strongly support the rights of those who choose to engage in production , distribution , and consumption of pornography that does not inherently violate the rights of others .
In principle , I also value the rights of those who do not wish to be exposed to such content , but I have very little faith in the government 's capacity to effectively shield the innocent without violating the rights of consenting consumers .
I think that this latest measure is an attempt to appease those concerned without incurring major expenses .
When it comes right down to it , this solution is less expensive and less ominous than other potential solutions , but I am concerned by the fact that the Attorney General considers this a high priority .
The absurdity of the situation is accentuated when you study previous situations where the government has attempted to censor content on the basis of criminal obscenity .
A commonly cited example is Allen Ginsberg 's poem Howl , the pinnacle of beat poetry and arguably the defining composition of an entire generation .
In 1957 , the government attempted to prevent the publication of Howl and pressed charges against Ginsberg and poet laureate Lawrence Ferlinghetti , claiming that the duo was guilty of criminal obscenity for distributing a poem that contained drug references and overt homosexual themes .
Fortunately , the American Civil Liberties Union intervened on behalf of the poets , and today , Ginsberg 's masterpiece is read in classrooms all across America .
I question the validity of a legal standard that requires the government to make determinations about what constitutes art , and for that reason I question the legal validity of anti-obscenity laws and the Miller test .
Is this a timely and legitimate solution to a serious problem , or is it a costly and wasteful attempt to appease concerned parents and religious fundamentalists ?
Will it make the Internet a safer and more wholesome learning environment for children , or will it stifle free speech and civil liberties ?
More to the point , how many of you will be polishing up the old resume and applying for jobs on the pr0n squad ?
“ Did I ever tell you the story of my first business ?
“ Let me see if I can remember the whole thing .
I was fourteen , I think .
They were running some kind of a TESOL summer institute at the University of New Mexico , and I was hired to sit behind a desk and make copies of articles from journals if anybody wanted them .
“ There was a big urn full of coffee next to the desk , and if you wanted coffee , you helped yourself and left a quarter in a little cup .
I did n’t drink coffee , myself , but I did like donuts and thought some nice donuts would go well with the coffee . ”

We often put the photos we take into frames as a way of displaying and drawing attention to our favorite photos – but there is another type of framing that you can do as you ’re taking your shots that can be just as effective doing just the same thing !
Framing is the technique of drawing attention to the subject of your image by blocking other parts of the image with something in the scene .
The benefits of framing pictures include :
1. giving the photo context ( for example framing a scene with an archway can tell you something about the place you are by the architecture of the archway or including some foliage in the foreground of a shot can convey a sense of being out in nature ) .
2. giving images a sense of depth and layers ( in essence framing a shot generally puts something in the foreground which adds an extra dimension to the shot ) .
3. leading the eye towards your main focal point ( some ‘ frames ’ can draw your photo ’s viewer into the picture just by their shape ) .
Some also believe that a frame can not only draw the eye into a picture but that it keeps it there longer – giving a barrier between your subject and the outside of the shot .
4. intriguing your viewer .
Sometimes it ’s what you ca n’t see in an image that draws you into it as much as ( if not more than ) what you can see in the picture .
Clever framing that leaves those viewing your image wondering a little or imagining what is behind your frame can be quite effective ( get it wrong and it can also be quite annoying ! ) .
Frames for photographs come in all shapes and sizes and can include shooting through overhanging branches , shooting through windows , using tunnels , arches or doorways – you can even use people ( for example shooting over shoulders or between heads ) etc .
Your frame does n’t need to go completely around the edges of your image – they might just be on one or two edges of your shot .
My rule of thumb when considering framing is to ask the question – ‘ will this add to or take away from the image ? ’
Sometimes framing can just add clutter to a shot and make it feel cramped – but at other times it can be the difference between an ordinary shot and a stunning one .
Lastly – if you do use framing techniques you also need to consider whether you want your frame to be in focus or not .
In some instances a nicely blurred frame will really add a sense of mood and depth to your shots ( in this case use a large aperture ) but in other cases to have your frame in focus can help with adding context to the scene ( in this case choose a narrow aperture .

SEX workers on Sydney 's streets are more likely to suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder than soldiers returning from combat or police officers .
Federally funded research showed most of the 72 women interviewed had experienced multiple traumas : child sex abuse , serious child neglect , rape as an adult , and work - related violence .
As a result , one - third still experience serious symptoms of post - traumatic stress such as flashbacks , recurrent nightmares , hyper- vigilance and extreme anxiety .
On top of that , many suffer depression .
The research , by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of NSW , found that just under half the women had tried to kill themselves .
The lead researcher , Amanda Roxburgh , said the prevalence of post - traumatic stress was higher than expected .
Zidane has spoken about his sending - off for the first time
But the French legend does not regret his actions , alleging on television that Materazzi provoked him by insulting both his mother and sister .
" It was inexcusable .
I apologise , " said the 34 - year - old Zidane .
" But I can't regret what I did because it would mean that he was right to say all that . "
Materazzi responded by denying he said anything about Zidane 's mother .
" I did n't mention anything about religion , politics or racism , " said the Italian on Wednesday .

Well done Zidane for apologising , it was the least you could have done
FN
" Naturally , I did n't know that his mother was in hospital but I wish her all the best .
" Zidane is my hero and I have always admired him a lot . "
Zidane was sent off for headbutting Materazzi in the chest in the second period of extra-time in the final in Berlin .
The Frenchman claimed he had been provoked by the Italian and appeared on French TV station Canal Plus on Wednesday to explain his actions .
" It was an inexcusable gesture and to them , and the people in education whose job it is to show children what they should and should n't do , I want to apologise . "
Asked what had caused to react so violently , he said Materazzi had directed some " very hard words " at him .
" You hear them once and you try to move away .
But then you hear them twice , and then a third time , " said Zidane .
" I am a man and some words are harder to hear than actions .
I would rather have taken a blow to the face than hear that . "
WHAT WAS SAID ?
BBC Radio Five Live asked a deaf lip reader to read Materazzi 's words phonetically to an Italian translator :
She deciphered the insult as being " you 're the son of a terrorist whore " The BBC's Ten O'Clock News called in experts to study the television footage who said : Materazzi told Zidane to " calm down " before accusing him of being a " liar " and wished " an ugly death to you and your family " .
This was followed by " Go f*** yourself "
Zidane , who retired from football after Sunday 's final , also called for Materazzi to be punished for his part in the incident .
" We always talk about the reaction , and obviously it must be punished .
But if there is no provocation , there is no need to react , " said the former Real Madrid and Juventus player .
" Above all it was a very serious provocation .
It was an inexcusable gesture but the real culprit is the person who provoked it .
" Do you imagine that in a World Cup final like that with just 10 minutes to go to the end of my career , I am going to do something like that because it gives me pleasure ? "
Since the incident , rumours have run rife about what Materazzi said to get such a reaction from the Frenchman .
There were claims the Italian had called Zidane a " terrorist " , but in Tuesday 's edition of the Italian newspaper La Gazetta dello Sport , Materazzi said : " It was the kind of insult you will hear dozens of times and just slips out on the field .
" I did n't call Zidane a terrorist and certainly did n't mention his mother .
I did not bring up Zidane 's mother ; for me a mother is sacred . "
Zinedine Zidane 's last professional game ended with a red card
The two players initially clashed in the Italian penalty area before words were exchanged .
Materazzi said : " I held his shirt , for only a few seconds .
He turned towards me and scoffed at me , looking at me with super arrogance , up and down .
" He said ' if you really want my shirt , you can have it later ' .
It 's true , I shot back with an insult . "
Fifa is to investigate Zidane 's sending - off and president Sepp Blatter has hinted the France star could be stripped of the Golden Ball award he won after being voted the best player in the World Cup by journalists .
Zidane said he planned to defend himself in the Fifa investigation into his sending off .
He also confirmed that he would not go back on his decision to quit the game .
" This is a decision I have made and I will not go back on it , " he said .
" This is definite .
I will not play again . "
Mehmet Ali Kocyigit ( left ) and his family lived on a poultry farm
A 14 - year - old boy who died last weekend was found to have the disease , despite earlier results indicating otherwise .
His sister died in eastern Turkey early on Thursday and a third sibling is in hospital with bird flu symptoms .
Although tests are still being carried out , a senior official from the World Health Organization says it is likely the boy had the deadly H5N1 strain .
Guenael Rodier , a special adviser on communicable diseases at the WHO , told the BBC that while he was not surprised by the case , it was a significant development .
" It shows a geographic extension of human cases and certainly increases altogether the overall likelihood that at some point this virus will adapt to humans , " he said .
" So it 's important this is going to be investigated , and a WHO team is on its way to the Far East and Turkey with nationals to investigate . "
Mutant fears
The WHO has said that while the virus is spreading , the cases are not the start of a pandemic , as it was not passed between humans .
QUICK GUIDE
Bird flu
The Turkish Health Ministry says both teenagers who died tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the virus .
A British laboratory is expected to confirm those results in the next few days .
At least 14 other people are being treated as suspect cases .
In the two years since bird flu was detected in Asia , around 70 people have died from the H5N1 strain .
There are no confirmed cases however of human - to - human transmissions , and sufferers are believed to have contracted it from close contact with sick birds .
But health experts have expressed fears that it could mutate , becoming a virus that could spread among humans like common influenza .
Turkey reported its first cases of bird flu among poultry on 8 October , which were confirmed as the H5N1 strain .
Thousands of birds were culled in and around Kiziksa , western Turkey , where the outbreak occurred .
' Do n't panic '
The boy , named as Mehmet Ali Kocyigit , died on Sunday in the city of Van in eastern Turkey .
His sister , Fatma , died in the early hours of Thursday .
This is not the start of the pandemic
Dr David Nabarro
World Health Organization
The family lived and worked on a poultry farm in the town of Dogubayezit , close to the border with Iran .
Health Minister Recep Akdag said the family kept infected birds in their home .
" There are two cases that have been confirmed as positive by the laboratory , said Mr Akdag .
" Another case is suspected of being positive .
We have a pandemic plan ready .
There is no need to be too alarmist . "
Murat Akova , of Ankara 's Hacetepe University , said close contact with poultry was the likely cause of infection .
Migration path
The agriculture ministry is conducting an emergency cull of poultry in the region , instructing farmers to take extra precautions .
The health ministry says it has enough medicine in stock to cope .
Dr David Nabarro of the WHO urged caution among millions fearful of a global pandemic .
" This is not the start of the pandemic .
The pandemic starts when there is human to human transfer , confirmed and sustained , " he said .
In Europe , the H5N1 strain was discovered in bird flocks in Turkey , Russia , Romania and Croatia , but had not previously spread to humans .
Turkey lies on the migration path of wild birds suspected of spreading the flu westwards from Asia .
Hi there .
My name ’s Rusty , and I ’m an air conditioning tech .
I ’m not a rocket scientist , but I know how to wield an electronic screwdriver and recharge the freon in a unit .
Lately I ’ve taken a job with Roy ’s Environmental Systems Technology .
It sounds impressive , but really it ’s just another air conditioning and heating company , nothing cutting edge , nothing fancy .
We mostly just call it REST .
However I am proud to say that we ’re a pretty good air conditioning and heating company .
We can do everything from window units in studio apartments to million dollar custom factory installations .
However big or small your job is , REST will get it done , on time , on budget , ( often under - budget ) , and very , very reliably .
We focus on simple , reliable systems .
Most of the time if something breaks , the customer can fix it themselves without even calling us .
If it does require an onsite visit , we ’re usually there in an hour or two .
Honestly , once we get a system up and running , it very rarely breaks outright .
More often , the the company has simply grown to a point where they need need another unit or two , so I hop in my truck , drive over , and install it .
No muss .
No fuss .
Lately , however , we ’ve been losing business to a newcomer in town , and I ’m not quite sure why .
A couple of years ago Water Supply - Strategic Tactical Air Recycling ( WS - STAR ) opened up a branch in our town .
WS -* ( as my IM crazy kids would type ) came about from the merger of Secure Operations Air and Power ( SOAP ) with Expert Machine Lubrication : Radiators , Power , and Cooling ( XML - RPC ) .
WS -* started taking out ads in the local business rags , and began chatting up the managers on the golf course .
They explained to our customers , who had previously been quite happy with us , that a traditional cooling and heating system was n’t good enough for the new millenium .
Instead they needed a hermetically - sealed , precision controlled , air filtration and recycling system that would guarantee them a precise balance of nitrogen , oxygen , and H 2 0 at all times and which could be remotely monitored from their offices .
Instead of just pumping in air from outside and cooling or heating it as appropriate , they ’d install huge tanks of water , nitrogen , and oxygen which they ’d truck over from their factory every week for an ongoing fee .
Then they ’d inject this into the factory in the correct mixture , and then pump it out again .
After all , you would n’t want to depend on the atmosphere for something as critical as the right percentage of oxygen , would you ?
To install one of these very impressive systems , they ’d spend months swapping out glass for bullet proof plastic , sealing the walls , replacing external doors with air locks , and installing internal doors that dropped down with warning sirens and flashing red lights in the event of a vacuum breech just like you see on Lost .
They promised the managers a system that was so incredibly air tight , they could run their factory on the Moon .
Of course , getting ready to move your home or office or factory to the Moon costs money .
Here at REST we used to think a million dollars was a big job , and the salespeople high - fived everyone and took the mechanics out for pizza when they landed one of those big jobs .
Over at WS -* , prices start at a million dollars ; and that ’s just to install a small system for the corner bodega .
Retooling an entire factory to WS -* specifications can run into the hundreds of millions or more .
In some cases , the existing building was just too old and too full of holes to ever hermetically seal , so to install the WS -* system , they had to shut down the entire production line , tear down the building , and erect a shiny new building that met WS -* ’s specifications .
You can imagine what that cost .
At least once , when the factory finally came online a couple of years later they discovered a new competitor had spent a week installing a REST system instead , and had now stolen their market out from under them .
The thing I never understood was that the companies WS -* was selling these Moon - ready systems to were the same companies that had been very happily using our old , prosaic Earthbound AC and heating for years .
These were all factories on Earth , not on the Moon .
I ’m sure somewhere if you looked hard enough , you could find one or two companies that are dreaming about building factories on the Moon , but personally I ’ve never met them .
Oh , one more thing .
The last two or three years were a little slow here at REST while a lot of our biggest customers invested all their time and budget in WS -*.
For a while we made our nut on homes and small businesses that could n’t afford WS -*’s prices even if they wanted to .
A couple of those small businesses are now quite large businesses , and starting to compete with the big boys that spent the last two years wrestling with WS -*.
And lately we ’ve started hearing from our older , larger customers again .
They ’ve been running their hermetically - sealed , precision controlled , air filtration and recycling system with service level guarantees for a precise balance of nitrogen , oxygen , and H 2 0 at all times and which can be remotely monitored from their offices for a couple of years now ; and they ’ve noticed something : their factories are too hot .
It seems the big , complicated , WS -* systems are n’t working out quite like they were supposed to .
The WS -* technicians are visiting their shop floors daily , and twiddling this knob and tweaking that dial ; and inspecting every widget and seal with some really impressive equipment that would look good on Star Trek .
Yet they still ca n’t seem to get the temperature below 83Ë š in the summer or above 57Ëš in the winter .
Now the lawyers are waving multi- hundred page contracts in each others ’ faces , and threatening lawsuits ; and the factory still ca n’t maintain an even 72 Ëš .
Tomorrow I ’m visiting one of these factories that just escorted the WS -* techs off the premises to install one of our old , reliable REST systems so they finally get their temperature back to a workable level .
The next few years look like they ’re going to be quite busy . 🙂

Dolphins were monitored in Sarasota Bay off Florida ( Image : Randall Wells )
The mammals are able to recognise themselves and other members of the same species as individuals with separate identities , using whistles .
St Andrews University researchers studying in Florida discovered bottlenose dolphins used names rather than sound to identify each other .
The three - year - study was funded by the Royal Society of London .
Dr Vincent Janik , of the Sea Mammal Unit at St Andrews University , said they conducted the research on wild dolphins .
I think it is a very exciting discovery because it means that these animals have evolved the same abilities as humans
Dr Vincent Janik
St Andrews University
He said : " We captured wild dolphins using nets when they came near the shore .
" Then in the shallow water we recorded their whistles before synthesising them on a computer so that we had a computer voice of a dolphin .
" Then we played it back to the dolphins and we found they responded .
This showed us that the dolphins know each other 's signature whistle instead of just the voice .
" I think it is a very exciting discovery because it means that these animals have evolved the same abilities as humans .
" Now we know they have labels for each other like we do . "
The research was conducted in Sarasota Bay off Florida 's west coast .
The findings are published in the US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
UPDATED : * Universal ’s frowns turned to high - fives this weekend because America wanted a laugh at movie theaters and made the studio ’s romantic comedy the third biggest of all time .
It turns out the Vince Vaughn - Jennifer Aniston comedy that had been tracking less than satisfactorily — and reviewed even worse , prompting all those showbiz cynics to ask whether Jen can really be a movie star — is a hit at the box office .
The Break - Up had a $ 38 million opening weekend , compared to 2nd - week - out X - Men 3 ‘s $ 34 mil , Over the Hedge‘s $ 21 mil and 3rd - week - out Da Vinci Code ‘s $ 17 mil .
Saturday ’s box office went up from Friday ’s : $ 14.6 for Universal ’s comedy ( Sunday estimate of $ 9.2 mil ) , $ 14.2 for 20th Century Fox ’s comic book caper ( Sunday est. $ 10.0 mil ) , $ 8.8 for Dreamworks / Paramount ’s toon ( Sunday est. $ 6.1 mil ) , and $ 8 mil for Sony ’s religious thriller ( Sunday est. $ 5.9 mil ) .
Da Vinci was the No. 1 movie again overseas , taking in another $ 51 mil for an international total of $ 409 mil .
The flick is about to pass Spiderman ( $ 415 mil ) and Spiderman 2 ( $ 410 mil ) as Sony / Columbia ’s biggest international release ever .
It ’s also the # 2 top - grossing Hollywood film in Italy passing The Passion of the Christ and behind only Titanic .
Worldwide , DVC had a $ 70 mil weekend to put worldwide cume at $ 581 mil . *
My sources are telling me early numbers say The Break - Up opened with a domestic take of $ 13.7 million Friday , which is prompting the studio to revise upwards their initial weekend opening estimate of $ 28 mil to a new estimated total of $ 38 mil .
Who ’d a thunk it !
For this comedy especially nowadays , that ’s much more than respectable ; that ’s a miracle .
Either Jen has developed a film fanbase , or else Vince is packing ’em in .
But I think America is just starved for comedy , any comedy , even a half - baked not - really - satisfying bickering - Bickersons comedy .
And Uni ’s lethal marketing department brought it to audiences in the right away .
It ’s Uni ’s biggest opening for ’06 and the industry ’s highest - grossing romantic comedy for the opening weekend in the month of June .
“ Imagine what the b.o. could have been if this movie had been really great , ” an insider tells me .
Attendance for 20th Century Fox ’s X - Men 3 went down 77 % for a still kicking 2nd - Friday $ 10.4 mil haul .
Dreamworks / Paramount ’s
Over the Hedge went down 31 % and took in $ 5.2 mil .
And Sony ’s Da Vinci Code was a close fourth with $ 5.1 mil .
( But that ’s in this country where pretty much only adults are seeing it .
DVC is still doing boffo box office overseas .
See below ! )
Meanwhile , Paramount ’s MI3 remains on life support with $ 1.2 mil .
The Break - Up just opened in U.S. this weekend .
Thanks to international audiences , Da Vinci hit the $ 500 mil mark worldwide Thursday ( just as my sources told me it would … )
Friday , DVC was off 52 % and XM3 66 % .
But Sony ’s religious thriller has a total $ 350 mil foreign and 20th ’s comic book caper $ 100 mil .

Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's nation fared worst in the survey
The survey for the BBC World Service asked how 39,435 people in 33 nations across the globe saw various countries .
Views of China , Russia and France have declined in comparison to a similar survey at the end of 2004 .
Japan is most widely seen to have a positive influence .
Europe has the most positive scores of all in the poll .
West negative
The survey by the international polling firm GlobeScan and the University of Maryland took place between October 2005 and January 2006 .
According to the poll , no country had a majority with a positive view of Iran 's role in the world , apart from the Iranians themselves .
On average , just 18 % say Iran has a positive influence , while 47 % believe the state 's role is negative .
Europe and North America have the largest majorities expressing a negative view - with Germany , the US and Italy the most negative about Iran .
Iran is embroiled in a row with the US and European Union over Western fears it is attempting to build nuclear weapons .
Tehran says its nuclear programme is aimed solely at energy production .
Ups and downs
The US has lost ground in some key allied countries , the survey suggests .
In France , 65 % had a negative view of the US , up from 54 % in the 2004 poll .
In Britain the numbers went from 50 % to 57 % .
Negative views of the US are also up by 20 points in China , eight points in Australia and nine points in Brazil .
Views of China have declined sharply over the last year , according to the poll .
Among the 20 countries polled both years , the number rating China positively has dropped from 13 to eight , while those rating it negatively have risen from three to seven .
But overall , China continues to have more backers than detractors .
Several European countries have developed more negative perceptions of Russia since 2004 , the poll suggests .
However , 31 of the 33 states ' populations gave Japan a positive rating .
None of the countries had a predominantly negative view of Europe .
The average is 53 % positive and 15 % negative , excluding the European states asked .
The margin of error in polling ranged from 2.5 % to 4 % .
William Rehnquist , the chief justice of America ’s Supreme Court , has died , and President George Bush has nominated John Roberts to replace him .
Since Mr Roberts had already been picked to replace another justice on the court , this means that a second high - court seat is now available .
It is an opportunity conservatives have dreamed of , but it comes as Mr Bush ’s political capital is at an all - time low
EVEN his ideological opponents agreed that William Rehnquist was an honest and fair - minded man who ran a tight ship as the top judge on America 's Supreme Court .
His death on Saturday September 3rd was , in the overused phrase , the end of an era .
As chief justice for nearly 20 years , the conservative Mr Rehnquist pulled the court slowly but surely to the right , and power in America firmly away from the federal government and towards the states .
How his legacy is judged is a question for future historians , but that it is significant is beyond doubt .
But even as his body lies in state in the Supreme Court building , thoughts are inevitably turning already to the future .
President George Bush has nominated John Roberts to succeed Mr Rehnquist .
Mr Roberts had already been nominated to an associate judgeship on the court on the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor , a conservative who nonetheless earned a reputation as the swing voter on social matters .
Mr Roberts 's confirmation hearings in the Senate had been expected to begin early this week .
But that was before the latest turmoil .
Not only has Hurricane Katrina shaken America ( see article ) , causing Mr Bush to postpone , among other things , a visit by China 's president .
Mr Rehnquist 's death means that there are now two Supreme Court vacancies , and the president 's decision to nominate Mr Roberts as chief justice changes the picture further still .
It was announced on Monday that his confirmation would be postponed until later this week or early next .
The chief justice has no more weight in voting than his eight colleagues .
But he is the court 's chief administrator , and among his more important duties is assigning opinions for his fellow justices to write .
This is no small power , since the different judges have both differing politics and styles .
The chief 's position is important enough that Mr Rehnquist had to go through a fairly bruising confirmation hearing in 1986 , even though he had already been an associate judge on the court for 15 years .
So even though Mr Roberts was widely expected to be confirmed as an associate justice , his nomination to the top spot will make activists and senators give him yet another close look .
So far , they have failed to come up with anything embarrassing after combing through virtually everything he has ever written .
Moreover , he is a likeable man with a formidable intellect , and is said to be more devoted to the law in the abstract than to pushing his personal conservatism .
Conservative he certainly is .
He was a clerk to Mr Rehnquist in the early 1980s , and shows it .
The two men shared a fondness for the tenth amendment to the constitution , and a corresponding wariness of the “ commerce clause ” .
The tenth amendment says that all powers not explicitly given to the federal government in the constitution are reserved for the states or “ the people ” .
Conservatives consider it the most widely , and sadly , ignored part of the entire document .
In particular , those who would arrogate powers to Washington have taken advantage of the clause that allows Congress to regulate “ interstate commerce ” .
This has been the legal basis for federal intervention in all kinds of matters not obviously related to commerce .
The Rehnquist court has fought back .
Mr Rehnquist opposed a federal law banning guns from a certain radius around public schools , on the ground that Congress had no constitutional power to do this ( guns and schools having no obvious connection to interstate commerce ) .
Mr Roberts used the same reasoning to oppose a law protecting a species of toad native to California .
Liberals worry that turning the tide against the federal government will weaken its ability to protect the environment , civil rights , abortion rights and a host of other causes dear to them .
In particular , they worry about Mr Roberts 's stance on Roe v Wade , the 1973 decision that found a right to “ privacy ” in the constitution and thereby guaranteed legal abortion across the country .
Mr Roberts has not said directly whether he would vote to overturn Roe , and probably wo n't in his confirmation hearings .
But Mr Rehnquist was against Roe already .
Barring surprises , Mr Roberts will take the same stance as his former boss on this and a host of other issues .
The succession is thus unlikely to change the court much in the short term .
And since Mr Roberts is only 50 years old , it is likely to ensure a powerful seat for many of Mr Rehnquist 's ideas for decades to come .
Caught between falling approval ratings and a conservative base threatening to revolt , the president is likely to find nominating a replacement for Ms O'Connor a difficult test of his political touch
Hence all the attention turning to the question of who will replace Ms O'Connor , the swing vote .
She was known for her pragmatic approach to cases , supporting some forms of affirmative action but not others , and some shows of public religion but not others .
Though conservative , she was nothing like her colleagues Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , who bring dogmatic , even radical , conservative arguments to bear on cases .
Whom will Mr Bush pick ?
Having just selected Mr Roberts in July , his shortlist is still close at hand .
There is pressure on him to nominate someone who is not both white and male — especially in light of the racial divisions exposed by Hurricane Katrina ( most of those too poor to leave New Orleans were black ) .
Having rejected a “ women-only ” seat by replacing Ms O'Connor with Mr Roberts , to conservatives ' delight , Mr Bush might now win points on the other side by choosing either a woman or a non-white this time .
There are several possibilities .
Edith Clement , who seems to be rather moderate , was rumoured to be in the running for the nomination Mr Roberts eventually got .
Mr Bush might appoint his close friend , the attorney - general Alberto Gonzales — but religious conservatives consider him flaky , particularly on abortion , and would cry foul .
Emilio Garza , currently a federal appeals - court judge , would be a more reliably conservative Latino .
Or Mr Bush could drop a bomb by nominating Janice Rogers Brown , a black woman , but also one of the most controversial conservatives on the bench .
Opponents see her as an extremist ready to overturn long - established social - protection legislation — she has written that Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal “ marks the triumph of our own socialist revolution ” .
Anyone perceived as an extremist would face the threat of a filibuster — as few as 40 of the 100 Senate members can prevent a vote by debating endlessly .
The Republicans are five seats short of the 60 needed to overturn such a ruse .
In May , the two sides made a deal over a batch of Mr Bush 's lower - court nominees ( including Ms Rogers Brown ) , saying that the filibuster against judicial nominees could be preserved in the Senate rules if the minority agreed to use it only under “ extreme ” circumstances .
But the agreement is fragile and could easily unravel from either side .
That said , the president 's political capital is at an all - time low — thanks to violence in Iraq , spiralling petrol prices and the botched response to Katrina — and he may feel this is no time for a big fight .
Caught between falling approval ratings and a conservative base threatening to revolt , he is likely to find nominating a replacement for Ms O'Connor a difficult test of his political touch .
How he handles it could set the tone for much of his second term .

結論から言うと、 「 かなりやばい」感じ。
実際、今の日本のインターネット中枢を支えるリーディング企業ＴＯＰ達は相当深刻な危機感を抱いているみたいだが、その危機感がイマイチ一般人には伝わってこない。
しかし、内情を知るにつれ、その「深刻さ」が我々にも実感できる。以下、技術的な話に疎い方でも状況が理解できる様、できるだけ噛み砕いて解説を試みる。
まず予備知識として。アメリカのインフラ事情についてもこんな記事が。
オンラインでも 「交通渋滞」の懸念–ビデオ配信量の急増を受け( CNET )
要するに、ブロードバンドコンテンツが本格的に普及してきた影響で、プロバイダの回線容量がもーすぐパンクするかも増強費用どうしてくれんだよやべーよって話。日本も根本的には同じような話なんだけど、日本の場合さらにお国事情が問題を深刻にしてる。その点については後述。
で、アメリカの状況に関しては、michikaifuさんの記事がとても参考になる。
「 インフラただのり論 」 は「売り手市場」への変化点—通信が値上がりする時代がついにやって来る！？
注目すべきはこの部分。
中国やインドなどのもともと供給爆発がなかった地域では、すでに回線の逼迫状況が起こっていると聞いていた。しかしなんとついに、アメリカでもそういう話を、最近聞いたのである。
アメリカはそれくらい回線資源に余裕のある国だったという事。ちなみに日本には供給爆発なんてもちろん起こらなかった。それどころかYahooBBが起爆剤となって需要爆発が先に起こってしまった。これについても後述。
要するに日本とアメリカはそれくらい状況が違う。
さて。 「アメリカでさえちょいヤバ」という状況を念頭に置いた上で、本題に入る。
日本でも最近 、NTTのTOP 達が「 インフラただ乗りケシカラン！」とGyaOやSkypeを名指しでヤリ玉に挙げ、物議を醸した。日経の以下の記事が話題になった。
「 インフラただ乗り」で始まるインターネットの新たな議論
上記記事 は 「ダイジェスト版」。日経コミュニケーションNo.456号にてさらに具体的な特集記事が読める。以下、WEBのダイジェスト版と、日経の本記事から適宜引用しながら話を進める。
名指しで批判されたGyaOを例に検証してみよう。
まず驚いたのが 、GyaOのユーザ数。なんと2006年2月22日時点で720万を超えたという。総務省が発表した昨年９月現在の総ブログ登録者数473万人と比べてもその凄さが判る。
ちなみに日経本記事では 、GyaOユーザ数は1月末現在650万人という記述がある。WEB版の方が最新データに差し替えられてるわけだが、これから換算すると22日間で会員が約70万人増加している事になる。１日あたり約3万2000人。これは凄まじい。この会員達が皆500k、1Mbpsといった帯域を占有するのだ。プロバイダ関係者がGyaOの話題で持ち切りになったというのもうなずける。
USENの二木CTOの話によれば、一ヶ月あたりのトラフィック増加が2Gbps。念を押すが総量でなく増加分である。IIJデータセンター札幌-渋谷間のバックボーンが2.4Gだから、データセンター拠点間の総トラフィックに匹敵する量が月ベースで増加している事になる。何度もしつこく言うが1ヶ月の増加分、しかもGyaOオンリーでだ。
さらなるデータを引き合いに出そう。
インターネットインフラにはIXという収束地点がある。プロバイダ間の相互接続などは皆ここで行われる。判りやすく言うとインターネットの大動脈みたいなものか。で、日本にはJPIX,JPNAP,NSPIXPという３大IXがある。日経本記事にはその３大IXの合計トラフィックというデータが紹介されているのだが、2001年末だとその合計値でさえ14Gbpsしかない。2001年末といってもそんなに昔じゃない。ちょうどWindowsXPが発売された頃である。
これが2004年末だと111.1Gbps、そして2005年末（２ヶ月ちょい前）には168.2Gbpsに跳ね上がる。
GyaOのトラフィック増加分を2Gbpsのままで計算しても、それだけで年間24Gbpsの増加。実際にはもっと伸びるかもしれない。一体2006年末にはどんな値になっているのかと考えると空恐ろしい。
まあ、トラフィックの増加だけであれば設備の増強でなんとかなる。しかし、やはり深刻なのはその費用の捻出だ。
GyaOはただ乗りと批判されているが、実際には相当高額なトランジット費用(プロバイダ間接続費用)を支払っている。じゃあなぜGyaOがただ乗りと批判されるかと言うと、トランジット費用はUSENと「直接」相互接続しているプロバイダにしか支払われていないからだ。このあたり、日経本記事には詳しい記述があるのだが、直接相互接続していないプロバイダにとっては、１円も実入りのない形でGyaOトラフィックを支える為の設備増強を行わなければならない。しかも直接相互接続していないプロバイダは(おそらく)零細プロバイダが多い。NTTのGyaO批判はそうした零細プロバイダの悲鳴を代弁したものだ。
なにしろ、（今ではだいぶ改善されてきた様だが）日本の幹線系回線費用からして高すぎる。100Mbpsの回線増強をしただけでも、地方のローカルプロバイダなどはこれだけで死活問題だ。
このままだと地方の零細プロバイダからバタバタと潰れていく。そして、行き場を失ったユーザが大手プロバイダに大量流入する。すると、大手プロバイダも予想以上の回線増強の必要に迫られ汲々とする。で、結局幹線系の回線使用料を大幅に値下げせざるを得なくなる。んで、結果ＮＴＴもやばくなる。USENはUSENで嵐の様に増え続ける自社ユーザの回線増強に加えてトランジット費用が膨れ上がって、みーんな共倒れ。
なんて未来にならない？このままだとかなりやばくね？
ここまでは 、GyaOが悪者みたいな内容になってしまったかもしれないが、USENはちょっと損な役回りかもしれない。GyaOのトラフィックに関する具体的データもGyaOがオーソドックスな配信形態をとっているからこそ判るもので、データがある分叩かれ役になっちゃってる感もある。例えばSkypeの総トラフィックが今どれくらいあって、月にどのくらいのペースで増加しているか、なんてのは皆目見当がつかない。そういう不透明な要素がまた別の不安感を煽る。
結局GyaOは単なる議論のきっかけに過ぎなくて、日本のインターネットが抱える構造的問題が根本にある。
日本のインターネットの最大の問題は、YahooやUSEN、NTTが繰り広げた際限なきアクセス回線の価格競争と、それが引き起こしたアクセス系と幹線系の収益不均衡にあるんだと思う。
YahooBBが登場した時、誰もが採算ベースに乗るわけはないと思った。それくらい「ありえない」価格設定。しかし、Yahooは力技で乗り切った。街角でキャンペーンのオネーチャンがADSLモデム片手に勧誘するなんて光景はおそらく日本以外には見られなかったのではないか。
結局、シェアを伸ばし たYahooに他の業者も付き合わざるを得なくなり、意地の張り合いが始まった。記憶が定かではないが、B-フレッツにしても現在の価格はNTTが当初予定していた価格設定の半額以下のはずだ。
そのシワ寄せが幹線系の値下げを鈍らせた。アクセス回線で本来得られるべきだった利益を回収する為だ。日本の超安インターネットは、(不当に？)高い通信料金を払い続けたあまたの企業ユーザあってこそ成り立っているのである。
長くなってしまったがホントはまだまだ書きたい事はあった（広告収入というビジネスモデル自体ブロードバンドと相性が悪いんじゃねーのとかその辺）。
最後に日経本記事にあっ たIIJ 鈴木幸一社長のインタビューから抜粋。日本の抱える問題が凝縮されている。
( 引用者注：インタビュアーの発言 )
■しかし安価な料金が日本をブロードバンドで世界一の地位に押し上げた。
( 引用者注：以下鈴木氏 )
「 世界一安い」なんてバカげてる。安さばかりを追求しているのは日本と韓国だけだ。
日本と米国のインターネットは全く違う。米国はインターネットを含め、プラットフォームの値段を安くする事には非常に慎重だ。Ｍビット／秒あたりの単価を見ても、日本は米国の３０分の１。世界平均と比べると５０分の１だ。米国はインフラに金が落ちているから破綻することはないが、日本は非常に危険な状況にある。
日本のインターネットに従量課金が復活するのは、すぐ目の前と見た。

This project became Mapumental .
Please visit www.mapumental.com for details of our transit - time maps and the services we can offer .
The work was funded and supported by the Department for Transport .
—
( See also the separate post on methods . )
Introduction
Transport maps and timetables help people work out how to get from A to B using buses , trains and other forms of public transport .
But what if you do n’t yet know what journey you want to make ?
How can maps help then ?
This may seem a strange question to ask , but it is one we all face in several situations :
Where would I like to work ?
Where would I like to live ?
Where would I like to go on holiday ?
These are much more complicated questions than those about individual journeys , but one thing they all have in common is transport : can I get to and from the places I ’m considering quickly and easily ?
The maps on this page show one way of answering that question .
Using colours and contour lines they show how long it takes to travel between one particular place and every other place in the area , using public transport .
They also show the areas from which no such journey is possible , because the services are not good enough .
Examples
Rail travel in Great Britain
Our first example is about rail travel .
The map below shows how long it takes to get from Cambridge Station to every other station in the UK , starting at seven o’clock on a weekday morning .
This could be useful if you lived in Cambridge , and were wondering where you might go for a long weekend away and did n’t want to travel more than 4 hours .
We assume that people will take a taxi from a convenient train station to their destination , so long as that journey is no more than an hour .
( Please see our methods page for a more detailed description of our assumptions . )
You can click on any of the maps on this page to see a larger version .

The white contour lines are drawn at one - hour intervals , so the innermost , almost circular contour shows destinations up to an hour from Cambridge , the concentric one two hours , and so forth .
( Technically , the contours are “ isochrones ” , meaning lines of constant time , as for “ isobars ” for lines of constant atmospheric pressure on a weather map . )
Places , such as Leeds , which are surrounded by little circular contours are more - accessible “ islands ” served by fast trains with infrequent stops ; they are therefore quicker to reach than those in the surrounding areas which require lengthy changes or journeys on slower services .
The colour scale , shown on the top right of the map , is in hours of total travel time .
Warm colours indicate short travel time — red for four hours or less , orange and yellow for four to eight hours — and cool colours longer journeys .
The longest journey times of all , to destinations in the far north and west of Scotland , are over nineteen hours ( remember that this includes waiting time , which could often be overnight ) .
Areas with no colour at all , such as the area around Hawich on the Scottish Borders or the north - west coast of Scotland , cannot be reached at all by rail and a taxi journey of up to one hour .
The map shows that the fastest journeys are those along the East Coast Main Line north to Edinburgh , and those south to London , which is served by frequent fast trains .
Everywhere in England can be reached within about seven hours ( so by two o’clock in this example ) , and everywhere in Wales within about ten hours , though many of the fastest journeys to rural areas of mid-Wales will involve a long taxi journey .
The urban areas of lowland Scotland are similarly well - connected , but areas further north are much less accessible , or even inaccessible where there are no stations within an hour ’s drive of a given destination .
Edinburgh
The next map is for journeys starting from Edinburgh Waverley station , but otherwise it is the same as the Cambridge map .

Department for Transport 100020237 2006
Here the East Coast Main Line is even more obvious than in the preceding map ; it appears as a tendril of red and pink stretching south from Edinburgh down to London .
Comparing car and train travel
Again considering journeys starting from Cambridge , this map shows which parts of the country are quicker to get to by train ( red and orange ) , and which by car ( green and blue ) .
Yellow and light orange show areas where there ’s no great difference .
This could be useful if you had limited access to a car and were planning where to go , or wanted to see whether it was worth hiring a car for a particular trip .

Department for Transport 100020237 2006
This time , contours are drawn for each hour of difference in travel time .
Note also that the scale is quite asymmetric : the most time you can save travelling by train is about two hours , but — for places which are difficult to reach by train — you can save six or seven hours travelling by road .
From this map , journeys to London are quicker by train ( the road travel model takes no account of traffic or urban areas , so it is pessimistic about the time saving ) as are journeys to Leeds , Berwick , Edinburgh , Glasgow and other points served by trains on the East Coast Main Line .
In the west of England , journeys to Exeter and thereabouts are quicker by rail , but all other journeys are quicker by road ( largely because most westward journeys require a change at London or a slow cross-country train to Birmingham ) .
( However , the model of car journey times is very simplistic , so these results should not be taken too seriously — we hope to extend the work with a more realistic model of driving times , which may substantially change the comparative results . )
Bus and rail travel in Cambridge and surrounds
Our second example is based on public transport in and around Cambridge , which chiefly means buses within town and from outlying villages into the city center .
Here we ask how early must you get up and leave your home to reach a particular place of work by public transport .
In this example the destination we ’ve selected is the University of Cambridge ’s West Cambridge Site , which is also home to a number of commercial employers including Microsoft .

Department for Transport 100020237 2006
This map shows the city center of Cambridge , and the area around the destination , which is marked by a small black circle ( left middle ) .
Again , warm colours show short journey times — in this case , later departures — but the contour lines are drawn at intervals of ten minutes , rather than an hour , so that the innermost contour around the destination corresponds to a start time of about ten to nine .
Again , uncoloured areas are those not served by any services ; on this map these are all fields lying outside the city itself .
Cambridge is a small city with a lot of bus services , so it is not very surprising that the whole of the city center and much of the suburbs are within twenty to thirty minutes ’ travel of the destination , even including waiting and walking time .
Moving further out , though , the picture changes : ( selected villages are labelled for orientation purposes )
© Crown copyright .
All rights reserved .
Department for Transport 100020237 2006
The larger map clearly shows the differing level of service to various outlying villages within 5 – 10 km of Cambridge .
Areas which are connected to Cambridge by fast roads , such as the A14 which runs through Fenstanton and Bar Hill , then skirts Cambridge to the north , and continues east via Stow cum Quy ( just south of Swaffham Bulbeck ) are much better served than villages such as Reach , which lies well off the beaten track .
Waterbeach and Great Shelford , to the north and south of the center of Cambridge respectively , are also served by train services .
Even on this scale there are a few habitations with no or limited bus service and from which it is not possible to reach the West Cambridge Site for 9 o’clock purely by public transport without a long walk or an overnight journey ( for instance , Rampton , to the north - east of Longstanton , or Childerley , to the north - west of Hardwick ) .
Looking at a yet larger scale shows a similar pattern :
© Crown copyright .
All rights reserved .
Department for Transport 100020237 2006
This map shares the same colour scheme as the previous one — warm colours indicate short journeys , and cool colours long journeys — but the contours are at intervals of thirty minutes rather than ten .
Towns such as Huntingdon , Newmarket and Ely are ideal commuter territory , as are some intermediate villages ; but most outlying villages are n’t connected at all .
London
As a comparison with transport around Cambridge , we ’ve also drawn maps for London , a much more densely - populated area with correspondingly better transport infrastructure ( you will see that there are almost no inaccessible grey areas ) .
Here the chosen destination is the Department for Transport ( DfT ) headquarters on Horseferry in Westminster .
Starting with the most local map :
© Crown copyright .
All rights reserved .
Department for Transport 100020237 2006
Again , warm colours indicate short journeys and cool ones longer journeys .
On this map contours are shown at ten - minute intervals , so that the near - circular one around the destination indicates the area in which you can get to the DfT by leaving the house at about ten to nine in the morning .
Moving slightly further out , nearby tube stations ( St James ’s Park , Westminster and Pimlico ) and bus routes to the south and east are important .
Further south there are islands of accessibility around mainline train stations such as Brixton and Clapham Junction .
On a smaller - scale map , the tube and railway lines themselves show up as chains of such islands :

Department for Transport 100020237 2006
On this scale , particular ill - connected areas of London are clearly visible : Hackney , Richmond and Dulwich ( despite a direct train service to Victoria ) both require an eight o’clock start to arrive at the DfT for our nine o’clock deadline .
Compare these to the region of good connectivity stretching south and south - west from the center , along the Northern Line and mainline rail line through Wimbledon , the District line to the west , and the Docklands Light Railway to the east .
On this scale individual bus routes are not particularly evident , even though they are significant everywhere that rail or tube stations are too far away to walk to in the model ; contrast this with the Cambridgeshire maps above .
On this final map , of the whole Greater London area and surrounds , the contour lines are at half - hour intervals :

All rights reserved .
Department for Transport 100020237 2006
At this scale the suburbs of London appear to be arranged along a southwest –northeast axis , a result of good rail links to Surbiton and Twickenham ( at the ends of the two red tendrils which stretch away from the center to lower left ) .
Other rail lines , such as those to Bromley and Orpington in the southeast , are also visible , as are islands of short journey time such as Watford ( northwest ) , Hersham and Esher ( southwest ) ; these surround individual locations with fast ( c. 1 hour ) journey times into central London .
What next ?
Further work
We are considering various possible extensions and improvements , and we ’re keen to talk to anyone else interested in the work so far , or any of these ideas :
Relating journey times to house prices
An obvious application for travel time data are to people ’s decisions about where to live .
By comparing journey time data for particular locations to house prices in areas nearby it would be possible to tabulate the cheapest areas to live in within a certain travel time of a desired location , for instance a person ’s place of work .
Improving the road travel model to better reflect comparative rail and road journey times
At the moment our rail travel model assumes that the final stage of each journey is by taxi , under the assumption of a uniform and isotropic road network .
This is clearly inadequate ; we would like to extend it using journey planning software ( preferably including traffic and time - of - day effects ) to
produce more reliable travel time and modal comparison maps .
Cost
At the moment the maps are constructed on the assumption that users will always choose the quickest journey under the imposed constraints .
Of course in reality users also respond to other incentives , of which one of the most importantly is price .
If we could obtain fare data we could show journey costs rather than times , use more realistic constraints ( for instance , choosing the shortest journey cheaper than a certain amount ) , or comparing the prices for tickets bought on the day to those bought at varying intervals before travel .
Improving the readability of the maps
The maps could be made much easier to understand .
Improvements could be made by refinement of the colours used and by replacing the current ( OS Explorer and 1:250,000 ) base maps with simpler ones showing sufficient information to allow the viewer to understand the placement of the map without extraneous detail such as building lines etc .
Incorporating reliability information Presently we assume that all public transport services run according to their published timetable .
This means that we are more optimistic about total travel times than would be regular users of those services , who will know how often services are late , cancelled or whatever .
In some cases — for instance , train services — reliability data are published , but in general this is probably better handled by a statistical model .
Both reliability and
users ’ tolerance for unpunctuality could be incorporated , so that users could state the tolerance they have for late arrival at their destination ( for
instance , no more than once every month ) and journey times computed so as to meet that target on average .
A real - time web service
While our approach uses only published data and services ( existing public sector journey planners such as
TransportDirect ) , the maps are quite slow to construct ; for instance , the one of London above required about ten hours of computer time ; further , each one is relevant only to a particular destination or origin ( and points near it ) .
If we could speed up this process , we could generate maps on demand for visitors to a website ; to do this we would need to work with organisations such as Transport for London and incorporate more specific information about services in each area , rather than relying entirely on outside services .
This is an attractive idea , although it would be expensive to build .
Please contact us if you have any questions or comments .
Acknowledgments
This work was funded by the Department for Transport , who also made it possible for us to use Ordnance Survey maps and data through their licence ; without this assistance we would have had to pay expensive fees to use the underlying mapping data or to produce maps with no landmarks , which would be almost incomprehensible .
DfT also gave us access to their National Public Transport Access Node database , which records the locations of train and tube stations and bus stops ; without this it would have been difficult to produce any maps at all .
The data we used
Although the journey planning services and software we used were publicly accessible , almost none of the other data is available unless you pay for it , or your work falls under an existing licencing agreement .
So while we set out to demonstrate how easily we could make travel - time maps from public data , very little of this work could be cheaply reproduced or extended without assistance from a government department .
That ’s unfortunate , because it means that innovative work by outsiders in this area can only go ahead if it ’s explicitly sponsored by government .
If all the data we ’ve used had been available for free , somebody else might well have done what we ’ve done years ago , with no cost to the taxpayer .
We ’d love it if others extend the work that we ’ve done , but realistically there are n’t very many people in a position to do this cheaply .

Washington Terrorist funds - tracking no secret , some say Cite White House boasts of tighter monitoring system WASHINGTON -- News reports disclosing the Bush administration 's use of a special bank surveillance program to track terrorist financing spurred outrage in the White House and on Capitol Hill , but some specialists pointed out yesterday that the government itself has publicly discussed its stepped - up efforts to monitor terrorist finances since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
On Monday , President Bush said it was ``disgraceful " that The New York Times and other media outlets reported last week that the US government was quietly monitoring international financial transactions handled by an industry - owned cooperative in Belgium called the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communication , or SWIFT , which is controlled by nearly 8,000 institutions in 20 countries .
The Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , and The Wall Street Journal also reported about the program .
The controversy continued to simmer yesterday when Senator Jim Bunning , a Republican of Kentucky , accused the Times of ``treason , " telling reporters in a conference call that it ``scares the devil out of me " that the media would reveal such sensitive information .
Senator Pat Roberts , a Kansas Republican , requested US intelligence agencies to assess whether the reports have damaged anti terrorism operations .
And Representative Peter King , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , has urged Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez to pursue ``possible criminal prosecution " of the Times , which has reported on other secret government surveillance programs .
The New York Times Co. owns The Boston Globe .
But a search of public records -- government documents posted on the Internet , congressional testimony , guidelines for bank examiners , and even an executive order President Bush signed in September 2001 -- describe how US authorities have openly sought new tools to track terrorist financing since 2001 .
That includes getting access to information about terrorist - linked wire transfers and other transactions , including those that travel through SWIFT .
`` There have been public references to SWIFT before , " said Roger Cressey , a senior White House counterterrorism official until 2003 .
`` The White House is overreaching when they say [ The New York Times committed ] a crime against the war on terror .
It has been in the public domain before . "
Victor D. Comras , a former US diplomat who oversaw efforts at the United Nations to improve international measures to combat terror financing , said it was common knowledge that worldwide financial transactions were being closely monitored for links to terrorists .
``A lot of people were aware that this was going on , " said Comras , one of a half - dozen financial experts UN Secretary General Kofi Annan recruited for the task .
``Unless they were pretty dumb , they had to assume " their transactions were being monitored , Comras said of terrorist groups .
``We have spent the last four years bragging how effective we have been in tracking terrorist financing . "
Indeed , a report that Comras co-authored in 2002 for the UN Security Council specifically mentioned SWIFT as a source of financial information that the United States had tapped into .
The system , which handles trillions of dollars in worldwide transactions each day , serves as a main hub for banks and other financial institutions that move money around the world .
According to The New York Times , SWIFT executives agreed to give the Treasury Department and the CIA broad access to its database .
SWIFT and other worldwide financial clearinghouses ``are critical to processing international banking transactions and are rich with payment information , " according to the 33 - page report by the terrorist monitoring group established by the UN Security Council in late 2001 .
`` The United States has begun to apply new monitoring techniques to spot and verify suspicious transactions .
The group recommends the adoption of similar mechanisms by other countries . "
Some worry that the new disclosures will nonetheless hamper US counter - terrorism efforts .
``I worked this stuff and I can guarantee that [ revealing the SWIFT ] information made a difference , " said Dennis Lormel , a retired FBI special agent who helped establish the bureau 's Terrorist Financing Operations Section before leaving government in 2003 .
`` The disclosure will have an adverse impact on investigations .
It was used in two specific instances where it helped to track terrorists .
We also used it for lead value . "
But the White House has also been very public about its efforts to track the overseas banking transactions of Americans and other foreign nationals .
Less than two weeks after the 9/11 attacks , Bush signed an executive order calling for greater cooperation with foreign entities to monitor money that might be headed to terrorist groups .
The executive order was posted on the White House website .
The document called for ``cooperation with , and sharing information by , United States and foreign financial institutions as an additional tool to enable the United States to combat the financing of terrorism . "
Richard Newcomb , the head of the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Asset Control at the time , later publicly credited the president for enabling US law enforcement and intelligence agencies to nab suspected terrorists , including followers of ``Hambali , " Al Qaeda 's leader in Southeast Asia .
The New York Times report said Hambali's capture in 2003 came with the aid of information gleaned from SWIFT .
Administration officials have said this week that the disclosure of such details were particularly damaging to US security .
Nevertheless , in July 2003 -- a month before Hambali was captured -- Newcomb told the Senate Government Affairs Committee in detail about a program initiated after 9/11 between his office and the Pentagon to track Hambali 's financial network in Southeast Asia .
The scope of the project included Indonesia , the Philippines , Malaysia , and Singapore , focusing on the finances of Jemaa Islamiyah , the Al Qaeda group run by Hambali that was responsible for deadly bombings in Bali in 2002 .
He said the operation ``identified the key leaders , fund - raisers , businessmen , recruiters , companies , charities , mosques , and schools that were part of [ Jamaa Islamiyah ] support network .
Thus far , we have imposed sanctions against two of these key nodes , and are coordinating action against several others , " Newcomb told the committee .
Other public documents have also detailed post - 9/11 efforts to follow terrorist money .
The Patriot Act approved by Congress after the attacks emphasized providing new authorities for the Bush administration to track and choke off terrorist funds around the world .
One part of the act , dealing specifically with terrorist money , was described by the Treasury Department as the most ``significant [ anti- money - laundering ] law " since a 1970 law requiring banks to report cash transactions over $ 10,000 .
That section of the Patriot Act required the Bush administration to ``adopt regulations to encourage further cooperation among financial institutions , their regulatory authorities , and law enforcement authorities " to track terrorist - related money laundering .
In testimony before Congress in early 2002 , Juan C. Zarate , deputy assistant Treasury secretary in charge of terrorism and violent crime , discussed how the global exchange of information was a key element in choking off their source of funds .
He cited a special international meeting hosted a month after the attacks by the international Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , ``to eliminate existing impediments to exchanging information " between financial institutions and to find solutions to the challenges of tracking terrorist funds .

Americans have a third fewer close friends and confidants than just two decades ago , and the number of people who have none has more than doubled -- another sign we may be living lonelier , more isolated lives than in the past , a survey being released today will say .
The survey found that men and women of every race , age and education level reported fewer intimate friends than the same survey turned up in 1985 .
Their remaining confidants were more likely to be members of their nuclear family than in 1985 , according to the study , but intimacy within families was down , too .
The findings are reported in the June issue of the American Sociological Review .
" You usually do n't see that kind of big social change in a couple of decades , " said study coauthor Lynn Smith - Lovin , professor of sociology at Duke University in Durham , N.C .
This is n't just an academic exercise :
Close relationships serve as a safety net , she said .
" Whether it 's picking up a child in day care or finding someone to help you out of the city in a hurricane , these are people we depend on . "
Linda Bickel can relate .
The 33 - year - old Detroiter is a designer for an advertising agency downtown .
Her closest confidants are a sister and sister - in - law .
" For me , it 's because I always had a close family , " Bickel said .
" Even when I was married -- I was married for 10 years -- we would do stuff with his family or our close friends .
We did n't have a big circle . "
One explanation for friendship 's decline is that adults are working longer hours and socializing less .
That includes women who , when homemakers , tended to have strong community networks .
In addition , commutes are longer , and TV viewing and computer use are up .
As connections to neighbors and social clubs decline , Smith - Lovin said , " From a social point of view it means you 've got more people isolated in a small network of people who are just like them . "
Carissa Gaden , a St. Clair Shores psychologist , said Thursday that more harried lifestyles contribute to the lack of close relationships .
" Most people are so busy nowadays that maybe they do n't have the time to nurture relationships .
The person you run into at your daughter 's soccer game may not be the person that you want to say ' Hey , I 'm really concerned about this ...' to . "
But Gaden said while the Duke study shows people have fewer close friends , that does n't mean people do n't want them .
" The clients I work with talk a lot about relationships , " she said .
" People definitely want those close relationships with other people . "
A person 's relationships or lack of them -- can say a lot about the person .
" When I 'm meeting someone , I want to know about their relationships , because it tells me about how emotionally healthy they are , " Gaden said .
The research team 's findings are based on questions that they added to one of the nation 's classic attitude polls , the General Social Survey , which the University of Chicago 's National Opinion Research Center has conducted every two years since 1972 .
In the face - to - face survey , 1,467 people -- a nationally representative sample -- were asked to count and describe all the people with whom they 'd discussed matters important to them in the previous six months .
The question asked in 2004 was the same as that asked in 1985 , although the term " discussed " may have led some recent respondents to omit friendships sustained by e-mail , Smith - Lovin admitted .
" But if you need someone to pick up your kid from the day care center because you 're stuck at work , you can't e-mail someone in New York , " she said .
Added Detroiter Bickel : those e-mail relationships are n't as intimate .
" The way we communicate is different , " said Bickel , who e-mails college friends .
" E - mail is so easy to keep a lot of people in the loop in a more casual way .
Whereas if they used to have to write letters to keep in touch with people , it was more personal . "

In the 1990s , it was very difficult to get any kind of compensation for developing content and putting it on the Internet .
That ’s presumably how we ended up with an Internet that is 99 percent spam , porn , and catalog shopping .
I never liked banner ads and did not place them on any site that I controlled because the ads were so poorly targeted .
It seemed like a waste of everyone ’s time and energy when the chance of the reader being interested was so low and therefore the chance of a clickthrough was minimal .
Sure enough , ad rates that had been reasonably high in the 1990s fell to the point that even very popular sites could n’t get serious money from banner advertising by 2002 .
A friend convinced me that perhaps it was time to give Google Ads a try .
The ads are targeted by looking at the words on the page where they appear .
The ads are text , so they ’re not graphically obnoxious .
I started my experiment by adding Google ads into the bulletin board pages at http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/ .
This is a server that suffered a database meltdown six months ago .
Nobody is going there to post anymore .
I had planned to throw the machine out .
Google ’s terms prohibit me from writing about the clickthrough rate , but not the bottom line .
After about 10 days , it seems that the ads are bringing in a steady $ 60 per day or nearly $ 20,000 per year .
Encouraged , I put some ads into a few of the pages at http://philip.greenspun.com, including the materialism , flying , and aquarium subdirectories .
These bring in another $ 20 - 30 per day and the click through rates are high enough that I do n’t feel too embarrassed for wasting screen space and reader attention .
Could it be that we are going to enter a golden age of content , fueled by the Google Ads team ?
We gather the official position of the Prime Meridian at Greenwich is not to the liking of the powers that be at Google , as they have decided to shift it 100 metres or so east .
Yes indeed , according to the most reliable authority ( The Greenwich Observatory press office - and if they do n't know , who does ? ) , the line marking zero degrees longitude passes right through the observatory buildings and across the forecourt where there is a lovely sculpture on top of which happy tourists can pose , one foot in the east and one in the west .
We 'll leave it to readers to construct an eloborate conspiracy theory around the Google Earth Prime Meridian relocation outrage , which you can confirm here ( . kmz file ) . ®

HOW TO GET RICH
A Talk by Jared Diamond
In Guns , Germs , and Steel I asked why history has unfolded differently over the last 13,000 years in Eurasia , in the Americas , in sub-Saharan Africa , and in Aboriginal Australia , with the result that within the last 500 years Europeans were the ones who conquered Native Americans and Aboriginal Australians and sub-Saharan Africans , rather than vice versa .
Most of that book , was concerned with comparing the peoples of different continents , but I knew that I could n't publish a book comparing the histories of different continents and considering Eurasia as a unit without saying something about the fascinating problem of the differences of history within Eurasia .
Why , within Eurasia , was it Europeans who conquered the world and colonized other people , rather than the Chinese or the people of India or the Middle East ?
I devoted seven pages to that subject at the end of Guns , Germs , and Steel , and I think I arrived at the correct solution .
Nevertheless , since the publication of Guns , Germs , and Steel , I 've received a lot of feedback , and the most interesting feedback has been about the implications of that comparative analysis of the histories of China , Europe , India , and the Middle East .
In particular , in addition to the review of my book by Bill Gates , I 've received a lot of correspondence from economists and business people , who pointed out to me possible parallels between the histories of entire human societies and histories of smaller groups .
This correspondence from economists and business people has to do with the following big question : what is the best way to organize human groups and human organizations and businesses so as to maximize productivity , creativity , innovation , and wealth ?
Should your human group have a centralized direction , in the extreme having a dictator , or should there be diffuse or even anarchical organization ?
Should your collection of people be organized into a single group , or broken off into a number of groups , or broken off into a lot of groups ?
Should you maintain open communication between your groups , or erect walls between them , with groups working more secretly ?
Should you erect protectionist tariff walls against the outside , or should you expose your business or government to free competition ?
These questions about group organization arise at many different levels and for many types of groups .
They arise , of course , about the organization of entire governments or countries : what is the best way to govern a country ?
Remember the classic arguments about whether the best government is a benign dictatorship , or a federal system , or an anarchical free - for - all .
The same questions also rise about the organization of different companies within the same industry .
How can you account for the fact that Microsoft has been so successful recently , and that IBM , which was formerly successful , fell behind but then drastically changed its organization over the last four years and improved its success ?
How can we explain the different successes of what we call different industrial belts ?
When I was a boy growing up in Boston , Route 128 , the industrial belt around Boston , led the industrial world in scientific creativity and imagination .
But Route 128 has fallen behind , and now Silicon Valley is the center of innovation .
And the relations of businesses to each other in Silicon Valley and Route 128 are very different , possibly resulting in those different outcomes .

The US CAN - Spam law is designed to smother unsolicited e-mail
American Jason Smathers , 25 , said he turned into a " cyberspace outlaw " after selling the database of 92 million screen names and e-mail addresses .
As a result of his actions in 2003 , about seven billion unsolicited spam e-mails flooded inboxes of AOL members .
Prosecutors said Mr Smathers had violated recent Can - Spam laws , which aim to clamp down on unsolicited mail .
He was also accused of breaking US interstate transportation of stolen property laws .
Mr Smathers admitted accepting $ 28,000 ( £ 15,515 ) from an individual for the list of AOL member details .
The details are still thought to be circulating amongst spammer rings .
The public at large has an interest in making sure people respect the same values that apply in everyday life , on the internet
Assistant US Attorney David Siegal
" Cyberspace is a new and strange place , " Mr Smathers wrote .
" I was good at navigating in that frontier and I became an outlaw . "
Assistant US Attorney David Siegal concluded that the case had shown that the net was " not lawless " anymore .
" The public at large has an interest in making sure people respect the same values that apply in everyday life , on the internet , " he said .
Mr Smathers ' lawyer added that the theft had been a " dumb , stupid , insane act " .
AOL said Mr Smathers ' act had cost the company at least $ 300,000 ( £ 166,240 ) , although the judge said that figure was speculative .
The judge ordered Mr Smathers to pay $ 84,000 ( £ 46,560 ) in restitution , but he delayed the order so that AOL could prove whether the damages were higher .
Mr Smathers was fired by AOL in June 2004 .
He was said to have used another employee 's access code to steal the list of AOL customers in 2003 from its headquarters in Dulles , Virginia .
Spam laws
The US CAN - Spam legislation ( Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ) was introduced in the US in January 2004 .
The US and UK laws to control spam have been criticised as ineffective .
Some legal action in the US has had to be brought against individuals or groups using local state laws instead .
Spammer Jeremy Jaynes was recently sentenced in Virginia , where there are tough anti-spam laws , to nine years in prison for sending 10 million junk e-mails daily .
But unsolicited e-mails in the US rose by 10 % after the introduction of its anti-spam laws .
The majority of spam originates outside of Europe , from the Americas in particular .
UK spammers account for less than two percent of all junk e-mails sent .
The anti-spam campaign group , Spamhaus , estimates that by summer 2006 spam will account for 95 % of all e-mails sent .
It said that spam would not stop until the US acts to toughen its laws .
Last week , software giant Microsoft has won a $ 7 m ( £ 3.9 m ) court settlement from a businessman considered to be one of the world 's biggest senders of spam e-mail .
Scott Richter agreed to pay the sum after Microsoft filed a lawsuit against his net firm Opt In Real Big .
Loopholes in UK law mean legislation is ineffective in the fight against spammers , according to Spamhaus .
Since UK anti-spam laws came into force more than a year ago no UK spammers have been fined or prosecuted .
Procrastination , the habit of putting tasks off to the last possible minute , can be a major problem in both your career and your personal life .
Side effects include missed opportunities , frenzied work hours , stress , overwhelm , resentment , and guilt .
This article will explore the root causes of procrastination and give you several practical tools to overcome it .
The behavior pattern of procrastination can be triggered in many different ways , so you wo n’t always procrastinate for the same reason .
Sometimes you ’ll procrastinate because you ’re overwhelmed with too much on your plate , and procrastination gives you an escape .
Other times you ’ll feel tired and lazy , and you just ca n’t get going .
Let ’s now address these various causes of procrastination and consider intelligent ways to respond .
1. Stress
When you feel stressed , worried , or anxious , it ’s hard to work productively .
In certain situations procrastination works as a coping mechanism to keep your stress levels under control .
A wise solution is to reduce the amount of stress in your life when possible , such that you can spend more time working because you want to , not because you have to .
One of the simplest ways to reduce stress is to take more time for play .
In his book The Now Habit , Dr. Neil Fiore suggests that making time for guaranteed fun can be an effective way to overcome procrastination .
Decide in advance what blocks of time you ’ll allocate each week to family time , entertainment , exercise , social activities , and personal hobbies .
Then schedule your work hours using whatever time is left .
This can reduce the urge to procrastinate because your work will not encroach on your leisure time , so you do n’t have to procrastinate on work in order to relax and enjoy life .
I caution against overusing this strategy , however , as your work should normally be enjoyable enough that you ’re motivated to do it .
If you are n’t inspired by your daily work , admit that you made a mistake in choosing the wrong career path ; then seek out a new direction that does inspire you .
Benjamin Franklin advised that the optimal strategy for high productivity is to split your days into one third work , one third play , and one third rest .
Once again the suggestion is to guarantee your leisure time .
Hold your work time and your play time as equally important , so one does n’t encroach upon the other .
I ’m most productive when I take abundant time for play .
This helps me burn off excess stress and enjoy life more , and my work life is better when I ’m happier .
I also create a relaxed office environment that reduces stress levels .
My office includes healthy plants , a fountain , and several scented candles .
I often listen to relaxing music while I work .
Despite all the tech equipment , my office has a very relaxed feel to it .
Because I enjoy being there , I can work a full day without feeling overly stressed or anxious , even when I have a lot to do .
For additional tips to make your work environment more peaceful and relaxing , read the article 10 Ways to Relaxify Your Workspace .
2. Overwhelm
Sometimes you may have more items on your to - do list than you can reasonably complete .
This can quickly lead to overwhelm , and ironically you may be more likely to procrastinate when you can least afford it .
Think of it as your brain refusing to cooperate with a schedule that you know is unreasonable .
In this case the message is that you need to stop , reassess your true priorities , and simplify .
Options for reducing schedule overwhelm include elimination , delegation , and negotiation .
First , review your to - dos and cut as much as you can .
Cut everything that is n’t truly important .
This should be a no- brainer , but it ’s amazing how poorly people actually implement it .
People cut things like exercise while leaving plenty of time for TV , even though exercise invigorates them and TV drains them .
When you cut items , be honest about removing the most worthless ones first , and retain those that provide real value .
Secondly , delegate tasks to others as much as possible .
Ask for extra help if necessary .
And thirdly , negotiate with others to free up more time for what ’s really important .
If you happen to have a job that overloads you with more work than you feel is reasonable , it ’s up to you to decide if it ’s worthwhile to continue in that situation .
Personally I would n’t tolerate a job that pushed me to overwork myself to the point of feeling overwhelmed ; that ’s counterproductive for both the employer and the employee .
Be aware that the peak performers in any field tend to take more vacation time and work shorter hours than the workaholics .
Peak performers get more done in less time by keeping themselves fresh , relaxed , and creative .
By treating your working time as a scarce resource rather than an uncontrollable monster that can gobble up every other area of your life , you ’ll be more balanced , focused , and effective .
It ’s been shown that the optimal work week for most people is 40 - 45 hours .
Working longer hours than this actually has such an adverse effect on productivity and motivation that less real work gets done .
This is especially true for creative , information age work .
Do n’t just take my word for it though ; test this concept for yourself .
Many years ago I ran a simple experiment to determine how efficiently I was working .
I measured my efficiency ratio as the number of hours I spent doing important work divided by the number of hours I spent in my office each week .
The first time I did this I was shocked to find that I only got 15 hours of real work done while spending 60 hours in my office , an efficiency ratio of 25 % .
Can you believe that ?
Over the following weeks , I increased my productivity dramatically while spending far fewer hours in my office .
By limiting my work hours , I actually got more done .
You can read the details in the article Triple Your Personal Productivity .
I now know that working long hours is huge mistake , and I challenge you to discover this truth for yourself .
3. Laziness
Often we procrastinate because we feel too physically and / or emotionally drained to work .
Once we fall into this pattern , it ’s easy to get stuck due to inertia because an object at rest tends to remain at rest .
When you feel lazy , even simple tasks seem like too much work because your energy is too low compared to the energy required by the task .
If you blame the task for being too difficult or tedious , you ’ll procrastinate to conserve energy .
But the longer you do this , the more your resolve will weaken , and your procrastination habit may begin spiraling toward depression .
Feeling weak and unmotivated should n’t be your norm , so it ’s important to disrupt this pattern as soon as you become aware of it .
The solution is straightforward : get off your butt and physically move your body .
Exercise helps to raise your energy levels .
When your energy is high , tasks will seem to get easier , and you ’ll be less resistant to taking action .
A fit person can handle more activity than an unfit person , even though the difficulty of the tasks remains the same .
Through trial and error , I discovered that diet and exercise are critical in keeping my energy consistently high .
I went vegetarian in 1993 and vegan in 1997 , and these dietary improvements gave me a significant ongoing energy boost .
When I exercise regularly , my metabolism stays high throughout the day .
I rarely procrastinate due to laziness because I have the energy and mental clarity to tackle whatever comes my way .
Tasks seem easier to complete than they did when my diet and exercise habits were poor .
The tasks are the same , but I ’ve grown stronger .
A wonderful side benefit of the diet / exercise habit is that I was able to get by with less sleep .
I used to need at least 8 - 9 hours of sleep per night to feel rested , but now I function well on about 6.5 hours .
The most energizing foods are raw fruits and vegetables .
Make your diet abundant in these foods , and you ’ll likely see a marked improvement in your energy levels .
The first week or two , however , you may temporarily feel worse as your body takes the opportunity to detox .
Erin and I each lost seven pounds the first week we went vegan .
Once the dairy clog finally got cleaned out , our intestines were better able to metabolize everything we ate from then on .
We later learned that this is actually quite common .
There ’s a good reason baby cows need four stomachs to digest their mother ’s milk .
Human beings can’t metabolize dairy products properly , so the partially digested cow proteins float through the bloodstream and must be eliminated as toxins ( i.e. poisons ) .
This requires even more energy , which can leave you feeling more tired than you otherwise would .
You ’ll have to decide for yourself how far you want to take this .
I suggest you try different dietary changes for only 30 days at first to see how it affects you .
That ’s how I went vegetarian and later vegan .
In each case I went into the challenge fully expecting to revert back at the end of the 30 days , but I liked the results so much that I could n’t fathom going back .
Do n’t take my word for this .
Experiment for yourself , and discover what health habits work best for you .
For more tips see the article How to Find the Best Diet for You .
4. Lack of Motivation
We all experience temporary laziness at times , but if you suffer from chronically low motivation and just ca n’t seem to get anything going , then it ’s time for you to let go of immature thought patterns , to embrace life as a mature adult , and to discover your true purpose in life .
Until you identify an inspiring purpose , you ’ll never come close to achieving your potential , and your motivation will always remain weak .
For more than a decade I ran a computer game publishing company .
That was a dream of mine in my early 20s , and it was wonderful to be able to fulfill that dream .
However , as I entered my 30s , I began feeling much less passionate about it .
I was competent at what I did , the business was doing well financially , and I enjoyed plenty of free time .
But I just did n’t care that much about entertainment software anymore .
As my passion faded , I started asking , “ What ’s the point of continuing with this line of work ? ”
Consequently , I procrastinated on some projects that could have moved the business forward .
I tried to boost my motivation using a variety of techniques but to no avail .
Finally I recognized what I really needed was a total career change .
I needed to find a more inspiring career path .
After much soul searching , I retired from the gaming industry and launched StevePavlina.com .
What an amazing change that was !
I found renewed passion in helping people grow , so I did n’t have to use motivation - boosting techniques to get going .
I was naturally inspired to work .
I still feel totally inspired .
Best of all I procrastinated less on non-work tasks too — my passion spread across all areas of my life .
Center your work around an inspiring purpose , and you ’ll greatly reduce your tendency to procrastinate .
If you have n’t already done so , listen to Podcast # 15 – What Is Your Purpose ?.
Finding your purpose is a powerful way to defeat procrastination problems because you wo n’t procrastinate on what you love to do .
Chronic procrastination is actually a big warning sign that tells us , “ You ’re going the wrong way .
Take a different path ! ”
Once you ’ve centered your life around an inspiring purpose , then you can take advantage of certain motivational techniques to boost your motivation even higher .
For some specific motivational tips , read Cultivating Burning Desire .
5. Lack of Discipline
Even when motivation is high , you may still encounter tasks you do n’t want to do .
In these situations self - discipline works like a motivational backup system .
When you feel motivated , you do n’t need much discipline , but it sure comes in handy when you need to get something done but really do n’t want to do the work .
If your self - discipline is weak , however , procrastinating will be too tempting to resist .
I ’ve written a six - part series on how to develop your self - discipline , so I ’ll simply refer you there : Self - Discipline Series .
If you really want to overcome procrastination , you must release any attachment to the fantasy of a quick fix , and commit to making real progress .
Hopefully you have the maturity to recognize that reading a single article wo n’t cure your procrastination problems overnight , just as a single visit to the gym wo n’t make you an athlete .
6. Poor Time Management Habits
Do you ever find yourself falling behind because you overslept , because you were too disorganized , or because certain tasks just fell through the cracks ?
Bad habits like these often lead to procrastination , often unintentionally .
The solution in this case is to diagnose the bad habit that ’s hurting you and devise a new habit to replace it .
For example , if you have a problem oversleeping , take up the challenge of becoming an early riser .
To de-condition the old habit and install the new one , I recommend the 30 - day trial method .
Many readers have found this method extremely effective because it makes permanent change much easier .
For tasks you ’ve been putting off for a while , I recommend using the timeboxing method to get started .
Here ’s how it works :
First , select a small piece of the task you can work on for just 30 minutes .
Then choose a reward you will give yourself immediately afterwards .
The reward is guaranteed if you simply put in the time ; it does n’t depend on any meaningful accomplishment .
Examples include watching your favorite TV show , seeing a movie , enjoying a meal or snack , going out with friends , going for a walk , or doing anything you find pleasurable .
Because the amount of time you ’ll be working on the task is so short , your focus will shift to the impending pleasure of the reward instead of the difficulty of the task .
No matter how unpleasant the task , there ’s virtually nothing you ca n’t endure for just 30 minutes if you have a big enough reward waiting for you .
When you timebox your tasks , you may discover that something very interesting happens .
You will probably find that you continue working much longer than 30 minutes .
You will often get so involved in a task , even a difficult one , that you actually want to keep working on it .
Before you know it , you ’ve put in an hour or even several hours .
The certainty of your reward is still there , so you know you can enjoy it whenever you ’re ready to stop .
Once you begin taking action , your focus shifts away from worrying about the difficulty of the task and toward finishing the current piece of the task which now has your full attention .
When you do decide to stop working , claim and enjoy your reward .
Then schedule another 30 - minute period to work on the task with another reward .
This will help you associate more and more pleasure to the task , knowing that you will always be immediately rewarded for your efforts .
Working toward distant and uncertain long - term rewards is not nearly as motivating as immediate short - term rewards .
By rewarding yourself for simply putting in the time , instead of for any specific achievements , you ’ll be eager to return to work on your task again and again , and you ’ll ultimately finish it .

7. Lack of Skill
If you lack sufficient skill to complete a task at a reasonable level of quality , you may procrastinate to avoid a failure experience .
You then have three viable options to overcome this type of pattern : educate , delegate , or eliminate .
First , you can acquire the skill level you need by training up .
Just because you ca n’t do something today does n’t mean you ’ll never be able to do it .
Someday you may even master that skill .
For example , when I wanted to create my first website in 1995 , I did n’t know how to do it because I ’d never done it before .
But I knew I could learn to do it .
I took the time to learn HTML , and I experimented .
It did n’t take long before I launched a functional web site .
In the years since then , I continued to apply and upgrade that skill .
If you ca n’t do something , do n’t whine about it .
Educate yourself to gain skill until you become proficient .
A second option is to delegate tasks you lack the skill to do .
There are far too many interesting skills for you to master , so you must rely on others for help .
You may not realize it , but you ’re already a master at delegation .
Do you grow all your own food ?
Did you sew your own clothes ?
Did you build your own house ?
Chances are that you depend on others for your very survival .
If you want a certain result but do n’t want to acquire the skills to get that result , you can recruit others to help you .
For example , I do n’t want to spend my days trying to understand the details of the U.S. tax code , so I delegate that task to my accountant .
This frees me to spend more time working from my strengths .
Thirdly , you may conclude that a result is n’t needed badly enough to justify the effort of either education or delegation .
In that case the smart choice is to eliminate the task .
Sometimes procrastination is a sign that a task need n’t be done at all .
When I was in college , I felt that certain assignments were pointless busywork , and I could n’t justify the effort required to do them .
If the impact on my grade was n’t too great , I ’d decline to do those assignments .
Nobody cares that I received an A- instead of an A in a class because I declined to write an essay on gestural languages .
If an employer or graduate school screener ever did care , I ’d have turned the experience to my advantage by using it to demonstrate that I could set priorities .
8. Perfectionism
A common form of erroneous thinking that leads to procrastination is perfectionism .
Believing that you must do something perfectly is a recipe for stress , and you ’ll associate that stress with the task and thus condition yourself to avoid it .
So you put the task off to the last possible minute until you finally have a way out of this trap .
Now there is n’t enough time to do the job perfectly , so you ’re off the hook because you can tell yourself that you could have been perfect if you only had more time .
But if you have no specific deadline for a task , perfectionism can cause you to delay indefinitely .
The solution to perfectionism is to give yourself permission to be human .
Have you ever used a piece of software that you consider to be perfect in every way ?
I doubt it .
Realize that an imperfect job completed today is always superior to the perfect job delayed indefinitely .
Perfectionism also arises when you think of a project as one gigantic whole .
Replace that one big “ must be perfect ” project in your mind with one small imperfect first step .
Your first draft can be very , very rough .
You ’re always free to revise it later .
For example , if you want to write a 5000 - word article , allow your first draft be only 100 words if it helps you get started .
Some of these cures are challenging to implement , but they ’re effective .
If you really want to tame the procrastination beast , you ’ll need something stronger than quick - fix motivational rah-rah .
This problem is n’t going away on its own .
You must take the initiative .
The upside is that tackling this problem yields tremendous personal growth .
You ’ll become stronger , braver , more disciplined , more driven , and more focused .
These benefits will become hugely significant over your lifetime , so recognize that the challenge of overcoming procrastination is truly a blessing in disguise .
The whole point is to grow stronger .
Bericht über türkischen Jet - Abschuss verschärft Bergkarabach - Konflikt
Ein Bericht über den Abschuss eines armenischen Kampf - Jets durch die türkische Luftwaffe hat die Furcht vor einer Ausweitung des Konflikts um Bergkarabach verstärkt .
For Dutch football fans it has become the summer 's cult outfit .
Over the past few months , a quarter of a million Holland supporters have bought themselves a pair of patriotic orange lederhosen - wearing them whenever Holland take to the pitch in the World Cup .
But when Holland fans turned up on Friday to watch their team play the Ivory Coast , wearing the garish trousers , officials from Fifa were not amused .
The lederhosen carry the name of a Dutch beer , Bavaria .
The only problem is that the Dutch brewery which makes Bavaria is not an official World Cup sponsor .
And so , in one of the most surreal incidents of the World Cup so far , stadium officials in Stuttgart made the supporters take their trousers off - leaving many of them to watch Holland 's 2 - 1 victory in their underpants .
" They put our trousers in the bin , " said an aggrieved Peer Swinkels , the chairman of Bavaria , Holland 's second biggest brewery .
" Fans going into the stadium had to dump them in a big container .
Fifa said that the supporters could get them back afterwards .
But the container was full of rubbish so most people did n't bother .
I understand that Fifa wants to protect its sponsors .
But this is very strange . "
Critics say the decision to make more than 1,000 Dutch fans strip off last Friday is evidence of the extraordinary lengths to which Fifa has gone to protect the interests of World Cup sponsors - at the expense of ordinary fans .
Fifa , however , says it has done nothing wrong and is entitled to defend itself against what it calls " ambush marketing " .
Either way , there is little doubt of the seemingly unlimited power that sponsors now wield over global sporting events - with British politicians controversially voting to give sponsors a major role in the 2012 London Olympics .
Fifa said its six suppliers and 15 official partners - among them Yahoo , McDonald 's and the American brewery that makes Budweiser - had spent € 700 m ( £ 480 m ) on the tournament .
Without their money , it would be impossible to stage the competition , it said .
But the zeal with which Fifa guards its commercial interests has gone down badly with fans - as has its decision to offer 14 % of all match tickets to sponsors .
Only 8 % have gone to national football associations .
" It 's ridiculous , " said Sjoerd Schreurs , a Dutch supporter who had to take his trousers off .
" I queued for 25 minutes to get in .
When I reached the front , an official told me : ' You 're not getting in like that ' .
I took my trousers off .
I managed to chuck them over the fence to some friends .
But another official spotted them and took them away . '
" I watched the game in my pants , " Mr Schreurs , 33 , added .
" Fortunately I had quite a long T - shirt . "
Mr Swinkels dreamed up the idea of orange Leeuwenhose , or lion trousers , last year .
Dutch fans who purchased 12 cans of Bavaria beer could buy the trousers for just € 7.95 ( they come with the tail of a lion , Holland 's national symbol , and two extra large pockets for storing beer cans ) .
Holland 's biggest brewery , Heineken , the official sponsor of the Dutch football association , did n't like the trousers either .
It took legal action against Bavaria but lost - after a Dutch judge ruled that fans could wear whatever they wanted .
Mr Swinkels has written to Fifa 's president , Sepp Blatter , asking whether Dutch fans would have to remove their trousers again when Holland take on Argentina on Wednesday in Frankfurt .
" Since when can a sponsor determine what supporters wear ? " he wrote , pointing out : " Orange clothing and symbols are part of the national heritage of the Netherlands . "
But some industry experts say Fifa 's intervention was no surprise .
Nigel Currie , chairman of the European Sponsorship Association , said : " My view is that if there is a deliberate attempt to ambush an event , it should be stamped on . "
Mr Currie , who is also director of the sports marketing agency brand Rapport , said : " Sponsors pay huge amounts of money and it is all about TV exposure .
If people are caught on screen drinking the wrong kind of drink , it is unhelpful to sponsors .
But it should come down to commonsense and a sense of proportion . "
There were also allegations yesterday that England supporters at last Thursday 's Trinidad and Tobago match were forced to hand over Nike clothing at the entrance of the stadium in Nuremberg , because Adidas - the German sportswear giant and Nike 's deadly rival - is the official World Cup sponsor .
Last night , however , Fifa denied that any Nike clothing had been confiscated .
" There are no special rules regarding clothing at the World Cup .
Visitors can wear their normal clothing or replica shirts with or without advertising , irrespective of the manufacturer or sponsor 's logo , " a Fifa spokesman said .
This was true of " individuals " but not of groups , the spokesman continued .
Some of the most contentious debate during the passage of the London Olympics bill through the Commons surrounded clauses designed to prohibit illicit use of the words " Olympic Games " , " London 2012 " and the ringed symbol .
Lobbyists for the advertising industry believed the measures - insisted upon by the International Olympic Committee - were draconian .
The bill prevents non-sponsoring businesses trying to cash in on the games by suggesting a link with the Olympics in their advertising .
Locog , the London organising committee , supports the clampdown as necessary for it to raise the £ 2bn to stage the games .
It is searching for four sponsors , each to contribute at least £ 50 m .
Last night Mr Schreurs , was searching for a new pair of trousers .
" When I tried to get them back they had gone .
Holland and Germany have n't always had the easiest of relationships .
It 's funny to wear them in Germany if you 're Dutch . "
Sponsors play hardball with the corporately incorrect
· The softdrink police were on patrol during the cricket world cup in South Africa in 2003 .
Pepsi was one of the event 's four commercial partners and stewards searched fans ' coolboxes for its rival 's fizzy drinks .
A Johannesburg businessman was evicted from one game for drinking a can of Coca - Cola .
" I was told it was against the law , " he said .
" It is unacceptable that law - abiding citizens be browbeaten and summarily ejected for quietly drinking a beverage that is not approved of by the official sponsors . "
· Pepsi also ruled at the 2004 Champions Trophy cricket tournament trophy , where matches were played throughout England .
Fans were issued with a list of drinks and snacks they could take into grounds .
Pepsi and its family of drinks , such as Tango , 7 Up and Abbey Well mineral water , were acceptable , but no other brands were permitted .
There were also restrictions on fruit juices , iced teas and energy drinks .
Only Walkers crisps were permitted .
Walkers is owned by PepsiCo .
· In March 1998 Greenbriar high school in Evans , Georgia , US , sponsored a Coke In Education Day , with the whole curriculum built round Coca - Cola , including an economics lecture by the company 's executives and lessons on baking a Coca - Cola cake during the home economics class .
The climax of the day was a school photograph in which all students pictured wore red and white Coca - Cola T - shirts spelling out the word Coke .
At the last moment , however , one student , Mike Cameron , spoilt the fun by pulling off his shirt to reveal a Pepsi- plugging shirt beneath .
He was suspended from the school as punishment .
· The Raja Casablanca football team was fined $ 15,000 in 2002 when its team members wore Coca - Cola logos on their shirts in the Caf ( Conféderation Africain de Football ) competition in Morocco .
PepsiCo was one of the competition 's main sponsors .

While I Realize It 's Extremely Boring , Let 's Take A Brief Look At Reality
Apparently there 's some kind of batsignal for the U.S. punditocracy that tells them all what to write each week .
This week their orders are to inform us that the Democrats had better watch out for those far - left elitists like Ned Lamont , who will with their extreme anti-war positions lead them to defeat just like George McGovern did .
I do n't have it in me to track down links to the 10,000 versions of this .
But here 's a representative sample from David Broder :
The people backing Lamont are nothing if not sincere .
But their breed of Democrats -- many of them wealthy , educated , extremely liberal -- often pick candidates who are rejected by the broader public .
Many of the older Lamont supporters went straight from Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern in the 1960s and ' 70s to Howard Dean in 2004 .
They helped Joe Duffey challenge Sen .
Tom Dodd in Connecticut for the 1970 Democratic nomination on the Vietnam War issue , only to lose to Republican Lowell Weicker in November .
This might make you wonder certain things — like , was opposition to Vietnam the " wealthy , educated " position ?
I know it 's fun to listen to stories from Uncle Dave B. , and extremely boring to look at reality .
But let 's give reality a shot just this once .
Here 's a Gallup poll from January , 1971 :
Wha--?
This must be some crazy anomaly , right ?
Everybody knows the far - left , highly - educated elitists hated Vietnam , while the bedrock real Americans hung in there to the end !
Actually , no .
Here 's James Loewen writing in his book Lies My Teacher Told Me ( from which the 1971 Gallup poll is scanned ) :
These results surprise even some professional social scientists , [ but ] [ s ] imilar results were registered again and again , in surveys by Harris , NORC , and others ...
Throughout our long involvement in Southeast Asia , on issues related to Vietnam , Thailand , Cambodia , or Laos , the grade school - educated were always the most dovish , the college - educated the most hawkish .
Huh .
That makes you wonder what equivalent polls are saying about Iraq today .
Here 's Gallup about six weeks ago :
Weirdly , as you see , more education does n't necessarily push you either way on Iraq .
It seems to make you more ambivalent — while those with less education are both the most dovish and the most hawkish , with little ambivalence .
We 're almost done with reality here , because I realize it 's irritating and makes things less fun at the cocktail party at David Brooks ' house in Chevy Chase .
But here 's a Gallup poll from April of this year on the general foreign policy views of Americans :
Here the results are absolutely clear : internationalism is the elitist position , while people become more isolationist the less money and education they have .
Shockingly enough , whenever Bush inveigles against " isolationism " he does n't mention that .
Whew !
Well , that 's enough reality for today .
Thank goodness our opinion leaders do n't have to trouble themselves with such things , because then they might have to spend more than thirty seconds writing each column .
( I snipped some of the isolationism poll to save space .
You can see the entire results here . )
Breaking up is hard to do .
But in web design , separation can be a good thing .
Content , style , and behavior all deserve their own space .

Style guide #section2
One of the greatest advantages to designing with Cascading Style Sheets is the potential for separation of style and content .
You could style an entire website using nothing but inline style declarations :
< p bold ; color : red ; " > This text is important </ p>
But then you might as well use < font > tags .
It makes more sense to keep style information in a separate file and add semantically sensible hooks into your markup :
Markup : < p class= " important " > This text is important </ p>
CSS : p.important { font - weight : bold ; color : red ; }
That makes everybody ’s life easier .
It ’s easy for the designer to tweak the styles — like changing important text from red to blue .
It ’s easier for the writer to edit the text without wading through inline style declarations .
It ’s easier for the visitor who does n’t have to download unnecessarily bloated pages .
What ’s good for CSS is good for JavaScript .
Unfortunately , a lot of JavaScript functionality is found embedded within markup .
Everything is superficially intertwingled #section3
Suppose you want to add some behavior to a particular link .
You could use what ’s known as the javascript : pseudo - protocol :
< a href= " javascript : doSomething ( ) ; " > click for fun < /a>
That ’s a short - sighted approach .
User agents that do n’t support JavaScript will choke on that href value .
A more common approach is to use event handlers in combination with a meaningless href value :
< a href= " # " > click for fun </a>
That ’s slightly better but it ’s semantically meaningless .
Why mark up a piece of text as a link unless it goes somewhere ?
< a href= " arealpage.html " return false ; " > click for fun < /a>
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
The link makes sense even if JavaScript is n’t enabled ( and , for the first time , the link is spiderable ) .
But the problem remains that the event handler is mixed in with the markup .
Inline event handlers are the JavaScript equivalent of inline style declarations .
Fortunately , the event handlers can be removed and placed in an external file , just as you would do with CSS .
And , just as with CSS , you can add hooks to your markup to target the elements you want to play with :
< a href= " arealpage.html " class = " fun " > click for fun </a>
In an external JavaScript file , you could now write a script to find all the links that have a className of
“ fun ” and have them execute a function — doSomething ( ) — when they are clicked .
Separating out behavior from markup like this is called unobtrusive JavaScript .
Enough theory .
I ’m going to apply this technique to a real - world example .
Two years ago , I wrote an article for A List Apart on building a JavaScript image gallery .
The JavaScript in that article works fine , but take a look at the markup ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< ul > < li >< a showPic ( this ) " href= " images/bananas.jpg " » title= " A bunch of bananas » on a table " > some bananas </ a> </ li > < li >< a showPic ( this ) " href= " images/condiments.jpg " » title= " Condiments in a » Chinese restaurant " > two bottles < / a> </ li > < li >< a showPic ( this ) " href= " images/shells.jpg " » title = " Seashells on a table " > » some shells </ a> </li > </ul >
Those repetitive event handlers are intrusive .
I could replace them with class attributes ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< ul > < li >< a class= " gallerypic " » href= " images/bananas.jpg " » title= " A bunch of bananas on a table " > some bananas </ a> </li > < li ><a class= " gallerypic " » href= " images/condiments.jpg " » title= " Condiments in a Chinese restaurant " > two bottles < / a> </li > < li ><a class= " gallerypic " » href= " images/shells.jpg " » title = " Seashells on a table " > some shells </ a> </li > </ul >
But that would be equally repetitive .
I would n’t do that if I wanted to style every item in the list , so there ’s no need to do it when I want to add a behavior to every item in the list .
Instead , I can simply add a unique id to the list ( line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
< ul id =" imagegallery " > < li >< a href= " images/bananas.jpg " title= " A bunch of » bananas on a table " > some bananas </ a> </li > < li >< a href= " images/condiments.jpg " title= " Condiments » in a Chinese restaurant " > two bottles < / a> </li > < li >< a href= " images/shells.jpg " title = " Seashells on a » table " > some shells </ a> </li > </ul >
Now I need to write a function to add the event handlers externally .
Separation anxiety #section5
I ’ll write a function called prepareGallery .
This function will use the Document Object Model to find the links in the document I want .
This is possible with the methods getElementBy Id and getElements ByTagName :
document.getElementById(" imagegallery " ).getElementsByTagName ( " a " ) ;
Those methods work like selectors in CSS .
It ’s the equivalent of combining id and element selectors :
#imagegallery a
Here ’s what I want to do :
Make sure that the browser understands the DOM methods I will be using .
Make sure that there is an element with the ID “ imagegallery . ”
Get the list with the ID “ imagegallery . ”
Get all the links in the list and loop through them all .
Add the onclick event handler to each link , pointing it to the showPic function .
Here ’s how that translates into JavaScript :
function prepareGallery ( ) { if ( document.getElementById && document.getElementsByTagName ) { if ( document.getElementById( ' imagegallery ' ) ) { var gallery = document.getElementById( ' imagegallery ' ) ; var links = gallery.getElementsByTagName( ' a ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i < links .
length ; i++ ) { links < i>. return showPic ( this ) ; } ; } } } }
Now that I ’ve written my function , all I have to do is run it .
But there ’s a problem .
I ca n’t simply execute the function like this :
prepareGallery ( ) ;
If I do that , the function — which is in an external file or in the head of my document — will run before the rest of the document has finished loading .
The DOM methods wo n’t work because there wo n’t be any Document Object Model .
Without a complete document , there ca n’t be a corresponding model .
I need to wait until the entire document has finished loading .
Fortunately , the loading of the document triggers an event , namely the load event of the window object .
I can use the corresponding onload event handler , window.onload , to assign the prepareGallery function to this event :
window.onload = prepareGallery ;
Rather than hogging the onload event for this one function , it ’s better to use something like <!-- times out MAR2013 --> Simon Willison ’s excellent addLoadEvent function <!-- --> , which allows you to queue up functions that you want to trigger when the document finishes loading :
addLoadEvent ( prepareGallery ) ;
Trial separation #section6
Unobtrusive JavaScript is a relatively new idea .
Try it out for yourself .
Begin with your content ,
give it structure with semantically descriptive markup ,
apply a presentation layer using CSS , and finally ,
, and finally , add a behavior layer with DOM Scripting .
Just make sure they all keep their distance .
Ivan Pavlov ( 1849 -1936 )
In an experiment that made him a household name , the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov a century ago got dogs used to hearing a bell every time they were fed .
The dogs soon started drooling whenever they heard the bell .
Now , scientists are trying to get cockroaches to follow the same trailblazing path as “ Pavlov ’s Dog , ” the words still commonly used in reference to Pavlov ’s work ( though he really used more than one dog ) .
Drooling , or salivation , is a natural physiological response to the presence of food .
The salivation aids digestion .
Hidehiro Watanabe and Makoto Mizunami of Tohoku University in Sendai , Japan , offered cockroaches a whiff of peppermint two seconds before giving them some sugar .
After repeating this three times , they found that cockroach nervous system cells that control salivation started firing signals more strongly whenever the peppermint odor came .
They also found that this effect , measured by means of tiny implanted electrodes , persisted a day later .
The salivation had nothing to do with an enjoyment of the peppermint odor itself , they argued .
They noted that cockroaches naturally prefer vanilla odor , but that when they tried the same experiment using vanilla but no food , there was no increase in salivation - related brain activity .
Watanabe and Mizunami reported that they have n’t yet measured the actual saliva levels in the cockroaches during such experiments , but that they ’re working on this .
The process in which an organism starts to behave a certain way as a result of learning a connection between two previously unrelated stimuli , as in Pavlov ’s experiment , is called conditioning .
“ Classical conditioning of salivation has been extensively studied in mammals , especially in dogs , ” wrote Watanabe and Mizunami in a paper describing their findings , in the Feb. 15 issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
“ But , as far as we know , it has not been reported in any non-mammalian species , ” they added , although conditioning involving effects other than salivation has been .
The new findings shows cockroaches should serve as good models for studying how individual brain cells participate in conditioning , they added .

This story happened a few days ago in Ekaterinburg city , in Ural region in Russia .
One man decided to add some money to his bank account via ATM .
He went to the nearest one and put 2,000 roubles ( around $ 74 ) .
The ATM took the money and returned him a slip .
Here is the photo of that slip :
The amount on the slip was 2,006,699,00 RUR ( around $ 7,430,000 ) .
He was astonished , he has got another slip – and still the amount was the same .
So he decided to go the bank and tell them about the mistake ATM made .
He arrived to the bank and told a clerk his story , also showed a slip , but the clerk was not interested in the situation .
“ Many strange things happen buddy ” told the clerk to the 2 billion roubles account holder , “ Come back please some other time , I ’ve got lot of things to do right now ” .
The man got offended with such a response .
He went straight to the nearest ATM and started withdrawing the cash .
All the day he was going from one ATM to another withdrawing the daily limit of each one .
Between the withdrawals he was again putting some more millions to his account in total his balance reached 20 billion roubles ( $ 70 million ) .
All the money he put in big shoe boxes and afterwards took all those boxes and went again to that bank clerk .
He rammed the box to the clerk desk .
“ What ’s this ?
What are you doing ? ” , asked him the clerk .
“ It ’s money .
Millions of roubles ” .
Clerk was really shocked .
He called other bank workers and they all got greatly amazed by what they were presented .
They took the money from the “ magic ” cardholder , told him “ thank you ” for his honest and unusual behavior , and he went home .
On the way home he again went to a nearest ATM and tried the trick .
And again he has got 2 billion roubles available after his 2 thousand transfer .
He again called the bank but nobody wanted to be in charge of this growing incident .
Only a few hours later all the ATMs of this bank were turned off .
It ’s a typical Russian incident from my point of view .
I do n’t think that in any other country bank workers could be so irresponsible , mistakes so huge buy amounts and poor people so honest .
This story was also published in Russian newspaper “ Komsomolskaya Pravda ” and in some Russian blogs .
Two leading academics at Oxford University have decided to face down threats of violence from animal rights extremists and speak publicly in favour of the building of a controversial £ 18 m research laboratory in the city .
Although scientists are advised to remain silent for fear of attacks , Professor Tipu Aziz , a consultant neurosurgeon , and Professor John Stein , a neurophysiologist have told the Guardian they believe it is time to stand up to the radicals who have attempted to stop the project .
" I think that it is important to speak out , " said Prof Aziz , whose research into Parkinson 's disease involves the use of primates .
" The ALF [ Animal Liberation Front ] are actively now saying that anyone in Oxford is a target .
They have had it all their own way for a long time .
What we are seeing in Britain today is a minority dictating how the majority of this country live and that is as undemocratic a process as can be imagined .
Animal research is absolutely essential to medical progress and a lot of research being done in Oxford is critical . "
He and Prof Stein will address a march on Saturday , the first demonstration supporting the construction of the laboratory .
Extra police are being drafted into Oxford for the march because it clashes with another being run by Speak , the protest group opposed to building the new animal research facility .
Prof Stein , who runs the laboratory where research into Parkinson 's and dyslexia is carried out , said he knew there were dangers involved in speaking at the march .
" You have to be really passionate about this to put your head above the parapet and not many do , " he said .
" Some of these people are loonies and do the most awful things .
Let 's be clear , we are all taking a risk , but I feel it is so important I am prepared to take that risk .
" The anti-vivs have had it all their own way .
They have intimidated people , but the time has come to speak up and risk it .
Who knows what that risk is ?
" I feel passionately that animal experiments have benefited mankind enormously and almost all of the medical advances of the last 100 years have happened through animal experiments .
People just do n't seem to know this , it has n't been got across . "
The movement in defence of animal research at Oxford is growing amid increasing tension .
In recent weeks members of the ALF have been encouraging and directing a violent campaign against university funders , students and researchers through postings on a website based in Florida .
Set up by undergraduates in a rearguard action to this increasingly voluble campaign , the pro-animal testing movement is also using the internet to spread its message .
Work was restarted on the lab in November after a year 's delay when the original contractor , Montpelier , pulled out amid threats and intimidation from animal activists .
Today the identity of the new contractor , which operates on South Parks Road behind a five metre ( 15 ft ) barrier remains a secret .
Builders wear balaclavas and the vehicles involved are all unmarked .
Under the terms of an injunction obtained by Oxford , noisy demonstrations against the lab are allowed to take place each Thursday , within a cordon opposite the building site .
But behind the public face of the anti-lab protest anonymous extremists from the ALF are encouraging the use of increasingly violent tactics .
On a direct action website , Bite Back , registered to an address in West Palm Beach , Florida , the ALF posts notices announcing attacks on anyone linked to the university and calling on supporters to " do whatever it takes " to " blow these fucking monsters off the planet " .
Extra security has been offered to many researchers and leading figures at the university and students have been warned to be vigilant .
One of the tests for new electrical therapies carried out in Prof Stein 's laboratory involves electrodes being placed in the brains of monkeys which have been given Parkinson 's ; something he says is painless because there are no pain receptors in the brain .
On the Speak website this experiment is highlighted and he is accused of " inflicting the most horrific suffering on innocent creatures " .
Other researchers will remain silent on Saturday , privately believing Prof Aziz and Prof Stein are taking a huge risk .
One , who would not be named , said it was not even sensible to discuss animal testing anywhere publicly in Oxford for fear of being overheard by anti-vivisectionists .
Officers from Nectu , the specialist unit monitoring animal rights extremists , will watch events on Saturday along with Thames Valley police .
" The track record of animal rights extremists shows there is a high level of criminality associated with it .
All threats are being taken seriously , " said a police source .
But the police appear powerless to act against the Florida website .
The FBI says it is " aware " of the man behind it , Nicolas Atwood , a Florida - based activist but they cannot close it down because that would breach the First Amendment , protecting freedom of speech .
Mr Atwood told the Guardian he was a volunteer editor for the site .
" The ALF is made up of compassionate individuals who act on their conscience , not on the orders of some mysterious leader , " he said .
" Bite Back 's mission is to support animal rights prisoners of conscience and report on current events in the struggle .
Its editors , designers and contributors , although maybe sympathetic are not responsible for any unlawful act taken in pursuit of such benevolent goals . "
Here 's a question for you : what have the Nazi wartime test facility at Peenemunde and the Australian city of Perth got in common ?
Well , the first thing ( and just about the only thing , truth be told ) which springs to mind is that they are both next to large bodies of water .
This is useful if you 're going to test things which might go bang .
Like V - 2 rockets and - wait for it - flying cars :
According to our Oz photo interpretation bureau ( Clinton Bird ) , the vehicle in question is at an altitude of three of four metres and doing about 80 knots .
Which rules out a rocket - powered project , and we can see no evidence of the Wankel - powered turbofan outrigger engines favoured by the Moller Corporation :
Which leaves just one possible explantion : the Aussies have developed a gravity - busting hyperdrive , have bolted it into a second - hand Holden , and are seen here in the split second before their X - Motor made the transdimensional leap to hyper light speed .
So , the answer to the question " Where 's my bloody flying car ? " is very simply " Right here " * .

The refusal of a community in Taichung City to let victims of child abuse move into their neighborhood not only drew criticism from the public , but also highlighted the kind of problems that the minority group faces .
In May , the Chang Shiow - jyu Social Welfare Foundation bought two houses in the community in a bid to provide housing for 15 victims of child abuse aged 12 to 18 , so that they could start their lives afresh .
However , a committee formed by residents of the community passed a ' resolution ' in June to prohibit the teenagers from moving in under the pretext of maintaining the " high quality " of the neighborhood .
Despite two rounds of negotiations between the committee and the foundation , the residents are still unwilling to let the teens settle amongst them .
The foundation had stated that the two houses were detached buildings and in no way connected to other households ; they also said the children would pass in and out of the community through the back gate and not the front gate , but the committee still thought the presence of the ' troubled ' kids would jeopardize public security .
The director - general of the foundation , Chang Liang - chin , said that his foundation would consider filing a lawsuit against the community in accordance with the Children and Youth Welfare
Act if the residents could not be persuaded to be charitable to the teenagers .
Lee Kun-ming , the deputy director of the Social Affairs Department under the city government noted that as the social welfare organization had operated well within the law , residents had absolutely no right to oppose the organization 's activities in the community .
One local resident surnamed Lee , who is opposed to letting the children live in the community , voiced concerns that real estate prices would sharply decrease due to the presence of the children .
That kind of reasoning was too much for Alicia Wang , the executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation , who lambasted the " high quality " community residents for ignoring the rights of the children and preventing the foundation from helping them .
One resident of the community , Lin Ching - chiu backed up Wang 's comment by saying that she now regarded her neighbors with utter contempt for not being more sympathetic .
Numerous lawyers have pointed out that the community residents ' resolution must be regarded as invalid because it discriminates against the children and obviously violates laws intended to protect their rights and interests .
Worsening problem
According to the Ministry of the Interior , the number of child abuse victims increased from 7,837 to 9,897 from 2004 to last year , showing that the problem of child abuse is getting much more serious .
Despite the gravity of the situation , social welfare organizations frequently meet fierce opposition from residents when they plan to settle down in or near a certain area .
For example , last year , Harmony Home established a center in Kaohsiung City to take in people with AIDS , but local residents protested .
Harmony
Home continued with its efforts to run the center .
The head of the city district , Su Yung - shu , noted that the human rights of the patients must be respected and the center could not be asked to move from the district .
Moreover , in 2003 , one resident of a community in Taoyuan County was indicted because he attempted to prevent a Vocational Training Center for Mentally Retarded from being set up in his community .
Last August , 12 mentally retarded students and their teachers were finally able to relocate there after social welfare organizations intervened to ensure that their rights were being protected .
Ars Technica RAM
Guide
Part II : Asynchronous and Synchronous DRAM
( This feature for subscribers only ! )
In Part I of the Ars Technica RAM Guide , I talked about the basic technologies behind SRAM and DRAM , as well as some of the problems with squeezing performance out of DRAM .
Since the foundation has already been laid in Part I , I wo n't really be recapping past material in basic form .
I will , however , revisit many of those basic concepts in this edition 's overview of current , mainstream DRAM technology , so it helps to have read and understood the entire first edition .
If you did n't read all of it , I 'd encourage you to do so before continuing .
And if you did read all of it , then I wo n't waste any more of your time with this introduction .
The DRAM Read revisited
In the last edition , I talked about the steps in the DRAM read .
Folks who 've read about RAM before will notice that I skipped something very important in that discussion , something that has to be covered at some point if you 're going to understand things like FPM and EDO DRAM .
The topic that I skipped was memory timing , and in particular I did n't include a waveform diagram that shows how the various signals in the steps I outlined have to be timed in relation to each other .
Since asynchronous DRAM does n't operate based on any kind of common system clock pulse that it shares with the CPU , the timings of the control signals , addresses and data have to be consciously taken into account .
To see what I 'm talking about , let 's look again at the steps I listed for the DRAM read :
1 ) The row address is placed on the address pins via the address bus .
2 ) The / RAS pin is activated , which places the row address onto the Row Address Latch .
3 ) The Row Address Decoder selects the proper row to be sent to the sense amps .
4 ) The Write Enable ( not pictured ) is deactivated , so the DRAM knows that it 's not being written to .
5 ) The column address is placed on the address pins via the address bus .
6 ) The /CAS pin is activated , which places the column address on the Column Address Latch .
7 ) The /CAS pin also serves as the Output Enable , so once the / CAS signal has stabilized the sense amps place the data from the selected row and column on the Data Out pin so that it can travel the data bus back out into the system .
8 ) /RAS and / CAS are both deactivated so that the cycle can begin again .
For our purposes , there are two main types of delays that we have to take into account .
The first type includes the delays that have to take place between successive DRAM reads .
You can't just fire off a read and then fire off another one immediately afterwards .
Since a DRAM read involves charging and recharging capacitors , and various control signals have to propagate hither and thither so that the chip'll know what it 's doing , you have to stick some space in between reads so that all the signals can settle back down and the capacitors can recharge .
Of this first type of in - between - reads delay , there 's only one that 's going to concern us really , and that 's the / RAS and / CAS precharge delay .
After / RAS has been active and you deactivate it , you 've got to give it some time to juice back up before you can activate it again .
The following picture should help you visualize this .
The same goes for the / CAS signal as well , and in fact to visualize the / CAS precharge delay just look at the above picture and replace the term " RAS " with " CAS . "
If you think about these / RAS and / CAS precharge delays in light of the list of DRAM read steps , you 'll immediately see that this rest period limits the number of reads you can do in a given period of time .
Specifically , step 8 dictates that you 've got to deactivate / RAS and / CAS at the end of each cycle , so the fact that after you deactivate them you 've got to wait for them to precharge before you can use them again means you have to wait a while in between reads ( or writes , or refreshes , for that matter ) .
So imagine a Richard Simmons video , where he 's having you cycle through the above steps by shouting < DISCO > " And one !
and two !
and three !
and four !
and five !
and six ! and seven ! and eight !
now rest !...
Ok , let 's do it again people .
And one !
and two !... "</ DISCO >
This precharge time in between reads is n't the only thing that limits DRAM operations either .
The other type of delay that concerns us is internal to a specific read .
Just like the in - between - reads delay is associated with deactivating / RAS and / CAS , the inside - the - read delay is associated with activating / RAS and / CAS .
For instance , the row access time ( tRAC ) , is the minimum amount of time you have to wait between the moment you activate RAS and the moment the data you want can appear on the data bus .
Likewise , the column access time ( tCAC ) is the minimum delay between the moment you activate / CAS and the moment the data can appear on the data bus .
Think of tRAC and tCAC as the amount of time it takes the chip to fill an order you just placed at the drive - in window .
You place your order ( the row and column address of the data you want ) , and it has to go and fetch the data for you so it can place it on the data pins .
( Note : I wish to God I could think of an analogy involving Richard Simmons for this part of it , but my ingenuity fails me . )
Anyway , this diagram should help you visualize how the two types of delays work .
Now that we 've seen both types of delay in action , let 's look at a larger diagram that shows them working together in a series of DRAM reads .
( Just click on the thumbnail to get the larger diagram . )
Take a moment to study the above timing diagram so that you understand exactly what 's going on in it , and leave it open in a separate browser window as you peruse the next few pages , because it'll form the basis for the rest of this part of the RAM guide .
In fact , I 'd suggest opening it up in a window next to the description of the DRAM read I provided in Part I , and going through it step by step , locating each step in the read on the timing diagram .
( Here 's a tip : steps 3 and 4 are n't really depicted in the timing diagram .
Actually , step 3 is , insofar as WE stays inactive the whole time ) .

The Jackals after the Storm
The damage in New Orleans and southern Mississippi from Hurricane Katrina may have taken more lives than 9/11 -- at least that 's what experts are estimating right now .
And , as with 9/11 , the thousands of tragic stories took place in the context of many acts of heroism , sacrifice , and simple kindness .
We hear many of these good stories -- and there are doubtless many others , whose participants would n't dream of telling anyone about their own courage or decency .
Whenever there 's a breakdown in the social order there are also people who quickly reveal that with them , at least , civilization is not part of their nature , it 's an external restraint , and the moment it 's gone , they 'll take any advantage they can .
We see the footage of these jackals on television , looting whatever they can take from stores ... or neighbors ' houses .
Some of them might be taking it to protect from looters so they can restore it to their neighbors when they come back .
We can't know other people 's motives .
But most of the looters are probably exactly what they seem : thieves .
It 's depressing to watch people profiting from others ' misery .
Profiteers
Most depressing , for me at least , are the jackals of the news media .
Most are simply reporting what happens .
But there are some ...
I think of Geraldo , standing in the midst of human misery , condemning those who " allowed this to happen . "
He 's hardly alone , though .
The governor of Mississippi , for instance , was pressed hard by a television news interviewer until he finally said , " I know what you want me to say -- that the federal government dropped the ball on this .
But they did n't .
They were as prepared as anyone could have been , and they 've done everything that could be done . "
( Or words to that effect ) .
A constant theme in the news media has been : Blame the federal government .
Most particularly , blame President Bush .
And there was Jesse Jackson , claiming that if we had n't been fighting the war in Iraq , we would have had more resources and money to take care of this disaster .
It 's as if the media jackals and the spokesmen of the Left were all starring in a satire that made fun of their own stupidity .
Not even their worst enemy could make them look as foolish as they 're making themselves appear .
They Think That Bush Is God
Even the most rabid Republican would n't ascribe divine powers to President Bush .
But the jackals do -- in a negative sense .
They mock anything he actually does ; but let a hurricane strike the gulf coast and a few levees break , and suddenly he has failed us .
Let 's see ... what was it he was supposed to have done ?
Stopped the hurricane ?
Slackened it ?
Kept the rain from falling ?
No , no , of course not , the jackals reply .
He should have been better prepared to deal with it , that 's all .
No , says another , he should have seen to it that all the poor people were evacuated from New Orleans and southern Mississippi !
They would n't have had to evacuate , says yet another , if President Bush had seen to it that the levees were high enough and strong enough to protect New Orleans from flooding .
These clowns howl when President Bush does things that the Constitution requires him to do -- like , say , nominating Supreme Court justices and UN ambassadors .
But let a disaster strike , and they condemn him for not doing things that no President has the power to do .
Like forcing the evacuation of citizens from danger zones .
( Remember Mount St. Helens , and the people who refused to go ? )
Or intervening in state affairs without the invitation of the governor , unless they 're in violation of federal law , which nobody was .
As for Jesse Jackson , the problem was n't lack of money .
All the money in the world could n't have made the water evaporate any faster from the below - level streets of New Orleans .
And if every soldier from the Iraq War had been home instead , they would not have been standing by waiting for Katrina to strike so they could rush in and deliver supplies and rescue people that no one imagined would need rescuing .
Of course none of these people really think President Bush could have predicted or prepared any better than he did .
There are agencies that are supposed to prepare , and they did their job up to any reasonable standard .
Only idiots would really believe that any part of this disaster or its aftermath was the fault of the President .
The trouble is , they think we are the idiots .
They think that if they loudly ask , " Why was n't President Bush ready for this ? " the American people will swallow the implied accusation and blame him for not protecting us from ... from the weather .
Bush was elected President , not God .
The Problem Was Foreseen
The sad thing is that the problem was foreseen .
It 's been known for more than a century that New Orleans was one of the most vulnerable cities in the world .
It 's below sea level , for pete 's sake .
It was n't when they started building it , but it is now .
The weight of buildings on the spongy ground of the Mississippi delta compresses it and squishes it out and the ground subsides .
Nature has a solution for this , of course :
It 's called " flooding . "
The Mississippi is supposed to spill over its banks every spring and when it finally subsides , it 's supposed to have carved itself new channels and deposited silt from Montana and Minnesota throughout the delta from Natchez to New Orleans .
But that pattern does n't fit with our human desire to stake out a piece of ground , build things and plant things on it , and have it stay the way we left it , year after year .
So the Army Corps of Engineers spent many years " taming " the Mississippi -- lining it with levees to prevent it from spilling over its banks .
The floods that once enriched the soil of America 's middle were ended .
Above all , New Orleans was kept dry .
But not high and dry .
It got lower and lower and lower , until you look up from the French Quarter and watch big ocean - going ships pass by on the Mississippi , floating so high that you realize their bottoms are higher than the streets of the city .
When I first heard that Katrina was going to be a category five hurricane and it was heading for New Orleans , my immediate statement was , " New Orleans is below sea level .
I sure hope the levees hold . "
And I 'm not even an expert .
Everybody always knew that there was a danger that a hurricane might raise the level of the river and Lake Pontchartrain so high that the levees would break .
Political Reality
But on what day was it politically possible to do anything about it ?
For good or ill , decisions like spending enormous amounts of tax money to raise and thicken the levees have to be made by politicians , and the very nature of democratic government makes it highly unlikely for us to get anything done that wo n't show benefits in time for the next election .
There are exceptions :
The Interstate Highway System only got started because of fear of Communism and nuclear weapons -- we needed a road system that would let us move our military swiftly across country .
Later , we saw all kinds of economic benefits -- but what made it politically possible at first was fear .
The Louisiana Purchase , Alaska ( i.e. , " Seward 's Folly " ) -- their benefits were obvious and yet they were sharply criticized .
Unless someone saw a way to make quick money out of it , these things rarely happened .
So ... what governor or state legislature , what mayor or city council , what Congress or President could be rationally expected to say , on one particular day , " We 're going to spend a hundred million dollars raising the levees around New Orleans , and another twenty million establishing a national fleet of evacuation buses that will go and evacuate the poor from densely populated cities that might be threatened by hurricanes someday . "
The very jackals who are now criticizing President Bush for not being prepared would have absolutely crucified him for " pork barrel politics " if he had proposed dumping that much money on raising the levees around New Orleans , and as for the fleet of evacuation buses -- he would have been mercilessly ridiculed for even proposing it .
It 's only after the disaster that all the solutions look obvious and everybody is full of advice on what should have been done .
Again , the news people who hate Bush for being President ( and hate us for reelecting him ) know all this .
They know that he has done nothing wrong .
But it 's an opportunity to damage him , and they can't bring themselves to let it go by unused .
Because there are people stupid enough to think that there really was something the President should have done , and a way he could have done it .
What Now ?
On Sunday I was talking with a good friend -- Mike Lewis , who teaches physical geography at UNC-G -- and he raised the real question : " Are we dumb enough to rebuild New Orleans in the same place ? "
" People are being defiant , " he said .
" We 'll rebuild it !
They can't stop us ! "
But there 's no " they . "
Wind patterns are notoriously difficult to impress .
It 's all about risk assessment .
Such a storm will happen again .
It might not be for another fifty or a hundred years .
But it might be next year .
It might be next week .
I suggested that they ought to spend the millions of dollars it would take to salvage the entire French Quarter , move all the buildings out , move in a billion tons of earth to raise the land well above sea level , and then put the buildings back .
It would be run as a historical site / amusement park .
A tourist destination .
But the rest of New Orleans would be shut down .
The levees would be torn down and the whole area would be redesignated a flood plain , with elevated roads to get tourists to and from New Orleans -- like the roads that already exist elsewhere in Louisiana .
In other words , give it back to the Cajuns and the gators .
What would we do with all those people ?
Give them assistance to relocate .
The refugees who come to Greensboro , for instance , should n't just be fed and housed , they should be helped to find jobs and reestablish themselves in their new home -- here .
The great institutions of New Orleans -- schools and universities and churches and sports teams -- should be transplanted elsewhere .
Wake Forest University is no longer in Wake County and it 's doing fine .
And those who can't bear to let New Orleans die should rebuild that ribald - yet - graceful culture -- at Baton Rouge .
There is simply no excuse for rebuilding in the same spot .
Even Californians have learned from earthquakes by changing their building methods so that new buildings do a good job of riding out earthquakes .
Of course , this does n't mean Californians are smart .
Take Balboa Island , for instance , or Venice Beach .
There 'll be a tsunami someday , and there is zero chance of any survivors on Balboa Island if the triggering earthquake is close to the coast .
But people still pay enormous sums of money for the privilege of living there .
We humans are such ... optimists !
Or -- wait -- is the correct term " fools " ?
The odds of another category five hurricane hitting New Orleans are identical with the odds of a tsunami sweeping over Balboa Island and scouring it bare :
One hundred percent .
The only question is when .
But it will happen .
And still we build there .
Property Lines
The reason New Orleans will almost certainly be rebuilt on the same site is simple : People own property there .
They can't stand the thought of losing it .
They have invested money in it .
So even if the only way to make New Orleans safe is to build levees so ridiculously high and strong that they make it the most ugly city in the world , surrounded by huge concrete - lined dikes , people will insist on doing it .
Unless they take so long to " improve " the levees that people forget Katrina and start putting it off and finally abandon the project .
Back to business as usual .
Why Did n't the People Leave Town ?
One question I 've heard several people ask about the hurricane is , " I 'm sorry these people are suffering , but why did n't they leave town ?
They were warned ! "
They were warned , but they were poor .
The people I 've heard say this are people who have never been truly poor a day in their lives .
But there were thousands of people in New Orleans who had no money , no car , nowhere to go , and nowhere to stay once they got there .
Did you go down and offer any of them a ride and a few rooms in your house where they could stay till the storm was over ?
If not , then do n't start judging them because they did n't get out in time .
Besides , they thought it was a hurricane -- high winds , lots of rain .
The terrible damage and loss of life came the next day , in the aftermath , as the rains upstream added to the storm damage by flooding so intensely that the levees gave out .
If we find out that somebody knew the levees would break and did n't give warning , then we have somebody to blame .
But my guess is that nobody knew .
Maybe they should have -- but that 's second - guessing .
After something happens , it 's always obvious that people " should have known " it could happen .
Again , I 'll take the critics seriously when one of them shows me footage or paper that demonstrates that they knew and gave warning that the levee would break , and nobody listened .
Geraldo ?
Did you give that warning ?
Let 's see you rerun that moment of wisdom and prescience , and then I 'll tolerate your accusations of others for " not being ready . "
When you 're poor you do n't have choices .
That 's one of the main reasons we do n't like poverty .
Who Were These People ?
And it was one of the main reasons New Orleans was such a good city , despite its many problems .
It was n't a bad place to be poor .
The streetcar and bus system worked -- public transportation could take you wherever you needed to go , and without making you wait for an hour .
The climate is warm so you do n't have to pay for much heating in the winter , and if you do n't have air conditioning , at least you 're no worse off than your ancestors , who did n't have it either .
You could live there without much money .
As for southern Mississippi , I 've heard people criticize it -- not unfairly -- for its having become a gambling center .
But most people there were neither gamblers nor owners of gambling establishments .
And even if they were , even the most diehard Bible - thumping anti-gambler would have to agree that the penalty for such sin should not be death .
( Besides , now that North Carolina has decided to adopt a lottery , we have no room to talk .
There is zero difference between gambling houses on the waterfront in Biloxi and Pascagoula , and lottery tickets for sale in convenience stores in North Carolina .
The customers are still being seduced into giving up something for nothing ; and in North Carolina we have the distinction of being the stupidest people in America , since we already had proof that state lotteries do n't help much ( if at all ) and do as much harm as any other system of vice . )
Nobody deserves to have a hurricane destroy their property , and still less do they deserve to be killed for the crime of living near the coast .
So the " Christians " who gloated of the destruction of such " wicked places " should look up Matthew 7:1 - 5 and keep your malice to yourselves .
Natural disasters happen .
We can prepare for them as best we can , but eventually there 'll be some twist that we did n't anticipate , or some force greater than we imagined possible , and people will die and property will be destroyed and landscapes will be transformed .
We do n't have to blame anybody -- not President Bush , not sinful people , and not God .
God did n't mean anything by Hurricane Katrina .
This is a world where natural forces will organize and distribute disasters in a semi-chaotic way that does not care where people happen to be living .
I believe that what God cares about is not whether or not we are always safe in our houses .
As I understand the scriptures , what God cares about is how we act when bad things happen .
Some people were brave and decent and kind and generous and I think that God is proud of his children who acted that way .
Some people looted , and some people exploited the disaster to hurt their political enemies , and some people used the disaster to condemn others and make themselves feel superior to the victims .
I believe that in the eyes of God , that is the real disaster -- that so many of his children , when the storm had passed , turned out to be jackals after all .
And that damage has spread far and wide across the country -- including places where Katrina did not go .

This post in my series on contracting focuses on suggestions for non-management permanent employees working with contractors .
The driver for this is that over the years I ’ve worked on both sides of the fence and I ’ve seen the sorts of preconceptions and misconceptions that can strain working relationships between permanent and contract staff .
The sources for the suggestions in this post are a combination of things I have seen myself and the questions I am most commonly asked about contracting by permanent staff .
Let ’s get the touchy one out of the way first : money .
Do n’t ask a contractor how much they are getting .
Ever .
It ’s unprofessional and rude and , honestly , no good is going to come out of asking .
If you want an idea of how much contractors can earn , look up some job ads .
I ’ve covered this topic in detail in previous posts so , if you need to , go back and re-read the sections comparing contract rates to permanent rates .
Contractors are not , by definition , any better than permanent employees at what they do .
The reason for employing a contractor can vary from case to case and it ’s worth finding out the reason a contractor has been hired if you find yourself working with one .
If there ’s any sort of decent management in your workplace ( a big “ if ” , I know ) then the contractor will have skills and / or experience that nobody else has .
In the case of specialists , it ’s easy to see why a contractor has been brought on but this is not always the case .
Sometimes a contractor will have the same skill set as permanent staff ( or even less skills ) and they have been employed to provide “ an extra set of hands ” .
This can lead to the unfortunate circumstance where someone appears to be getting more money while offering less return but this premium is the return for giving up the security of perment employment .
It ’s worth getting clarification ( preferably written ) of how you , as a permanent , are expected to relate to a contractor .
Are they a peer ?
Are you expected to report to them or pass any of your work through them ?
Will they have no impact at all on your work or who you report to ?
Once you have the word from management , introduce yourself to the contractor in this context :
“ Hi , I ’m … we ’re going to be … I ’m looking forward to … ”
All those nice platitudes .
This is good practice for two reasons .
First , it gets you both off on a positive footing .
Second , it can reduce miscommunication .
It is not unheard of for management to tell a contractor one thing and permanent staff something else ( shocking , I know ) .
I ca n’t recommend strongly enough that , where appropriate , permanent staff have a lot of interaction with contractors .
There ’s all those airy - fairy “ team building ” concepts of course ( and I strongly believe the contractor should be treated as part of the team – for everyone ’s benefit ) but there are also some excellent selfish reasons for doing this .
I ’m going to approach this from a positive perspective and assume that you , as a permanent employee , want to improve your position / career / pay rate .
If you happen to be the bump on a log type who is happy to sit the same desk and do the same job for as long as a regular paycheck keeps coming , feel free to ignore this advice .
A contractor , by definition , is doing something that a permanent employee is n’t and they are a much better source of information than any agency , article or guidebook when it comes to discovering what life as a contractor is really like .
You may have no interest in becoming a contractor as such but a contractor is likely to have had more diversity in their roles and can provide some valuable insight into how to develop new skills , how to adapt to changing environments and what skills and / or experience are most valued in the job market .
Whether you are looking for advancement in your current workplace or wondering what roles might be available elsewhere , someone with active experience in the job market ( e.g. a contractor ) can help you make a decision .
What it all comes down to is do n’t build walls between yourself and contractors .
Honestly , some contractors are jerks , gloating about their exciting life and sky - high pay rates and they can make you feel resentful towards contractors in general .
If you ’re going to dislike someone , do it because they ’re a jerk , not because they ’re a contractor .
In my experience , the vast majority of contractors want to get on with their permanent co-workers so give them the benefit of the doubt .
Pretty much the only platitude I subscribe to is “ if you ’re not part of the solution , you ’re part of the problem . ”
Bitching about contractors having too many advantages does n’t help your situation .
Besides , if you were so sure they had things so good , surely you go out and do some contracting yourself ?
Permanent staff can gain a lot of benefits from working with contractors so do n’t be shy .
Treat them as part of the team and you never know what you might gain .
READ PART FOUR
Really , I want this post to be seen as an optimistic one .
We all know about the problem , but we should focus on the incredible opportunity that 's out there if we can solve this .
I know we 're all volunteers -- I am too .
We work on what we enjoy .
But we also do this work because we can always imagine great things yet to be created .
We do this work because we enjoy sharing our ambitions and successes with others .
I just hope people will direct their imaginations in this direction , because we could really use the help .
Anyone who cares about Python should care about the web programming situation -- no matter what your area of expertise .
Those of us in the web development community need both support and pressure to improve things .
We also need support from the Python core -- there 's some longstanding issues with Python that cause problems ; things like long - running processes and reloading code , isolating and monitoring interpreter instances , and restricted environments .
These are things that reach far down into Python the language , in such a way that the application programmers that need the features are n't generally able to make much progress ( nor is it clear they'd get support on any solutions they did provide ) .
We also need input from people trying to do commodity Python hosting , and we need to pay attention to what they say .
And Python could have been PHP .
We could have seen that kind of growth .
But we did n't , because there has been and continues to be a bunch of little things that make Python annoying to use and get started with for web programming .
But it 's not all over -- PHP 5 is barely catching up to Python 's features from 10 years ago .
There 's a lot of room for a better language to take it 's place .
( Though we should be a little worried that Ruby could be that language . )
By some coincidence three languages starting with P are often grouped together : Perl , PHP , and Python .
It 's a nice coincidence , and these are the languages I 've thought about .
Both Perl and PHP have had tremendous bursts of growth because of web programming .
This graph is n't entirely a representation of PHP 's growth , but it says something , and it 's does n't take a graph to know that PHP has grown incredibly rapidly :
When we consider Python marketing , we should look for accessible marketing successes .
Java is n't accessible .
The PSF is n't Sun , Zope 3 and PEAK are n't J2EE , and I could go on .
These are n't just technical differences , they are based on deep social differences .
We need to look at agile and open source successes .
( And we have to look at successes , so no need to look at Smalltalk or Lisp ... )
programmer might display test results in a web page , the engineer may collect data via a web upload form .
If they have successful experiences in Python in these cases , it is only natural that they will try to use Python elsewhere .
That 's great , because Python is appropriate in some way for most of those other use cases too .
Web programming is also a kind of universal need .
Sure , there 's lots of things besides the web .
But unless you really try to avoid the web , as a programmer you are likely to have occasional problems that are best solved with a web application .
This is true no matter what field you are in .
In part because web applications do n't just touch on core needs -- e.g. , embedded programming at a hardware company , numerical analysis at an engineering firm -- but on any coordination needs , and everyone needs to coordinate things .
The embedded
Web programming is the best way to get our foot in the door .
A programmer with little experience can produce a useful web application in a matter of hours .
Not just playful or interesting , but something that can actually go into productive and live use .
The only other environment where that is possible is the command line -- and managers never see programmers ' command line tools .
What we need to do is get our foot in the door .
We need to get programmers to write projects and do so successfully .
We need those projects to be visible to managers .
Python appeals to programmers .
That 's who we have to sell ourselves to .
Forget everyone else .
Let the programmers sell it to their own managers -- if they really love Python , they 'll go through that effort .
If they are really successful with Python it wo n't be hard for them -- Python will sell itself .
If Python can't sell itself then it does n't deserve to be adopted -- ultimately what matters is what people build in Python , not the virtues of the language itself .
Everything that makes Python great does n't mean much to managers -- will they care about significant whitespace ?
Sometimes it 's even contrary to what managers want .
Managers are wary of empowering programmers , because it scares them to become dependent on a single programmer -- I think this is n't a big problem for Python , but it is something that encourages heavyweight methodologies ( which are n't good in Python ) , B&D programming environments , static typing , etc .
Right now Python marketing -- which is admittedly an afterthought for everyone -- is driven by a desire to compete with Java ( and probably . NET recently ) .
But people wo n't admit that we are utterly incapable of competing head - to - head with these languages , because they speak to an audience we can't market to directly .
This is an incredible missed opportunity for Python .
Most other marketing efforts underway for Python are ( IMHO , of course ) misplaced .
And I am doing okay -- these are n't my own problems I 'm complaining about .
I do n't want to talk down Python web programming too much -- if you are serious about web programming the initial investment will pay off , since Python is a great environment .
But if you are n't committed enough to invest that time , and you want to produce something useful quickly , then -- though it hurts me to say this -- Python is n't a good choice .
You might dismiss me as being self - centered , as I 'm a Python web programmer , and we all think our own problems are the most important problems .
But then I 'm a web programmer because I think it 's the most important and empowering development environment of our time -- it has been for at least the last five years , and I 'd be surprised if that did n't stay true for at least the next five years .
I meant to give this as a lightning talk , but unfortunately the session was too short and I gave a different presentation first and it did n't come back around to me again , which is too bad -- I actually did n't care about the other presentation that much .
I totally agree with you .
Trying to explain to people how to do Web programming in Python , or even trying to convince them to let me do Web programming in Python ( instead of say PHP ) has been an embarrassment .
( This despite my opinion that PHP is an embarrassment to the term " programming language " . )
I have long believed that Web scripting is the domain with the biggest bang - for - buck you can get out of a high - level language , mainly because the Web is the universal user interface .
Once a program is placed on the Web , its functionality becomes instantly accessible to millions of people .
Tiny , simple programs can become useful groupware tools .
It 's all about the barrier to entry .
Over the course of Python 's history , i think Guido has n't recognized the full significance of this .
It 's not due to any shortcoming as a language designer ; it 's just that the Web is not what he does every day .
At PyCon i heard him remark something along the lines of , " The Web is n't everything " or " There 's a lot more to programming than the Web . "
Well , yes and no .
There 's certainly a lot more ways to use a programming language than just for Web programming .
But if you 're talking about adoption , the Web is everything , nearly .
Improving standard library modules to support Web programming ( such as cgi.py ) has been on my to - do list for ages .
I bear some of the burden for not acting sooner to improve things in Python , and it weighs heavily on me .
Not all is lost , though .
PHP succeeded at displacing Perl as a widespread Web programming language , so maybe it can happen again .
Python can still do many things that other languages can't -- for example , cgitb exploits Python 's unique strengths to provide a huge win for Web developers .
Huge .
Using cgitb completely changed how i did CGI development overnight .
Even though it was introduced a few years ago , no other language has anything like it .
Things like this point to deeper strengths in the language that no amount of hacking can add to PHP .

Trying to explain to people how to do Web programming in Python , or even trying to convince them to let me do Web programming in Python ( instead of say PHP ) has been an embarrassment .
( This despite my opinion that PHP is an embarrassment to the term " programming language " . )
The vitrol that Python programmer 's have for PHP has always baffeled me .
Frankly , part of the reason I 've avoided learning Python is because every Python programmer I 've ever met has been a prick about my current choice in programming language .
PHP works , I enjoy programming in it , I like the way it feels and reads , and the user community is incredibly supportive .
More importantly , I 've built some seriously effective web applications using it .
If you want me to bother learning Python , loose the 'tude , dude .
Seriously , every language has its problems and it 's quirks .
PHP is far from perfect ( e.g. no namespaces ) , but many of Python 's language design features , such as the meaningful whitespace concept , I find unpleasant to work with .
( A little too much like FORTRAN for my taste . )
That does n't mean that I do n't think its a good language , or that Python programmers are bad people .
( Just pooly socialized . )
Obviously people have done a lot of great work in Python , and its a very useful tool .
But its also a language that has a very different syntax from PHP , PERL , JavaScript , Java - languages that web people are familiar and comfortable with .
If you want to get us to part with our semicolons , curly braces , and crazy bohemian whitespace , you 're going to have to be nicer to us , and more polite about the tools we love .
# David Cloutman
Finding Python hosting is difficult and all are expensive .
I find that a dis-incentive to try it .
Even if we leave that factor out , I find the plethora of options out there confusing .
I plan to try Nevow sometime in the future .
Swaroop www.swaroopch.info
Persistent processes for servers ( eg : twisted ) will not be as successfull as PHP .
CGI or mod_python are the only affordable way to go with Python .
Nevow works partially with WSGI ( WSGI knows nothing about LivePage and Guard ) .
If you are looking for XMLHttpRequest support , try wallaby .
# Sridhar Ratna Deru.net is very affordable and reliable , and Python runs great there .
# Sam Feltus
Now this is interesting .
I am running hosting besides other things and I 'd love to provide Python too .
Is there a consensus what that means actually ?
Is it CGIs in Python , Zope , Webware , Twisted , or mod_python within Apache ?
Or all of them ?
Or anything else ?
Then , there is a question how to set them up when you have decided - what access rights , permissions , etc .
I have a couple of my own projects there and they use mod_python .
This includes some hacking in the mod_rewrite , or mod_alias for every project that needs python for it to work .
PHP is different : you just drop the files in the directory and it just works .
Maybe when ordinary administrators ( = not using Python every day ) know how to set it up , there will be plenty of Python hostings ; when it is as easy as issuing apt - get install php4 ... jbar # Jiri Barton
This is EXACTLY why Python is losing out to PHP .
There are WAY too many options ( Zope , Twisted , CherryPy , Paste , Django , Quixote , ad nausem ... ) and ALL of them require a long running process ( no - no in most hosting scenarios ) - which leaves people with CGI , which has been widely accepted as NOT the right way to build large web apps .
This means until we have totally clean Python integration with apache ( mod_python is too low level for most people , we do n't want to care about returning http response codes - Python is high level remember ! ) , or tomcat for Python <- this is what I think we need most btw ( and Zope is an abomination in my eyes and nowhere close to filling this need ) , we 're suck using Python as a client side language .
# anonymous
If we have enough clear documentation for mod_python then I think it can be a killer web language .
I have to read mod python tutorial 5 times to get the information that Mr. Grish states .
IMO , it 's a splendid tool and I am beginning to write applications in it .
It all grinds down to attracting the end users with simple documentation even if it's so low level , the rest follows .
# Intercodes
Thanks for writing this post .
I think you 're right on .
I myself am , I suppose , an intermediate programmer -- I had only programmed in Perl and a bit of C++ before finding Python -- but I rapidly became enamored of Python 's usability and " discoverability . "
Even after a year or so of programming Python , I still get the feeling that by just poking around in the command line , I can figure out what I need to know to get a job done without reading reams of documentation .
And in fact I have managed to get things done that way -- my productivity in Python compared to Perl is an order of magnitude of difference .
Except when it comes to the web .
I 'm currently trying to build my first substantial web application , and I would love to write it in Python .
But watching the recent progress in the Rails world has made me wonder if learning Ruby would n't actually be faster than building and / or learning the Python frameworks necessary to get my project off the ground .
Or even figuring out which frameworks are appropriate !
" There 's one obvious way to do it " most definitely does not apply in the Python web programming world , and it 's too bad .
Even so , I think the Subway project looks promising , and I think that Python has several features that make it better than Ruby for web programming , most important of all , I think , being that Python has the best Unicode support of any of the " P " languages .
( A fact which should n't be underestimated . )
It seems to me that a concerted effort could be made to unify various existing components into a useable and easily installed MVC package .
The competition with Rails may turn out to be the best thing to have happened for Python web programming ... I hope so .
Maybe a little " marketing " for such an effort would n't be such a bad thing ?
How do we build momentum ?
Agreed .
Thru the years every Python web solution I 've evaluated makes at least one deadly assumption : scalability and performance do n't matter , production uses compatible version control , the HTML / XML is not templatized and is not language neutral , no CGI URL will end in .html , every URL is controlled by Python code , subdirectories are class heirarchies , etc .
That is why Python fails on the high end .
Python fails on the low end because PHP makes an effort to get out of the way of newbies .
It is easy to get useful results out of inexperienced people without reading a lot , configuring a lot , or annoying administrators .
Solutions like Zope are closer to J2EE than to Ruby On Rails .
That is a mistake .
PyGTK is a first choice .
Maybe some day something like CherryPy will be too .
How odd .
My web framework made none of those assumptions .
I can't imagine every other framework you looked at made them .
# Robert Brewer
Which framework ?
Devavu ?
Is Dejavu recent ?
I have n't looked at Python web solutions for months .
A quick peek at the dejavu docs uncovers this statement .
Dejavu uses bytecode hacks , and therefore requires CPython .
Is Dejavu still tied to CPython ?
# anonymous Dejavu is an ORM .
I do n't see the relevance here .
# Daverz
I 'm a PHP / Java / Ruby / Python programmer .
I tried once to talk ( but it 's amazing how some people does not know how to talk ) with a influent Python local dude about this .
I told him that mod_python will spread more easily if it could show all it's power running on Apache 1.x , since there 's is a LOT of websites still running Apache 1.x .
That was worst than insult his mother .
He became mad , angry , asked me if we need to use old tools , that is a stupid idea blah blah blah .
He did not see the point there .
I was thinking in a way that could help to , for example , THOUSANDS of PHP coders try mod_python ( easy ) , without upgrade their webservers ( harder ) while PHP still marked Apache 2.x as experimental .
But he was not able to talk about that .
I told his so beloved tool could not work perfectly ( and I was able to help if there was a way , on that moment ) on a older enviroment , and he became mad , offended .
Stupid .
Idiot .
While this kind of behaviour still exists on the Python community ( and believe me , there is a lot of situations like this ) , the tool will not even go closer where PHP is .
While PHP is not a half of the language Python is ( and I think Python is very better than PHP ) , some Python dudes are really hard to deal .
Thanks for writing this , Ian .
You 've clearly articulated a deep frustration that I have felt for several years now .
I would love to do web programming in Python but I know that pragmatically PHP is a better choice despite its inadequacies as a language .
Finding affordable Python hosting is not easy ; choosing a framework is not easy .
Even when frameworks are well documented - like modpython - I would like more than just the bare documentation i.e. books .
For commodity hosting to emerge and books to be written the community has to agree on one framework , develop it further and make it easy for new programmers to get started .
I worry that by failing to recognise the importance of the web and adding further complexities to the language Python will actually begin to lose users .
This is one of the most important things haunting Python today !
Thanks so much for writing this .
Recently , at work , one of my bosses asked me what I would choose to write a potential web application and web service .
We develop a lot of Python applications , and its definitely my favorite language .
After a lot of thinking , I responded " Rails . "
I do n't even like Ruby very much , but Rails is obviously the best web framework out there because of the tightly integrated simplicity of it !
Rails is the Apple of web frameworks -- one tightly controlled stack .
Sure , you may lose some flexibility , but you gain beauty , simplicity , and ease of use !
I really really wanted to pick Python , but I just could n't do it .
There are too many frameworks , none of which are as good as Rails .
Python is making the mistake of copying Java when it comes to web frameworks : choice is better .
We are going to end of with a myriad of tools that do one thing sorta well ( for Java : struts , hibernate , tapestry , et al ... for Python : Cheetah , Nevow , Quixote , CherryPy , et al ) , but when you put them together , you get highly abstracted , loosely coupled , confusing mess .
I am especially afraid that we are going this route because of the WSGI .
Do n't get me wrong , its a great idea , but its not the solution to our problem : its an enabler .
" Now you can have more choice " ... thats not appealing .
Thats more work .
Thats more to figure out .
In the Ruby world , if you are developing a web application , there is no choice : there is Rails .
And thats okay , since its so damn well done .
In the Python world , if a web framework does n't do something that you want , you just create your own framework ... why not fix the original one ?
The whole situation is embarrassing .
I do n't think Java is the right platform to emulate when it comes to web application ( ever , really ) .
I think , at least in this one regard , we need to look at the principles behind what makes Ruby on Rails so successful , and come up with something to counter it in Python .
Otherwise , I promise you , Rails will be the dominate open source , dynamic web framework for the next few years at least .
Anyway , sorry to rant here , but your post really struck a chord with me !
I do n't disagree with Ian 's diagnosis of the problem ( although it 's not terribly relevant to me personally ) , but I will disagree with this particular prescription for it .
I can understand being frustrated with the proliferation of web frameworks , but let 's face it : there is no way you are going to be able to convince anyone to give up on their pet framework to work on someone else's .
I see a lot of people in the Python web community complaining about proliferation of frameworks .
I do n't see anyone at all standing up and saying " My web framework X is unnecessary , I will abandon it and spend my web - framework development time working on web framework Y instead . "
Let 's focus on what is going to make web frameworks seamless to use .
Personally I think that " web programming " is a red herring and the problems with Python are basic platform deployment issues : for example , the lack of a packaging system makes the simplest task in web programming - downloading and setting up a framework - unnecessarily difficult .
For those of you that are going to heed Ian 's call to arms , please consider productive suggestions that people can follow .
If we 're not each going to give up our individual toolkits , let 's at least agree on the featureset that would make each of them really attractive to new people coming to the Python web space .
For example , Alex Levy suggests that the problem is documentation : http://mesozoic.geecs.org/cogito/archives/000152.html
# Glyph Lefkowitz
Well , I personally have resisted the urge to develop a new framework ( an urge I 've felt many times over the years ) , and I actually am willing to give up my framework of choice for more conformity .
But I can't abandon my framework ( and I ca n't expect anyone else to do so either ) -- other people have trusted my opinion and choice over the years , and it would be irresponsible of me to abandon them and those applications I 've developed .
Which is a bind a lot of us have probably been in .
That 's one of the things I see in WSGI , is a path out -- a way to support the old apps and consolidate and improve the new apps , without being bogged down in abandoned frameworks and out of date setups .
Talking to people at PyCon , I do n't think I 'm altogether unusual .
First , there 's a lot of people with homegrown frameworks , and from what I can tell this describes most of them -- they are dissatisfied but trapped by their own legacy .
But even beyond that there 's hope that open source frameworks can consolidate .
If we can phrase one framework in terms of another there 's the opportunity for the lesser frameworks to melt away , to create a layered environment instead of competing full - featured stacks ( well , they are all actually partially - featured stacks ) .
As to Rails : I agree that it's a challenge and a competitor , but it 's not a model .
People have been working on Rails - like things in Python for a long time , with various successes and failures .
But Python 's flaw is n't that we do n't have any interesting frameworks or interesting MVC systems .
Python simply is n't at the same place Ruby is .
We have to fix our specific problems , not immitate someone else .

I am not saying that anyone has to give up their old software .
And Ian 's suggestion for the WSGI as a " way out " is a good one .
However , I do think its reasonable to centralize around one solution .

Well , I do n't have a framework that I have written that is out in the world .
However , if I did , I would be willing to give it up or allow it to become the new central framework .
I think its really selfish to hold onto one 's own framework if presented with the option to unify .
Let 's be honest , there are probably only 3 or 4 different Python web frameworks with any traction whatsoever .
This adds up to somewhere between 5 - 10 people ( likely ) that actually have control of these frameworks .
I see no reason why 5 - 10 people can't come together and work as a group to improve the obviously broken situation we are in now .
What we currently have is good for noone : especially the Python community .

Wow .
I really disagree .
This might make us slightly more popular , but it certainly would n't make us better .

Why would n't we give up our individual toolkits ?
You can't win if you are n't willing to change .
You are saying the best we can do is stagnate .
I totally disagree . " " " For example , Alex Levy suggests that the problem is documentation : http://mesozoic.geecs.org/cogito/archives/000152.html " " "
Insufficient solutions with good documentation are still insufficient .
Show me something that is as unified , cohesive , and useful as Rails , and is just missing documentation .
It does n't exist .

Thats very true , and I think you are on to something here .
Please , keep preaching it .
Maybe you could organize some " summit of web frameworks " or something :)

I do n't think we need to clone Rails in Python .
Rails is a very ruby - like solution , and there are certainly things I dislike about it .
I am not saying we need to model it by copying it : I am saying that we need to model its principles .
Its a VERY RUBY , tightly integrated , complete , simple , and fully - functional framework for building web applications from the database all the way up to the top .
We need to create a HIGHLY PYTHONIC , tightly integrated , complete , simple , and fully - functional framework as well .
It does n't have to look anything like Rails , but that is our competition .
That is our target .
I am not arguing that we need to create an imitator : but we do have to compete on the same level of simplicity and ease of use .
PHP and Perl were wildly successful web application languages for some of the same reasons as Rails : simple to install , simple to understand , and documented copiously .
Why do people aim so low ?
# Jonathan LaCour
" I am not saying that there can't be other solutions , I am saying that our current solutions suck . "
What ?
Zope sucks ?
Quixote sucks ?
I 'm sure the developers and communities of those and other solutions would certainly feel encouraged to hear that kind of judgement fall on their hard work ( and success , too ) .
" If any of our solutions were as good as Rails , they would have a dominant user base in the Python community .
I really believe that ! "
Well , aside from the fact that any incursion into the Rails site to see what the fuss is about tends to set off my anti-hype alarms ( even more so than the JBoss site , circa 2001 ) , and even when I 've hit the " master alarm " I just get presented with various JSP - like endeavours which are , after the " scaffolding " is set up ( to borrow the Rails terminology ) , arguably mostly as easy in a JSP environment ( albeit without the transparent SQL - based persistence supposedly provided in Rails , and yes , a " to do " list tutorial is n't going to show off the power of Rails , even if the only Rails applications seem to be " to do " list managers , anyway ) , I must regard the framework domination claim somewhat skeptically .
Ages ago ( ie. 1997 ) solutions like Bobo provided a clearly better means of developing Web applications than just using cgi.py .
What then happened was that Bobo grew into being Zope , and that many developers did indeed follow that path , thus forming the Zope and Plone communities which seem in many respects to be disjoint from what is now considered to be the mainstream Python community - in a way , a dominant solution did emerge , but only as a parallel community .
Meanwhile , in the wider Python community and inspired by various other Web programming paradigms , a number of frameworks emerged and matured to produce the ecosystem that you see today .
Certainly , Quixote has a certain number of advocates , but probably nothing like the number of the solution that is said to have inspired it : Zope .
" I think its really selfish to hold onto one 's own framework if presented with the option to unify . "
You ignore the fact that most frameworks are designed to address real situations and quite possibly function adequately , even optimally , for their developers .
Is it selfish for someone not to abandon a framework because it is used in a production environment and that such abandonment would force them to migrate their existing applications for free just for those applications to function more or less as they did before ?
Sure , you get eventual benefits from your application suddenly using code that someone else is maintaining , but then there 's always the temptation to open source your own framework and to try and get the maintenance advantages of a larger development community whilst having everyone else migrating their applications instead .
( I suppose that this might explain why so many competing frameworks emerge , even though they often resemble one another - it's just the " selfishness " of not holding onto one 's own framework ... )
" Lets make the WSGI just that -- a way out .
But , we should n't try to make it the Servlet 's of the Python world ! "
Well , WSGI does n't really address anything other than a very basic standardised environment ; not that there is n't merit in addressing that area , but I was disappointed that people were happy with just settling for that , and somewhat disturbed that for many people WSGI is just something to believe in whose existence acts as an excuse for not getting to grips with the harder issues .
Personally , I do n't care about the WSGI level - I 'd rather examine the higher - level concepts which applications use directly to behave in the ways that they do .
After using Webware a fair amount , I wanted to experiment with other frameworks if only to avoid various pitfalls and issues that Webware had , but I did n't want to rewrite my framework and applications to make them run on Twisted ( for example ) .
In the end , I created WebStack to enable this whilst papering over some of the bizarre behaviour of various frameworks .
For me , WebStack " scratches my itch " because I can now ignore framework issues and concentrate on actual applications .
So for me the framework wars are over .
I do n't care about the " distinctive " things that many frameworks promote ( ie . the special template language or the URL dispatching scheme that should in any case really be determined by the application being written ) - I just want a sane API which mostly returns request parameters , streams , sessions , cookies and so on and which does n't force me to have to reinvent several wheels in every application I write , just because of some misguided minimalist agenda on the part of the framework designer .
And if I want my application to appear at http://mysite/zope/folder/myapp even after prototyping it on BaseHTTPServer , then so much the better !
# Paul Boddie
I agree with you in part Paul .
And I should n't have used the word " suck " to describe any of the existing frameworks , as they still beat the pants off of anything available for PHP or Perl .
The people who work on those frameworks can and should be proud of them .
But , I do believe that they do n't stack up to Rails .
I agree that their hype machine is running at full steam , and that is pretty obnoxious .
But , its hard to deny the traction they are getting .
And , no , they are n't doing anything all that impressive technically .
People have been writing bits and pieces of the Rails framework in Python for years and years .
But , they are n't putting all the pieces together in a simple way and working together to create a singular foundation .
Rails is doing it well , doing it all , documenting it , and getting it publicized .
I just wish that we had something comparable .
# Jonathan LaCour Personally , I do n't care about the WSGI level - I 'd rather examine the higher - level concepts which applications use directly to behave in the ways that they do .
That 's what my talk at PyCon was about , and I want to re-express all those same ideas here as articles .
WSGIKit is an architecture that uses WSGI as the way to pull together those higher - level concepts -- it 's using WSGI as much more than a generic way to connect to a server .
If all WSGI did was connect apps to server , it would be useful but indeed quite boring -- but WSGI is really a sneaky way of creating a standard request and response object , and a pattern for providing a stack of filters .
And that is a big deal , even if it is n't an end in itself .
# Ian Bicking >
What , ZOPE sucks ?
No , would n't say so .
However : I 'm a python enthusiast , but up to now , I was n't able to find ANY python web development framework comparable to J2EE with respect to the learning curve .
I took some time and tried several python solutions : CGIHTTPServer and low - level from the standard modules
It is fine as a sample and easy to learn , but far from being production based .
It took me days to find out how to write a multi - threaded server .
I could help very much if there was n't only the 5 - line sample code , but also a multi - threaded server program that at least works fast enough for in - house use .
And , even worse , though the HTTPServer and cgtib are both standard modules , there seems to be no easy way or example of how to actually let them work together .
What we need is at least a basic standard solution using a multi- threaded CGI server together with the cgitb routines .
twisted Fine ideas , very promising , but needs a complete new way of development .
I read the docco several hours .
It is just too different from everything else , so it is ruled out .
You 'll never set up some hello world examples after 2 hours like with JSP .
mod_python
The best standard solution , I think , but : I agree with some others here .
The main problem with mod_python is the lack of a good Apache 1.3 version .
For example , we are using Oracle Application Servers for production ( based on Apache 1.3 ) , so mod_python is out of the race automatically .
ZOPE
Zope is a world of it's own .
Just like twisted , there 's too much to learn for a quick start .
And with all those different template languages , it 's confusing .
In my work , I 'm forced to use J2EE .
I do n't really like it , because * I have to use Java ( better than C , but ways behind Python ) * Development is SOOOO slow * J2EE is a very complex world now .
But : it is very easy to start with .
Every java programmer can write a Hello World JSP and test it within a few hours .
The difficulties only follow later , as soon as things like session handling , DB connections , error handling , reliability etc are considered .
But at that time , the devloper is already convinced that - in principle - he can build a solution with J2EE .
A python solution should make it easy to start learning from scratch , that 's the pythonic way to go !
( just like JSP / J2 EE does ... ) .
And it should be in the standard module library .
# Henning von Bargen " twisted Fine ideas , very promising , but needs a complete new way of development .
I read the docco several hours .
It is just too different from everything else , so it is ruled out .
You 'll never set up some hello world examples after 2 hours like with JSP . "
The web is only a small part of twisted .
Or did you mean Nevow ?
I think you could pick of the basics of Nevow very quickly without knowing much about twisted , though you do eventually need to pick up some twisted basics like deferreds , adapters , realms , etc. to be fully proficient with it .
The main problem with Nevow as an application framework is the lack of integration with an ORM and the immaturity of some parts ( e.g. formless needs a lot of work to be useful for more than simple forms . )
# Daverz HMMM ...... I guess that 's why everyone uses PHP instead of Python : " .. because it 's superior to PHP . "
It 's hard to believe , as a Python / PHP / Java /.NET /C programmer , that Python is " superior " to PHP .
# James Rickmond John , Rails is far from the only web app framework for Ruby .
Other competent ones ( i.e. used in production ) are Nitro and IOWA .
Several others exist which are probably little more than hobbies .
That 's not to put them down : some of them showcase excellent techniques and are an important part of the ecosystem .
Anyway , just wanted to clear up that misconception .
Rails is , IMO , the best webapp framework for Ruby in every way , and it 's certainly the dominant one , but it has prospered _despite_ being one of many choices .
It was n't a Ruby community effort to present a dominant framework to the world ; it was the hard work of one person .
The " too much choice " argument regarding Python web programming has a valid point , but it 's not fully convincing .
# Gavin Sinclair
This is very true .
In my environment ( database support , FWIW ) I find that most of the utility - type programs I write fall into one of two categories - server - side utilities / daemons ( with a command line interface at best ) or web applications .
For web applications , I 'd love to use Python .
I 've tried , often enough .
But this is " internal " software , and it 's hard to get any time to spend on it .
So I have to be able to get a basic , good looking ( I know , but it matters to management :-() application , up and running fast .
Python can't really do this , as things stand .
The type of application I 'm talking about is n't fancy - a very basic CRUD ( Create , Report , Update , Delete ) application is all I need as a start .
Once I 've got that sanctioned and running , adding the extra bells and whistles is a lot easier to get agreement to .
This is where , in my view , Rails scores - it 's a " build the basic application in a day " environment , with the flexibility to grow once the initial system is in place .
FWIW , being an Oracle environment , we 've started using Oracle 's proprietary HTML DB system .
It 's nice for that basic CRUD system , and it's got a reasonably nice - looking set of default templates ( with slick bells and whistles like tabbed dialogs , which always impress people :-) ) .
But it 's an unholy nightmare to extend .
And yet that does n't matter , because the initial development is so simple ...
So there 's a challenge .
If someone were to develop a Python framework which made writing a basic CRUD application a simple matter , coupled with some good , " professional - looking " templates , I 'd bite your hand off to get it .
Paul .
Paul :
We 've had the exact Python Web framework you 're asking about for about a year -- on - the - fly ORM generation , dynamically - created admin interfaces , stupidly - simple CRUD and much , much more ...
It 's just a matter of convincing our higher - ups to open - source it .
We 're working on that .
Stay tuned .
And if you ( or anybody else ) have suggestions on how to convince management to open - source a product , please contact me .
( holovaty.com / contact ) # Adrian H. I 'd like to pipe in with my agreement regarding the true problem here .
SQLObject is a good , transparent ORM .
Nevow , Quixote and CherryPy are all quite reasonable object publishers .
Cheetah or one of the XML template systems ( ZPT , Kid , etc. ) are decent template systems .
The parts are all there .
Because of distutils , they 're even pretty easy to install .
The problem is that once you 've got them installed , you 're sitting there with a blank directory , wondering what to do next .
Reading through the docs of the various projects will give you some ideas , but you do n't get a great feeling about things because you 're not really sure how to kick things off and make something visible that you can put your arms around and start improving .
I do test - driven development and find that it helps , but a project really takes off once you 've got something to grab onto .
That 's what Rails offers that none of the current Python solutions does : a way to get going nearly instantly .
So much so , that they can create a 10 minute demo video .
A large number of applications are all about CRUD .
Sure , they all have their own wrinkles , but if you can give someone a quick start with CRUD and easy ways to grow from there , you 've got yourself a winner with a big chunk of apps .
Subway can do this ( but , I have n't looked closely enough at it to know if that 's where it 's heading ) .
Bringing this kind of CRUD quickstart would at least let Python catch up with Rails .
# Kevin Dangoor
As Ian pointed out in another posting , and you say here , Python has all the bits .
What it lacks is the " quickstart " appeal .
Whatever you call it , that 's what 's missing .
And I do n't see this as " playing catchup to Rails " - it 's a simple case of providing entry - level , tutorial type documentation and sample material ( something that open source projects are notoriously lacking in , because none of us like writing it ) .
I do n't think there 's any need to evangelise a " one true system " for object publishing , or for templating , or whatever .
Each has its strengths and weaknesses .
But picking one set ( and accepting the compromises ) and doing a really good job of putting that quickstart tutorial together will add something extra to the mix .
Subway sounds interesting , but a first glance makes it look like ( more ) packaging and " layers " .
I 'm happy with a toolkit of " bits " .
I do n't really want a packaged solution , I want a first step up .
Heck , I 'm very close to going it alone , and building something for myself .
I found a document the other day called " Four Days on Rails " , which went the step past the 10 - minute demo video , and showed how to start customising the initial application .
I 'm seriously considering doing something similar for Python , starting from SQLObject , Cheetah , and Quixote ( or maybe CherryPy ) .
But my graphic design skills are dire .
I 'm going to find it very hard to write something along the lines of " look - it 's easy to build a basic web application in Python " when I can't even stomach the look of the result myself :-)
I do n't know if I 'll ever get round to doing this ( my life is a mess of part - completed projects ... ) but I 'm not sure that waiting and hoping someone else will do it for me is going to work , either .
( And I even looked at Rails , but I can't get my head round Ruby so I 'm probably safe from the temptation to swap languages for a while yet ... )

# Gabriel Birke
Jonathan , I 'm going to agree with most of your statements .
But I 'd like to tell you a little something , because you might find it enlightening .
You said , " Everything that makes Python great does n't mean much to managers -- will they care about significant whitespace ? "
Recently , I did a risk analysis for Lockheed Martin where we compared some of the major up - and - coming popular " scripting " languages .
I chose Python , Ruby , Lua , Ocaml , and Erlang as examples of languages with strong but somewhat hidden support .
These are the folks that I feel are the up - and - comers .
So we did an analysis , comparing stylistic differences , typing , testability , readability , usability ( as in number of libraries ) , and maintainability ( what companies could offer sustainment with these languages ) .
The risk scale went from white ( 0 risk ) to green ( not too risky ) to yellow ( risky ) to red ( too risky ) .
Python was the only contender in this list that 's in the green .
When I spoke with middle - line managers and the hollow once - engineers who had n't done any real work for years -- now doing " engineering management " and " proposals " -- Python had the most favorable impression .
They loved the idea of things like significant whitespace , because ( and I quote this ) , " It makes people 's code more similar . "
It also helps reduce the burden of people who draft up code standards .
Other popular features were garbage collection , familiar syntax , and the fewest " new methodologies " for programmers to learn .
Now , maybe my bias is showing here , I 'm not a huge Python fan .
For that reason , I had the other engineer on my project , who is a big Python fan , handle Python .
I thought it was interesting that the same things I thought were weaknesses of Python turned out to be strengths in the eyes of our review .
But as I was doing this comparison , I realized something .
If the Revolution were to happen today and Java and C++ were shot in front of the wall , Python would be one to rise to dominance .
Because , when you get right down to it , Python is the least different .
Ah sadly one of the great recurring themes in the python world .
I ( and others ) have repeatedly had this discussion .
As a non uber - geek ( in python or elsewhere ) I can say the impression I 've gotten over time , repeatedly , is that many people who write python are too damn smart .
They say " look , we 've got great libs that do X Y and Z. Just put 'em together ! "
Fine .
If you 're a really good developer , that 's likely workable for you .
Especially if you 're working on a large complicated project , with lots of other really smart people like yourself .
But there is a huge class of ( " under " ) developers , who either do n't have the skills , experience and / or time to do this .
It is these people who end up falling back on PHP , or increasingly , Rails , as it caters to a more RAD approach than putting together python libs .
And the sheer numbers of these people have a huge effect on public perception and language penetration - that PHP trendline surely is n't measuring high - quality applications .
Yet decision - makers see that trend , and are reassured ; publishers see it and see " okay , we can publish a book on this " ; ISPs see it and say " okay , we need to look into supporting this " .
Python developers seem to see it and say " but , yeah , almost all of those apps are crappy and written by script kiddies " .
Yes .
Probably , but that 's not the salient point here IMHO .
For example , Quixote is very nice inside - but it is certainly not packaged ( docs / site / etc ) or presented as something Joe Developer can start running with .
It is clearly used and aimed at experienced and smart people .
That limits its exposure .
Which is probably fine - less support needed on a mailing list , and they have a great tool for their needs .
Zope / Plone is just not something many will consider , for various reasons .
It 's complexity and opaqueness being the initial ones , but that 's a near - religious argument I 'm not looking to get into .
CherryPy , again nice , but pretty barebones still last I checked .
Great if you want a base tool to build on .
Maybe akin to a java servlet container , but not a cohesive stack .
Also , a key point on Rails that David ( original coder , current leader ) mentions often , is that the framework was extracted , not designed on paper .
And , less mentioned , but to me seemingly as important , it was basically done by one person .
The original ' spirit ' is very cohesive because of this - like a novel written by one person compared to being assembled and written by committee .
This is why I 'd guess projects like Subway will have trouble " gelling " into any similar sort of cohesiveness .
Not that it 's impossible to blend frameworks seamlessly , but I 'd say much harder .
I only hang around these discussions because I would much rather write python than ruby , but Rails has presented an unbeatable argument at this point , that nothing in python matches .
And I 'm far from the only one with this opinion .
I think the only way a viable competitor will arise is if a small team or individual takes the initiative and does it - summits , merging projects , etc. are not likely to work based on past examples .
Perhaps the project / framework mentioned by holovaty.com ( Adam ? sorry can't see the comment while typing this ) will be one to take this shape , arising out of a small team I believe ( kansas.com ? ) .
Okay enough from my peanut gallery .
Thanks for raising the issue again - hopefully for the near - last time ?
I think you are right on the money !
This is analagous to the ballyhooing that comes from the Postgres group about MySQL .
Sure , it 's got the bells and whistles and can also make sandwiches , but it was lost on them that it was the ease of use coming in and relaxed learning curve of MySQL ( not to mention that it could also run on Windows ) that helped it 's popularity .
I have this sinking feeling that new easy to grok simple languages will allways spread faster than OOL's .
It 's easier for a noob to understand logic first then paradigm later .
If he does n't have to deal with learning OO ( as an example ) at the onset he gets down to the business of writing code a lot faster than one who does .
Seriously , the group of people that you want are the young kids that some have termed " script kiddies " .
They are the ones that get excited about it and turn it into something cool .
As far back as ' 98 people were talking about how cool PHP is and before that they talked abuot how cool Perl is .
But nobody was talking about how cool Python is .
That talked seemed limited to people on high horses looking down on the hordes of kiddies .
A gret many of whom grew up ( a little at least ) and began influencing those ( like managers and publishers ) around them .
And if that influence was n't at first by jaw , then it was by example .
Please do n't take this the wrong way .
I am someone that makes a living with PHP , but I just adore Python ( inspite of the fact that I also love the Curly Brace ) .
It 's an awesome language !
However , if it 's a popularity game we are talking about , simplicity is the ulitmate trump card .
PHP has that .
# BDKR
I think you 're making what I call the " Microsoft Argument " : target the mean of the standard distribution of brainpower , not the starboard tail , where the pythonistas hang out .
This may be an increasingly bad problem with python .
I dimly grasp what we 're doing with decorators , and really have n't gotten my mind around why a ' new style class ' is better than an old style one , and the use case for meta - classes escapes me .
Maybe the answer , then , is a custom apache distribution that automagically configures mod_python for intense http combat .
Not that I 've the technical chops to configure such , mind you .
# Chris Smith
Re Ruby on Rails - personally tried enough frameworks to want to wait a long time before committing real effort to it .
Have a rule these days not to take frameworks seriously until someone is able to describe how it " sucks " .
At that point the sort of insight required to build real apps with it starts popping out .
ROR is still on the hype curve right now .
It 's great that it 's become a focal point for many developers , something lacking for any equivalent Perl , PHP or Python framework .
That guarantees a longish future and no doubt plenty of supporting libraries , both important for betting your development project on it .
But
The make - or - break for me is the " edge cases " ( the moment you step beyond CRUD ) , plus how things start to look when the feature list grows .
Specifically , a couple of issues I have from doing nothing more than trawling ROR documentation ( which should probably be directed at a mailing list but David H scares me ; ) , so here goes ...
I 've seen the approach of mapping actions directly to methods before in a PHP framework called ISMO ( http://ismo.morrdusk.net/).
From trying one project in anger with it - started off nicely but breaks down when you start needing to implement things like a authentication with permissions global behaviour ( read Intercepting Filter ) which needs to be bubble through to individual actions .
Also things like an Application Controller , such as for a form with multiple parts , required blood .
Perhaps Ruby can prevent the same happening with Rails in a way that PHP can't but need to see that before I believe .
Otherwise Ruby on Rails lacks ease of deployment right now .
As I see it only " ASP " type technologies can deliver that , number 1 now being PHP .
And ease of deployment is not just a feature for newbies .
It opens up options like " just in time " code generation and caching which , in turn , create new possibilities for optimization and scaling smoothly .
Along those lines , another rule I have these days is if it does l10n at runtime , move swiftly on .
Sick as it may seem , I 'd recommend exploring Python as an active generator for PHP ( i.e. you never touch / extend the PHP yourself ) ;
Python working as the design / modeling tool .
In general PHP " works best " when it violates all rules of sane programming ( other than security of course ) ; as raw spagetti , perhaps because PHP was always meant to be just a template language .
The spagetti nature of PHP can be preserved while employing sane coding practices by using code generation .
Right now the tools are n't there and no one 's really explored the potential .
The furthest walk I 've seen in that direction is Scriptol - http://www.scriptol.com/ and some template engines written in PHP itself , such as WACT 's http://wact.sourceforge.net/index.php/TemplateComponentArchitecture.
Stepping out of what platform makes most sense for a moment , PHP 's installed base represents opportunity for anyone writing applications which target it and figure that 's the bottom line .
There 's a joke , where I came from , about the answer you 'll get if you ask a local farmer for directions : " Ooooh , you do n't want to start from here ! "
Sick as it may seem , I 'd recommend exploring Python as an active generator for PHP Yes Harry , that does seem sick .
Sick !
Horrible !
The debugging horror !
The deployment nightmare !
That is the framework I really , really do n't want to see ... maybe if you keep it in the basement and never tell the neighbors it was ever born it would be okay .
But do not reveal such a thing to the light of day , please !
# Ian Bicking
Oh well , guess you do n't want to see this http://eric_rollins.home.mindspring.com/pgen/
- Ruby again ;) # Harry Fuecks
Apologies - got rant some more ; " Sick ! Horrible !
The debugging horror !
The deployment nightmare !
That is the framework I really , really do n't want to see ... "
Perhaps as a general framework , yes but for more specific application , where the design stage involves a narrower range of choices , it can work well .
There 's a perfect example I forgot - Worksheet Server : http://www.jedox.com/.
Design / development is done with Excel and the generated PHP code is not meant to be touched directly - it behaves something like a " component " on the web server .
Further changes are made in Excel , overwriting the previous set of generated PHP code .
So PHP acts as something like the " byte code " of a Worksheet Server " runtime " .
Did a review of it a while back http://www.sitepoint.com/article/php-apps-excel-worksheet-server.
And a potential candidate would be tools like JAlbum ( http://jalbum.net/) which normally spit out HTML .
Could easily be used to spit out PHP and add all those features some people seem to appreciate on their galleries , such as hit counts and comments .
Otherwise the devil is in the details - I do n't see debugging horrors and deployment nightmares as givens - depends what you 're doing and how you do it .
Sure anything that involves generating code will itself require significant development overhead but As one simple example of Python aiding PHP development , using Ned Bachelors COG , you might have something like : <? php /* [ [ [ import cog from myapputils import getdsn dsn = getdsn ( ) cog.outl ( " $db = DB::connect ( %s ) ; " % dsn ) ] ] ]
*/ #
While developing use this ( will be replaced by COG ) $ db = DB :: connect ( " pgsql://devuser:password@localhost/myapp " ) ; //[ [ [end ] ] ]
# Continue with PHP script ... ?>
The PHP script is still executable while hacking / debugging is in progress .
Deployment could be a Python script that runs COG over the source then copies it to the producive environment , replacing previous versions .
Anyway ... # Harry Fuecks
I think it 's reasonable when using static publishing to produce PHP .
I 'm not against all PHP generation .
But I think it 's important to keep the generation dumb ; set some variables , include some other PHP files ( which are custom written ) , and that 's about it .
It 's the modeling in Python and generating PHP that would scare me .
# Ian Bicking
I 've been shopping web frameworks for 3.5 years now .
Really just window shopping - I 've had project ideas but not the inclination to pursue them in my limited time .
Now that I 've finished school and only work full - time this has changed a bit , and I 've gotten more serious about a project .
I still do n't know if it would have gotten off the ground except for Rails .
I 've developed with MS technologies for about 7 years and the last couple has been mostly web apps with ASP .
NET /C# .
For a long time , I 've been deciding which Java frameworks I would use for my independent work ... I 've played with all the struts , spring , webwork , tapestry as well as a couple ORMs ( thought I really liked Hibernate ) and had pieced together what my " stack " would be .
I really like the toolsets and active community there .
For a long time , I 've also been in love with Python but have never really gotten past " Whetting your Appetite " .
CherryPy really peaked my interest at one point and I even found well - priced hosting that supported it but I never went anywhere with it .
I remember playing with Zope ( at least , Zope DB ) a little bit but did n't get far .
Cannot say why now ( it was quite a long time ago ) and unfortunately I 'm out of the market for the time being .
Maybe I am just a sucker for hype but Rails got me moving .
I found a hosting provider to support me ( and for a bargain rate , great service so far ) .
Once I was sure I could actually deploy my application I started building it .
This is after doing nothing but idly looking at various frameworks , reading various websites , following several communities over a period of years with only a few concepts for potential projects in the back of my mind .
Rails HOOKED me .
I had barely learned anything about Ruby before learning about Rails ( what little I had learnedI liked less than Python , and as it did n't have a web framework of note I did n't pursue it further ) .
I think Rails has taught me somethings about Ruby that I now appreciate more , but I still have a long way to go and ultimately do n't know how I will feel about Ruby as a language .
Please understand , the rails tutorials and scaffolding have done nearly as much harm as they have good for Rails ( and that is saying a lot ) .
Rails != scaffold .
Yes , Rails views look like ASP / JSP / PHP spaghetti code .
They are different , and you can find out why if you read more of David 's holy writ but even better if you experience it for yourself .
The framework guides you by convention to do things properly .
Coming from standard ASP & ASP .
NET , I never fully grokked MVC ( I understand it , but I have n't lived it ) .
I was often paralyzed by questions of " where does this type logic go " .
Rails seems to be telling me , and telling me in ways that I do n't feel anxious or guilty about , and telling me quickly .
Really what attracted me to Rails though is not the hype or the scaffold or the 10 minute demo , although that certainly helps when I feel I 'm making really rapid progress .
What attracted me is the philosophy .
Do n't repeat yourself .
Use convention instead of configuration .
After using ActiveRecord going back and doing Hibernate ( even with everything its tools can generate for me ) really makes me sick .
After using ActiveController and ActiveView , the idea of the struts or springs XML config approach makes me sick .
Of course , ASP.NET makes me sick just by being what it is and by the generally accepted practices associated with it ( same with PHP ) .
Truly , I do n't have the Python experience to speak to it in ways I can speak to Java and MS technologies .
But Rails sold me in minutes , and I 've been shopping a long time .
If the Python community can develop something as cohesive and / or market it as well , then it can win .
Python I think is unquestionably a better general - purpose language than Ruby still , just based on its library and tool support as well as it its distribution and mind share .
But you might not have that much time .
# JeremyH
I totally agree with your thoughts .
However , I think the solution will be simpler than you think : Through Ironpython , Python will be able to leverage all the power of ASP.
NET running on the .NET framework and Mono .
What can be better than that ?
. NET is very , very similar to Java ( the platform , not the language ) .
We 're talking about wanting very high - level web frameworks , and I know that the closest you get on Java is RIFE .
I do n't know about .
NET .
The trouble is that frameworks for .NET and the JVM are designed primarily for statically typed languages that do n't offer cool features like metaclasses .
I 've used Hibernate extensively , and I can safely say that SQLObject ( and ActiveRecord , I 'm sure ) are much easier , because the language offers features to support that kind of thing .
So , while it may be nice to be able to call .NET and Java code , that is not really a big win in terms of web development productivity .
# Kevin Dangoor
I think you forgot to define " Web Programming " .
It can be anything from help with making HTML to Content Management Systems to Database Accessing Frameworks to advanced templating and forms handling .
Depending on the audience , different solutions are needed , and I can't tell what audience you are aiming for .
This is too hand - wavy a problem definition to yield any useful answers .
I think the problem is one of " product design " and " usability analysis " more than anything else :
What 's lacking is a single easy to pick up choice that combines the parts that already exist , documents them well , adds easy tutorials , and makes it easy to package and deploy the resulting web apps .
Then hype the heck out of it like Rails .
The current choices for Python web development seem either in involve way too steep of a learning curve or are n't really complete on their own .
This is said w/o deep knowledge of most of the frameworks out there , just my general sense from talking to people and dabbling a bit with a few .
I have n't looked at Rails at all , so I do n't know what we 're up against , ;) but it seems to me that something that support representational state transfer ( REST ) really well could be very useful .
I have n't found anything that does ...

Can you guys get down in writing just what is so good about Rails that you would like to copy in a Python framework ?
There seems to be a lot of " it 's so great , I wish we could do that " , but how about a top ten list of what 's so great .
E.g. " easy to install " , " make CRUD screen from SQL table definition " etc .
< plug >
I 'm yet another developer who set out to create the nicely integrated tight - stack RAD web app framework for Python .
However I did n't start from scratch but instead chose Quixote as the underlying framework ( very Pythonic , if not the most IMO ) and built up from there .
The result of that is http://www.qlime.org/.
Anyway it was interesting going through the article and comments to see what people are looking for .
I 'd be thrilled to get more feedback regarding my framework from end users .
QLime has n't reached 1.0 yet and significant design decisions can still be made .
I 'd rather be building what people are going to use .
</ plug >
One of the reasons why there are many frameworks is that Python is inherently easy and inviting for developers .
Why learn the details of an existing framework when it 's easy ( and fun ) to just write my own ?
Which will also work exactly as I think it should work .
Cheers !
Python does not " appeal to programmers " .
Every programmer I know did the same thing I did when they dipped their toe into python .
" It imposes rules on whitespace ? ? "
And then they drag it to the recycle bin .
A 30 second experience .
Fixing THAT is what " Matters Most " for Python .
Until you do , it will continue to be a niche .
I almost did it myself ( drag to recycle bin ) when I first found Python .
The only reason I kept it ( and am I glad I did ! ) was because it was recommended by a coworker ( programmer ) whos skills I highly respected .
Soon I realized there was really nothing to be afraid of , my productivity soared and now it 's my first choice for most tasks .
It was an important life lesson too - to be wary of my own prejudice when encountering something new .
I now realize my traumatic experience with COBOL in school , and the fact that most languages do n't use whitespace , had built my prejudice .
Anyway , Python went from 8 % to 14 % usage in one year ( fastest growing language in the enterprise ) according to this InfoWorld article - http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/09/24/39FErrdev_1.html?s=feature .
I 'd also suggest you look at the python.org jobs page and quotes page to see what people are doing with Python .
That might make you rethink your ' niche ' comment .
Cheers ! # Shalabh
If the shape of your whitespace is your idea of self - expression , you can't really be that much of a " programmer " .
# arimasp
My idea of " self - expression " ?
Huh , what am I , picasso ?
The shape of my whitespace is my idea of organization , that 's what it is .
( And so I guess writing organized code does n't make me " much of a ' programmer ' " according to your comment . )
#
Bog source
This thing about indentation / whitespace has dogged python forever .
Personally , I think it is a great feature , but for those who wo n't touch python without curly braces , there is an easy fix : Just accept an alternate form of blocks , which is : xxx ... { code #
Note : code here is deliberately randomly indented .
code code } instead of xxx ... : code code code right in the Python compiler .
( I can hear all you python zealots scream so loud :) since it breaks the ' one way to do it ' , and pushes a stake right through the heart of the indentation based readability , but hey why not ?
I have often thought of whipping out a perl ( sorry ) preprocessor script that could take such braces based syntax and turn that to standard indentation based syntax , but it is best done right within the python compiler and interpretor : maybe allow a new command - line option that allows for braces based blocks .

If Python were like " every other " programming language , what would be its advantage ?
The Monty Python tie -in ?
Python does appeal to programmers .
When you are sick of your current language and you want something better , you finally decide to do more than dip your toe in .
Or that super programmer down the row who you respect , because he really is very good at programming keeps telling you Python is worth learning .
You finally break down and start playing with it .
Or you think LISP is really cool , but not really practical these days and you look to Python .
Whatever , but it takes some effort to learn a new language .
If the new language were just like your old language , you would n't be making the effort to learn it .
Programmers impose rules on whitespace themselves .
Would you like to read a program written in Perl ( or whatever ) where the programmer used no whitespace to denote structure ?
Or worse yet had incorrect indentation ?
It would be horrible .
The first thing you 'd do was fix it , curly braces or not .
You need the whitespace .
So who cares about the curly braces ?
They do n't matter .
Indentation is what matters .
I ran across a really good quote recently .
It kind of fits the whole whitespace argument .
The thought being that the way Python does whitespace is a really good idea : " Do n't worry about people stealing your ideas .
If the ideas are any good you 'll have to ram them down people 's throats " - Howard Aiken , computer scientist .
# Dennis
That 's odd .
I had the opposite experience .
Personally , it took a few minutes for me to get over the whitespace , but most of the programmers I 've introduced it to have n't cared .
Of course , many of them are used to various 4gl - ish vertical - app languages , so maybe it 's not too representative ...
My experience is that there are two kinds of programmers :
Those that want the best tool for the job ( and are willing to adapt a little to best leverage the tool ) and those who trash anything not " just like " what they 're already used to .
I use Python primarily for doing network management housekeeping on a university network ( 802.1x , mac - based radius auth , etc ) .
Most of the comments I see about making changes to python make me nervous , as they seem to ignore any " non-web " usage in a rush to " beat PHP " or whatever .

As a Python lover who also uses PHP extensively , I find that Spyce ( http://spyce.sourceforge.net ) is the Python web programming solution that is closest in spirit to PHP .
With Spyce , all the right ingredients that made for PHP 's [ initial ] success , such as immediacy of learning and integration into an HTML page , are made available while straying as little as possible from how you normally do Python programming ( read : nothing much new to learn ) .
Spyce 's Pythonic design involves a small amount of carefully designed features which : provides powerful HTML - integration features more on par with JSP ( such as rockin ' custom tags ) than PHP ( whose tag - related features you need to boost with outside help such as Smarty ) retains the ease and cleanliness of basic PHP lets you reuse what Python already does well , with the least distraction allows extension with template processors ( such as Cheetah ) Spyce has been around for a while and mature and stable enough for ' heavy lifting ' .
It was what I settled on after evaluating roughly a dozen other Python web frameworks including CherryPy , Quixote , Skunk , Zope , and Webware , none of which , imo , offered the clarity and ease of HTML integration that PHP provides and thus were not satisfactory alternatives .
Spyce can be made to run on commodity hosting that supports CGI and Python ( 99.9 % do ) easily by : just copying over the Spyce files under a cgi-bin directory creating a 2 - 3 line .htaccess file in a directory where your .spy files will run Voila !
You now have Spyce working together with all the features that a Python program on that server has access to ( including MySQL , SMTP , etc ... )
Spyce can also work on top of fastCGI , mod_python as well as its own server proxying behind Apache or other web server .
Oh ... and before I forget ... if its default [ [ and ] ] delimiter tags turn you off , you can use the more conventional <% and %> instead .
The final icing on the cake is that the free SciTE ( http://www.scintilla.org ) editor can beautifully highlight HTML , Javascript and Spyce code separately when you use <% %> and enable ' asp.default.language=3 ' in its ' html.properties ' configuration file !
Well , I agree - spyce is fine .
Howerver , since I have found CherryPy ... No .
Spyce is - too- close to php programming for me .
I think that the way cp2 is going is better for web programming .
However , there is one thing cp needs - mod_cherrypy :-]
# Almad I used Spyce , but now mod_python supports inline code , so for med Spyce became redundant .

Hi Ian .
I agree with you absolutely .
Too bad Guido do not concern web development that much .
Even if he does not do web related work directly he should deputize a team to come up with a solution within certain time frame .
If ever Python come out with any clout like Rudy on rail I can see its user base easily double or triple .
Talking about Ruby on rail its momentum does startle me .
But I think more importantly it should be consider an inspiration for the Python community .
It is easy for a talented Python developer to crank out a well designed framework .
But what really counts is the user base and public awareness .
The way Ruby on rail takes on the audience shows there are still opportunities in web development , and that PHP and Java still sucks .
It might be insane but , why Guido should be concern with every framework built atop Python ?
As far as I see it , it is not really his business after all .
But , on the other hand , I totally agree with Jonathan when he says that the Python community should only focus on some solutions though I think we should act on two levels .
One solution that is very simple and very pythonic so that it attracts newbies .
PHP works great because it does n't force you to use a complex framework like J2EE or .NET
Another solution for bigger structures like J2EE and .NET offer .
There Zope and Twisted might be welcome ( I do n't like them to be fair but that 's personnal taste . )
I 've found all that burden around Rail really sane for the Python community which sometimes is really quick to think Python is the best so we do n't need to keep on going on .
Python community is a bit self - centric sometimes where Ruby community is not ( ' till now ) .
That 's why I also do n't think Guido should have anything to decide in terms of web frameworks .
We can't rely only on one unique individual .
Just y 2 cents ... # S. Why should Guido concern about web framework ?
Let 's scroll back to the top to check on Ian 's key premise .
" Resolving Python 's problems with web programming is the most important thing we can do to market Python . "
So Guido does not directly invoked in any web development himself .
But I bet he would concern about the market of Python and he would be a cheif evangelist himself .
And here our believe is positioning Python as a premier web development tool is the top most important thing you can do to market Python .
I do n't expect Guido to have any role in designing of picking the best framework .
The best thing he can do is to be a catalyst to help the community to arrive to a better solution .
By the way I like your idea of having several layers of framework ( like JSP and Struts ) .
If the higher layer is build on top of lower layer that would be even better .
# Wai Yip Tung
Could n't agree more .
Have developed untold lines of software in everything from Fortran / Basic / Pascal / Forth / APL , to C/C++/ ObjC/Java and Python .
While I still use C/C++/ ObjC / Java occasionally , I stick to Python whenever I can because it is just better .
That said however , I share the concern for Python 's future because I 'm selfish and do n't want my Python relegated to the scrape heap of unsupported languages somewhere down the road .
I fear that Python 's inability to cohesively embrace the challenge of web - based apps provides too much opening for some lesser species to proliferate and push out other options in the same way the the Unix community failed to create a cohesive offering and allowed the M$ virus to proliferate so widely .
I do n't mind having lots of choices ( I 've tried most of the web app development frameworks out there at one time or another ) , but I would like to see a really well - engineered choice integrated into the Standard Library so that the community as a whole could focus its resources and deliver a knock - out punch in the world of web apps .
Add my vote should you present this to the Powers That Be ...
I do agree on what Ian is saying , but I want to go forward .
I 've tried to write down the requirements the ' ultimate '
Python web framework needs to comply to .
PHP supports all of these : a template syntax that can mix fixed HTML with generated code .
Sadly enough the whitespace of Python does not fit very well with HTML .
There have been numerous attemps to overcome this ( Quixote ptl , psp , ... ) but none of them are as easy as PHP .
I think this is the main reason why Python keeps on struggling to become a very popular Web language .
This one will be the main hurdle to get an agreement on because of the legacy of the existing templates systems
a simple relationship : a web page is a file .
Storing web pages in an object database ( the Zope way ) only increases complexity : it requires specific tools to do ftp , webdav , ... , while it does not bring anything more than the file system does .
A web page can be an object if we stick to the ' one object in one file ' rule .
a RDMBS back end .
While pyhton lovers will argue that a ptyhon object store is more pythonic , these object stores lacks the features of RDMBS like MySQL and Oracle : robustness , backup / restore , scalability , replication , transactional behaviour , ...
People are scared to put 2
Gb of critical business data in an ' unknown ' OO database .
SQLObject might do the job to link to the back - end .
non stop behaviour .
Most Python web framework requires you to stop and restart the framework when you add / edit / delete a web page .
In most case a web page is directly linked to a Python object , which cannot be easily removed / modified from a running Python process .
This behaviour is not acceptable for operational sites .
Or we need to go away from the paradigm ' a web page is a Python object ' or we need to solve remove / modify objects issue .
a decent release policy ( and not like Webware who lives in the SVN repository for the last 2 years )
a good Apache integration ( both release 1 and 2 )
a good persistent session management ( not like Quixote ) .
PHP dumps session info in ordinary files , which is not nice , but it works .
Looking at the existing web framework we have ( Quixote , Webware , CherryPy , SnakeLets , mod_python , ... ) all of the frameworks miss at least one .
Only if we have a framework that complies to all of these requirements , we can go for the last one : a solution that integrates nicely the different components , having a single integrated configuration file , installation script , start / stop script and documentation
OMFG .
The amount of hand - wringing going on over this topic is beyond belief .
Is the sky going to fall if Python does n't come up with a draconian " web standard " ?
Are you all so eager to have legions of script kiddies using Python , leaving you with huge messes to clean up ?
I do nothing but web development for businesses , and I use Python , and all this talk about how hard it is to get started with framework X , Y , or Z is utter balderdash .
Sorry if I sound harsh , but you guys are spouting nonsense , and encouraging some " sense of urgency " among each other in the same way that mass hysteria impacts mob behavior .
LDB
I agree although a little more moderately .
I am a Python web developer and have been able to meet any customer requirements using either Webware or Plone / Zope .
And I would argue that the reality is Zope has become THE Python Web framework .
Does that mean we should stop working on WSGI ?
No. But Zope and Plone now have significant backing from large organizations .
Plone / Zope is the official web platform for several federal agencies including NASA , NOAA , and the U.S. Navy .
And even more large commercial companies have settled on Zope including Intuit and SGI .
Like it or not that 's a lot of market share and name recognition .
Plus there are plenty of mom and pop sites running Zope as well .
It seems that the Web has declared Plone / Zope a definite leader among web frameworks in general .
And as far as the core language , Python 's weak XML support is a far greater threat to its success as both a web and general purpose language .
Web services and other web - related XML standards are becoming more important than any given web framework or paradigm in software development .
J2EE and .NET are killing Python in the SOAP arena not to mention all of the other places where XML is applied heavily .
Count how many SOAP examples are in the latest edition of the " Python Cookbook " ( Answer : 0 ) .
Also count the number of core Python libraries related to Web / Network programming versus the ones related to modern XML standards .
And if you still have doubts about Python 's suitability and scalability for Web applications just ask Google how they feel about it :-) # Joel
Your more moderate agreement is probably more productive that my rant , I readily concede ;)
As for your point about Zope being the de-facto standard , I agree .
I 'd also point out that there has been plenty of conversation about finding ways to use the Twisted framework for Zope 's network plumbing , so that Zope can be more focused on its core problem domains .
Also , Jim Fulton ( the Zope Pope ) has stated that he would like to incorporate some of the desirable features of the Nevow framework .
The Twisted folks , for their part , have dropped their Interface implementation in favor of the one used in Zope 3 .
SQLObject is a de-facto standard these days , too .
Now , my point in rambling on about this stuff is that I like the standardization that I 've described above , because it happened naturally .
Nobody had a big summit to lay down the law or make sweeping pronouncements .
I hate the kind of standardization being argued for in this topic , because it is an attempt to dictate a " winner " technology stack , instead of letting the winning combination be determined by the only measure that matters , which is utilization in the field .
The irony here is that there is so much talk about creating a standard , about limiting choices , about making it easy for developers to avoid thinking about which technology to use when building a web application ; Rails is just a framework that somebody built to solve some problems , and it happens to be evolving into a de-facto standard in Ruby - land .
No voting or consensus involved , just natural forces at work .
What is being proposed here will fail , because it is an artificial , design - by - committee solution to a fictitious problem .
Somebody , anybody , please give me a real example of how it is so easy to do X in Rails / PHP / whatever , and how it is just so much harder to do in Zope / Twisted / whatever .
LDB # L. Daniel Burr
While on some level " standards " are decided after the fact in the Open Source community , but they are rooted in conscious decisions .
No one said that Jim Fulton had special authority over Nevow , Python web programming , or anything -- the informal authority he has was gained through his action and involvement , and leveraging the authority from a popular framework ( Zope ) .
And even in the presence of Zope Corp , he still does n't get a pass when it comes to authority in that community .
" Authority " in all these cases still only means that people choose to listen to him , not that he can actually make people do much ( at least outside of Zope Corp ) .
In turn he chooses things consciously and strategically .
Many people in the community do this -- they choose something , either to follow the opinions of others , to start out on their own , to become part of some project -- based on conscious decisions that include their imagination -- what they think will happen with projects , how they personally feel invested or alienated from a project , how they imagine a design fitting into their unknown future developments .
Not all programmers do this -- but almost all the ones that matter do .
Developer - users -- people who just download packages and use them in their isolated environments -- have very little effect on the code or community .
Imaginative programmers are what make things happen , and that 's who I 'm trying to appeal to with most of what I write on this blog , because sometimes code alone is n't enough to spark someone 's imagination .
And sometimes I do n't have code to hawk anyway ;)
In conclusion , because I do n't think I 've made my point entirely clear yet : on one level you can look at the community and its decisions as an organic process of evolution .
And seeing that you can think that conscious decisions and strategies do n't matter , that standards can't mean much , that the best man will always win in time .
But the other side is that the community is made up entirely of individuals -- it seems organic because there are no authoritative institutions , no authoritative decisions outside of what an individual chooses for him or herself .
But individuals make decisions for very conscious and personal reasons , and though it 's a different process to appeal to a community of many individuals , it 's still worth doing .

" Are you all so eager to have legions of script kiddies using Python , leaving you with huge messes to clean up ? "

A regressive attitude will not make the problem go away .

Hand - waving is an attempt to gloss over the difficulties of solving a particular problem .
My whole point is that I do n't think there is any problem at all , much less some dire problem that threatens the future of all Pythonistas everywhere .
You can engage in further ad - hominem attacks , but that is hardly productive either , and you seem to care about being productive .

I have to agree .
I have been through 3 generations of web application development .
Circa 1996 1st used Delphi to do CGI programming on O'Reilly Website webserver (! ) .
2nd Circa 2000 Programmed Java servlets on Sun Javawebserver running on Windows NT interacting with with Informix on HP - UX .
3rd 2003 to now PHP on linux / apache with Postgresql .
Staying there until something better ...
PHP is pretty ragged sometimes but I have found that people can become productive very quickly , there are lots of good examples ( or at least examples ) .
I am leery of the move to " all objects " php5 .
I have never seen anything that was just impossible in PHP , and usually there is a pre-existing built in function to use , or a PEAR class that can be installed .
I like python a lot and have written extensively in it , doing large Postgresql database load operations in large scale conversions from legacy systems .
At one point I was convinced that it would be worth it to do web programming in python but everything just seems to be so immature , and the python web developer base is tiny .
Zope seems ridiculously complex , though it seems to be the poster child for " big time " python success .
And it is slow , admit it .
And given there are probably dozens of good CMS 's in PHP ( mediawiki , mambo , drupal , etc ) why not skip it .
Just because it's " famous in Europe ? " ( like Slim Whitman ? ) .
I think Zope has enough momentum to actually make a buck as a consultant if you get Zope expertise but that is just a guess .
Twisted Matrix seems interesting but practical examples / tutorials of significant production non -toy web apps ( e- commerce , CMS , business system / database apps etc. ) seem missing .
" It does everything and does it fast " , " Write an http server in 2 lines ! " etc sounds great but where are the real life examples ?
I agree with earlier comment that requiring Apache 2 to run latest mod_python is a drag for PHP users .
I tried it but compared to ease of development in apache anything and PHP why bother .
I would not worry that much about Rails .
Like the twisted matrix crowd there is the tone of " look everything is easy ! , a site built in 100 lines of code " and again , where are the real life , in use applications that I can download and look at and which do n't look like a high school CS term project .
Anyhow , IMYO , too late for python to make a significant impact for web development , the python news always seems to be dominated by arcane and obscure discussions ( i.e decorators ) .
IronPython may be the next big deal , but the alliance with the dark forces of Microsoft and .
Net will alienate many .
My two cents ...
I also totaly agree .
I ended up doing a big web project in php because it was too hard to do in zope ( though we tried for 3 months ) and mod_python was to difficult too use compared to php .
I really wish that I had done it in python now , but , its too late for that .
Now I have this giant beast , albeit written well , its written in a crappy language .
If python were convenient to use on the web it would be a power house .
I do n't want to start flaming , but after using php for a few years I can confidently say its a mess , a real scritping language .
I could almost write better scripts in bash ;) -- not really .
I 'm starting a new project and looking at zope3 , but I really wish python was as clean an easy as php , and had a tool - kit as smart as rails .
Alas there is still hope !
Let us unite and crush the competition , lest we be the beta-max of the web .
Superior , but eventualy useless .
A quick search for " webware " in the comments came up with nothing .
I 'm a web developer with a background in cold fusion .
I 've been using python to code background tasks like importing and exporting data and just about anything I can think of .
I recently I started playing with webware because I want to see what python can do on the web .
What is everyone 's comments on webware ?
Is it worth it 's weight ?
From the looks of it , a mixture of SQLObjects , Cheetah and Webware would allow you to build a damn good / flexible webapp in a couple hours .
For those who do n't know of webware , http://www.webwareforpython.org/ , it 's an application server in python that resembles concepts in J2EE .
Servlets , PSP , all that jazz .
It 's open source too .
Gotta love that .
Thanks .
i'm having success with webware , but it too is missing what was identified elsewhere in this article ( wrt python web frameworks in general ) : complete , coherent documentation and start - to - finish examples that clearly demonstrate all the major elements of webware / cheetah / etc working together to create a typical web app .
# mike also forgot to mention that webware 's release schedule is agonizing .
some people are n't comfortable living out of version control for their production code .
# mike I personally see WSGIKit as the future of Webware , and it provides a cleaned - up Webware experience right now .
I like Webware , but it has some issues related to testability and coupling ; WSGIKit started out as an effort to resolve those problems ( though I think it has become more than that ) .

# aticle
Ian , I completely agree with your analysis .
I am not a developper , rather a ' power user ' .
My first goal is to get things done quickly and cleanly .
I often use python for different purposes and I have tried ( at the tutorial level ) most of available python web frameworks .
I think we need a kind of easyPHP all - in - one package ( including python and a db ) with a simple demo application that you can immediately fire and which acts as the first step by step tutorial .
I am not enough skilled to launch a new collaborative project , but I will love to participate to one like this if some python expert would accept to start and pilot the project .
I think python community should try to leverage the huge base of good - but - not - experts programmers available among its members to participate to projects like this .
This probably leads to invent a new kind of collaboration , simpler to start with for newcomers .
How to work with 20 - 30 good programmers who can provide a few hours of work per week , instead of 4 - 5 experts much more involved .
If Python community would manage to invent this new collaborative method , involving a lot of good pragmatic developers ( uninterested in overdesigning ) , I am convinced that the new Python - for - web package would not need more than a few months to emerge .
Am I a poor lonesome - good - enough - but - not - expert python programmer ?
If not , write down a line on this blog , and perhaps some Python guru / leader will think it 's a pity not to use such a treasure of pragmatic and available task - force .
I think we need a kind of easyPHP all - in - one package ( including python and a db ) with a simple demo application that you can immediately fire and which acts as the first step by step tutorial .
That sounds a lot like Karrigell .
# Tim Lesher
Simplicity is the key .
Make testing changes as quick as possible .
So far my python web development has been done with the cgi module , zope , plone , twisted , simplehttpserver , mod_python , and now lighttpd + wsgi .
So like a lot of people I have tried all sorts of things .
I also use php , and a little java on some projects ( not ones I have started ) .
Here is my brain dump of where I am at , and what I 'm doing with python web dev stuff .
So far I think plone + zope is the most advanced , and popular of all the python web development frameworks at the moment .
It is really simple to install and get a site up .
It is simple in some respects , if all you want is in the default plone site .
However making modifications to it requires a lot of learning .
It has sooo many users at the moment compared to other frameworks , that it will eventually have enough modifications available to do many common web tasks .
Also getting good performance out of plone is hard .
I like the subway effort .
That 's a really good idea , and I wish them luck .
Cheetah + SQLObject + WSCGI are pretty good building blocks , and are some of the things I 'm using on my latest python web project .
I want to see how they do automatic reloading of templates .
Simple .
Five lines or less to do hello world .
Simple .
Twenty lines or less to do a CRUD application .
Scalable .
Should be able to be moved to run on multiple servers easily .
Default config should handle lots of users .
Can any python framework get ' hello world ' done in five lines or less of explanation ?
What about a CRUD app in less than 20 lines of explanation ?
Archetypes is probably the only one I can think of that can do a CRUD one quickly , and simply .
Here is a less than five line php hello world explanation .
It will work on most webservers around , so no need to describe how to install php .
Not describing how to install php makes the explanation shorter than a python one would be .
open a new file in notepad / vi. write into it this text : <? php echo ' hello world ' ; php ? > save file as index. php upload to your webserver .
OR for unix shell users : echo " <? echo ' hello world ' ; ? > " > index.php
That is simple .
Doing a CRUD application with the basic php libraries is quite hard .
There are many more frameworks in php than there is in python .
I really like WSGI , and I will be using that for my new stuff .
With wide spread WSCGI support there should be able to run those types of applications more easily without having to do complicated install instructions .
It should make using these various python frameworks easier .
Luckily I do n't have too much python code to convert on my latest project .
My latest project is based on these things ( and others ) .
Cheetah for templates .
can be made to work nicely with html editors .
nvu , and dreamweaver with the added <!--# stuff around cheetah stuff .
I made a basic inheritence system for templates on the file system .
It checks to see if there is a template for each content types insert , update , and list things .
Otherwise it uses the

Mr Janabi's identity had not been kept secret
Sadoun Nasouaf al - Janabi , who was seized by gunmen at his office in the Iraqi capital on Thursday evening , had been shot in the head .
The killing has fuelled claims that it will be impossible for the former Iraqi leader to get a fair trial .
Mr Janabi was acting for one of Saddam Hussein 's co-defendants , Awad Hamed al - Bandar , a former top judge .
The lawyer 's body was found outside the city 's Firdous mosque .
The Iraqi government condemned the killing .
' No witness protection '
Badie Izzat Aref , lawyer for former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz , who will also face trial , said : " If they can't protect lawyers , how are they going to defend their clients , and how will witnesses dare to come before the tribunals ? "
Saddam Hussein's chief defence strategist , Abdel Haq Alani , an Iraqi lawyer based in Britain , told the BBC : " This incident has proved is what we 've been all along saying , that there could be no fair trial in Iraq at this time , there could never be a fair and just trial simply because there 's no authority .
" Can anybody imagine that a witness is going to step forward and appear for the defence ?
If the defence cannot present its witnesses and guarantee safety for them , what kind of a trial is this going to be ?
" If lawyers are getting eliminated , executed ... how am I going to convince an international lawyer to appear in Iraq in a court and give legal advice on issues of international law of which the Iraqis know very little , including the judges ? "
And Miranda Sissons , a senior associate with the International Center for Transitional Justice , told Reuters news agency : " We and other rights groups have long had concerns about an effective witness protection programme for this trial .
" This murder highlights the lack of attention the court is paying to the defence and the defence 's offices , which has implications for the equality of the trial . "
Anonymous
There was tight security at the court as the trial of Saddam Hussein and his seven co-defendants opened on Wednesday .
Four of the five judges and most of the prosecution lawyers have remained anonymous for safety reasons .
The names of the chief judge and the top prosecutor were the only ones revealed .
But the defence team 's identities were not kept secret , and Saddam Hussein 's top lawyer , Khalil Dulaimi , said many had been threatened .
The government has now offered protection to any defence lawyer who wants it .
Mr Bandar is one of six Baath party officials being tried along with Saddam Hussein over the killing of Shia Muslim villagers in the town of Dujail north of Baghdad in 1982 , following an attempt on the then president 's life .
The trial has been adjourned until next month but will hear testimony at the weekend from an ill witness .
Wadah Ismail al - Sheik , who was a top intelligence official under Saddam Hussein , will testify from his hospital bed on Sunday .
He has cancer .

A recent comment by augustss made me realise that I mentally classify mathematics into two different kinds .
I wonder if other mathematicians do the same - so here 's your chance to post a comment saying whether or not you agree .
It seems to me that mathematical theorems are either structural theorems or content .
By structural I mean that they set up some machinery and show that the machinery does what we expected it to do , and content refers to ' surprising ' facts about the mathematical universe .
( I think ' structural ' is a good choice of word here .
' Content ' does n't feel quite right but the best I could come up with . )
For example , think about a subject like algebraic topology .
We start by learning about point set topology .
We might define the product topology and then from that show that the projections from the product space to the original space are continuous .
These are structural results .
They simply tell us that we 've defined the product topology in the right way , and the reason why they are the right way is that someone wanted to do topology on the cartesian product of sets and thought hard until they found a way to make this work .
They ( probably ) did n't make a discovery like - hey , there 's this amazing topology on the cartesian product that gives continuous projections .
They set out to make the product topology in order to prove other stuff , like the way a silversmith or a computer scientist might make tools for themselves for a particular application .
On the other hand , people later started discovering bizarre properties of homotopy groups of spheres .
Consider the Hopf fibration which is a beautiful way of building the 3 - sphere out of 1 - spheres .
This was a genuine discovery .
It 's not just a trivial consequence of the topological machinery but a new result that was n't plugged in from the beginning .
That 's what I mean by content .
You invent mathematical machinery , prove structural theorems about it which shows that it does what you want , and then you start discovering interesting results with the machinery .
Most branches of mathematics have a mixture of both types of result .
In group theory you might prove structural results like the isomorphism theorems which really just show that quotients are what you think they should be .
And then you start discovering content like the fact that Ais simple for n≥5 .
Structural theorems tend to be more universal and feel more ' invented ' .
Content theorems are more specific and feel more ' discovered ' .
And I 'm really talking about a spectrum rather than a binary classification .
Most branches of mathematics have a mixture of the two types of theorem .
Typically the structure theorems are used as a tool to discover content .
In some sense the content is the end and the structure is the means .
But category theory seems different in this regard - it seems to be mainly about structure .
Every time I read category theory I see ever more ingenious and abstract tools but I do n't really see what I think of as content .
What 's hard in category theory is getting your head around the definitions and often the theorems are trivial consequences of these .
For example consider the Yoneda lemma as described here .
This is a pretty challenging result for beginning category theorists .
And yet these notes say : " once you have thoroughly understood the statement , you should find the proof straightforward " .
This exactly fits with what I 'm getting at : the theorem is an immediate consequence of the definitions and the proof essentially shows that the machinery does what you 'd expect it to do .
Computer science ( at least the more formal parts ) is a lot like structural mathemtics .
It 's about inventing machinery ( lambdas , coalgebras , state machines ) and then proving that machinery does what you expect ( diamond property of reductions in lambda calculus etc. ) .
If we compare with group theory the differences become apparent .
A mathematician might consider groups in general ( general machinery ) , specialisations of groups such as rings and fields ( more machinery ) and then specific groups like the Monster or the alternating groups ( content ) .
A computer scientist will look at things like untyped lambda calculus , untyped lambda calculus , lambda calculus with this or that extension , but they tend not to look at specific instances in the way that there are specific groups .
Very rarely there is a content theorem that follows from the structural theorems about the tools of computer science .
Here 's one .
7 binary trees are isomorphic to one .
This is a really neat bit of content .
This is n't a direct consequence of the definition of trees .
When trees were invented nobody thought " what structure can I invent that captures the notion that 7 of them is isomorphic to just one ? " .
This is a discovery , a new result that was n't plugged in from the beginning .
I guess there is another way to view category theory .
As it is the mathematics of structure then in a sense the structure of other branches of mathematics is the content of category theory .
It 's probably fair to say that one person 's content may be another person 's content .
But it 's not unusual for a lecturer to say of their course " the first few weeks will be spent setting up the definitions and machinery and then we 'll get onto the real content ...
" And now I can reply to augustss .
" Real mathematics " is mathematics where from time to time you prove content .
And the reason why I said " it 's time to get back to some real mathematics " is that much as I 've been enjoying computer science lately , I need to see some non-structural content from time to time .

My favorite NP - complete problem
At last year 's open source conference , I gave a talk about fundamental problems of computer science .
I talked about undecidable problems and NP - complete problems , and some other stuff .
It was only a 45 - minute talk , but I worked hard to make it as accessible as I could .
For the NP - completeness section , I discussed the knapsack problem .
In this problem , you have a bunch of items you can take on a trip , each of which has a value and a size .
Your luggage is of limited size , so the total size of the items you take on the trip must not exceed this limit .
Subject to this constraint , you want to take the items whose total value is as large as possible .
( Actually , in the talk , I used the decision problem version of this , rather than the optimization problem version , to avoid sticky questions from the know - it - alls in the audience . )
Knapsack is a pretty good example problem .
It 's simple , easy to understand , and reasonably easy to see why it might be interesting .
But after I gave the talk , I thought of a much better example .
I deeply regret that I did n't come up with it in time to put it in the talk .
Fortunately , I now have a blog .
Read on ; here 's the coolest NP - complete problem ever .
Each episode of Sesame Street now ends with a fifteen - minute segment called Elmo's World , featuring Elmo , a small red monster .
Elmo is extremely popular , and the segments have been released on videotape and DVD .
Each of these segments has a topic of interest to toddlers , such as : Babies Dancing Food Bananas Dogs Games Baths Drawing Hair Bicycles Ears Hands Birds Exercise Mail Birthdays Families Music Books Farms Plants Bugs Feet Singing Cats Firefighters Water ( These are all real examples . )
When the segments are released on video , they are bundled in groups of three .
Usually , the three segments will have a common theme .
For example , the video Wake Up With Elmo ! ( left ) gathers together the three segments about " sleep " , " getting dressed " , and " tooth brushing " .
Another video ( right ) collects the segments about " food " , " water " , and " exercise " .
Your job is to plan the video releases .
Sesame Workshop gives you a list of which sets of three segments are considered to be thematically related .
Your job is to select items from this list that exhaust the available segments , without using any segment more than once .
Each segment might be part of several different thematically - related groups .
For example , the " dancing " segment could be released on a physical - activity - themed video , along with the " bicycle " and " exercise " segments , or it could be released on a party - themed video , along with the " birthday " and " games " segments .
If you choose to release the physical activity collection , you foreclose the possibility of releasing the party collection , and you will have to find something else to do with the " birthday " and " games " segments .
This problem is NP - complete .
The official computer science jargon name for it is exact cover by 3 - sets , or just X3C .
The Sesame Workshop people were not able to solve the problem .
One of the videos in the series is about flowers , bananas , and hair .

Google has offered a Chinese - language version of its search engine for years but users have been frustrated by government blocks on the site .
The company is setting up a new site - Google.cn - which it will censor itself to satisfy the authorities in Beijing .
Google argued it would be more damaging to pull out of China altogether .
While removing search results is inconsistent with Google 's mission , providing no information ... is more inconsistent with our mission
Google statement
Chinese results toe the line
Critics warn the new version could restrict access to thousands of sensitive terms and web sites .
Such topics are likely to include independence for Taiwan and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre .
The Chinese government keeps a tight rein on the internet and what users can access .
The BBC news site is inaccessible , while a search on Google.cn for the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement directs users to a string of condemnatory articles .
Google 's move in China comes less than a week after it resisted efforts by the US Department of Justice to make it disclose data on what people were searching for .
Google has lost ground to Beijing - based web search company Baidu
Google hopes its new address will make the search engine easier to use and quicker .
Its e-mail , chat room and blogging services will not be available because of concerns the government could demand users ' personal information .
Google said it planned to notify users when access had been restricted on certain search terms .
The company argues it can play a more useful role in China by participating than by boycotting it , despite the compromises involved .
" While removing search results is inconsistent with Google 's mission , providing no information ( or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information ) is more inconsistent with our mission , " a statement said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Google is a business , businesses tend to want to maximise profits

Julian Pain , internet spokesman for campaign group Reporters Without Borders , said Google 's decision to " collaborate " with the Chinese government was " a real shame " .
The number of internet search users in China is predicted to increase from about 100 million currently to 187 million in two years ' time .
A survey last August revealed Google was losing market share to Beijing - based rival Baidu.com .
Last year , Yahoo was accused of supplying data to China that was used as evidence to jail a Chinese journalist for 10 years .

You 're at your PC , reading a web page , and for some reason your hard drive light suddenly starts flashing like crazy .
Or perhaps you are n't using your computer at all - but yet you still hear the click - click - click of the hard disk doing something .
What is it causing it ?
Is it a virus ?
99 % of the time , so called " disk thrashing " is perfectly harmless .
In this article , we 'll explain what is probably accessing your hard drive , and how you can know for sure .
Likely causes of disk thrashing
The most likely culprits are anti-virus software , anti-spyware software , instant messenger programs ( IM ) , and Microsoft 's own indexing service .
Some IM software , such as Trillian or AOL Instant Messenger , may write system events to a cache file .
A system event may be that someone on your buddy list is logging on or logging off .
Your IM program takes note of this , and may write that to a file , or even play a sound .
If you have anti-virus or anti-spyware software installed , they are probably set to auto - protect ( and they should be set that way ) .
That means that they are constantly monitoring your system to make sure that there is no virus or spyware activity .
Especially if another program is making a small change ( like if the IM program is writing to the cache file ) , the anti-virus and anti-spyware programs will suddenly " wake - up " to check to make sure that the disk activity is n't the result of a virus .
Other programs that monitor your disk for changes are indexing utilities , like " Google Desktop " and Windows XP 's indexing service .
Whenever something is written to your hard drive , these programs also make note of the change so that your searches ( whether through Google Desktop or through the Search function in Windows ) are always up to date .
So , in essence , a small event ( like someone on your buddy list logging off ) may cause 4 or 5 other programs to also access the hard disk !
One easy fix is to disable the Windows XP indexing service .
Your searches ( when you click on Start , then Search ) make take longer as a result .
To turn it off , click the Start button and choose Run ...
In the pop -up box , type in services.msc
In the Services window , find the Indexing Service and double - click on it to see its Properties .
Change the Startup type to Manual .
Click the Stop button to stop the service from currently running , then hit OK and close the Services window .
Find out what is accessing your hard disk
If you want to find out specifically which programs are accessing your drive , SysInternals makes a great free utility called Filemon - download it here .
There 's no need to install Filemon - just unzip the files and double - click the filemon .
exe program to run it .
You should see a window that looks like this :
Each disk access is a different line on the screen , and it will automatically update as new accesses take place .
On my screen , you can see that a process called " Rtvscan.exe " accessed my disk - that process is Norton Antivirus .
Next , the Trillian instant messenger program accesses my disk , followed immediately by Google Desktop .
This program makes it very easy to see what processes are accessing your hard drive , and what folders the processes are looking at .
If you do n't know what a particular process is , the quickest way to find out is simply to enter the process name in Google .
For instance , if I Google " rtvscan.exe " , it will show me loads of web pages about Symantec 's Norton Anti-Virus .
If you do n't know what a particular process is , ask us in the Computer Help forum and we 'll be glad to find out .
If you 're convinced that spyware or a virus has taken over your PC , then please read our guide on getting rid of spyware and viruses .

In all these cases , what is really meant by “ performance ” is speed .
“ High performance ” is just a high - fallutin ’ way of saying “ fast . ”
But being fast is certainly not the only way in which a computer can be said to perform .
In fact , a quick look at the primary dictionary definition shows that it ’s a rather poor choice of word :
performance , n .
1. a .
The accomplishment or carrying out of something commanded or undertaken ; the doing of an action or operation .
— Oxford English Dictionary
I do n't see AS FAST AS POSSIBLE in there anywhere .
I suggest to you that there is something fundamentally misleading about using a general term such as “ performance ” to refer to a single specific factor such as speed .
Why does this matter ?
As long as we continue to abuse the word “ performance ” like this , it reinforces the ingrained idea that speed is everything .
That usage is a relic of the 1970s ; other concerns have been more important than speed for quite some time now .
Corrupting the word “ performance ” hampers our ability to talk about actual performance — as in , computers doing what they ’re supposed to do and doing it well .
Being dependable .
Operating smoothly and correctly .
Recovering from problems .
Not falling over suddenly .
In other contexts , that ’s what “ performance ” usually means .
When you go to see a musical , a “ good performance ” includes the whole experience — the acting , the singing , the music , the engagement of the audience .
When we ’re talking about cars , “ performance ” refers to reliability and control as well as speed .
If you hit the brakes and the car does n’t stop , that is poor performance .
So , here is my humble request of you .
Do n’t use the word “ performance ” when you are really talking about speed .
If you mean speed , say “ speed . ”
If you feel weird about using the word “ speed ” because it is a less important - sounding word than “ performance ” or because it sounds like less of an overarching design priority , that ’s because it is .
That ’s all the more reason to be candid about it .
Go ahead — take this little badge and pass it on .
And the next time you write a paper or an article about computers , please think twice before you write “ performance . ”
It ’s easier to break the habit than you might think .
Update : Here 's a PDF if you want to print it out or make other designs .
Another update :
It ’s a good thing most people do n’t apply the computer science definition of “ performance ” to sexual performance .
Phew !

It is 25 years since Citizens ' Band radio arrived on British shores in a big way .
But where has it gone ?
In 1981 Britain was in the grip of an illegal craze .
But it did n't involve sex , drugs or violence .
Instead , bedrooms and cars across the UK reverberated to the coded joys of CB radio .
With far - fetched sounding call signs for users , CB became a space for a community of users , admittedly mostly young and male , who wanted to talk and share music .
The craze , like so many before and after , was American in its origin .
Movies like Convoy , in which Kris Kristofferson plays Rubber Duck , a trucker with a grudge , and Smokey and the Bandit , with Burt Reynolds as the eponymous bootlegger , captivated a section of the British public .
In the beginning it was cars , kids were even using them on pushbikes , anything you could strap one to , motorbikes even
Alan Crumpton
Aka Al Capone
British lorry drivers were the pioneers of CB use , finding it useful to communicate between themselves about such things as the locations of speed traps and other road hazards , and to keep at bay the loneliness of the open road .
But the slang they used remained resolutely American .
" Breaker - breaker , you have smokey bear in your area , " roughly translated into English as " I 'm sorry for interrupting your conversation but members of the local constabulary are nearby " .
Only British place names found their way into the code .
Newspapers gleefully picked up on Noddy Town for London , Smokey Dragon for Cardiff , and industry specific monikers like Sugar Town for Bury St Edmunds and Salt City for Northwich .
Each local community of CB - ers might then conjure up more nicknames at a more detailed level .
Rapid rise
Jeff Briggs , who ran an electronics business , realised there was a gap in the market and filled it with an audiotape , Teach Yourself CB : An Englishman 's Guide .
" They used to take it very seriously , " he remembers .
The rapid rise of CB was a serious vexation to the authorities .
Questions were soon asked in Parliament about this fad that was disrupting emergency pagers and the public 's reception of ordinary radio and television .
But a mixture of the anti-authority feel of US CB and the illegality of the technology in the UK only added to its appeal .
CB SLANG Smokey / bear : Police Brush Your Teeth and Comb Your Hair : Watch out for speed trap Good buddy : Friend and fellow CB - er Ears : Antennae Eyeball : Face - to - face meeting Hammer : Accelerator Rig : CB set Flip flop : Return journey
Alan Crumpton , who in 1981 went under the call sign or " handle " Al Capone , and now runs Thunderpole , a CB retailer , said he had joined the craze while it was illegal .
" There was the thrill of something under the counter .
The reason the handles were used was because they did n't want anybody to know who they were .
Then again , it 's still fun now . "
By 1981 , there were an estimated 300,000 illegal users of CB .
John Gordon , call sign
The Spirit , was another early adopter , and remembers the radios rapidly becoming ubiquitous .
" In the beginning it was cars , kids were even using them on pushbikes , anything you could strap one to , motorbikes even . "
But Mr Gordon , who now runs an electronics business , had got in on the act so early that he was the only person in his area with a CB .
When he eventually persuaded a friend to get on board the radio revolution he had to phone him to tell him to switch on his CB when he wanted to talk .
Long decline
" In the early days kids were on it all night .
There was lots of bad language .
Now they 've got mobile phones .
There 's e-mail . "
CB was legalised in the autumn of 1981 - but not in a way CB - ers wanted .
The government picked a frequency at odds with the sets owned by the illegal fraternity .
It was seen as heavy - handedness from a country that up until recently demanded that many long - range amateur radio users take a Morse Code test .
The average London CB conversation can have as many gaps and uncomfortable pauses in it as that at an unsuccessful dinner party
The Times
1981
From a high of 300,000 licence holders in 1983 , and who knows how many operating illegally , there has been a year - on - year decline , with just 20,000 licensees remaining .
Ofcom is currently consulting on proposals to scrap licences .
Now if electronically - minded people want an " open channel " environment to chat they have endless chatrooms of every possible flavour .
For those wanting to meet each other in the ether there is MySpace , Facebook and countless dating websites .
In 1981 , Britain 's media expected CB usage to rocket into the stratosphere in much the same way .
And there were concerns about the content .
American feel
A columnist in the Times warned : " All in all the average London CB conversation can have as many gaps and uncomfortable pauses in it as that at an unsuccessful dinner party . "
The paper noted : " In practice the frequencies can overflow with trivia at best , obscenities at worst . "
But the " wrong " frequency issue helped stunt the growth of the phenomenon .
Users felt the British - specific equipment somehow lacked an American feel .
Burt Reynolds was the poster boy for the CB generation
" We were alienated from the rest of the world .
All the high street shops overstocked with CB .
There was going to be this huge demand .
It did n't happen , " notes Mr Crumpton .
Nevertheless , he maintains CB is " still alive and well " - the torch being carried by lorry drivers , off - road 4x4 enthusiasts and caravan clubs .
While handheld mobile phone use is now illegal in a car , CB is not .
And there is at least one area where the CB dealers might see growth .
Tiverton Age Concern is using CB radio to combat the feelings of loneliness and vulnerability felt by older people living alone , often in remote areas .
After the charity was left a legacy by a CB enthusiast , it issued 20 pensioners with sets .
For a generation where not all are comfortable with the internet , and with many finding mobile phones too expensive , the radios are a godsend .
For an hour every morning , they chat on the radio .
Some even have call signs and use slang like asking for an " eyeball " , a face - to - face meeting , says Mary Healey of Age Concern .
" One chap said ' I can listen to other people talking if I want join in I can but it means the world when you are on your own and have only got the cat for company ' . "
All those decades ago , my younger sister ( " Angel Eyes " ) met " Arthur Daley " on the CB radio ..
she went on it from under the duvet in her bedroom at night , all night and unbeknown to our parents .
Once the eight foot long aerial hit the ceiling lampshade and knocked out the electrics in the whole house !
I , as older sister thought the whole CB thing was incredibly naff !
This " Arthur Daley " lived two roads away in south London and it was love at first " eyeball " .. they got married some years later and now have two lovely little girls !
So it was n't just for truckers !

I have been on and off CB since the late 80s and I can say it has been a lot of fun .
There was a time when it was almost impossible to find a clear channel to talk on - not so these days !
We had endless fun on Saturday evenings playing a game of hide - and - seek in our cars using just the signal strength as a ¿finder¿ .
The person who found could then go and hide and the game would begin again .
Some of the home - bound home - base locals would often listen in to our silly banter as it made them feel part of the community .
One year , the local CBers were asked to chaperone the Biggleswade Carnival ; we had no trouble relaying messages around the whole town .
The local police gave up and used us for messaging as their radios had too many black - spots !
The current consultation from the government has a use - it - or - lose - it approach and we are being encouraged to switch to the CEPT band used in Europe ; ironically the very same frequencies used by the original American rigs , but still only FM .
We are not too happy with that idea as some EU countries do not regulate their radio users quite as well .
10 - 10 till we do it again ...
Gary " The Electron " Myers , Biggleswade , Bedfordshire , England
Never forget , these idiots used these illegal toys in the complete knowledge that they interfered with emergency radio frequencies causing deaths , aircraft landing equipment , etc and these criminals thought destroying radio controlled models was a " sport " via intentional interuption of the signals , and were menaces on the road ( like using a mobile ) .
Criminal Band radio was an accurate term .
Allan , Durham
CBs at the time were the best thing since sliced bread in an age where mobile phones were just a dream ( or a brick with a mortgage ) and the internet had n't even been thought of .
The ability to " talk " to multiple people in a chat room type environment was great and FREE !
As for foul or abusive language , the community policed this themselves and just refused to give abusers airtime ( or drove to their location and boosted transmission power to drown them out ) .
Fox Hunts with cars ( hide and seek ) were a weekend occurence .
One car hides and the others seek .
A general clue given to get you going then track them down using the SwR meter ( the closer you get the stronger the signal ) .
Catch you on the flip side !

Breaker One Nine -
You got your ears on good buddy ?
Anyone recall that East Kilbride near Glasgow was known as Polo Mint City ?
- because it has lots of roundabouts .
And a Skateboard was CB slang for a regular car .
So when asked : " Breaker One Nine - What 's your Twenty ? " ( ie Where are you ? ) - I 'd answer : " I 'm the red skateboard heading for Polo Mint City ... "
Ken Morton , Glasgow , UK
Quite agree Crazy Cat ,
Not just long distance drivers used it , my father had a cb radio hidden in a briefcase in his car !
The illegality of it added to the fun .
The whole family had handles and we used it to keep in touch .
It lost its frisson when it went legal !

In response to Ian Macbeth , Leeds , the toll bridge in Selby is now free .... so does this warrant the re-naming to " Freetown " ..?!!
Mark , " Paytown " , North Yorkshire
I was born in 1981 .
My Dad was constantly on the CB .
He was a newleywed , but paid more attention to the CB than his new family .
He met another woman , started sleeping with her .
It broke up my parents marriage and cost me my father .
He set up home with the other woman and had a family with her .
It 's much the same as the horror stories you hear about internet chatrooms nowadays !
Technology changes , people do n't !
Helen , Edinburgh
As an Army instructor in the late 1980s it was fun trying to eradicate ' CB - speak ' from trainee radio operators !
But only last Friday I went to a friend 's house and discovered he uses a CB set to keep in touch with his elderly dad down the road !
Megan , Cheshire UK
Well its still being used in Leicester and Leicester Control is still there with " Red Rust " and the gang ( Hi Rob ) .
A lot of people i meet dont even know that CB still exists .
It still has the music and swearing but its only like that on the calling channel .
CB lives on though so get those radios from the loft and get back on the air
Dave " Cubwolf " Smith , Leicester
I had an imported AM ' rig ' and a home made antennae .
Everytime I transmitted I blanked out every television set in a quarter mile radius !
I think that kit like mine was probably the reason it was illegal in the first place .

1 - 9 for a copy !
When at secondary school , as recent as 15 years ago , I persuaded my parents ( both original ' 80 's ' CB-ers ) to utilise the aerial still up that tree in the garden to give me my own CB .
At that time there were still several people at school with the same idea , using their parents equipment that had been lying unused for several years .
I met my now husband on the CB , and before mobile phones or SAT NAV , never went any distance in the car without plugging in the CB .
Essential if you got lost - always an obliging trucker to assist .
Sometimes tempted to plug back in to see if the stalwart enthusiasts are still waiting for a copy !
vicky , Moray , Scotland
CB was a really big part of my teenage years .
I met my now best friend on - air " Red October " .
Does anybody remeber the " Fox Hunt " .
We all had Minis ( Mine was the best ) and used to be up all through the night trying to find other cars .
Those were the days hiding in the middle of roundabouts !
Martyn " NightHawk " , London
" DX - ers " , ( long - distance CB enthusiasts ) , took the hobby as seriously as their licensed HAM counterparts .
I spent many pleasant evenings chatting on side - band to America , Jamaica , Brazil , even Australia .
OK , it was illegal , but the authorities did n't seem to mind .
The 30ft antenna towering over my house was fairly obvious !
" Kamikaze " , Maputo Mozambique
I 'm surprised that so few truckers use it now .
As someone who commutes down part of the accident - prone A14 ' Highway from Hell ' , I am amazed at lorries blithely passing the A428 exit and heading up towards a Huntingdon tailback , when a CB would have warned them to divert ....
Kit , Cambridge , UK
When we lived in a fishing town in Scotland my two sons had CB and their not too intelligent readheaded friend had the handle ' Red Herring ' and could n't understand why no one came back to him !
A friend of mine 's handle was ' Schoolboy ' so we could say Schoolboy do you copy ?
Alex Mitchell , Stockport , UK
In the earlie 80's I ran a small country hotel in East Yorkshire .
I found it quite amusing that young " CB'rs " would spend a couple of hours in the bar chatting to each other , then go to the car park , sit in their cars next to each other and talk to one another on their CB's .
As they say in Yorkshire " Thre 's nowt so queer as folk "
John Pheasant , Nottinghamshire
I used to use the CB a lot .
I spoke to guys with cool handles like ' The Outlaw ' , and ' Spiderman ' , it felt like I was part of something dangerous , a rebellion if you like .
We were subverting the Government and played by nobodys rules , not even our own .
Eventually I went along to a meeting and realised I was speaking with a group of 30 - something , basement dwellers who drove 50 CC scooters .
I sold my rig soon after , the magic was gone .
Greg , Wick , Scotland
The best part of it was the names for places .
My favourite was " Paytown " for Selby where there was a toll bridge .

I was very actively involved with legal CB in Leicester , with the very well known " Leicester Control " on ch23 .
This group of enthusiasts were famous for giving accurate directions to truckers in our area .
I also wrote a monthly column for a CB Radio magazine .
What killed CB was the internet and the availablility of mobile phones and computer - based communications .
It was fun whilst it lasted and many CBers went on to tke the RA exams .
But I never forgot Roger " Red Rust " , Jeff " Murgatroyd " , Sid " Sunray " and many , many others .
Yes the bucketmouths and music - players were a pain , but I made some very good friends .
Rob " Captain Jack " Davis , formerly Leicester , now Telford
It does bring back fond memories of hooning around Tamworth and surrounding villages on a pushbike with friends to arranged " eyeballs " with other " breakers " .
Often it seemed that a lot of my peers while on CB radio were about 20 + years older than me but most treated my curiousity with respect and even more information .
From CB radio and the contacts I made there I joined an organisation called Search & Rescue to assist members of the public , sporting events in the town etc - which eventually evolved to become a fully fledged British Red Cross Society members unit M16 .
So to Prinz Eugen , The Red Baron ( and Snoopy ) , Viking and all the others of M16 - those really were fun days of my youth !
John Somers , Chesham , Buckinghamshire
I was a student in Leeds around 1981 , trying to fly radio controlled gliders .
My legal RC equipment used the correct alloted frequency of 27 Mhz or so .
The illegal CB equipment used the same .
This ' CB interference ' was not appreciated by my RC glider .
So , to gain some revenge back at my digs in Leeds I would wait in the evening until the local CB 'ers came on the air by listening in with my ' world bands ' capable radio / cassette and then turn on my radio contol transmitter and proceed to cause interference on their goings on .
I know it worked because the incredulous voices would complain of the number ' d B they were pulling ' dropping as I twiddled the control on my RC transmitter .

Fond cb years remembered well , sitting in your car on the highest local hill trying to call out to others on hills across the country and if you were lucky recieving copies from abroad as well , great fun in its hey day but nothing like it was .
Still got mine , gathering dust in some cupboard , you never know one day it might see some copies again .

In 1981 I met my first boyfriend using my dads CB .
Sitting in the car on the front drive I opened up a whole new world and a whole new group of friends , as a teenager who was bullied badly at school it was heaven to talk to people who did n't have a clue who I was or what I looked like ( or even where I was ) .
Now my teenage daughter is on MSN night after night and we are endlessly warned about the dangers , in reality its no different to the CB , use it safely and its not a danger ...
I soon left home and the fun of my dad 's CB set , however I wont ever forget cold winter nights sitting in his car chatting away feeling like any teenager anywhere , as if the world were at my feet .

" Illegal for no good reason " and " harmless " ?
Not really .
The reason ' legal ' CB was introduced , using FM ( a different mode , on a very slightly different frequency ) , was that FM transmissions cause a lot less interference than AM ( as in illegal CB ) .
It 's as simple as that .
Unfortunately , the illegal users did n't grasp the problems that they could have been causing to legitimate , and probably a lot more important , users of the radio spectrum .
Rob , Newcastle
The UK legal sets have restricted power and operate on FM , which reduces the transmission range .
Due to the way sunspot activity affects us the early CBers could often talk to people in the States .
I know people who were into CB in the early days who subsequently passed the exams to become Radio Amateurs so they could get back to talking to people on the other side of the world .

Brilliant !
I was " on the rig " for about 10 years - I had a severe stammer and it was my way of talking with people I 'd ( probably ) never meet .
As it happened , I met a girlfriend on there , and we had a great time .
It was full of friendly people and I made many friends .
The only downside was dismantling the 30ft antenna in my garden when a thunderstorm approached !
Edward Byard , Oxford
I remember using CB 's in the early 90s and by then it was becoming a joke - the sets were available for peanuts so many people would buy them and then mess around ' on - air ' .
It just became a noisy mess where you could n't hold a real conversation without someone butting in and making silly comments .
It was a great idea but spoiled by the same people who now cause trouble on on - line chatrooms .
Technology changes - people dont ...
Craig , Perth
All I remember is girls coming on air and dropping heavy hints their parents were out and why do n't you pop round to say hi .
The rest of the evening consisted of a bunch of teens champing at the bit in a Vauxhall Viva outside some house realising you 'd been had yet again and there were no girls , not there anyway .
Iain , UK
It 's still going strong , especially with 4x4 owners .
The license is a complete waste of money as it has n't gotten rid of the foul language or the music on channel 19 , but it 's getting better .
You'd be surprised how many people are still using it , and it 's superb on the motorway !
David Jacobs , Hinckley
As a young kid living in rural Kent in the early 80s there was n't much to do of an evening .
My memory of CB was sitting on Channel 14 - reserved for meeting other users , endlessly calling " one - four for a copy " and hoping someone would start chatting to me .
In those days , people did n't worry so much about children talking to complete strangers over the airwaves like they do now about internet chat rooms !
Tom " Lard " , Chelmsford
When off roading with others , CBs the best free all day conference call you can get and there¿s no limit to the number of participants .
You don¿t get that with mobiles .
David Edwards , Chester
It 's still a great way to communicate between vehicles travelling closely together such as groups of truckers , caravaners , any vehicle marque clubs and for off - road driving .
No cost for calling , no issues with network coverage and one person can instantly communicate to everyone else in the group .
I got into CB in the early days but it 's better now because the airwaves are less cluttered and your less likely to get some idiot interupting you !
Chris , Nr Faversham , United Kingdon
My local Mini club uses CBs to make sure we all keep in touch , how sad do we sound ?
We often travel a long distance to shows and rallies and it's nice to make sure we are all headed in the right direction should we get split up in traffic .
Believe me - this is an absolute god send when going through the middle of London .
Philippa " Fluffy " Kruman , Cambridgeshire
It was through the interest of repairing CB and as a spin off two - way radios that I arived in my profession of communication engineering .
Today I have work across Africa .
That 's a big 10 - 4 good buddy ... 10 - 10 till we do it again ... we gone ...
John " Septic Knuckles " Buckham , Lusaka , Zambia
Please dont perpetuate the old myth that CB 's were responsible for interference on radios , TV's , hifi's etc - they were not in the majority of cases .
The electronic equipment at the time had unsophisticated ' front ends ' which poorly discriminated between radio and audio signals , hence it was the receivers fault .
Yellow Horse , whitehaven , cumbria
As a 14 year old boy there was only one real reason for CB - girls .
CB opened up a whole new way of finding girls and we certainly made the most of it !

My first introduction to CB was at a training session for new hunt saboteurs when a hand - held unit was passed around and experimented with .
They were a godsend for co-ordinating large numbers of ' sabs ' at a single hunt and all the sab vans and Landrovers could be seen with the 5 - foot aeriels .
Of course the hunts soon worked this out and would buy their own units to jam us out .
Everythings switched to mobile phones now .
Roger , Derby
I was a member of a CB club when I was about 12 - I did n't think it was illegal as a ) I only had 2 channels b) I could never get a signal or anyone to talk to and c ) all the cool dudes had a car to put their radio in - I only had my Grifter although it was tooled up with American emergency sirens - nice .

Breaker 1 - 4 for a copy ?
CB radio at its time was a fun thing to do .
I personally met some great friends and the fun of ' catching the skip ' and talking to CB users in other countries was just amazing .
Things move on and so does technology - its in the process of being replaced by VOIP and wireless openzones , but I feel there is always a need for a general public frequency band - in what form though , who knows .
Nigel Underwood , Bristol , UK
I was a CB - er for a few years in the early 80s and enjoyed it enormously .
My first rig was second hand and I used to have it in my bedroom with a ' mag mount ' attached to the radiator !
I then had a 50 - 50 pole out the window , but I used to take it in when the wind got up .
I briefly went back on air in the early 90s to avoid the road jams , but it was not the same .
Good days - ' What 's yer 20 ? ' ' I 'm on yer back door good buddy . '
Looking back I must have sounded an idiot !
Mike " Hunchback " Wilks , Ruardean , Glos
Being a " radio ham " ( and taken the Morse test ) on air officially , we had our own share of idiots who transferred to CB to be " rebelious " .
Mobiles and text are cheaper , and with Internet phones , will return to the few as before who experiment and who - ironically push forward communications as we now know it .
Graham , Northampton
Half the fun of CB was because it was illegal - and illegal for no good reason .
It was a harmless and fun way to cock a snook at authority .
10 - 10 ' til we do it again , good buddies .
Mark " Crazy Cat " Esdale , Bridge , Canterbury
In my experience the only use that people made of their CB sets was talking about their CB sets to other owners !!
I tried to get the idea going of a voluntary community info service .
Where people with special knowledge on a subject would spend a few hours on air offering advice about local directions , medical advice , DIY help , cooking tips , fixing TVs or whatever .
It might have taken off but the killjoys would have swamped it with endless music or noises and ended it pretty quick .
Nigel Andrews , Worthing , United Kingdom
I remember the CB craze .
Only a few ( richer ) kids in our school ever got involved , as the cost was enormous .
A large antena was needed and the cost of the equipment was a lot ( in those days ) for people counting out their pocket money .
A few boffs would venture to Tandy 's and buy stuff but it was never as big a craze as people said it was with the young - more with 20 + age group - and they were working people who were just a bit sad and imagined they were trucking an 18 wheeler .
Come in rubber duck !
Very much like a Sinclair C5 - rare as chickens teeth

Talk about government control !
People find a way of making the world smaller and benefitting all that use it and just because the government cannot tax or control it they make it illegal .

I asked an American friend of mine what happened to CB ?
Apparently its alive and well and living in the USA .
This article is the first I have heard about CB in the UK for years .
Anthony , Cardiff
Oddly enough yesterday I was driving down I65 , Chicago to Indianopolis , and stopped off at a coffee shop - which had a large CB section - rigs , whips , mikes , etc .
It seems CB never went away for the US trucker community !

I used to take my C.B. set away to sea with me in the early 1980s .
For a 4 watt set the reception and transmission at certain times of the day was out of this world once away from the UK .
The best " copy " was with the Island of Guernsey and a guy sat in his " roller skate " on Brighton sea front while I was off the coast of Ghana , west Africa .
a distance of some 4000 miles !
The UK legal sets were only supposed to have a range of 12 - 15 miles .

" It was seen as heavy - handedness from a country that up until recently demanded that many long - range amateur radio users take a Morse Code test . " .
Until recently it was n't ' heavy - handedness ' by the British , it was an intenational requirement that radio amateurs demonstrated their competence in morse code .
That has now been removed .
Britain was the first to change its licence , although many countries retain morse code as a requirement for short - wave transmissions by amateurs .
Paul , Ayia Napa , Cyprus
CB was intended to be a local community facility .
The equipment was low powered and antennas inefficiently short .
Unless you lived a a remote area of the country it was a disaster from the start .
A basic setup could transmit and receive for many miles and in or near cities the nutcases took over and filled the airwaves with abuse rendering it useless for its original intention .
It seems to have been left to lorry drivers and taxi firms now .
Many dedicated CB -ers went on Amateur Radio courses and took up that hobby .
However with all types of technology based hobbys of the 60's 70's 80's they have succumbed to the computer and mobile communications .
Many young amateurs and " proper " C.B'ers went on to be trained and employed in Communications or Technology based careers .
Mike , Hull
It became increasingly annoying towards the mid/late eighties to have someone use it as a Radio Station !
I remember one Sunday morning whilst trying to chat to a freind , all 40 channels where being used and over half where complete morons !
blocking channels with music .
one was sending out just bleeps and squeals ... At least these days we are only subjected to those who seem to have a passion for it .
You listen , you join in .... you switch off !
easy !
Kathy , Cambridge
We used CB ( FM ) in Zambia in the 80's as communication tools for anti-poaching operations , for free communications and even the Neighbourhood Watch base and operations vehicles used them .
Fun to use , but almost valueless in highly built up areas where they require line of sight ( unless the weather was ' with you ' ) .
Great fun for a few years , I even used them as late as 1998 at my own safari camp .

Microsoft has delayed the release of Windows Vista by up to eight weeks - and become the Grinch that stole the PC industry 's Christmas .
Vista , the next version of Windows , will still be delivered to corporate users this year .
But , as the company put it in a masterfully spun press release last week , after consulting with PC manufacturers and retailers , " broad consumer availability " will be delayed until January 2007 .
In other words , too late for PC manufacturers to put on the machines that will be in shops at the biggest selling time for consumer PCs .
Possibly more significant , two days after the announcement of the delay to Microsoft 's flagship product , the company announced a reorganisation : the Windows division is being broken into eight units , with the next version , code - named Vienna , coming under the charge of Steve Sinofsky , the 40 - year - old senior vice president who was in charge of Office , Microsoft 's biggest money - spinner .
Sinofsky , a 16 - year veteran who joined the company as a software engineer , was described by Microsoft Watch author Mary Jo Foley as having " the reputation of a strict , schedule - bound manager who keeps the trains running on time " .
That phrase , to European ears at least , might seem a backhanded compliment both to him and to Jim Allchin , who is in charge of the Vista effort but ( as was already known ) will retire when it is delivered .
Security delays
Still , the Vista train is late - arguably by three years .
It was delayed after Windows XP , released in 2001 , came under attack from worms and viruses : Microsoft took 18 months off , beginning in 2002 , to re-educate its programmers in trustworthy computing , and to create what amounted to a new , more secure version of the code .
This shipped in the summer of 2004 as XP Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) .
In 2004 , there was what Microsoft staff call " the reset , " when Allchin decided to abandon all work in progress based on the Microsoft .
net 2.0 programming framework , and start from scratch using the ( successful ) Windows 2003 Server code base .
Pop , that 's three years gone , though members of the Windows group get annoyed by suggestions they have n't shipped anything since 2001 .
Brad Goldberg , a general manager on Windows , pointed out to the New York Times that , as well as SP2 , Microsoft has released two versions of the Windows Tablet PC software for pen-based notebooks , and four versions of Windows Media Center .
Those are areas where Microsoft is still ahead of the market .
Reorganisations are common at Microsoft , but this is the second in seven months .
It follows a company - wide one last September which created three divisions - platform products and services , business , and entertainment and devices .
Two questions arise :
Is the delay dramatic news for Microsoft and its partners ?
And are there deeper troubles in the company and is this only a symptom ?
While the delay has made headlines ( some of them wrong : it is unthinkable 60 % of Vista 's code would be rewritten so close to release ; and Microsoft has firmly denied any Xbox programmers are being put on the Vista team ) , industry analysts mostly think it will not have a great effect on annual revenues .
Paul Jackson , a principal analyst at Forrester Research , says : " It 's a bit embarrassing , and the investors wo n't like it , but the long - term effects are likely to be minimal . "
High hopes dashed
However , it will push back revenues for Microsoft , says Joe Wilcox at Jupiter Research 's Microsoft Monitor : " While Microsoft says Windows Vista will be available [ in 2006 ] to businesses through volume licensing , the company 's own financials show only a small percentage of customers purchase that way .
About 85 % of Windows revenue came from OEM sales during Microsoft 's 2006 fiscal second quarter .
Most businesses buy Windows on new PCs and these wo n't be coming until 2007 . "
However , Brian Gammage , a research vice president at Gartner , is less sanguine about the impact on the retail market .
He says : " There 's a desire to find some new thing to sell , and everybody had pinned their high hopes on Christmas 2006 .
Vista would have been just in time for peak consumer demand . "
The fourth quarter , he says , accounts for about a third of annual PC sales in the UK .
Instead of appearing in the peak selling season , Vista will appear in January when consumers want bargains in the sales , adds Gammage .
" It 's a double hit , to be paid for by computer manufacturers and retailers , and component suppliers such as memory manufacturers .
It 's a losing scenario for all of them , " he says .
" I do n't think there 's a plausible way of wrapping this up as a benefit for the PC industry . "
David Weeks ,
Windows client marketing manager at Microsoft UK , is willing to have a go .
He points out that Microsoft has many different partners who can get to the market at different times .
" There are a number of partners that possibly could have made it into retail with Windows Vista , and some would n't , so there would not be the customer choice , " he says .
" We consulted with partners and major retailers worldwide , and they were supportive of us moving [ the launch ] to January , so that all partners would be able to sell Vista from day one . "
A split could have had a real impact on the two largest PC manufacturers , Dell and Hewlett - Packard .
Dell manufactures to order then supplies PCs direct , so it could load Vista quickly .
HP , however , builds most of its HP and Compaq - brand PCs in advance then sells them via retail channels , which takes longer .
This would give Dell a significant advantage in the Christmas market , and Microsoft 's US anti-trust controllers forbid it from favouring one supplier over another .
While both manufacturers declined to discuss the issues , they issued similar statements supporting Vista .
There might be anger in private , but the industry seems to be supporting the decision in public .
There is another effect besides the financial one .
Morale has been hit .
Within and without the company , from staff bloggers , manufacturers and shareholders , there have been calls for heads to roll - and that may be happening behind closed doors .
The Mini-Microsoft blog ( minimsft.blogspot.com ) , written by an anonymous staffer who thinks the company has grown fat and torpid , made the simple call : fire the leadership .
Mini-Microsoft has become a lightning - rod for disaffection within the company .
Managers and programmers gather there and leave comments , some supportive , some angry , but all with suggestions on how to improve the company .
But is the leadership listening ?
Asked last September whether he reads Mini-Microsoft , Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer replied : " I do not " , though he confirmed he knew of its existence .
He said internal data suggested an 85 % satisfaction rate among staff .
One wonders if Ballmer thinks the blog is worth reading now it wants senior managers fired .
It would also be interesting to know Bill Gates 's view .
He has always believed in giving bad news a conduit .
In his 1999 book Business@ The Speed of Thought , on effective business practice , he said : " Sometimes I think my most important job as a CEO is to listen for bad news .
If you do n't act on it , your people will eventually stop bringing bad news to your attention .
And that 's the beginning of the end . "
Either way , Microsoft 's culture is changing .
The September reshuffle put two sales and marketing people - Ballmer and Kevin Johnson , promoted to joint head of platform products and services - in charge of a company that used to be run by software guys , Gates and Allchin .
The blogger who writes Mini-Microsoft used that title because he believes the company needs to shed staff from its 63,500 headcount .
Microsoft 's challenge now is not to turn into the sort of slow , bureacratic company it tore apart - IBM .
But that may be happening .
" The constant these days is reorganisation , " one Microsoft UK executive said last week .
That 's reminiscent of what IBM 's employees used to say - that the company initials stood for " I 've Been Moved " .
And while Microsoft struggles with its internal identity , Google and a host of other online companies are throwing out new ideas quicker than ever .
Many of them flop , but some stick .
Is Writely a better way to produce an online collaborative document than Office 12 ?
It 's certainly a lot cheaper .
Is 37 Signals ' Basecamp a better project management system than Microsoft Project ?
Maybe not but if you 're a startup , you 'll have much more money left over if you use Basecamp .
Advantage , Apple
Apple Computer , 30 years old this week ( a year younger than Microsoft ) has already won the digital music crown with its iPod ; it could win quite a few extra customers for its computers this Christmas , since there will be no Microsoft marketing campaign to drown it out , and the only Windows machines on sale will have a five - year - old operating system .
But even when Vista arrives , there 's a problem .
" Basically , consumers are not clamouring at the doors of Redmond saying ' We need a new operating system ' , " observes Forrester 's Jackson .
And that may be part of the problem : even within Microsoft , nobody seems to have a snappy answer to the question : " Why is Vista better than XP ? "
As in , why lay out the cash ?
Mini-Microsoft saw a fellow employee asked that question at an internal conference .
" Not only could you tell her brain was momentarily frozen ( uhhh ) , you could feel the entire crowd hit a panicked brain freeze .
The lady then came up with an almost apologetic answer saying Vista is more stable , safer , and faster than XP . "
Not , he comments , the greatest reason for either splashing out on a new PC or going through the pain of an OS upgrade on your new machine .
The giant Microsoft is seeing its picnic being eaten by ants .
Some are tiny , some huge , but all chewing at some part of its revenue - generating structure - whether it 's Windows , or Office , or media .
It used to dominate in search ; if you mistyped a URL in Internet Explorer , you 'd end up on the MSN page .
These days , Google is the most popular starting point for searches online .
And the longer Vista is delayed , the more the ants carry away .

Dr. Randall Mills , a Harvard medic by training , is claiming to have built a prototype generator that can produce 1000 times more heat than normal fuels , according to a report in the Guardian newspaper .
The trick , he says , is the use of a new form of hydrogen - we can hear your collective eyebrows raising - which he calls the Hydrino .
This has a single electron orbiting the nucleus of the atom more closely than it does in normal hydrogen .
We 'll just pause while that sinks in .
Yes , he is suggesting that an electron can be more tightly bound to a nucleus than the ground state allowed by quantum theory .
According to Mills , creating a hydrino is a simple process .
Take some H 2 O and split off the hydrogen into H 2 molecules .
Next , split these into hydrogen atoms by passing them over a super - heated filament .
Add a catalyst , such as strontium ions or potassium atoms , and out pops the hydrino .
As the hydrogen ion collapses into a hydrino , energy is released .
We 're troubled by this .
Surely , if a lower energy level than the ground state exists , would n't electrons prefer to sit in it ?
What on earth is keeping all the electrons in hydrogen atoms and ions sufficiently excited that they stay is their theoretically less stable ' orbit ' in the ground state ?
We are not alone .
Not everyone is in a big hurry to abandon quantum mechanics .
Dr Roland Smith , Reader in Laser Physics at Imperial College , London is one of the sceptics .
" Quantum Mechanics ( QM ) is a robust and incredibly well tested piece of physics , " he told The Register .
" A vast number of our everyday devices including lasers and computers are based on its predictions and they work 'as expected from QM theory ' to incredibly high degrees of accuracy .
" In contrast , the experimental evidence for the existence of ' Hydrinos ' is very weak and has not stood up well to the acid test of scientific peer review and publication in mainstream literature . "
But despite the understandable mainstream resistance to the idea , Mills is quite happy to say that he is right and quantum mechanics must be wrong .
He told the Guardian that he 's done a lot of testing , and argues out that much of the theoretical work has been peer reviewed .
He says resistance to the idea is the result of people 's vested interests in the status quo .
Of course , some of you will have heard about this theory before .
Mills has been around a while , as has Blacklight Power , the company developing his research .
The company claims to have huge investment backing it , and even NASA has expressed an interest in the past .

Dr. Smith suggests anyone wanting to get a handle on the " entertaining history of the ' hydrino story ' and its various meetings with the sharp end of the scientific process " should check through the archives of sci.physics.fusion . ®
The entertainment industry and the EFF have been at each other for years , and the EFF has just launched the latest salvo in the war of words between the two groups .
It 's a list of " tough questions " to ask MPAA and RIAA reps , questions designed to force them to go on the record with unpopular opinions or explanations .
As the EFF puts it , " Asking hard questions is a way of ' keeping honest people honest ' and revealing when they 're actually being deceptive . "
What sort of things are on the list ?
Here 's a sampling .
The RIAA has sued over 20,000 music fans for file sharing .
Recently , an RIAA representative reportedly suggested that " students drop out of college or go to community college in order to be able to afford [ P2P lawsuit ] settlements . "
Do you stand by this advice ?
Is this really good advice for our children 's futures ?
Major entertainment companies have repeatedly brought lawsuits to block new technologies , including the VCR , Digital Audio Tape recorders , the first MP3 player , the ReplayTV PVR , and now P2P software .
Why is your industry so hostile to new technologies ?
The RIAA says that it does n't mind if I rip CDs to my personal computer and put them on my iPod .
Do I need your permission to do this or can I legally do it even if you object ?
The major movie studios have been enjoying some of their most profitable years in history over the past five years .
Can you cite to any specific studies that prove noncommercial file sharing among fans , as opposed to commercial DVD piracy , has hurt the studios ' bottom line in any significant way ?
In several lawsuits , the MPAA has repeatedly said that it 's illegal to make a back - up of a DVD that I purchased .
Why is this illegal ?
Is it ever legal for me to use software like DVD Shrink or Handbrake to rip a digital copy of a DVD I own onto a video iPod or my laptop ?
What if I want clips to use for a class report ?
Or if a teacher wants to include a clip in a PowerPoint slide ?
Is there anything illegal about copying TV shows I ?ve recorded off the air onto my video iPod ?
At bottom , the questions try raise one fundamental question :
Can the entertainment industry actually prove that backing up DVDs , engaging in non-commercial file - swapping , and recording from digital radio are a threat to the bottom line ?
Past studies have found that file - swapping , the music industry 's biggest concern , actually leads people to purchase more music and to spend more money .
If this is a problem , it 's the sort of problem most businesses would kill for .
Limited evidence suggests that DRM actually hurts sales of CDs and aggravates customers , especially when that DRM is a rootkit .
The list of questions is solid , and they 're well worth tossing out if you find yourself in a meeting with an entertainment industry rep .
It 's also an opportunity for the industry , should they care to take it .
How so ?
By gathering the strongest criticisms against the entertainment business into one high - profile list , the EFF has given the RIAA and MPAA an excellent chance to talk candidly about some thorny questions .
If the industry takes the opportunity and engages the EFF — really engages , as opposed to just labeling file - swappers " pirates " and ending the discussion — the conversation could be quite interesting .
Monkeys drink more alcohol when housed alone , and some like to end a long day in the lab with a boozy cocktail , according to a new analysis of alcohol consumption among members of a rhesus macaque social group .
These and other observed behaviors strongly correspond with human patterns of alcohol use .
Researchers attribute a predisposition to alcohol abuse in some monkeys and people to a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
In the study subjects , " blood alcohol levels often exceeded the .08 percent level , which is the legal limit for most states in the U.S. , " said Scott Chen , one of the study ’s authors and a researcher at the National Institutes of Health Animal Center in Maryland .
The study , recently published in the journal Methods , also found that booze affects monkeys much the same way it affects people .
" It was not unusual to see some of the monkeys stumble and fall , sway , and vomit , " Chen added .
" In a few of our heavy drinkers , they would drink until they fell asleep . "
For the initial experiment , 21 females gained access to an aspartame - sweetened ethanol concoction during a group " happy hour . "
Neck collars registered the amount of fluid consumed , and each monkey received a blood alcohol level test at the end of the period .
In a follow - up experiment , 10 monkeys were housed individually during the " happy hour . "
" The singly housed monkeys certainly drank more than the socially housed monkeys - at least two to three - fold more , " Chen told Discovery News .
" With the socially housed monkeys , there are a number of factors that can potentially compete with access to alcohol , such as social status or dominance ranking . "
Lower - ranked monkeys and males tended to drink more overall , but certain individuals consistently drank more than others , regardless of status or housing conditions .
" Similar to humans , rhesus macaques have individual differences in taste preference , stress levels , drug tolerance and genetic background that lead to differences in alcohol intake , " explained Chen .
In yet another study , the scientists gave a group of male monkeys 24 - hour access to the beverage dispensers .
According to the researchers , a spike in consumption immediately followed the facility ’s working hours .
" Like humans , monkeys are more likely to drink after stressful periods , such as soon after the daily 8 - 5 testing hours and after a long week of testing , " said Chen .
Judy Cameron , a professor and senior scientist at Oregon Health & Science University , told Discovery News , " The fact that different animals consume very different amounts of ethanol suggests that the neural systems in the brain that govern alcohol consumption differ in macaques as they do in humans . "
" Monkeys show highly individual responses in their choice to drink alcohol excessively , " agreed Kathleen Grant , a senior scientist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center .
" There are important parallels to human alcoholism . "
Since the monkeys appeared to go through withdrawal , Chen and his team hope to investigate drugs that may help prevent related symptoms , which often result in relapse in human alcoholics .

" The Name of Our Country is América " - Simón Bolívar
Three Days that
Shook the Media
Online Journalism 's Finest Hour
Exposed and Reversed a Coup
By Al Giordano
Special to The Narco News Bulletin
T he failed coup d'etat against Venezuela marks a turning point not just for authentic democracy in our América , but also for authentic journalism .
The remote - control attempt by Washington and commercial interests - including various media giants within and outside of Venezuela - to topple the government of President Hugo Chávez by force has only made him stronger .
In poetic defiance of all the official and commercial media declarations to the contrary , the " Bolivarian Revolution " has survived .
On the third day it rose again : The Chávez government emerges as more popular than ever , and Venezuelan democracy the strongest in América to withstand future authoritarian ambushes like the failed plot of these three fateful days .
One of the news agencies that had been so dishonest in recent days , Associated Press ( AP ) , reported today a fact that , only hours ago , its reports did not even consider as a possibility :
" Never before in modern times has an elected president been overthrown by military commanders , his successor inaugurated , and then the ousted leader returned to power on the wings of a popular uprising . "
The story also enters the history books as a watershed moment in the Authentic Journalism Renaissance .
AP , Reuters , the New York Times , and CNN , the worst offenders in the English - language media among many others , have had to radically adjust their coverage of the events in Venezuela precisely because online journalists worked overtime in recent days to break the information blockade and get the true facts to the international public .
The same media professionals who cringe at the term " authentic journalism " are the ones who , for the sake their own future credibility , ought to pay close attention to what has just occurred .
For there is going to be hell to pay over the professional misconduct by many of them in recent days .
Just as the Venezuelan majority - out - hollered , out - dollared , but not out - smarted - called the bluff of its nation 's spoiled oligarchy and reclaimed its right to choose its own destiny , authentic journalism - in particular , the rapid response of independent online journalism - forced the mass media to eat its own dishonest words .
Let the banquet begin .
Countdown to a Coup
T hat an attempted coup d'etat was underway in Venezuela was evident months ago .
Long before last week 's coup began there was a pitched battle to define its terms in advance .
After the December 6 , 1998 landslide electoral victory by Chávez , New York Times reporter Larry Rohter began the charge of the lite brigade , tagging Chávez as " the populist demagogue , the authoritarian man . "
Rohter decried " his past disregard for the rule of law . "
Chávez , Rohter bemoaned , " seems inclined to govern on the basis of a mystical bond he claims to have established with Venezuela 's 23 million people . "
He compared Chávez with " populist dictators of the past . "
Rohter 's conclusions about the Chávez presidency were decreed before Chávez had served a single day as president .
Rohter 's drumbeat of simulation continued right up until the final hour .
As Narco News was reporting about the unraveling of the coup d'etat ( " What dishonest spin will the inauthentic journalists place on the story when the Venezuelan majority begins to fight to restore its constitutional government ? " we asked , concluding , " Anything can happen .
Anything , " ) the NY Times '
Rohter was no longer concerned , as of yesterday , with " disregard for the rule of law " now that his own favored coup - masters were abolishing Congress and the Constitution in Venezuela and going door to door rounding up political opponents to their putsh .
Rohter even dredged Plan Colombia author Michael Shifter from the polluted Potomac to justify the coup : " This provides another formula to solve crises for countries that are seen as not being governable , " said Shifter , as Rohter chose to crow : " Mr. Chávez was a left - wing populist doomed by habitual recklessness . "
Now , Mr. Rohter must eat that crow .
But even caught in his anti-democracy bias , he is without remorse .
In today 's Times , Rohter continued in damage - control spin mode : " There were no obvious American fingerprints on the plot that unseated Mr. Chávez , unlike coups in Guatemala in 1954 or in Chile in 1973 , " he claimed ( in a double deceit , since it took years of Freedom of Information Act requests after the Guatemala and Chile coups to find those Yanqui fingerprints . )
However , in this age of fast - moving information , we remind : Mr. Rohter 's own fingerprints on the attempted military coup of 2002 are archived in ink and pixels for posterity .
The July 31 , 2000 elections in Venezuela - in which Chávez won reelection by an even larger landslide margin - were even more upsetting to the establishment press .
There was , that summer , a wave of official hysteria at the thought that all the predictions of Chávez 's demise would be proven wrong by the Venezuelan electorate .
Three days prior , Mary Anastasia O'Grady wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal titled " A Chavez victory will only worsen Venezuela 's problems . "
That same day , Brian Latell wrote an article titled " A Disguised Dictatorship " for the Washington Post .
And yet the predictions of " authoritarianism " by Chavez in Venezuela did not come true .
To the contrary , Venezuela , with Chávez at the helm , has experienced the most rapid development of human rights , fair and free elections , and press freedom of any Latin American nation at any moment in history .
Human Rights Watch , in 2000 , cited Venezuela as the only Latin American country where human rights had improved .
The viciously anti-Chávez Organization of American States sent a team of election observers to monitor both the 1998 and the 2000 elections in Venezuela , and despite all motive to discredit the vote , was forced by the facts to conclude that the elections were scrupulously fair .
As for press freedom , Venezuela has stood alone among Latin American nations :
Not a single journalist has ever been imprisoned under Chávez 's watch ( although the ideologically myopic Committee to Protect Journalists in New York has complained that Chávez speeches that have criticized the notoriously corrupt Venezuelan media and its financial conflicts - of - interest somehow constituted threats to press freedom .
CPJ has thus become more concerned with words -- the very speech it purports to defend -- than with the real sticks and stones that break our bones . )
Meanwhile , as the major media was consistently , and in a knowingly false manner , getting the story wrong , the Internet media was reporting the facts .
An English - language online newspaper , Vheadline.com , edited by veteran journalist Roy S. Carson , reported the true facts day after day from Venezuela since 1996 .
More on Vheadline.com in a moment : its journalists played a central role in recent days to break the information blockade out of Caracas .
For those who have been misled by the simulators ' who portray the Venezuela conflict as an issue of " left vs. right " ( as opposed to what it really is : democracy or none ) , libertarian conservative columnist Justin Raimundo actually bothered to read Chávez 's speeches and research his government 's policy positions in January 2001 .
He concluded :
That Chavez does n't fit into any of the formerly useful categories of " right " and " left " is the source of whatever confusion there is about what he believes , but this is due to the myopia of his critics , for the most part , and not - as we shall see - any fuzziness in his own thinking Before Venezuela 's 1998 presidential election , the US State Department denied Chavez a visa to visit the United States on the grounds - according to Albright - that he had once been the leader of a coup , and therefore a criminal unworthy of entry .
We wonder if the State Department will now apply its " no coup leaders allowed " to the band of oligarchs , military thugs ( trained by the School of the Americas , like so many Latin American torturers and dictators ) , and media moguls , who were leaders of the failed coup of April 2002 .
( When he was arrested and charged with violating the Constitution on Sunday , the military - installed dictator - for - a - day Pedro Carmona was reportedly fleeing from Miraflores Palace en route to the U.S. Embassy to seek asylum . )
Narco News , for our part , has reported about Venezuela and offered media criticism of the professional simulators for the past two years .
On September 18 , 2000 , we published " NY Times CIA Apologist Rohter Invades Venezuela Territory . "
On February 1 , 2001 , we praised Chávez 's unprecedented decision to place a civilian statesman at the helm of the nation 's armed forces , after it was discovered that certain corrupt military leaders - from the same faction that deposed the elected president at gunpoint last week - were conspiring with Colombia 's vicious AUC terrorist organization to form paramilitary death squads in Venezuela .
We warned , more than a year ago , that the Bush administration in cahoots with rogue military officials and Colombian paramilitary groups had launched a plan " to destabilize the Chávez government from within . "
Seven weeks ago , we went way out on a limb ( and received no small amount of hate mail , as a result , from members of the spoiled brat elite classes of Venezuela ) for a February 20 , 2002 analysis we published by Narco News correspondent Kim Alphandary .
It was titled : " Venezuela Faces U.S. Coup Plot : Washington Seeks End to World 's Truest Democracy . "
The Pre-Coup Show
I n recent weeks , though , the simulators of the mass media controlled the microphone .
Narco News , Vheadline.com and other reputable online news agencies warned of a coup in progress .
Those reports were ignored by the commercial press , and even by the " alternative " press .
But a whisper did begin among commercial journalists that eventually grew into a crescendo of shrieks , planting the seeds to harvest later :
If there was to be a coup d'etat , it would not be called a coup , but , rather , a " popular " revolt .
It was on March 19 that there came a decided shift in the message portrayed by propagandists who call themselves journalists , led by Juan Forero of the New York Times , who was , by now , installed in Caracas .
( Narco News , last year , reported that Forero allowed U.S. officials in Colombia to monitor his interviews with private - sector U.S. mercenaries there , without having disclosed that fact in his reports . )
It was no longer sufficient to call Venezuela 's president " left - wing " or point out his disagreements with Washington over Plan Colombia , OPEC or other policy matters .
The big lie , orchestrated and sung in harmony by the mainstream media , was floated by Forero of the NY Times on March 19th : That Chávez 's " autocratic style and left - wing policies have alienated a growing number of people . "
" Although he promised a ' revolution ' to improve the lives of the poor , Mr. Chávez has instead managed to rankle nearly every sector -- from the church to the press to the middle class -- with his combative style , populist speeches and dalliances with Fidel Castro of Cuba and the Marxist rebels of Colombia , " claimed Forero .
Forero , along with other official " journalists " also began pushing heavily the spin that the " military forces " of Venezuela had turned against the Chávez government .
It was then , in mid-March , that a slow drip of military brass was trotted out before the media .
Forero quoted one colonel as saying that Chávez " has said the military forces were with him .
I wanted to tell people they were not . ''
" Mario Ivan Carratu , a retired vice admiral with close contacts in the military , " wrote Forero , " said some active - duty officers had spoken of playing a more aggressive role .
He said a few had even privately spoken of a need to stage a coup to oust Mr. Chávez . "
' ' I have been in contact with many active officers , and they are of the belief that if society does not organize to take steps , then they are going to have to take control , '' said Mr. Carratu .
Forero , true to form , added the now - obviously fictional chestnut that the dissident military brass " are well aware that the United States has said it will not support a coup . "
( As the Washington Post reported on Saturday , there had been a constant march of businessmen , media moguls and military officials in and out of the US Embassy in Caracas in the days before the coup . )
But this was Forero 's story , and he reported :
'' The armed forces do not want to gain a place in history with a coup , '' said one high - ranking military officer , who asked to remain unidentified .
'' If they want to pass into history , then what they want to do is support civil society in its protests . ''
From that moment on it was clear to the close observer : A simulation of " Civil Society " and " popular revolt " would be staged to " justify " a military coup d'etat .
The " Revolt " of the Spoiled Brats
B y last Tuesday , April 9th , the ducks were all lined up .
Forero , again , led the media charge when he wrote about the strange plans for a " labor " strike , supported by management and the national Chamber of Commerce and Industry , to shut down Venezuela 's major cash cow industry - that of oil :
'' This can only end with the president resigning , '' Humberto Calderon Berti , a former minister of energy and mines , told a throng of protesting executives from the oil company Petroleos de Venezuela in Caracas .
'' All Venezuelans from all walks of life , from all social strata , from all the political and ideological sectors , must take part in the stoppage .
This is about him or us .
It is a choice between democracy or dictatorship . ''
How many " protesting executives " makes a " throng " ?
It 's going to take years to disassemble every slight - of - hand piece of rhetoric wielded by the mainstream media in trying to make The Revolt of the Spoiled Brats seem like a " popular uprising . "
( See the Q & A with Narco News by journalist Jules Siegel from our reports last weekend for details on the ingredients of the " astro- turf " that the inauthentic journalists tried to pass off as a grassroots rebellion . )
Forero 's source , the oil executive quoted above , was right about one thing :
The drama that unfolded would indeed become " a choice between democracy or dictatorship . "
The journalistic crime of the new century was the mass media 's Orwellian misrepresentation of which side of the conflict represented which D - word .
THURSDAY , APRIL 11 , 2002 :
DEMOCRACY HELD HOSTAGE , DAY ONE
L ast Thursday , April 11 , the coup was officially launched .
Forero , by now , had left all pretext of journalism behind to become Minister of Propaganda for an illegal coup d'etat that almost turned the clock back 30 years on democracy in Latin America .
He wrote in that morning 's edition of the New York Times :
" Much of the opposition is rooted in widespread displeasure with Mr. Chavez 's policies .
White - collar workers view him as a left - wing autocrat .
Unions resent his attempts to impose his control on them . "
Forero and the rest of the official media chorus - including AP and Reuters upon which most daily newspapers , radio and TV stations rely on for international news coverage - did not explore the details of the oil workers union 's real gripe with the Chavez government :
That the union bureaucracy had been in direct disobedience of new laws requiring fair and free elections for union leadership .
Does insisting on free elections constitute " imposing control " ?
Or does it constitute a necessary part of the democratization of a nation ?
And what of the other vested interests of the Five TV chains , the national dailies , the Catholic Church , the military brass and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry who mixed themselves up into a Molotov cocktail of a coup ?
What of the role of the United States ?
These questions were never asked by the commercial media , much less answered .
Coup Central :
The CIA Bunker in Caracas
A report would appear two days later in the daily Panamá América newspaper that shed light on how oil union boss Carlos Ortega , the number - two coup organizer ( among the Venezuelans involved ) second only to oilman - turned - dictator - for - a - day Pedro Carmona , became head of the oil union and consequently of Venezuela 's equivalent of the AFL - CIO .
Translated by The Narco News Bulletin :
" Months ago , we warned that the U.S. government had put a plan in march to topple Venezuela 's president Hugo Chávez .
Working with agents of the CIA and with members of the military group that the Pentagon maintains in Caracas to supervise U.S. arms sales in the region , the strategies from the Potomac joined forces with the opponents of the president .
Bankers , businessmen and politicians donated funds to creat the marches and protest that detonated the crisis .
Money from the opposition served to influence union elections and the control of the petroleum workers union , the most important in Venezuela "
Narco News has learned that the CIA headquarters for organizing , distributing said cash , and engineering the attempted coup d'etat , was the office known as the MIL GROUP .
That 's the name by which the US Military Liason staff in Embassies - " usually a repository for fixers and grafters pitching Department of Defense sponsored weapons sales to third world satrapies , " as one source colorfully explained to Narco News - had , according to another well - placed source , greatly increased its staff size in the weeks prior to the attempted coup .
We presume the increase in personnel - or individuals posing as personnel at the MIL GROUP - was not due to a sudden desire by Washington to sell more arms to the Chavez government .
Former National Security Agency officer Wayne Madsen , writing with Richard M. Bennett , reveal that the U.S. participation in the failed coup attempt was not only financial , but military .
Reporting from the National Press Building in Washington , they have just blown the roof off of U.S. government denials of involvement in the coup with this Intelligence Report :
Under the cover of the COMPTUEX and a Joint Task Force Exercise ( JTFEX ) training exercises in the Caribbean the US Navy provided signals intelligence and communications jamming support to the Venezuelan military .
Particular focus by US Navy SIGINT vessels was on communications to and from the Cuban , Libyan , Iranian , and Iraqi diplomatic missions in Caracas .
All four countries had expressed support for Chavez and the plans for US military and intelligence support for the coup d'etat were brought upto date following President Bush 's visit to Peru and El Salvador in March 2002 .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) supported the coup using personnel attached to the US Southern Command 's Joint Interagency Task Force East ( JIATF-E ) in Key West , Florida .
NSA 's Spanish - language linguists and signals interception operators in Key West ; Sabana Seca on Puerto Rico and the Regional Security Operating Centre ( RSOC ) in Medina , Texas also assisted in providing communications intelligence to US military and national command authorities on the progress of the coup d'etat .
From eastern Colombia , CIA and US contract military personnel , ostensibly used for counter - narcotics operations , stood by to provide logistics support for the leading members of the coup .
Their activities were centred at the Marandua airfield and along the border with Venezuela .
Patrol aircraft operating from the US Forward Operating Location ( FOL ) in Manta , Ecuador also provided intelligence support for the military move against Chavez .
Additional USN vessels on a training exercise in the Outer Range of the US Navy 's Southern Puerto Rican Operating Area also stood by in the event the coup against Chavez faltered , thus requiring a military evacuation of US citizens in Venezuela .
The ships included the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and the destroyers USS Barry , Laboon , Mahan , and Arthur W. Radford .
Some of the latter vessels reportedly had NSA Direct Support Units aboard to provide additional signals intelligence support to US Special Operations and intelligence personnel deployed on the ground in close co-operation with the Venezuelan Army and along the Colombian side of the border .
The polemic in recent weeks in which the Narco - State government of Colombia ( again , with NY Timesman Juan Forero as its press agent ) accused the Chávez government of Venezuela of harboring Colombian rebels now seems particularly hypocritical given the confirmation that Colombian territory was used by US forces in the failed coup attempt .
Also note that the cover for the anti-democracy military operation was " counter - narcotics operations " that " provide logistics support for the leading members of the coup . "
In sum : the effort by US tax dollars to prop up Carlos Ortega as head of the oil union was intended , long ago , to provide a " working class " gloss for the Revolt of the Spoiled Brats .
The oligarchy could not stand the fact that , for the first time , Venezuela had become a true democracy for the majority of its people who elected Chavez .
Nor could it handle the reality that it was now seen by the Venezuelan majority for what it was : an oligarchy .
So the corrupt union boss was brought in to provide a false image of class diversity .
Then the real expense to U.S. taxpayers ( something especially timely to reflect upon on this date of April 15th ) came in the form of a massive US military and intelligence operation .
But back to Thursday , for a moment :
With the five TV chains running free advertisements every ten minutes urging the citizenry to join the march , the 40,000 member oil workers union , the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry , and the Catholic Church hierarchy pulling out all the stops to create the illusion of a popular revolt , they only got between 50,000 and 150,000 people into the streets of Caracas to protest against Chavez .
( Caracas has more than two million citizens and Venezuela , 24 million . )
The demonstration , purportedly in support of the business - backed oil workers strike , was initially advertised to march to the state oil agency 's offices .
But once the leaders - with the help of the TV stations ( upset with Chavez , as we reported on Saturday , over having to pay taxes like any other business for the first time in their history ) - had the crowd assembled , they switched the parade route and marched their own lambs to a pre-plotted slaughter .
The march - puny in size compared to the multitudes that would take to the streets to oppose the Coup in coming days - was detoured by the coup plotters to head to the presidential palace known as Miraflores , where several thousand supporters of the Chavez government were already assembled .
As universally reported by the English - language media - including the Four Horsemen of Simulation ; AP , Reuters , the NY Times and CNN - shots were fired , between 10 and 30 people died , and another 100 or so wounded .
The question of where those shots came from looms explosively .
Eyewitness in Caracas Greg Wilpert reported on Friday in an article for commondreams.org - and linked immediately by Narco News - that the majority of killed and wounded were Chavez supporters .
Wilpert has subsequently reported that , now that the Constitutional government of Chavez is restored , he expects the list of martyrs to finally be released ( interesting , how the coup never released the names of the dead ) , and the list will show that the majority of those killed were Chavez supporters .
Wilpert also comments that he expects videotapes to be released in the coming days that show the true culprits behind the shooting provocation : an extreme anti-Chavez group titled " Bandera Roja . "
But AP , Reuters , the NY Times , CNN and many other English - language media sources reported , without sourcing their claim , that the shots came from the Chávez government .
They repeated that unsubstantiated speculation as fact over and over and over again .
And White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer claimed that Chavez " ordered " the shootings .
All of this will come out in the wash in the coming days .
Suffice to say , the mainstream media got the story wrong , intentionally wrong , to blame violent acts by Chávez opponents on Chávez .
Chávez Never Resigned
T he Four Horsemen of Simulation - AP , Reuters , the New York Times and CNN - and virtually the entire commercial press reported that Chavez had " resigned " from office after the shootings .
All have subsequently been forced to change their stories , because the clearest fact that has emerged from this entire drama is that President Chávez never resigned .
They did not source their claim .
They simply stated it as fact .
Some major media outlets went as far as to invent more extreme fictions , aimed at portraying Chávez as a coward and buffoon .
On Thursday night , the Dow Jones Newswire reported a story titled " Venezuela President Chavez Seen Leaving Country - Report . "
The coup leaders had gone so far as to circulate a lie , repeated endlessly by the US press , that Chavez had behaved timidly , and had pled permission to flee to another country ( many reports presumed it was Cuba . )
The Dow Jones Newswire - the press agency of the Wall Street Journal - repeated that headline NINE times before the night was done .
Even after reporting that Chavez was under arrest in Venezuela , Dow Jones ( knowing full well that local radio newscasters throughout the U.S. read the headlines aloud the next morning ) persisted in titling the story : " REPEAT - Venezuela President Chavez Seen Leaving Country - Report . "
Thursday night was a dark hour for journalism in our América .
It 's cynicism and simulation would only be surpassed by what was to come on Friday .
FRIDAY , APRIL 12 , 2002 :
DEMOCRACY HELD HOSTAGE , DAY TWO
N ew York Times readers awoke on Friday morning to read what should herald , in retrospect , Juan Forero 's resignation from a career as a so - called journalist .
Forero wrote :
" Mr. Chavez , 47 , a firebrand populist who had said he would remake Venezuela to benefit the poor , was obligated to resign in a meeting with three military officers about 3 a.m. today "
Forero was , by now , in full disinformation mode .
He claimed that Chavez , during his presidency , had " seized control of the legislature , " neglecting to clarify that Venezuela 's electorate voted fair and square , the American way , at the ballot box for members of Congress who supported the Bolivarian Revolution of Chavez .
On Friday , the military junta that had arrested and imprisoned the President at gunpoint without having legally charged him with any crime , installed national Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman , oilman , and number - one coup leader Pedro Carmona as " president . "
Among Carmona 's first acts :
He abolished the elected national congress , disbanded the constitutionally established Supreme Court , and even changed the name of the country from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the plain old Republic of Venezuela .
Thus , in the name of stopping an " autocrat , " a " dictator , " an " authoritarian , " a " strongman , " and other epithets thrown by Forero and the Horsemen of Simulation , the coup installed a real dictator , Pedro Carmona : un-elected , mentally unstable , so mercurial as to demand the abolition of Congress , and who began a house - by - house witch hunt to round up cabinet members , congressmen and political leaders in Venezuela .
'' We can not allow a tyrant to run the Republic of Venezuela , '' said Navy Vice Adm. Hector Rafael Ramirez according to Forero .
The Admiral was spouting those words ... at the precise moment that he was installing a tyrant to run the Republic of Venezuela .
It was on this day that the owning class of the commercial media reared its true face as a vested enemy of democracy .
The Inter - American Press Association , dominated by the oligarch owners of newspapers in América whose definition of " press freedom " is their liberty run their commercial fiefdoms at maximum political and economic profit , issued a statement on this date :
" President Robert J. Cox said today that political developments in Venezuela demonstrate to nations throughout the world that there can be no true democracy without free speech and press freedom . "
As with Forero 's inverted dialectic of " democracy or dictatorship , " the IAPA press release was positively Orwellian .
Repeating its prior complaints that Chávez 's " belligerent and intolerant attitude towards journalists and the news media " ( read : the President 's speeches criticizing the simulation by a media that serves only the wealthy and denies voice to the majority ) somehow constituted interference with press freedom , the IAPA showed its true fangs in endorsing a military dictatorship over a democratically elected government .
" This is a classic example for the new government headed by Pedro Carmona , which hopefully will turn things around , respect freedom of the press and encourage the independence of the judiciary , and thus , ensure restoration of true democracy , " Cox added .
Cox and his group of Inauthentic Journalists inverted the question of the day .
In declaring " there can be no true democracy without free speech and press freedom , " it forgot the inverse :
There can be no free speech and press freedom without true democracy . "
The IAPA lost all the illusory credibility it had with that savage endorsement of a military coup .
The IAPA , instead of defending democratic values , became part of the coup .
As Mexican newspaper publisher and editor Mario Menéndez Rodríguez - the founder of the term " authentic journalism , " the most experienced American journalist covering revolutions and counter - revolutions in this hemisphere , and our victorious co-defendant in the New York Supreme Court decision that established First Amendment rights for online journalists - said , " You will know the true character of a journalist by how he behaves during a crisis . "
IAPA President Robert J. Cox - like many others - revealed his true character in these Three Days that Shook the Media .
In a meritocracy he would be immediately demoted to beat reporter to learn the ropes all over again .
We recommend that he and the others like him who turned their backs on the most important value of any free society - the protection of electoral democracy over military imposed dictatorship - go back to square one .
Cox and the others can begin by reading our 24 Coup Questions for Journalists , and by doing the gumshoe work to answer those questions .
After all , he 'll have the time now : nothing he does as IAPA boss will have any credibility from this date forward .
In these Friday hours , the situation seemed hopeless .
Absolute Power had strangled democracy in our América , and the commercial media had become handmaiden to a military junta .
And then , miraculously , the cavalry arrived .
The Counter - Coup
by Authentic Journalism
T hen , on Friday night , what history will call " the counter - coup by authentic journalism " began , as the Vheadline.com online newspaper and its editor Roy S. Carson , news editor Patrick J. O'Donoghue and 14 reporters throughout Venezuela began to break the information blockade .
Among many authentic journalists who turned the tide , Carson deserves the democratic medal of valor .
At 11 a.m. on Thursday , before the coup occurred , his Vheadline.com website had gone into the shop for maintenance .
When it rains it pours : Carson woke up Friday morning recovering from pre-ocular surgery he had received on Thursday , but upon learning of the coup he rose from his bed to change the history of América .
His website was inoperative , but Carson , undaunted , began filing email alerts which were published by Narco News , Indy Media , and many others of the Authentic Journalism Renaissance .
At 7:30 on Friday night , Vheadline.com translated and distributed , via email the first decrees of the military - installed regime of oilman Pedro Carmona .
The global distribution of the " Transitional Junta Decree " on the Internet erased , in one fell swoop , all the fictions repeated in the mass media about who was the real dictator :
Caracas , Friday , April 12 , 2002 -- 7:30 p.m. Article 1 - Pedro Carmona Estanga is designated president of the Republic of Venezuela .
Article 2 - The name of the Republic of Venezuela is re-established .
Article 3 - Principal and substitute legislators of the National Assembly ( AN ) are suspended from their posts
The decree also delayed new presidential elections until up to a year from now and stated :
" The President in Cabinet will be able to remove and transitionally designate the officials of national , state and municipal agencies to guarantee institutional democracy and the adequate functioning of the stated
The reorganization of public agencies is decreed for the purpose of regaining their autonomy and independence and to ensure a peaceful and democratic transition , " thus dismissing from posts illegitimately held by the president and magistrates of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ( TSJ ) , Comptroller , Attorney General , OfficialOmbudsman and members of the National Electoral College ( CNE ) . "
The decree also suspended 48 laws passed Constitutionally by the Chavez government and Congress in 2001
Dictatorship vs. Democracy , indeed .
The Vheadline.com archives of its email alerts from April 11th to 13th is now online ( the website was back in action by Saturday afternoon ) at :
http://www.vheadline.com/p1
The updates are archived in reverse chronological order ( in other words , for a blow - by - blow account , scroll from the bottom up ) .
Historians of the coup , and scholars of the Authentic Journalism Renaissance , will consult those Vheadline.com archives for years to come .
Then came Saturday , and the turning of the tide .
SATURDAY , APRIL 13 , 2002 :
Collapse of a Coup
W hile New York Times readers awoke to a puff piece by Juan Forero about the new dictator - titled , incredulously , " Manager and Conciliator - Pedro Carmona Estanga " - in which Forero repeated the lie that Chavez " was forced to resign , " the independent online media had begun to take back the microphone .
Among the factors that , in retrospect , caused news consumers from throughout the world to turn toward online news sources was that the official reports by Forero , AP , Reuters , CNN and others had become so obviously one - sided .
Indeed , they had a gloating quality about what they errantly called Chávez 's downfall .
And the Times and others committed the faux pas of arrogance :
They underestimated the public and overestimated its capacity to swallow their Selling of a Dictator - Carmona - as a legitimate " president . "
Forero wrote :
'' Carmona is not a mega - industrialist in his own right , '' a political consultant , Eric Ekvall , said .
'' Carmona is a man who 's always worked in and been involved in the business sector , but always as a manager .
He 's not one of the landed elite , with his own fortune , his own bank . ''
( Here in the Narco Newsroom , we thought Forero 's trotting out of Ekvall was shameless , though predictable : Ekvall - father of the former Miss Venezuela and an eccentric species of political consultant who is hostile to basic democratic values - had been one of the readers who had sent us hate mail after our February 20th report predicting the coup .
He raged at us , and at author Kim Alphandary , and mocked our description of Alphandary as an authentic journalist .
And now , during the coup , here he was , on the pages of the New York Times doing spin-control for an authoritarian dictator and a coup that seven weeks ago he swore would never happen , trying to portray the sleazy oilman Carmona as some kind of humble man of the people . )
While Forero and other English - language commercial reporters were relying on Embassy sources , oligarchs like Ekvall , and the slanted Venezuelan TV " coverage " of events , Vheadline.com and its team of reporters was driving a stake through the official censorship .
At 1:50 p.m. on Saturday , Vheadline.com broke the story that the Speaker of the National Assembly had rejected the dictator Carmona 's decree abolishing the elected legislative branch of government ( the " abolished " legislators later announced that come Sunday , they would hold a formal session anyway ) .
Moments later , Vheadline.com reported that protests had erupted in the slums of Caracas against the military - installed dictatorship .
( A polemic would later ensue because the five big TV chains of Venezuela had made a concerted decision to not report demonstrations against the coup ; Vheadline.com was getting its information directly from the streets . )
Later that afternoon , Vheadline.com translated a statement by the major human rights organizations of Venezuela condemning the coup and the illegal arrests of elected and political leaders by the Carmona dictatorship .
And so it went : 4:38 p.m. , disturbances break out in the popular neighborhoods of the capital .
4:56 p.m. , a military junta leader admits on the radio that Chávez never resigned .
6:40 p.m . " Two national dailies and a private TV station have imposed an absolute news blackout . "
And , the most crucial turning point of all : rank - and - file soldiers and officers at the nation 's largest Army Base in Maracay reject the military junta and begin the counter - coup ( Maracay is the base where Venezuela 's F16 fighter planes are hangared , and a nervous Washington began worrying about the oil fields that supply 15 percent of the United States ' imported oil . )
In the streets of virtually every city and town in Venezuela , the poor , as Chávez had predicted the day before the coup , " came down from the hills . "
The ocean of bodies placed itself between the dictatorship and history .
Carmona 's troops began firing upon crowds indiscriminately , the very behavior it had accused the Chávez government of undertaking in creating a pretext for the military coup .
Morgues and hospitals filled with the dead and wounded civilians .
Rank - and - file soldiers throughout the country broke ranks with the brass , reclaimed the presidential palace for the Bolivarian Revolution , and forced the high military commanders to begin to backpedal from their imposition of Carmona .
" Oh , how the poor love each other , " John Reed wrote in his early 20th century classic , " Ten Days That Shook The World . "
The poor majority of Venezuela , unseen and unheard by the English - language media , blacked - out by the five TV stations of the oligarchs in Venezuela , had come forward to make a lie out of months of disinformation by the establishment media , which had claimed that Chavez had lost popular support .
And is this not the story of our times ?
A media so concerned with pandering to wealthy consumers in order to draw even wealthier advertisers that it has forgotten the very motive for the First Amendment protections it enjoys :
That in democracy , all voices must be heard .
And all ears must be able to hear those voices .
And all eyes must be able to see :
Is that not the stated mission of the news media ?
Millions of people around the world have read Narco News , but we never forget that each reading is by one set of eyes at a time .
The eyes of journalist Mari Ranut in the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago - just seven miles from the Venezuela coast , in the Caribbean sea - were looking for information as these events were unfolding .
Unsatisfied by the news blackout of the commercial Venezuelan oligarch - controlled media , and the inauthentic reporting of the English - language media , she turned to the Internet , and found her way to these pages .
Her newspaper , Trinicenter.com , like so many other online publications , helped turn one slingshot into a thousand stones fired from all directions until the Goliath lie - " Chávez resigned " - fell to earth with a thud heard ' round the world .
Authentic Journalist Mari Ranut analyzed what had just occured :
Were it not for independent Internet news sources the developing story in Venezuela would not have been made public .
Without the Internet Vanguards , the coup in Venezuela and the coup of information would have gone unchecked or buried below the prejudices of many with the attitude of " Another Central American Coup , what 's new " .
For 48 hours the mainstream media e.g. BBC , CNN gave very little news about the grassroots support for Chávez that had taken to the street demanding his reinstatement .
They did not keep the public updated as to the fact that there were three changes in leadership .
Instead they tried to hammer home that Chávez ( the Democratically elected leader ) ' resigned ' , a resignation that they did not confirm as Chávez was not allowed media access .
A resignation at the barrel of a gun cannot be considered valid .
This was another clear case of distorted propaganda ...
Now that the independent Internet medias have done their duty to inform the public , the mainstream media has no choice now but to start bringing out the bits and pieces they have been hiding .
Suddenly they are showing the Pro-Chávez supporters on the streets demanding his re-instatement and as we can see it is not hundreds but thousands , many thousands more than they were showing that called for his removal ...
The lessons of the hypocrisy of the American and other European Powers are being learnt quickly because the Internet is proving to be the largest pressroom ever established .
The U.S. can not shut down all the websites in the World at once ; they may bomb independent media buildings or support their big businesses in gobbling up these smaller media , but the small non-commercial activists Websites are the real challenge .
The Internet shows you do not need a building that can be bombed or any easily identifiable structure to provide alternative news and views .
You just need a computer , a phone line and information , and guess what , you do n't have to own it .
Just check your local library or Internet cafe .
The coup in Venezuela has been foiled with the aid of small independent media outlets in support of the rights of ordinary people .
People must always remember this .
The fledgling movement of Authentic Journalism - above all , online journalism - broke the information blockade and refused to allow the simulation to continue .
The Bolivarian Revolution of Venezuela 's poor majority has won back more , so much more , than its own country .
It has delivered Washington 's policy of simulation against democracy its first major defeat , and the dominoes have only begun to fall .
But perhaps even more significantly , the people of Venezuela created the conditions under which Authentic Journalism has now wrestled the microphone from a discredited commercial mass media .
No victory is final .
As journalist Bill Vann notes , " An armed uprising that failed preceded the September 1973 military coup that brought down the
Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende and inaugurated General Augusto Pinochets reign of terror against the Chilean working class .
That abortive action , just like the recent move against Chavez , showed how vulnerable the government was to a coup .
It also provided a dress rehearsal for a real confrontation with the masses and allowed the principal figures in the military to determine which units could be relied upon and which could not . "
But what we have today is a fighting chance that democracy in América did not have in 1973 : the now - demonstrated ability to rise up with a thousand informational slingshots and take down the big lie .
This is not a story about " new technology , " but , rather , about people , human beings , journalists , authentic journalists ...
Not just Narco News , or Vheadline.com , or the now - online intelligence report by a courageous former National Security Agency officer , but most importantly a decentralized slingshot army - you know who you are - that now has the microphone and will never give it up to the commercially - driven usurpers of democracy again .
The revolution has taken back the media palace , too .
Welcome , kind readers , to the 21st Century .
Like the dawn of an authentic sun , we come from below .
It 's morning in América .
Oh , this little light of ours

Building to flip is building to flop Jason 21 comments Latest by Anonymous Coward
If you ’re about to build anything , do n’t build it to flip or you ’re almost guaranteed to flop .
Sure , you could win the Yahoo lottery , but the odds are n’t in your favor .
If 9 out of every 10 new companies fail , I ca n’t imagine the minute percentage of successful acquisitions .
1 in 100 ? 1 in 1000 ?
Worse ?
Believe it or not , it ’s far better ( and easier ) to build a small , profitable , healthy company that sells a product or service to a thousand small customers than it is to sell to that one magical big buy - out customer .
Secondly , name a great company that was built to flip .
I ca n’t name one .
Great companies are built to build , to grow , to mature , to make a difference eventually .
Not to sell to someone in a couple years .
A sale is a side - effect of building something great , it should n’t be the motivation for building something great .
So , if you ’re shooting for mediocrity and trying to win the lottery , good luck to you .
If you want to build something great , best success to you .
UPDATE : Om Malik wonders if the falling stocks bring shopping sprees to quick halt .
A French alternative to Google Earth - offering hi-res coverage of the entire country - went into meltdown last Friday shortly after its launch and is still unavailable due to a stampede of punters eager to avail themselves of the free service .
French prez Jacques Chirac chaired the official launch of Geoportail , Yahoo !
reports , and quickly administered the Gallic kiss of death to the project by proclaiming : " This is a step forward for all citizens , which places France at the forefront of new technologies . "
Geoportail cost the French taxpayer a cool € 6 m which the National Geographic Institute used to collate 400,000 aerial photos and 3,700 maps .
It reportedly allows users to " zoom in to within 50 centimetres of the ground " and to " switch from aerial views of a site , to detailed maps , charts and geological data " .
We 'll take Geoportail for a spin as soon as France has re-established itself at the forefront of new technologies .
In the meantime , the black helicopter - spotters among you will be disappointed to learn that " certain sensitive or military zones " are censored , so we 'll presumably have to continue to rely on Google Earth for quality material such as this fine view of naval hardware in Toulon ...
... or a handsome trio of AWACS at Avord air base :
Bootnote
Those of you without Google Earth can find the Toulon and Avord images on Google Maps here and here , respectively .
So , you 've been a developer for yonks , and you 've just realised that you 'll carry on being a developer for ever unless you get promoted ( or fired ) .
The obvious career path seems to be project management , then department management , then manager management ( a few times ) , and finally director .
But good developers do n't necessarily make good managers .
I know this , because I 've worked for a couple .
Most developers do n't seem to want to be managers anyway , so what else is there ?
Lead Developer .
Take charge of a major component , and assist junior developers along the way .
Make some big design decisions , and discuss with seniors how they will function .
Software Architect .
Design the big picture , how the major pieces interact , and steer other people while they 're building it .
Technical Strategist .
( Probably not called that , but I do n't know what they 're called . )
Become the expert for generic things across all the development teams in the organisation : coding standards , release management , re-use strategy , daily builds , researching new tools , technologies and techniques .
Implement these across the teams .
Entrepreneur .
Finish that handy utility , web application or telepathic UI that you 've been tinkering with for months , pretty it up , and start selling it .
Educator .
Work for Learning Tree , QA , or whoever , telling other developers how to do it , or lecture at schools , colleges and universities .
Contractor .
If you 've been working on the same sort of thing for a while , switching to short - term contracts for various companies may introduce some different challenges .
Consultant .
Tell customers what approach they should take with their software projects , maybe designing or coding it for them .
Evangelist .
Work for a large software product company , and extol the virtues of their latest products .
Author .
Write books , articles and blogs about programming .
Change career .
Work for a small or expanding company where programming skills would n't take up the majority of your time , but would give you an edge .
Many smaller companies would n't employ a programmer , but an estate - agent , shop - keeper or magazine editor that could rustle up things to interface to third - party systems and write server - side wizardry for the website would be valuable .
Salesman .
How often do salesmen promise customers completely unrealistic features ?
Have a real advantage over other salesmen by actually understanding what you 're selling ( and talking about ! ) .
Software Tester .
Catch the bugs that other developers introduce , and ( as delicately as possible - developers are fragile ) tell the developers to fix them .
Das YouTube Problem . [ Update ]
Socialnetworking Seiten mit Inhalten von Konsumenten befinden sich gerade zweifellos im Aufwind .
Die vor einem Jahr gestartete Videosharing Seite YouTube ist eines der besten Beispiele .
Auf YouTube kann jeder seine Clips und Videos umsonst hochladen oder die Videos anderer betrachten .
Mittlerweile werden bei YouTube jeden Tag 20 000 Videos hochgeladen und über 15 Millionen Videos angeschaut .
Das führt zu einem Alexa Traffic Rank von 144 ( 3 Monatsmittel ) und das innerhalb eines Jahres .
Doch trotz des Erfolgs gibt es massive Probleme für YouTube , die der Service lösen muss um nicht einen genauso schnellen Abstieg zu nehmen .
Das große Problem für YouTube ist , dass der Service eines Tages Geld verdienen muss , denn die $ 5 Millionen in Venture Kapital reichen sicher nicht lang um die immensen Traffic Rechnungen zu bezahlen .
Die Probleme im Einzelnen :
YouTube hat also eine Menge Probleme zu bewältigen .
Sollte es YouTube schaffen diese Probleme in den Griff zu bekommen ensteht sicher eines der interessantesten Internet TV Angebote im Web .
Ansonsten sehe ich schwarz für die Zukunft von YouTube .
Update :
Es sieht so aus , als ob YouTube sich der Probleme durchaus bewusst ist .
Zuerst wurde nun der Uploadprozess angepasst ( man muss nun zustimmen , dass einem der Clip gehört ) und des Weiteren bietet YouTube nun ein Partnerprogramm an. MTV2 ist der erste Sender , der davon gebrauch macht und Clips offiziell über YouTube vertreibt .
Dabei werden die professionellen Clips im „ premium content provider program “ mit einem Hinweis auf den Veröffentlicher versehen .
As stated before ( and proven many times over ) the mere presence of a computer can short circuit normally intelligent people 's brains .
But sometimes it 's just ridiculous .

I had about ten different responses flash through my mind , but as this guy was fairly high up on the food chain of management , I had to control myself .
I said , " Align the pins with the hole , and push it into the socket . "
Satisfied , the user hung up .

There was a really angry user who called me , saying my company was @ # $ !# and its products were !@#$@ , and I was @# $ *! too .
He said he bought our graphics card , and it did n't work , and what the @&$ ! # was I going to do about it before he sued my lying butt .
After this I learned from him that he did n't actually have our product .
Email from a customer :
I 've bought a stolen CDD3610 which did n't come with any software or cables .
Could you please send that to me ?
I presume I do have the full 12 months warranty ?
Customer : " Do I need a computer to use your software ? "
A haughty caller to my Claris Works cue began haranguing me about the Claris Works she 'd just bought .
When her tirade abated enough for me to ask a few probing questions , she explained that the box promised a word processor , but there was n't one inside .
I asked her to insert the disk from the box into her computer .
Customer : " Computer ?
I do n't have a computer ! "
" Computer ?
I do n't have a computer ! "
Me : " Ma'am , Claris Works requires a computer . "
From here , she became irate .
She dragged in two levels of supervisors , several lawyers , later , and I was nearly placed on the sacrificial altar .
For what it 's worth , we never laughed and always maintained a professional demeanor .
The customer is always right .
Customer : " I would like to place an order . "
" I would like to place an order . "
Tech Support : " Unfortunately , we are unable to take orders over the phone .

User : " What program do you use to make a Word document ? "
My neighbors asked me one day to check their computer , because it was no longer working properly .
After realizing that the problem was caused by some corrupted or deleted system files , I reinstalled Windows , but I could not find their cable modem installation disk among their CDs .
After I asked them for it , they gave me a weird look , so I put my question in simpler terms .
" When you have bought this little box over here , " I said , " they must have you given a shiny little round disk like this with it .
I just need that shiny little round disk . "
They said they kept all their " computer stuff " in the other room in a cupboard , so they went to search for it .
After a few minutes , the wife returned with a power cable .
" This was the only thing we found , " she explained , " but I hope it will be just as good . "
Quote from a tech support forum :
" but i'm getting like 2000 lines of mysql db errors ... could it be caused by my non-workin mysqldb ? "
Once I got called to the office of a co-worker ( let 's call him Joe User ) to help him figure out his username ( he knew his password ) .
Me : " Your username is ' Joe User ' . "
" Your username is ' Joe User ' . "
Him : " Unacceptable !
How much am I supposed to remember ?
I can only remember a certain number of things . "
" Unacceptable !
How much am I supposed to remember ?
I can only remember a certain number of things . "
Me : " Would n't one of those things be your name ? "
" Would n't one of those things be your name ? "
Him : " I guess I 'll have to write it down . "
He proceeded to write his own name on a sticky note and attach it to his monitor .
I 'm in fifth grade , and I 've recently started using LimeWire .
My friend 's cousin ( who 's in second grade ) heard about it and wanted to use it , too .
The next day , he told me it was n't working .
He proceeded to explain how he got a copper wire , dipped it in lime juice , and tried to attach it to his computer .
I could n't stop giggling the rest of the day .
I work for the help desk of the IT Department of a fairly large university .
We had just completed a large roll out of VoIP phones and were expecting some calls from bewildered staff members wondering what these new fangled devices they now had on their desks were .
We had one call from a lady , who seemed to be utterly confused by this new phone .
When I answered the phone , the first thing said was , " Ok , how do I make calls using this new phone ? "
Well , the new phones have caller ID , so I knew she was making the call with her new phone .
So I said , " Uh , how did you just call me ? "
She said , " Ohhhh , thanks ! " and hung up .
The place I work for charges about $ 100 / issue for tech support .
Tech Support : " So what can I do for you ? "

Our Hong Kong office had a computer that was infected with a virus .
Supposedly they had run antivirus software several times and had been unable to clean it , even after updating their virus definitions .
I was asked to diagnose and fix the computer immediately , because it would n't even turn on .
Me : " Sure thing .
When do you want me to fly over ? "
" Sure thing .
When do you want me to fly over ? "
Him : " Ca n't you do it from there ? "
" Ca n't you do it from there ? "
Me : " Sure , just ship it to me . "
" Sure , just ship it to me . "
Him : " No , I mean ca n't you just fix it here , from there ? "

Me : " Uh ...how exactly would you like me to do that ? "
" Uh ...how exactly would you like me to do that ? "

I used to work in the computer help desk at a large university .
A woman walked into the room and came up to where I was sitting : at a desk marked " COMPUTER HELP DESK " with computers on it , one of which I was using .
" Excuse me , " she asked .
" Do you know anything about computers ? "
A call to the technical support line for a cell phone company :

" Excuse me ? " Customer : " How am I supposed to change this battery ? "
" How am I supposed to change this battery ? " Tech Support : " Sir , all you need to do is replace the battery .
It 's not that hard . "
" Sir , all you need to do is replace the battery .
It 's not that hard . "
Customer : " Can you send out a repairman to do it for me ? "
What ?
He had to be kidding .
Tech Support : " We normally do n't send out repairmen to change batteries . "
" We normally do n't send out repairmen to change batteries . "
Customer : " What ?
I can't change this battery by myself ! "
After a few more minutes of angry yelling on his part that we would not be sending a repairman to go change the battery for him , he got on the phone with supervisor and demanded I be fired .
Needless to say , I was n't .
Customer : " I have a message on my screen that says : ' Disk Full ' .
What can that be ? "

On the top of the next gray box , click on the white box with ' Save In ' next to it .
From this next white box , click on ' 3 1/2 Floppy ' . "

I went to the post office to ship a package of software to a customer .
Since the software was expensive , I decided to insure it .
As the postal employee was filling out the insurance form , he asked me what I was shipping .
Me : " Software . "
" Software . "
Him : " You mean , like , pajamas ? "
Working at a large ISP I once got a call from a user who had a new iMac .
He had just gotten an account and wanted to get setup .
I asked him to run the Internet Setup Assistant , but there was no alias to be found in the Apple menu .
That was odd , but , undeterred , I told him to go to Sherlock and try to find the file " Internet Setup Assistant . "
After it scanned the disk he said it did not find the file .
Puzzled I asked him to just search for " Internet Setup . "
Again it scanned and did not find anything .
I was starting to wonder what was going on with this brand new iMac when he asked me , " Would it help if I typed something in the search box ? "
Co-Worker : " This other guy came to me for help with his workstation , and I was wondering if you knew what was up . " ( describes symptoms )
" This other guy came to me for help with his workstation , and I was wondering if you knew what was up . " ( describes symptoms )
Me : " Oh -- I 've seen that before .
Try typing in this command and see if that helps . "
Later ....
Co-Worker : " I typed in that command , and it did n't do any good . "
" I typed in that command , and it did n't do any good . "
Me : " Now , did you type this on YOUR machine or the machine of the person who was having the problem ? "
" Now , did you type this on YOUR machine or the machine of the person who was having the problem ? "
Co-Worker : ( pause ) " Oh . "
A user trying to install new software :
Customer : " I 'm having a problem here .
Do I put the serial number in the box that says ' serial number , ' or do I put it in the box that says ' company ' ? "
I was teaching an email course to novice users -- some of them I was explaining how to enter contact information in the address book , so the program could " look it up " for them .
Bad choice of words .
Student : " So it 'll look up phone numbers for me ? "
" So it 'll look up phone numbers for me ? "
Me : " That 's right . "

I asked a user once for the Windows 98 CD that came with her computer .
She handed me a copy of Office 97 .

In high school , I was the production editor of the school newspaper .
One of my jobs was to take all the articles written by the students and arrange them in the final format using a desktop publisher .
Students were to save them in a specific directory on a network drive and write the filenames on a sheet .
When one day I could not find an article on the sheet , I tracked down the author and asked where it was .
He assured me he had saved it under that filename , and I should be able to find it .
Me : " Where did you save it ? "
" Where did you save it ? "
Him : " Right here on my disk . "

I do network administration and end user support .
A particular clerical person was always having problems running Windows for Workgroups .
The hard drive finally crashed , and when we got it back I convinced the boss to load her machine with DOS only .
I created a batch file menu , tested it , and then compiled it into an exe file .
When the person was at lunch I installed it on her machine .
When she came back from lunch she called and said her computer did n't work .
I asked her to read the screen to me .
She said " Bad Command or File Name . "
So I went over to her desk .
We started her machine and the file menu screen came up .
It read :
1. Main Frame
2. Word Processing
Press the number of your choice and hit [ enter ] .
It looked right , so I told her to press either 1 or 2 depending on whether she wanted to go to the main frame or the word processing package .
She pressed 4 .
And , of course , we got the error .
When I asked her why she pressed 4 , she said , " It says press the number of my choice !
I choose 4 ! "
Is n't it amazing how people can forget even the simplest things when they 're sitting in front of a computer ?

I used to work as a salesman in a computer shop .
About five minutes before closing time a customer came in .
He was quite a frequent visitor and usually also quite an annoying one .
This time he wanted a parallel cable to go from the computer to the printer switchbox .
He got it and left .
About ten minutes after our closing time , the telephone rang .
I picked it up , and sure enough , it was this customer , angry and insisting that I had sold him the wrong cable .
I was convinced I had n't , so I asked him what kind of connectors he needed .
Him : " Female 25 - pin on one end , and Male 25 - pin on the other . "
" Female 25 - pin on one end , and Male 25 - pin on the other . "
Me : " Yeah , ok , and what do you have ?

Him : " Erm...hmm ... that would be all . " ( click )

One day I was leading a team of three people working on a new application .
Input data for our application came on an old reel to reel tape .
Our data center was in the basement , a bit of a walk .
I handed the tape to one guy and asked him to take it down there and put it on drive 381 .
Upon his return we tried to access it but could n't .
I asked him to check it ( perhaps the tape did n't load properly for some reason ) .
He returned five minutes later , confirming that the tape was on 381 .
Still , it did n't work .
Finally I went down there myself .
I got to drive 381 and discovered the tape was lying ON TOP of the tape drive .

While working in tech support , a user called me with a problem with their PC .
I would ask her to look at something , and she 'd set the phone down and walk across the room and then come back .
Realizing it would take forever to troubleshoot the problem that way , I told her it would be easier if she could be on the phone and doing the commands at the same time .
I asked if there was a phone closer to the machine .
She said that there was , and I asked her to transfer me to that extension .
She did .
The phone rang and rang and rang , and there was no answer .
I called her back and told her .
She said , " Oh ... you wanted me to answer it ? "
I think she thought I could fix her problem through a ringing telephone .

He said the computer was n't working .
I asked for more details , and he said the monitor was dead , and there was no picture on the screen .
After a few minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong , I called my assistant and asked what he did to the customer 's computer .
He said , " Nothing .
I still have it right here . "
The customer was using release 1 of Windows 95 , and I was using Windows 98 , so I had to ask her a question about what her Explorer window looked like .

I work in a computer store .
One day , at 1 pm , a customer walked up to the counter .

Customer : " How long is the 14 foot ethernet cable ? "
Someone complained that her monitor was " all green . "
The problem , I guessed , was due to the monitor cable not being correctly connected , so that the red and blue pins were n't making contact .
I talked her through the checking process , but she was adamant that the cable was correctly plugged in .
Somewhat puzzled , I decided to visit her office .
Sure enough , the cable was n't correctly inserted .
She 'd forced it in and bent some pins .
I pointed it out , and she said with some astonishment , " It was n't like that a moment ago ! "
I fixed it , then asked what it had been like before .
She said that the plug had been a different shape .
I finally figured out what she meant .
She had been checking the other end of the cable , where it plugs into the desktop chassis .
I pointed this out to her .
She said , quote , " Oh ! I did n't know it had two ends ! "

" How do they get the box into the computer ? "
I cracked up in his face and have n't been welcome there since .
Apparently he thought that to install software you had to get the box in there somehow .
Customer : " I 'm having a problem installing your software .
I 've got a fairly old computer , and when I type ' INSTALL ' , all it says is ' Bad command or file name ' . "

I recently overheard this family conversation :
My Mother - In - Law : " The computer you have works , right ? "
" The computer you have works , right ? "
My Husband : " Yes , it 's brand new , why ? "
" Yes , it 's brand new , why ? "
My Mother - In - Law : " Well I was wondering if I could put mine like that . "
" Well I was wondering if I could put mine like that . "
My Husband : " What do you mean ? "
" What do you mean ? " My Mother - In - Law : " Well the big box , it 's on the wrong side . "
" Well the big box , it 's on the wrong side . "
My Husband : " What big box ? "
" What big box ? "
My Mother - In - Law : ( pointing to the CPU case ) " That one . "
( pointing to the CPU case ) " That one . "
My Husband : " I do n't know what you mean . "
" I do n't know what you mean . "

" So that means I can put the printer anywhere too ? "
My Husband : ( chuckling ) " Yeah , Mom . "

At our company we have asset numbers on the front of everything .
They give the location , name , and everything else just by scanning the computer 's asset barcode or using the number beneath the bars .

One day , there were several brand new 386SX - 16 machines with Microsoft Works and the like installed .
The librarian wanted to know how to use all the neat stuff on it , so I showed her , spending a good fifteen minutes showing her how to use the word processor , spreadsheet , and other fun programs .
All this time she stared and nodded , apparently soaking up all the information .
Satisfied , I asked her if she had any questions .
Her : " How do you move that little arrow around the screen ? "
Tech Support : " Ok , please click on ' Start ' and move the mouse up to ' Settings ' . "
" Ok , please click on ' Start ' and move the mouse up to ' Settings ' . "

I 'm the I.S. manager of a small manufacturing company .
Recently , I had a user approach me to ask if she could open her own " things " on someone else 's computer .
Tech Support : " Yes , just log in as yourself . "
" Yes , just log in as yourself . "
User : " How do I do that ? "
" How do I do that ? " Tech Support : " Just type the name you usually use where it says ' Name ' , and your usual password . "
" Just type the name you usually use where it says ' Name ' , and your usual password . "
User : " Oh , ok .
But how does the computer know it 's me and not [ the person who normally uses the machine ] ? "
Two days later , I received a similar call from another employee .
Tech Support : " Yes , just log in as yourself . "
" Yes , just log in as yourself . "
User : " With my name , you mean ? "
" With my name , you mean ? " Tech Support : " Yes , that 's right . "
" Yes , that 's right . "
User : " So how does the computer know that I 'm using it and not [ the person who normally uses the machine ] ? "
Shaking my head somewhat , I settled down to do some network maintenance , when lo and behold YET ANOTHER user rang .
User : " I need to access my files whilst I cover reception .
Can I do that ? "
" I need to access my files whilst I cover reception .
Can I do that ? "
Tech Support : " Yes , if you get [ receptionist ] to log off and just log on as yourself . "
" Yes , if you get [ receptionist ] to log off and just log on as yourself . "
User : " But wo n't I get [ receptionist 's ] stuff ? "
" But wo n't I get [ receptionist 's ] stuff ? "
Tech Support : " No , if you log on with your name , you 'll get your own things . "
" No , if you log on with your name , you 'll get your own things . "
User : " Oh , ok .
How does it know whose things to display ? "
This question and answer has now been submitted to the company newsletter .
So there I was , working at the help desk of a medical facility , when I received a phone call from a doctor who had forgotten his password to log into a workstation .
I reset the password to 54321 and told him that 's what I had done .
I was astonished to hear five tones sounding out over the phone line .
Me : " Are you typing into the phone ? "
" Are you typing into the phone ? "
Him : " Oh , heh heh .
I 'm supposed to type this on the computer , are n't I ? "
My father works for a multinational company and he is the manager of a project that implements a new sales support system in the entire region he is operating in .
The program itself is a distributed database , allowing individual users to make their own updates on their laptop PCs and then uploading their changes to a server as well as downloading all the changes the other users have made .
When he wrote the instructions to the sales representatives on how to do this he got the letter back from one of the regional offices with complaints .
His original instructions read like this :
From the File menu , select OS - Shell .
This will make your screen look like this : C: \SPS \WIN
Now type DOWNLOAD to ... , blah , blah , blah , etc , etc .
The hand - written remark on the sheet of paper was : " These instructions are incorrect and can not be followed !
Right after C: \SPS \WIN , a strange bracket ( > ) pops up and it will not go away ! "
For reasons too involved and irrelevant to explain , a friend of mine had possession had a copy of a nasty program on a floppy .
It would erase the entire hard drive of whatever computer it was loaded on .
The floppy was labelled " INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS " and kept in a locked box at his store .
One day , a man he had hired to work at the store found it and popped it into the company 's computer and turned it on .
Would n't you know it -- the hard drive was erased .
His explanation was , " I wanted to see what it would do . "
One day a friend of mine called me up to tell me he was thinking of buying a computer .
This guy is particularly sensitive to criticism and not to exactly in the upper eschelon of the IQ range , and personally I do n't think he should own a programmable VCR much less a computer , but he 's a good guy , so I said " good for you . "
The following conversation ensued :
Him : " Well I have a couple questions though , that I thought I should ask you , cause you know about those things , right ? "
" Well I have a couple questions though , that I thought I should ask you , cause you know about those things , right ? "
Me : " Yeah , ok , what do you want to know ? "
" Yeah , ok , what do you want to know ? "
Him : " Well ... what one should I buy ? "
" Well ... what one should I buy ? "
Me : " What do you want to do with it mostly ?
Play games , word processsing ( blah blah blah ) ...? "
Twenty minutes later ....
Him : " Well , I think probably I should get a real fast one , you know , cause I want it to go fast so I do n't have to wait for the Internet . "
I proceed to explain , SLOWLY , about the difference between megahertz and modem speed , which takes another twenty minutes .
Him : " So how much is this going to cost me anyway ? "
" So how much is this going to cost me anyway ? "
Me : " It all depends on what you want .
Some stuff costs more .
( Now , let me say here that at the very begining of all this I had stated that neither a monitor nor a printer would come with a computer itself , unless you went for a package deal .
He was , at this point saying that he wanted to spend about $ 500 and that everything had to be from the same manufacturer .
This was when the 550 P3 had just come out , so prices were still higher than $ 500 for any system you could go buy in a Circuit City , which he said he HAD to do . )
Him : " Well , you know , I just want the basic stuff , a monitor , and a printer and a scanner , and maybe a camera , plus the stuff to make cards and print photos and all that , and the stuff to take care of paying my bills , and online . "
" Well , you know , I just want the basic stuff , a monitor , and a printer and a scanner , and maybe a camera , plus the stuff to make cards and print photos and all that , and the stuff to take care of paying my bills , and online . "
Me : " Ok , well , you need to get a system first , then think about the extras .
You really need to learn the basics first .
A computer with a monitor and a printer is probably going to be a minimum of $ 800 to $ 1000 , if you really want them all to be from the same company . "

Him : " REALLY ?!
Well , ok , but I probably will need two printers , so it 'll be more then , huh ? "
" REALLY ?!
Well , ok , but I probably will need two printers , so it 'll be more then , huh ? "
Me : " What ? "
" What ? "
Him : " Yeah , you can do that , right , hook up two of the same printer to one computer ? "
" Yeah , you can do that , right , hook up two of the same printer to one computer ? "
Me : " Well ...NO , you can't . "
" Well ...NO , you can 't . "
Him : " But I 'll need to do that ! "
" But I 'll need to do that ! "
Me : " No , really , you wo n't .
Why do you think that ? "
" No , really , you wo n't .
Why do you think that ? "
Him : " Ok , wait , I know , what about two computers ?
Can you do that ?
Can you hook two computers together ? "
" Ok , wait , I know , what about two computers ?
Can you do that ?
Can you hook two computers together ? "
Me : " But ... why ?
No . "
" But ... why ?
No . "
Him : " But I am going to NEED that !
You can't do that for me ? ! "
" But I am going to NEED that !
You can't do that for me ? ! "
Me : " Ok , ya know what , what the hell are you talking about ?!?
No one ever NEEDS to do what you are talking about doing so why do you think you need to do this ?!? "
" Ok , ya know what , what the hell are you talking about ?!?
No one ever NEEDS to do what you are talking about doing so why do you think you need to do this ?!? "
Him : " Well , when I go to print out that manuscript I 'm going to write , it 'll probably be like 800 pages or so , so how am I ever going to get one printer to print that much , and one computer probably can't even hold that much in one thing right ? "
Inside I was going ballistic at this point , and it did boil over , especially since there is NO WAY there is 800 pages worth of anything in this guy 's head , but I explained that ( a ) one computer can in fact " hold " that much and a whole lot more , and ( b ) one printer ( unless it is a huge Xerox or other office type industrial machine ) CAN'T hold that much paper in one shot .
I hope that none of you nice tech support people never EVER get a call from this guy , because I guarantee you it will be the worst call you ever get in your life .
You guys may all have to get together and dedicate a page to him , posting only his calls , just to vent your anger .
He is the cupholder guy , the NOSMOKE.EXE guy , the guy who insists he " has n't changed anything " when he really edited his AUTOEXEC .
BAT and CONFIG .
SYS to include lines like " and do n't say I 'm bad and an invalid , " and the guy who has everything plugged in but nothing where it is supposed to be plugged in .
He WILL have his powerstrip plugged into itself and will insist that it is NOT .
May the force be with you all ; you 'll need it .
I 've been a fan of Overheard in New York for a while .
At some point , it occurred to me that each quote has a pretty precise location attached to it and that it would be cool to plot all of them on a map .
I eventually got motivated enough to actually do it .
The result is overplot , a Google Maps API - powered visualization of all of the quotes I could get my hands on .
Technical Details
The most basic issue with implementing this is geocoding all of the location strings ( like " Canal & Broadway " ) to a latitude / longitude pair .
When I began this , the best option seemed to be geocoder.us .
While it was good enough for prototyping , it quickly became apparent that the quality of data was not good enough .
The most severe problem seemed to be that addresses in the southern part of Manhattan were off by half a block to the northwest .
Thankfully , a few weeks after I began working on this , Google added a geocoding component to their API .
Their geocoder turned out to be much faster and reliable .
It is not perfect , but since the set of addresses is pretty tightly constrained , I was able to add some rewriting rules to make the input more easily parsed .
As of right now , 54 % of the addresses are geocoded .
One remaining issue is that some the locations are actually business ( like " Saks Fifth Avenue " ) .
I may be able to use the Google AJAX Search API to do local searches for them and get their actual addresses .
I did n't want to directly scrape the HTML of the site to extract all of the quotes .
I ended up using the data stored in Google Reader 's archive of the site 's feed .
This allowed me to get at the quotes themselves more easily , without having to worry about the chrome of the site .
Going back to October 6 , 2005 , I had in hand 5,578 quotes at 2838 locations .
Since I had accumulated so many quotes , indicating them with the standard marker object had performance problems since so many can be visible in the same area .
This is a well - known problem with the version 2 of the Maps API , and the traditional solution is clustering .
However , that does n't really make sense because when zoomed in at the street level , one has no choice but to display the hundred or so markers that are visible at the same time ( the southern part of Manhattan is particularly densely covered ) .
In the end , my solution was to do my own marker implementation .
Instead of each marker being its own overlay , I put all of them in the same overlay ( see the QuotesOverlay class ) .
Additionally , I did not split each marker into several layers ( shadow , image , click area ) - having the shadow be part of the image works well enough .
In order to deal with clicks while in the shadow of an info window , I added a global click handler that checks if the click event falls in the boundaries of a marker ( see the handleMapClick ) .
Finally , I hide and show markers so that only those bounded by the currently viewed area are displayed .
All of this led to a performance improvement by a factor of 8 on Firefox Mac .
I then ran into a user interface problem .
Even with marker rendering being efficient , when zoomed out the island of Manhattan becomes a sea of red , which is not very useful .
I decided that switching to a neighborhood mode made more sense there .
The problem was where to get the neighborhood boundaries .
The map used in cabs seemed like a good start , but it made some interesting choices ( e.g. TriBeCa was not bounded by Canal St. ) .
New York Magazine 's map also turned out to be of dubious quality ( e.g. it combined Gramercy and Murray Hill ) .
In the end , the best resource turned out to be the Wikipedia 's list .
Even there there is some debate ( an mild edit war on the souther border of Spanish Harlem - 86th or 96th street - appears to be going on ) .
I 'm not entirely satisfied with the current divisions , but they generally make sense .
Once I actually plotted the 28 neighborhoods on the map , I noticed that it was slow to redraw , especially in Firefox .
I was using GPolyline s to draw the neighborhood outlines , one per area .
Possily due to the switch to SVG for polyline rendering , this seemed to have high overheard .
In the end , similarly to my solution to the marker performance problem , I switched to a single overlay for all neighborhood outlines .
Inside this overlay I used a canvas object to do my own rendering .
To deal with MSIE 's lack of a canvas implementation , I used the ExplorerCanvas implementation of the interface on top of MSIE's VML API .
The site loads all of the data upfront ( in a 728 K almost - but - not - quite JSON file ) .
This allowed me to do a simple client - side search that works pretty quickly once all of the quotes are tokenized ( done the first time a search is executed ) .
Update on 12/17/2012 : The code , including the scraping / generation tools is now available on GitHub .
Update on 12/1/2013 : I have migrated the web UI from v2 to v3 of the Google Maps API ( the v2 API was deprecated a few years after overplot was released ) .
However , none of the tools used in data generation ( geocoding , neighborhood boundary drawing , etc. ) have been migrated .
Additionally , I did a minimal migration , and have not investigated if any of the performance hacks that I did in 2006 ( e.g. a custom overlay for drawing lots of markers ) are still necessary .
A MANUFACTURING process that can print you a pair of bespoke shoes could put an end to ill - fitting footwear and help usher in an era of mass customisation .
The tailored shoes are built layer by layer using a form of rapid 3D printing called selective laser sintering , in which a laser fuses together particles of a nylon - based material ( New Scientist , 4 June 2005 , p 26 ) .
Initially the system will be used to make shoes for professional sportspeople such as British Premiership soccer players , says Greg Lever - O’Keefe , creative director and co-founder of Prior 2 Lever ( P2L ) , the London - based company launching …

Interested in who your spouse is talking to ?

The Chicago Police Department is warning officers their cell phone records are available to anyone — for a price .
Dozens of online services are selling lists of cell phone calls , raising security concerns among law enforcement and privacy experts ….
How well do the services work ?
The Chicago Sun-Times paid $ 110 to Locatecell.com to purchase a one - month record of calls for this reporter ’s company cell phone .
It was as simple as e-mailing the telephone number to the service along with a credit card number .
The request was made Friday after the service was closed for the New Year ’s holiday .
On Tuesday , when it reopened , Locatecell.com e-mailed a list of 78 telephone numbers this reporter called on his cell phone between Nov. 19 and Dec. 17 .
The list included calls to law enforcement sources , story subjects and other Sun - Times reporters and editors .
I hate it when the Boss starts talking about best practices in software engineering .
He thinks it makes him sound like he knows what he 's talking about .
We think it makes him sound like he 's been bought lunch by a software vendor or he wandered onto a techie web site whilst looking for smut .
This time he 's decided that code reviews are exactly what we need .
I explain patiently that code reviews were tried by the Boss before him and failed , but he 's not convinced .
Even when I explain that the Boss before him was carried out of the building by paramedics he 's adamant .
So , here I am , sitting in an unfamiliar office , surrounded by unfamiliar people , working on unfamiliar projects .
I hate having to come upstairs .
I 'm sitting with Derek , a project leader , and Megan , one of his team .
They look as happy as I do .
I 've been here for five minutes and so far the we've discussed the possibility of rain six times and the state of the roads four times .
The Boss arrives finally .
A big hearty grin on his face .
Yep , it has the desired effect of instantly bonding us as a team .
' This should definitely not be a confrontational meeting , ' he announces .
' This is about swapping experiences ?
learning from each other ?
fruitful cross-pollination …'
' I thought it was about looking at code , ' Megan interrupts two minutes later .
' It is , it is , ' the Boss assures her .
' But in the process of sharing code we can learn from each other , pass on the benefits of previous experience .
It 's about process improvement .
It 's about … '
'… time we started , ' I suggest .
The Boss looks deflated .
I guess there 's at least another ten minutes of verbiage that he 's got lined up .
' Agreed , ' Derek adds helpfully .
' We 've only got this room booked for another forty - five minutes . '
' Yes , good point .
So , let 's just dive in , ' the Boss says excitedly .
Megan , Derek and I all turn towards him and wait .
' Are n't we starting ? '
' We are , ' I point out .
' You do n't think I should sit in ? ' he asks hopefully .
Vigorous shaking of heads on our side .
' To be honest , ' I tell him gently , 'it 's likely to be a bit technical . '
' It 's Java code , ' Derek adds .
' Twenty pages of it , ' Megan chimes in .
And then I deliver the killer blow .
' There are no pictures . '
The Boss looks frightened now .
' Not even a diagram ? '
' No , ' I tell him .
' We decided that PowerPoint was banned from code reviews .
The code needs to speak for itself . '
Nods all round from our side of the table .
' Perhaps I 'll give this one a miss , ' the Boss finally concedes .
' My Java 's a bit rusty to tell the truth . '
' Well , ' I tell the others once the Boss has gone , 'if we ever need to do a code review on a three line DOS batch file we 'll know who to call . '
Twenty minutes later I 'm knee deep in code and struggling .
Derek 's decided that he does n't need to sit through another boring meeting , and once Megan is happy that I 'm not about to knife her in the back he disappears .
Megan explains that the code I 'm looking at was part of a maintenance release on an existing product .
It 's part of the start - up code but the complexity of it is way over the top .
' So , ' I say , ' let me get this right .
You 've got a splash screen and a progress bar and this bit of code is spawned to a separate thread to grab the environment details .
Right ?'
Megan nods .
' And there 's a settings file which contains everything you need .
Right ?'
Another nod .
' It 's an XML file stored in the user 's settings directory . '
' So you grab the file , check that it 's well - formed , validate against a schema and then transform the contents into text . '
' We store the XSLT file with the program code . '
' And you check that for well formedness and validity as well I see . '
' Ca n't be too careful , ' she says .
' And then , once you 've got the transformed text you read a set of simple properties and feed these back to the rest of the application . '
' Yep . '
' The code 's spot on , ' I remark .
Megan blushes .
' Well , I admit I did clean it up a bit yesterday . '
' Good use of comments . '
' Thanks .
I added those this morning .'
' But you 'll delete them after this meeting ? '
She nods .
' Buggered if I 'm going to maintain them . '
' There is just one thing … '
' Yes ? '
' You do n't think it 's a bit over - engineered ? '
' Absolutely .
All it needs is a two line properties file .
All this extra stuff is way too much . '
' So why do it the hard way ? '
' Because we 've been told that XML is the company standard for all configuration files .
Even when we only need a couple of properties we 've got to wrap them in XML . '
' But that still leaves a lot of extra complexity in what you 've coded . '
' That 's another spin - off from a company policy they 're trialling with our team . '
' What 's that ?'
' Productivity 's being measured in lines of code .
The more lines we code the more productive we are .'
I ponder on this for a few seconds .
' There is one thing that I think could improve your code , ' I tell her finally .
' The XSL file , it 's not likely to change very much is it ?'
' No , not really . '
' Then why do n't you create the file in code , spool it out at run-time and then read it back when you do the transform . '
She nods thoughtfully .
' I had n't thought of that , ' she admits .
' And while you 're at it , why use a transform at all ?
I 'm sure you could knock up your own custom XML parser class … '
' Thanks , I 'll do that . '
' You see , ' I tell her , ' these code reviews really do work .
Experience being passed on to a new generation .
Best practices here we come .
At least until they figure out that lines of code is the crappest measure known to human - kind . '
Ah. David Leonhardt writes :
This Glass Is Half Full , Probably More - New York Times : David Leonhardt : Wages have n't been falling ....
Up and down the economic spectrum , they have been higher in the last few years than they were at any point in the 1980's or 90's , according to inflation - adjusted numbers from the Economic Policy Institute .
The median Kansas worker made $ 13.43 an hour in 2004 , 11 percent more than in 1979 , which might help explain why many people do n't vote on bread - and - butter issues anymore .
Now , an 11 percent raise over the course of a generation -- which is similar to the national increase -- is not especially impressive .
It 's certainly smaller than the increase workers received in the 25 years leading up to 1979 , and for the last few years , wages have not risen at all .
But they did rise during the 1990's boom , and pretending otherwise does not jibe with most people 's experiences ....
Many luxuries of earlier generations -- owning a three - bedroom house , flying across the country , calling relatives who live overseas -- are staples of middle - class life .
If all this does n't add up to a rise in living standards , I 'm not sure what the phrase means ...
This is not right .
Our three - bedroom houses are further out from the center than our parents ' smaller houses were .
We spend a lot more time stuck in traffic .
I 'm higher up in the American income distribution now than my parents were when I was my children 's age , but I could n't touch their house .
I certainly believe that my family is better off now than we were back then , but this is because I very much like the replacement of book - intellectual - culture by internet - intellectual - culture that has accompanied the extraordinary technological revolutions in computers and communications .
Others with different preferences would think differently .
To try to balance and appropriately weight all the changes of the past generation , we construct index numbers : median national real hourly wages up $ 1.25 --11 % -- since 1979 ; but median national real hourly wages for males down $ 0.50 --3%-- since 1979 .
And real hourly wages for males at the 95th percentile up by $ 10 an hour - - 30 % .
Men with less than a high school diploma : down from $ 13.93 of today 's dollars an hour in 1979 to $ 11.04 today .
Men with just a high school diploma : down from $ 16.32 to $ 15.07 .
Men with some college but not a bachelor 's degree : up from $ 16.98 to $ 17.03 .
Women with less than high school : down from $ 8.94 to $ 8.547 .
Women with high school : up from $ 10.60 to $ 11.87 .
Women with some college : up from $ 11.38 to $ 13.60 .
To get an even half - complete picture of what has been happening in the middle of the income distribution over the past generation , you need to know four more things in addition :
First , at least as important as the ( small ) rise in median wages and salaries since the 1970s has been a large rise in risk : Peter Gosselin makes a convincing case that America 's middle class is anxious today because it knows that its middle - class status is surprisingly fragile .
See http://delong.typepad.com/teaching_spring_2006/2006/02/covering_the_ec.html
Second , these real wage numbers have been calculated using the CPI -- the consumer price index .
Use of the CPI understates economic growth : as relative prices change , people substitute toward items that become cheaper ( i.e. , iPods ) and away from items that become more expensive ( i.e. , houses with short commuting times ) , and so wind up better off than CPI - based measures of real income indicate .
How much is this effect worth ?
My guess is between half a percent and a percent a year -- say ten to twenty five percent since 1979 .
See http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Comments/FRBSF_fast_growth.html.
Third , to the extent that income is a relative rather than an absolute concept -- and to a big extent income is a relative rather than an absolute concept -- America 's middle class will become discontented when the gap between them and America 's rich overclass widens .
The gap between America 's middle class and the rich overclass has widened extraordinariy over the past generation .
And this is , I think , doing a lot to mask increasing absolute living standards .
Fourth , America over the past generation has done a lousy job in translating the inventions of our scientists and engineers into boosts to the living standards of average Joes and Janes .
Eleven percent over twenty - five years is only about one - fourth of what we would have seen , given underlying technological progress , if the relative income distribution had remained the same .
In sum , Leonhardt says that median incomes have risen by eleven percent and that this makes today " the best of times in many ways .
Americans are wealthier than previous generations ... enjoy a higher standard of living .
The good old days simply were n't as good as the present day .... [ B ]y most broad measures -- wages , average life span , crime , education levels , home ownership and racial and gender equality , to name a few - - life in this country has clearly improved over the last generation . "
It 's much more complicated than that : America 's middle class sees itself as insecure - - a feature that does n't show up in averages or medians but that is very important in assessing welfare .
It sees itself as facing a broader gap than ever between it and the overclass -- which means that the children of the overclass are starting life 's race with an even bigger head start .
And as for Leonhardt 's belief that " up and down the economic spectrum , [ wages ] have been higher in the last few years than they were at any point in the 1980's or 90's , " that 's not quite right : you can't claim that real wages and salaries for white males without much education are any higher today than they were a generation ago .
It 's not that we are in general poorer than we were a generation ago ( although unskilled males probably are ) .
It 's that we 've been wasting a great deal of the potential benefits that should have accrued to us from the ongoing march of science and technology .
Now Leonhardt wants to take this in a political direction :
Democratic politicians just do n't seem comfortable talking about the ways that overall living standards have risen , focusing instead on the recent stagnation in wages for rank - and - file workers .
" We do talk negative about the economy , " Rep. Rahm Emanuel , an Illinois Democrat , told me yesterday , adding that it comes in part with being the opposition party .
There is a fear that any good news will somehow help President Bush , and there is also the admirable liberal tradition of agitating for the little guy , a tradition that helped end the Depression , crush Jim Crow and open up the economy to women .
But the Democrats ' approach has a downside .
With Mr. Bush less popular than he has ever been , they have become even more downbeat about the economy at a time when more than half of Americans rate it as good ....
A couple of weeks ago , the spokesman for one House candidate went one better , saying : " This economy is terrible .
Republicans are using lies , damn lies and statistics to say otherwise . "
In a country founded on optimism , this is a tough sell ...
But Leonhart gives no examples .
Democratic politicians say stridently that George W. Bush has mismanaged the economy -- as he certainly has .
But John Kerry does n't think the country is worse off than in the 1970s .
Rahm Emmanuel certainly does n't buy into Leonhardt 's proposition that the country is worse off and poorer than it was back in the 1970s .
And dollars will get you doughnuts that the unnamed " spokesman for one House candidate " does n't do so either .
In fact , Leonhardt quotes only one Democratic politician at any length :
Senator Barack Obama , an Illinois Democrat , has become something of a rock star in the last two years , and I think a big reason is that he speaks eloquently about all the economic progress the country has made and all the problems it faces .
When you listen to him , you have no doubt that too many people are still struggling ....
But Mr. Obama does n't confuse the new insecurity with a general decline in the quality of life , and he insists ... that doing nothing about disappearing pensions and blue - collar jobs is simply not an option .
" It 's not how our story ends -- not in this country .
America is a land of big dreamers and big hopes , " he said at a college graduation last year .
" And it is because our dreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united , more prosperous and more admired than before . "
I was taught in high school to be very distrustful of people who have no examples to cite : if you are going to criticize the Whig interpretation of history , you had better know something about some Whig historians .
So I emailed David Leonhardt to find out which Democratic politicians he was thinking of .
His reply :

Here ’s how I learned to run the night shift at the Oranim bakery when I was a teenager .
First , you do an awful lot of cleaning .
A few months of cleaning dough off of machines gives you a really good understanding of what the machines are and how they work and what parts matter .
Then you run the dough mixers for a few months until you get really good at that .
Then you learn to make rolls .
Then they let you run the computers that control the nightly bread production .
If you ’re lucky , the computer will break down once or twice , and you can learn how to do it manually .
That ’s really cool .
Finally , when you ’re really really good , they let you hang around with Yussef on the ovens .
Yussef was about 100 years old and so good at running the ovens it was scary .
When Gabbi tried to show me how to solve the problem of bread sticking to the conveyer belts on the way out of the oven , he ran back and forth like a lunatic for ten minutes , turning knobs , pulling levers , redirecting heat , and burning a few hundred loaves while he struggled to get things under control .
But Yussef , facing the same problem , turned one tiny knob on a seemingly - unrelated chimney about one degree to the right .
It made no sense , he could n’t explain why it worked , but it did : it solved the problem instantly and suddenly perfect loaves started popping out .
It took me another couple of years to really understand the complex relationships between heat and humidity inside an 80 foot tunnel oven , but it would have taken ten more years before I could solve problems as well as Yussef did .
After a year or so doing every job in the bakery , you have credibility with the crew you ’re leading because they all know you could do their job .
You have a complete , holistic understanding of the bakery in a way that no individual does .
You ’ve had a chance to watch good managers and bad , you ’ve experienced a lot of the things that can go wrong and seen how to fix them ( and how not to fix them ) , and you can be trusted to drive a fifty million dollar factory that churns out hundreds of thousands of loaves every night .
So they put you in charge of the night shift .
Although Yussef will probably pretty much ignore you no matter how much you think you know .
I told you that so I can tell you this :
We ’re planning to hire a new kind of employee at Fog Creek .
Until now , most of our hires have been programmers .
That ’s a start , but we need to start hiring the next generation of management too .
Now , there ’s nothing wrong with promoting a programmer to management , but management is a different job and requires different skills from programming .
Many people who are excellent developers are lousy managers , and promoting someone out of a job that they love doing and are good at doing into a job that they hate and are not good at does n’t make sense .
We plan to make sure that programmers have explicit career paths that do not require them to shift into management just to get the next raise in salary level or benefits .
Thus : how do we develop the next generation of managers ?
We do n’t really want to hire MBAs , because there ’s too much evidence that MBAs substitute book - learnin ’ for common sense or experience .
We ’d much rather hire someone who created and ran a profitable lemonade stand than someone who has taken two years of finance courses at Harvard , especially since the Harvard MBA is going to think he knows a lot more than he really does .
Our latest thinking is just to train a new generation of leaders from the ground up .
To that end , today we ’re launching an experimental new program , the Fog Creek Software Management Training Program .
That ’s a terrible name , but bear with me !
It ’s an entry level program , meaning , significant work experience is not required .
A college degree is a big plus .
The program will last about three years .
It will provide experience working in all aspects of software development except for the actual coding itself , along with some formal training .
It ’s a job .
It includes a great starting salary , restricted stock in Fog Creek Software , and the full raft of benefits , from Aeron chairs to free lunch .
You do n’t have to be a programmer or a CS major , although you do have to be ridiculously smart and you have to be the kind of person who gets things done .
The key component of this program is rotating through just about every job at Fog Creek Software .
We ’ll rotate trainees through about ten different jobs over the course of three years :
Project Management
Project Management Tech Support
Inside Sales
Software Testing
Usability Testing
Software Design
Program Management
Beta Management
Marketing
Build Management
… sometimes all on the same day !
The theory is that nothing can better prepare you for leading a high tech company than gaining significant , substantial experience with everything a high tech company does , under the mentorship of experienced veterans .
To supplement that , we ’ll add a component of formal training .
There will be some coursework at nearby colleges , long lists of reading material , intensive offsite training programs , and we ’ll send you to industry conferences that we think are particularly valuable .
Unlike full - time MBA programs , you wo n’t have to pay $ 120,000 in tuition and $ 200,000 in foregone salary .
You ’ll be earning money and if Fog Creek does well your stock may be worth something .
Unlike management consulting , you wo n’t have to work 18 hour days and fly to some small town in the midwest every Monday morning and live out of a suitcase in a hotel .
The idea of this program is to develop a new generation of leaders for Fog Creek , but we think that it will be great preparation for a career leading , running , or starting any kind of high - tech company or team .
If the program is successful we expect , in the long run , to churn out about twice as many graduates as we need for our own purposes , so many will tend to head off to start their own companies , take a high - level position elsewhere in the industry , or go back to graduate school .
Either way we think it ’s a fantastic opportunity for ambitious , smart geeks who do n’t see themselves as programmers .
We ’re taking applications now for the first round of Fog Creek Management Trainees , most of whom will start work in summer 2006 .
To apply , send a letter explaining why you ’re a good fit , a resume , and any standardized test scores to jobs@fogcreek.com .

Cameras onboard Genesis 1 will beam back pictures to Earth
Bigelow Aerospace , the commercial firm behind the Genesis 1 module , confirmed that the ship was in orbit and was beaming pictures back to Earth .
" All systems are operating within expected parameters , " the company founder , hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow , said in a statement .
The water - melon shaped craft could form the basis of a future space hotel .
The craft will remain in orbit for the next five years while engineers test the durability of the design .
One of the key tests for the craft is whether it can maintain a constant temperature and pressure , suitable to support life , inside the inflatable hull .
Old design
The idea of using inflatable spacecraft is not new .
In 1960 The US space agency ( Nasa ) launched Echo , a 30 m ( 100 ft ) diameter communications satellite .
The huge balloon , made of aluminised polyester , was used to bounce radio signals around the Earth .
Later , Nasa worked on an inflatable space habitat , known as Transhab .
The design was tested at the agency 's Johnson Space Center and was mooted as an alternative to the " hard " habitation modules used for the International Space station ( ISS ) .
It 's extremely durable and resistant to any puncture or penetration
Robert Bigelow , Bigelow Aerospace
Inflatable spacecraft are attractive because they take up less space on their launch vehicle than solid components and therefore cost less to place into orbit .
Budget cuts by the US Congress ended the Transhab programme in 2001 , and Bigelow acquired the patents and rights to the design soon after .
Since then , the private company , set up in 1999 , has been evolving Nasa 's design .
Space debris
The first Genesis craft is 4.5 m ( 15 ft ) long and has a diameter of 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) , one - third of the size of a full - scale craft .
It is built around a rigid central core and two solid bulkheads .
The inflatable walls are composed of a range of materials including Kevlar , often used in bullet - proof vests , and a fibrous textile called Vectran .
The craft is strengthened to resist collisions with space debris
On a full - scale module , each wall would be 40 cm ( 16 inches ) thick .
" It 's extremely durable and resistant to any puncture or penetration , " said Mr Bigelow .
To launch the module into space , the craft was carefully folded so that it could be placed into the fairing of the rocket .
It was launched aboard a Dnepr rocket from the Dombarovsky missile base in Siberia on Wednesday .
At 0415 Pacific Time ( 1115 GMT ) scientists and engineers on the ground in the US confirmed that it had reached its target orbit of 550 km ( 340 miles ) and that they had started to communicate with the ship .
The ultimate long - term success of Bigelow 's business rests on lowering the cost of space access
David Salt , Vega
First , solar arrays , necessary to power the onboard telemetry , unfolded before compressed air tanks pushed the concertinaed structure into shape .
The process was complete by 0520 Pacific Time ( 1220 GMT ) .
" We have downloaded several small images from the onboard cameras and hope to get more as more bandwidth in the data stream becomes available , " said Mr Bigelow .
The ship was reported to have an internal temperature of 26C .
Nearly 24 hours after the inflation was complete , Mr Bigelow also confirmed that the hull was maintaining a constant pressure .
This should keep alive the module 's inhabitants , which include cockroaches and Mexican jumping bean moths .
Commercial space
The successful launch is the first of many planned by Bigelow Aerospace .
Two more missions are planned within the next 12 months .
They will carry other inhabitants including ant colonies and scorpions , as well as personal objects , such as photographs , which people can pay the company to put into space .
The Virgin Galactic craft will have space for five passengers
However , according to some space experts , Bigelow 's venture will only succeed if others can provide the transport to get people into space .
" The ultimate long - term success of Bigelow 's business rests on lowering the cost of space access , " said David Salt , a senior consultant and expert on private spaceflight at Vega , an aerospace consultancy .
As a result , Mr Bigelow is offering a $ 50 m prize to anyone that can demonstrate a craft capable of carrying five people to a height of 400 km ( 250 miles ) before 2010 .
" America 's Space Prize " , as it is known , is one of many cash rewards aimed at encouraging private companies to kick - start the commercialisation of space .
Pilots Brian Binnie and Mike Melvill sped into the record books in 2005 when they piloted the rocket plane SpaceShipOne to 100 km twice in a week .
The feat won the $ 10 m Ansari X - Prize for the plane 's design team , led by Burt Rutan .
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has since launched his commercial Virgin Galactic service that will eventually use spaceliners based on the SpaceShipOne concept .
" Bigelow is one of a growing number of ' NewSpace ' entrepreneurial ventures aiming to establish a sustainable and evolving human presence in space , driven by the force of commercial enterprise rather than government programmes , " said Mr Salt .
" The goal and commitment of Bigelow and others is now being taken very seriously . "
Ever since Voyager 1 returned detailed images of Saturn 's F ring back in 1980 , astronomers have struggled to understand its bizarre features .
The F ring , an outer thin wisp of icy material orbiting the giant planet , was discovered in 1979 .
It 's been described as having clumps , strands and braids by various research groups .
An animation released in December showed the features , described as kinks , moving through time .
Turns out none of these descriptions was right , according to a new study using data and images from NASA 's Cassini spacecraft and led by Sebastien Charnoz at the University of Paris .
" These strands , initially interpreted as concentric ring segments , are in fact connected and form a single one - arm trailing spiral winding at least three times around Saturn , " Charnoz and colleagues write in the Nov. 25 issue of the journal Science .
The concept is best explained in an artist 's conception .
Charnoz team made computer simulations to explore the spiral 's origin .
The new explanation raises more questions than it answers .
" The newly reported spiral is in a class by itself , " says Mark Showalter , a SETI Institute researcher who wrote an analysis of the discovery for Science .
And it is changing rapidly .
The spiral wound itself tighter between November 2004 and May 2005 , the Cassini observations show .
It will continue to tighten until the strands blend into a more uniform feature , Showalter said .
Prometheus and Pandora , near the F ring , have long been seen as playing a shepherding role , keeping ring particles together and tugging out the curious features .
But their role is likely more disruptive than shepherding , Showalter now says .
Charnoz and colleagues say a recently discovered small moon catalogued as S/2004 S6 is involved .
This moonlet -- or it may be just a tight clump of material -- can intersect the F ring at high speeds .
But none of these objects fully explains the F ring .
Showalter speculates that some other unknown large object may have collided with the F ring .
The moonlet S/2004 S6 may be a leftover of that collision , he figures .
Saturn 's rings were originally spotted by Galileo shortly after the invention of the telescope .
The astronomer Domenico Cassini discovered the Cassini division in Saturn 's rings in the 17th Century .
The ring system begins from the inside out in this order : D , C , B , A , F , G , E .

On June 29 , the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5 - 3 decision ruled that President Bush ’s effort to railroad tortured Guantanamo Bay detainees in kangaroo courts " violates both U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions . "
Better late than never , but it sure took a long time for the checks and balances to call a halt to the illegal and unconstitutional behavior of the executive .
The Legal Times quotes David Remes , a partner in the law firm of Covington & Burling : " At the broadest level , the Court has rejected the basic legal theory of the Bush administration since 9/11 — that the president has the inherent power to do whatever he wants in the name of fighting terrorism without accountability to Congress or the courts . "
Perhaps the Court ’s ruling has more far - reaching implications .
In finding Bush in violation of the Geneva Conventions , the ruling may have created a prima facie case for charges to be filed against Bush as a war criminal .
Many readers have concluded that Bush assumed the war criminal ’s mantle when he illegally invaded Iraq under false pretenses .
The U.S. itself established the Nuremberg standard that it is a war crime to launch a war of aggression .
This was the charge that the chief U.S. prosecutor brought against German leaders at the Nuremberg trials .
The importance of the Supreme Court ’s decision , however , is that a legal decision by America ’s highest court has ruled Bush to be in violation of the Geneva Conventions .
There are many reasons to impeach Bush .
His flagrant disregard for international law , U.S. civil liberties , the separation of powers , public opinion , and human rights associate Bush with the worst tyrants of the 20th century .
It is true that Bush has not yet been able to subvert all the institutions that constrain his executive power , but he and his band of Federalist Society lawyers have been working around the clock to eliminate the constraints that the U.S. Constitution and international law place on executive power .
Republicans are " outraged " that " liberal judges " have prevented Bush from " protecting us from terrorists . "
In the U.S. Senate , Majority Leader Bill Frist said that Republicans will propose legislation to enable Bush to get around the Supreme Court ’s decision .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) already had a bill ready .
What sense does it make to talk about " liberal opposition " when liberal Republicans like Specter are falling all over themselves to kowtow to Bush ?
Americans are going to have to decide which is the greater threat : terrorists , or the Republican Party ’s determination to shred American civil liberties and the separation of powers in the name of executive power and the " war on terror . "
The rest of the world has already reached a decision .
A Harris Poll recently conducted for the Financial Times found that the populations of our European allies — Britain , France , Italy , and Spain — view the United States as the greatest threat to global stability .
A Pew Foundation survey released the same week found that 60 percent of the British believe that Bush has made the world less safe and that 79 percent of the Spanish oppose Bush ’s war on terror .
Republicans and conservatives equate civil liberties with homosexual marriage , abortion , racial quotas , flag burning , banning of school prayer , and crime resulting from a lax punishment of criminals .
This is partly the fault of the ACLU and left - wingers , who go to extremes to make a point .
But it is also the fault of conservatives , who believe that their government is incapable of evil deeds .
In their dangerous and ill - founded belief , conservatives are in total opposition to the Founding Fathers , who went to the trouble of writing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in order to protect us from our government .
Most conservatives believe that they do not need constitutional protections , because they " are not doing anything wrong . "
Conservatives have come to this absurd conclusion despite the Republicans ’ decision to sell out the Bill of Rights for the sake of temporary power .
A number of important books have recently been published decrying America ’s decaying virtue .
In Lawless World , the distinguished British jurist , Philippe Sands , documents the destruction by George Bush and Tony Blair of the system of international law put in place by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill .
In The Peace of Illusions , Christopher Layne documents the American drive for global hegemony that threatens the world with war and destruction .
Americans are enjoying a sense of power with little appreciation of where it is leading them .
Congress has collapsed in the face of Bush ’s refusal to abide by statutory law and his " signing statements , " by which Bush asserts his independence of U.S. law .
Bush has done what he can to turn the Supreme Court into a rubber stamp of his unaccountable power by placing John Roberts and Samuel Alito on the bench .
Though much diminished by these appointments , the Court found the strength to rise up in opposition to Bush ’s budding tyranny .
Amazingly , on the very same day in England , where our individual rights originated , the High Court struck down Tony Blair ’s " anti-terrorism " laws as illegal breaches of the human rights of suspects .
As with the Bush regime , the Blair regime tried to justify its illegality on the grounds of " protecting the public , " but a far larger percentage of the British population than the American understands that the erosion of civil liberty is a greater threat to their safety than terrorists .
Thus , in the two lands most associated with civil liberties , courts have struck down the tyrannical acts of the corrupt executive .
Perhaps the fact that courts have reaffirmed the rule of law will give hope and renewed strength to the friends of liberty to withstand the assaults on freedom that are the hallmarks of the Bush and Blair regimes .
On the other hand , the two tyrants might ignore the courts as they have statutory law .
What ’s to stop them ?

Eco-car more efficient than light bulb Kart racer Jack Dex , 13 , will drive the Ech2o prototype at this week 's Shell Eco Marathon .
VISIONARIES YOUR SAY LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
An eco-car that can travel the world using a fraction of the electricity it takes to power a light bulb has been unveiled by its British creators .
The hydrogen - powered Ech2o needs just 25 Watts -- the equivalent of less than two gallons of petrol -- to complete the 25,000 - mile global trip , while emitting nothing more hazardous than water , the UK's Press Association reported .
But with a top speed of 30 mph , the journey would take more than a month to complete , even if the car was driven flat out with no pit -stops .
On Thursday Ech2o , built by British gas firm BOC , will bid to smash the world fuel efficiency record of over 10,000 miles per gallon at the Shell Eco Marathon at the Rockingham Raceway track in the UK .
The record is currently held by the PAC - Car II , a hydrogen - fueled Swiss vehicle , that traveled the equivalent of 5,385 km / per liter at a testing track in France .
The BOC Ech2o , which was originally designed to demonstrate fuel efficiency , is a remodeling of the BOC Gh2ost which failed to break the world record in Aberdeen last year .
Unlike most other eco-marathon vehicles that run on petrol or diesel , the BOC Ech2o 's driving force comes from electricity , created in a hydrogen fuel cell .
John Carolin , BOC global director sustainable energy , told the PA : " It sounds unbelievable how little power is used to keep the BOC Ech2o moving , but it demonstrates the impact of careful design and is a valuable lesson for car makers in the future .
" The lessons from this and other projects will show that hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles could be a practical , attractive and a viable economic alternative to diesel or petrol fueled vehicles . "

An investigation by the CNN - IBN news channel showed three doctors taking money from the reporters , who said they were looking for medics to amputate beggars ' limbs .
There appears to be a thriving trade in Delhi where gangs kidnap beggars and force them to undergo surgery so that their deformities attract sympathy .
CNN - IBN news said the price to amputate limbs from healthy patients , an illegal act in India , ranged from 10,000 rupees to 40,000 rupees .
It reported that there were 12,000 " handicapped " beggars in India 's capital .
Police questioned one of the doctors , PK Bansal .
He has denied the allegations .
The two other doctors - Ajay Kumar Agarwal and Arvind Agarwal , the secretary of the Orthopaedic Association of Bareilly in northern India - have disappeared .
Police later dispersed an angry mob outside the home of Arvind Agarwal .
The Indian Medical Association ( IMA ) said , if the reports were true , the licences of accused doctors would be revoked .
" Our Ethics Committee will look into the matter .
This is a heinous crime and we will wait for the legal action .
If these doctors are members of the IMA , their licences will be cancelled , " said the IMA president , Sanjeev Malik .
The medical profession has been under increasing scrutiny from television channels which target corruption .
Many doctors in India are accused of being more interested in money than ethics .
Earlier this year in Punjab , journalists exposed doctors selling organs from poor patients .
Begging is widespread in large Indian cities .
In Mumbai , which is home to some 300,000 beggars , there was uproar in the state assembly when politicians offered the city 's beggars a " better way " to live through the central government 's employment guarantee scheme .
The programme assures 100 days of work every year in return for 60 rupees a day ( about 75 p ) .
Commentators wondered why beggars would leave their trade for such small amounts - it is estimated begging in Mumbai brings in 200 rupees a day .
Root cause analysis is an important activity whenever a problem occurs - whether it is a defect , an operational outage , or something else .
Whatever the problem , your objective should be to not only resolve the issue but also prevent it from reoccurring in the future .
To do this , you need to determine the root cause - the key factor (s ) that caused the problem to occur and that need to change in order to stop it from happening again .
Root cause analysis is essentially a learning exercise , and as such should be a fundamental practice if your objective is perpetual learning or continuous improvement .
It disappoints me to so often see it done poorly or not at all .
The good news is that the ability to do root cause analysis can be trained and improved .
At its essence , root cause analysis involves asking " Why ? " coupled with the determination to find answers that will help permanently resolve or at least improve the situation being dealt with .
To start , you simply ask " Why did the problem happen ? " .
If the answer tells you how to fix the problem but not how to prevent it in the future , then you need to keep asking why .
Even once you start getting more profound answers , you can often continue asking why questions and learn still more .
Asking why is easy - figuring out the answer is hard .
Both analytical and creative thinking skills play a role .
At times you may feel like a detective , ferreting out clues like Sherlock Holmes .
When faced with a question concerning a situation with no apparent answer , I 've found it helpful to brainstorm ideas for what possibly could have led to the situation , and from there try and determine whether each possibility could have occurred .
Root cause analysis is not for the faint - at - heart .
Asking probing questions and searching for answers about why things went wrong can make you unpopular , especially if your investigation involves other teams and other managers .
You need to be careful that your efforts are not perceived as laying blame or trying to score political points by making others look bad .
Instead , emphasize that it is a learning exercise whose purpose is to prevent future occurrences of the problem .
Next week I 'll present some real - life examples of root cause analysis that touch on the above points .
But you do n't have to wait .
You can start practicing root cause analysis today - just ask " Why ? " .

[ Ajax tips ] XMLHttpRequest と If - Modified - Since
RSS リーダーについてさんざん言及されたように、Webコンテンツを取得するアプリケーションでは、
HTTPリクエストに If - Modified - Since ヘッダ をつけるなどして対象コンテンツの更新時刻をチェックし、過剰なデータ取得を避けるのがマナーであるとされている。
同じこと がAjaxについても当てはまると考える。Ajaxでは、ユーザーのアクションと非同期にHTTPリクエストを行うため、RSSリーダーと同様に人為操作を超えるトラフィックを発せさせる可能性があるからだ。
そこで、素朴な疑問 。
・ブラウザは、ユーザーが意識しないでも更新時刻チェックをやってくれる。
・ Ajaxの主なエンジンとな る Javascript は、ブラウザに組み込まれたものである。
・ Javascript の XMLHttpRequestを使用すると、プログラマが明示的にコーディングしなくても、更新時刻チェックを実行してくれるのではないか。
というわけで、簡単な実験をしてみた。概要は次のとおり。
1 ) XMLHttpRequestで適当なWebページを数回GET
2 ) Webサーバのログをみて、更新時刻チェックしているかチェック
なお、対 象Webページは、 「 ブラウザで以前アクセスしたことがあるが、最終更新日時以降はアクセスしていない」状態である。
また、テスト内容は完全なものではなく、あらゆる環境および状況で同様の結果が得られることを保証するものではないのであしからず。
以下、詳細と結果 。
まず、次のようなテスト 用Webページを設置。
index.htmlというHTMLファイル（なんでもいい）を、XMLHttpRequestでGETするだけのJavascriptスクリプトだ。
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
＜html＞
＜head ＞
＜script type =" text / javascript " ＞
function testfunc ( ) {
var xmlhttp = false ;
if ( typeof XMLHttpRequest!='undefined ')
xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ;
else
xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " MSXML2.XMLHTTP " ) ;
xmlhttp.open ( " GET " , ' index.html ' , false ) ;
xmlhttp.send ( null ) ;
document.getElementById( " r " ).innerHTML=xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders ( ) ;
document.getElementById( " c " ).innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText ;
}
＜/script ＞
＜title＞ajax If - Modified - Since test＜/ title＞
＜ /head ＞
＜body ＞
＜button onclick =" testfunc ( ) " ＞click!＜/button＞
＜hr /＞
＜pre id = " r " ＞＜ / pre＞
＜hr /＞
＜div id = " c " ＞＜/div＞
＜ / body ＞
＜/html ＞
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
この Webページのボタンを数回クリックして、Webサーバーのログを見たところ、次の結果となった。
【結果１ ：If-Modified - Since未コーディング】
・ firefox1.0.2の場合
1回目のアクセス→ステータスコード200でGET
2回目以降のアクセス→ステータスコード200でGET
・ IE6 SP1 の場 合
1回目のアクセス→ロギングされない
2回目以降のアクセス→ロギングされない
firefoxでは、更新時刻チェックを行ってくれないようだ。
IEでは、なぜ かWebサーバにアクセスしていないようだ。しかし、XMLHttpRequest.responseTextには値が入っている。ブラウザのローカルキャッシュをそのまま入れているように見受けられる。ブラウザのローカルキャッシュ（インターネット一時ファイル）をいったん削除して、再度テストを行うと、1回目だけは200でGETしてくるが、2回目以降はやはりWebサーバにアクセスしない。ここまではいいが、Webページを編集して更新時刻を変更してから再度テストしても、Webサーバにアクセスせずにローカルのキャッシュを取得し続けてしまう。テストの仕方が悪いのだろうか。この動きはAjaxアプリケーション作成時にやっかいだ。
そこで、こんどは明示的 にIf-Modified - Sinceによる更新時刻処理をコーディングしてみた。Webページのスクリプト部分を次のように変更して、再度テストを実施。
（ロジックはきれいじゃないが。。。）
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
＜script type =" text / javascript " ＞
var last_modified = null ; /*← この行を追加*/
var cached_content = ''; /*← この行を追加*/
function testfunc ( ) {
var xmlhttp = false ;
if ( typeof XMLHttpRequest!='undefined ')
xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ;
else
xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject ( " MSXML2.XMLHTTP " ) ;
xmlhttp.open ( " GET " , ' index.html ' , false ) ;
if( last_modified ) /*← この行を追加*/
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader( " If - Modified - Since " , last_modified ) ; /*← この行を追加*/
xmlhttp.send ( null ) ;
document.getElementById( " r " ).innerHTML=xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders ( ) ;
document.getElementById( " c " ).innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText ;
if(xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders ( ). match ( " Last - Modified " ) ) /*← この行を追加*/
last_modified = xmlhttp.getResponseHeader( " Last - Modified " ) ; /*← この行を追加*/
if(xmlhttp.responseText.length == 0 ) /*← この行を追加*/
document.getElementById( " c " ) .innerHTML
= cached_content ; /*← この行を追加*/
else /*← この行を追加*/
cached_content = xmlhttp.responseText ; /*← この行を追加*/
}
＜/script ＞
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
結果は、次のとおり 。
【結果２：If-Modified - Sinceチェックを明示的にコーディング】
・ firefox1.0.2の場合
1回目のアクセス→ステータスコード200でGET
2回目以降のアクセス→ステータスコード304でGET
・ IE6 SP1 の場 合
1回目のアクセス→ロギングされない
2回目のアクセス→ステータスコード200でGET
3回目以降のアクセス→ステータスコード304でGET
firefox では、それなりの動きになった。
IEでは、firefoxよりワンテンポ遅れたような動きになっている。1回目のアクセスではやはりローカルキャッシュを見ているのだろう。
結果１と結果２から総合すると、IE6SP1の動きは、「 If -Modified - Sinceを付加しない場合、たとえWebページが更新されていても、何度アクセスしてもローカルキャッシュを見に行く。」ように見える。
最後に、スクリプトの 「 var last_modified = null ; 」の部分を 「 var last_modified = " Thu , 01 Jun 1970 00:00:00 GMT " ;」と変更して再度テストを試みた。
結果は、次のとおり 。
【結果３：1回目からIf-Modified - Sinceをつける】
・ IE6 SP1 の場 合
1回目のアクセス→ステータスコード200でGET
2回目以降のアクセス→ステータスコード304でGET
上記のとおり、firefoxと同じ動きになった。
結論としては 、
「 ブラウザ （Javascript）に任せず、If-Modified-Sinceの処理は自分で明示的にコーディングすべし」
となる（当たり前？） 。
追記 ：If-Modified - Sinceを使用してキャッシュを行うXMLHttpRequestラッパーを書いてみた。
補遺
Ajaxアプリケーション作成の際、結果３の方法は十分ではない。それは、結果２においてfirefoxを「それなりの動き」と表現した理由でもある。
上記のスクリプトでは、単純なHTTPリクエストのほかに次のことを実施している。
1 ) Last-Modified情報の保存（次 にIf-Modified - Sinceに利用するため）
2) Webページの内容のキャッシュ
これに加えて、本来は 、
3 ) 1)と2)で保存した内容の永続化（ブラウザを再起動しても前回の内容が保存されている）
が必要だ 。
上記のスクリプトでは、3 ) ができていないので、 「 ブラウザをリロードした らJavascriptが再スタートし、保存しておいたLast-Modified情報がリセットされてしまう」問題を抱えている。この問題を解決するには、次の２つが必要だ。
i ) Javascriptからブラウザのローカルキャッシュ情報（Last-Modifiedなど）にアクセスできること
ii ) XMLHttpRequest でWebコンテンツを取得した場合でも、ブラウザのローカルキャッシュに追加されること
この面については、IEの動きはある意味firefoxより優れている気がする。しかし、対象Webページが更新されていてもIf-Modified-Sinceをつけないかぎりローカルキャッシュを常に見るという動きはなんとかしてほしいところだ。
Ajaxアプリケーションが普及するためには、以上のような処理を、プログラマが意識することなくブラウザ（Javascriptインタプリタ）が調整してくれることが望ましい。何かやり方があるのだろうか。

うーん、httpにはIf-None-Matchもあるし、クライアントとはいえJavaScript側でこのあたりにいちいち対応するのは厳しいでしょう。。。
サーバー側 のLast-Modified やEtagの取り扱いにも振り回されるし。。。 > プログラマが意識することなくブラウザ（Javascriptインタプリタ）が調整してくれることが望ましい。
というのに同意ですね。そのときにはもうxmlhttpとは違うモノになる可能性もなきにしもあらずですが。
投稿者 Ryosuke : April 11 , 2005 09:29 AM
主題ではないですが、、、
XmlHttpRequestは仕様上、同サーバーにしかアクセスできないので、If-Modified-Sinceを付けると言うのはマナーと言うよりも自分自身の首を絞めない為って感じですか
それと、ローカルキャッシュの件は大変な落とし穴ですが、もしかしたらSajaxやRuby on Rails等のフレームワーク部分で対応してくれるたりしないかなぁ(現状未確認）
投稿者 bo : April 11 , 2005 09:57 AM
「 ソフトウェア作成者」のせいで「利用者 」 が「サーバ管理者」にアタックしてしまう構図になります。結果として、「サーバ管理者」が「利用者」に制限をかけてしまい、「利用者」がソフトウェアを使用しなくなることが予想されるので、「作成者」にとっても自分のためにちゃんとしないといけないということですね。

What 's new ?
Like a lot of people , I find that the web is becoming my main source of news .
Some of the sites I read are published by individuals , but I find the most informative sites are those published by groups of writers / editors / correspondents , including those put out by Main Steam Media ( MSM ) .
However for the past three months my main source of “ what ’s new ” has been a new breed of website that collaboratively votes on the best links .
This genre does not have an official name yet , but each of these sites supplies readers with pointers to news items that are ranked by other readers .
None of these sites generates news ; they only point to it by filtering the links to newsy items .
Using different formulas they rank an ever moving list of links on the web .
The velocity of their lists varies by site , but some will have a 100 % turnover in a few days .
I check them daily .
This new genre fits into a whitespace between already occupied niches of social web sites .
In the established center are the group - produced sites such as Slashdot , BoingBoing , WorldChaning , Huffington Post , to name just four very popular ones , where a very small cast of editors ( under a dozen or so ) collaboratively filter and annotate the links to other sources .
A daring and effective extension of this method was devised by the fantastic group at MetaFilter .
Here the editors are a very smart mob of 25,000 users .
One by one readers recommend the cool new stuff they find .
Their filter is simply the emergent one of their collective discretion and taste ; no one votes or ranks links .
At the other end of the axis of collaborative filtering is the likes of Google and Yahoo News , which use the entire collaboration inherent in the web and many Googleish algorithms to programmatically generate a list of what ’s new based on who is linking stuff , the most “ important ” item at the top .
No humans explicitly vote on the items .
These new uncategorized sites , which have emerged this year ( and reviewed below ) , fall in between the positions above .
They take the smart mob approach of MetaFilter and add the algorithms of search engines .
So , readers themselves vote on the importance of linked items suggested by other readers ; these votes are then subjected to a complex formula to produce rankings .
The sites use various flavors of algorithms to balance and refine the votes and selection of smart mobs .
Or they use the action of tagging or bookmarking a site as a type of vote .
Each site uses a different algorithm , yielding slightly different mixes of links , and a different personality .
The best sites maintain a balance between providing a sense of what everyone is reading ( consensus popularity ) and some novel items that not everyone is reading ( yet ) .
In the reviews below I try to capture some sense of distinctive style for each site .
How I use these consensus tools :
By scanning these lists daily I get a fantastic sense of what the web is reading , and an early glimpse of what will reach the MSM in the next day or so .
But most important for me is the large volume of very interesting news that will not become “ news . ”
This is the kind of material that is more interesting than random pages but which lacks an appealing hook to place it on the front page of a magazine or even a news website .
Often these items are timeless ; they do n’t make the front page because they could be run at any time .
But they are more valuable than odd curiosities .
Because of the voting , tagging , bookmarking process enough people find the item worthwhile that they rise to notice .
What emerges for me is a delightful counter - news , or what we used to call at CoEvolution Quarterly , “ news that stays news . ”
I have encountered no other process in the world that is better at surfacing “ news that stays news ” and “ news that will be news ” better than these collaborative filtering sites .
I imagine in the near future there will be many dozens , if not hundreds , of tweaks on this scheme .
Readers will gravitate to a formula that suits their own personal taste .
Inevitably , there ’ll be some meta-operation that will seek out the overlaps among all the collab - voting sites and extract its own meta - list .
Or , eventually , you ’ll be able to tweak your own mix of others ’ votes to roll your own collabvote site .
Given the rate of innovation , I ’m sure I ’ve missed some already in progress .
If you find a new one at all useful , let me know about it .
— KK
*
Digg
My first stop .
I only look at their top stories page , an approach which some devotees find whimpy ; true Diggers look at the real - time stream of suggested items before they have too many votes .
*
Reddit
If I had to pick only one of these I would pick Reddit .
It gives me the best balance between the lesser - seen and the over - seen .
Some folks do n’t like it because users can down - vote items which may make the list more manipulated .
But I feel it brings me a little more variety than Digg .
I find I click on more stories here than any other consensus site .
*
NewsVine
I have their science thread bookmarked .
It ’s the best link for breaking science news .
And their world news thread is very fine too .
( I find the their top story thread to be polluted by popularity . )
*
Fantacular
A new one .
Still learning its personality , but so far it delivers fairly techie posts , closer to Slashdot themes .
It does not churn as fast as Slashdot or Digg and Reddit .
*
180 News
Good for getting the latest news in the last five minutes .
There ’s no attempt to weed out duplicates , as in say Google News , so you get a raw stream of voted items , many of them the same story reported by different sources .
Their technology stream resembles the mix of Fantacular and Digg , but faster .
I also like their World News bookmark .
It feels like Yahoo or Google news , but still faster .
*
Gather
The type of stories that rise to the top here reminds me of a cross between Reader ’s Digest and NPR ’s Weekend Edition — light , offbeat , humorous , encouraging , sometimes odd , inspiring .
If you like a collaborative group hug , this is your place .
It ’s just not me .
*
The above websites use voting to rank links to other sites .
Another set of new websites use shared bookmarks to rank links .
Delicious was the first well - known shared , or social bookmarking site .
As readers bookmark interesting pages they would tag ( categorize ) and share these bookmarks with other readers through Delicious .
The original idea was that one could search bookmarks by tags to find listings of cool sites by subject .
But folks discovered that by compiling a list of the most popular shared bookmarks an ever - changing ranked list of sites would also emerge .
There are now at least 15 different social bookmarking sites .
Some of them provide a ranking of most popularly bookmark pages of the moment .
I use this ranking function without bothering with the tagging part of sites .
Del.icio.us
I look at the “ popular ” page on Delicious .
It features 4 or 5 popular links for five sample subjects at one time .
The subjects seem to change every few days .
There ’s a lot of action , and the links are generally high quality .
*
Oishii
This is my preferred way to “ read ” Delicious .
It polls the front page of Delicious and posts any item that is bookmarked by at least 30 people .
Quick , fast , one page .
*
Blogmarks
I like Blogmarks for one great innovation : they display a thumbnail of the front page of the sites they link to .
Why do n’t all of these sites do that ?
*
Blinklist
Blinklist also displays thumbnails of listed sites but not consistently .
*
Furl
Choose the “ day ” mode , otherwise the list refreshes too slowly .
*
Simpy
A lot of very geeky links , with an occasional keeper .
*
Spurl
Scarce traffic keeps the change in the list slow .
The Pentagon has decided to omit from new detainee policies a key tenet of the Geneva Convention that explicitly bans “ humiliating and degrading treatment , ” according to knowledgeable military officials , a step that would mark a further , potentially permanent , shift away from strict adherence to international human rights standards .
The decision could culminate a lengthy debate within the Defense Department but will not become final until the Pentagon makes new guidelines public , a step that has been delayed .
However , the State Department fiercely opposes the military ’s decision to exclude Geneva Convention protections and has been pushing for the Pentagon and White House to reconsider , the Defense Department officials acknowledged .
For more than a year , the Pentagon has been redrawing its policies on detainees , and intends to issue a new Army Field Manual on interrogation , which , along with accompanying directives , represents core instructions to U.S. soldiers worldwide .
The process has been beset by debate and controversy , and the decision to omit Geneva protections from a principal directive comes at a time of growing worldwide criticism of U.S. detention practices and the conduct of American forces in Iraq .
Advertisement
The directive on interrogation , a senior defense official said , is being rewritten to create safeguards so that all detainees are treated humanely but can still be questioned effectively .
President Bush ’s critics and supporters have debated whether it is possible to prove a direct link between administration declarations that it will not be bound by Geneva and events such as the abuses at Abu Ghraib or the killings of Iraqi civilians last year in Haditha , allegedly by Marines .
But the exclusion of the Geneva provisions may make it more difficult for the administration to portray such incidents as aberrations .
And it undercuts contentions that U.S. forces follow the strictest , most broadly accepted standards when fighting wars .
“ The rest of the world is completely convinced that we are busy torturing people , ” said Oona A. Hathaway , an expert in international law at Yale Law School .
“ Whether that is true or not , the fact we keep refusing to provide these protections in our formal directives puts a lot of fuel on the fire . ”
Advertisement
The detainee directive was due to be released in late April along with the Army Field Manual on interrogation .
But objections from several senators on other Field Manual issues forced a delay .
The senators objected to provisions allowing harsher interrogation techniques for those considered unlawful combatants , such as suspected terrorists , as opposed to traditional prisoners of war .
The lawmakers say that differing standards of treatment allowed by the Field Manual would violate a broadly supported anti-torture measure advanced by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
McCain last year pushed Congress to ban torture and cruel treatment and to establish the Army Field Manual as the standard for treatment of all detainees .
Despite administration opposition , the measure passed and became law .
For decades , it had been the official policy of the U.S. military to follow the minimum standards for treating all detainees as laid out in the Geneva Convention .
But , in 2002 , Bush suspended portions of the Geneva Convention for captured Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters .
Bush ’s order superseded military policy at the time , touching off a wide debate over U.S. obligations under the Geneva accord , a debate that intensified after reports of detainee abuses at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and at Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison .
Among the directives being rewritten following Bush ’s 2002 order is one governing U.S. detention operations .
Military lawyers and other defense officials wanted the redrawn version of the document known as DoD Directive 2310 , to again embrace Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention .
Advertisement
That provision -- known as a “ common ” article because it is part of each of the four Geneva pacts approved in 1949 -- bans torture and cruel treatment .
Unlike other Geneva provisions , Article 3 covers all detainees -- whether they are held as unlawful combatants or traditional prisoners of war .
The protections for detainees in Article 3 go beyond the McCain amendment by specifically prohibiting humiliation , treatment that falls short of cruelty or torture .
The move to restore U.S. adherence to Article 3 was opposed by officials from Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office and by the Pentagon ’s intelligence arm , government sources said .
David S. Addington , Cheney ’s chief of staff , and Stephen A. Cambone , Defense undersecretary for intelligence , said it would restrict the United States ’ ability to question detainees .
The Pentagon tried to satisfy some of the military lawyers ’ concerns by including some protections of Article 3 in the new policy , most notably a ban on inhumane treatment , but refused to embrace the actual Geneva standard in the directive it planned to issue .
The military lawyers , known as judge advocates general , or JAGs , have concluded that they will have to wait for a new administration before mounting another push to link Pentagon policy to the standards of Geneva .
Advertisement
“ The JAGs came to the conclusion that this was the best they can get , ” said one participant familiar with the Defense Department debate who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the protracted controversy .
“ But it was a massive mistake to have withdrawn from Geneva .
By backing away , you weaken the proposition that this is the baseline provision that is binding to all nations . ”
Derek P. Jinks , an assistant professor at the University of Texas School of Law and the author of a forthcoming book on Geneva called “ The Rules of War , ” said the decision to remove the Geneva reference from the directive showed the administration still intended to push the envelope on interrogation .
“ We are walking the line on the prohibition on cruel treatment , ” Jinks said .
“ But are we really in search of the boundary between the cruel and the acceptable ? ”
The military has long applied Article 3 to conflicts -- including civil wars -- using it as a minimum standard of conduct , even during peacekeeping operations .
The old version of the U.S. directive on detainees says the military will “ comply with the principles , spirit and intent ” of the Geneva Convention .
Advertisement
But top Pentagon officials now believe common Article 3 creates an “ unintentional sanctuary ” that could allow Al Qaeda members to keep information from interrogators .
“ As much as possible , the foundation is Common Article 3 .
That is the foundation , ” the senior official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because the new policies had not been made public .
“ But there are certain things unlawful combatants are not entitled to . ”
Another defense official said that Article 3 prohibitions against “ outrages upon personal dignity , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment ” could be interpreted as banning well - honed interrogation techniques .
Many intelligence soldiers consider questioning the manhood of male prisoners to be an effective and humane technique .
Suggesting to a suspected insurgent that he is “ not man enough ” to have set an improvised explosive device sometimes elicits a full description of how they emplaced the bomb , soldiers say .
Advertisement
The Pentagon worries that if Article 3 were incorporated in the directive , detainees could use it to argue in U.S. courts that such techniques violate their personal dignity .
“ Who is to say what is humiliating for Sheikh Abdullah or Sheikh Muhammad ? ” the second official asked .
“ If you punch the buttons of a Muslim male , are you at odds with the Geneva Convention ? ”
Military officials also worry that following Article 3 could force them to end the practice of segregating prisoners .
The military says that there is nothing inhumane about putting detainees in solitary confinement , and that it allows inmates to be questioned without coordinating their stories with others .
Human rights groups have their doubts , saying that isolating people for months at a time leads to mental breakdowns .
Advertisement
“ Sometimes these things sound benign , but there is a reason they have been prohibited , ” said Jumana Musa , an advocacy director for Amnesty International .
“ When you talk about putting people in isolation for eight months , 14 months , it leads to mental degradation . ”
Jinks , of the University of Texas , contends that Article 3 does not prohibit some of the things the military says it wants to do .
“ If the practice is humane , there is nothing to worry about , ” he said .
Defense officials said the State Department and other agencies had argued that adopting Article 3 would put the U.S. government on more solid “ moral footing , ” and make U.S. policies easier to defend abroad .
Some State Department officials have told the Pentagon that incorporating Geneva into the new directive would show American allies that the American military is following “ common standards ” rather than making up its own rules .
Department officials declined to comment for this article about the directive or their discussions with the Pentagon .
Advertisement
Common Article 3 was originally written to cover civil wars , when one side of the conflict was not a state and therefore could not have signed the Geneva Convention .
In his February 2002 order , Bush wrote that he determined that “ Common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to either Al Qaeda or Taliban detainees , because , among other reasons , the relevant conflicts are international in scope and Common Article 3 applies only to ‘ armed conflict not of an international character . ’ ”
Some legal scholars say Bush ’s interpretation is far too narrow .
Article 3 was intended to apply to all wars as a sort of minimum set of standards , and that is how Geneva is customarily interpreted , they say .
But top administration officials contend that after the Sept. 11 attacks , old customs do not apply , especially to a fight against terrorists or insurgents who never play by the rules .

“ The overall thinking , ” said the participant familiar with the defense debate , “ is that they need the flexibility to apply cruel techniques if military necessity requires it . ”

For the past decade , homeowners in the United States have been living in " Housing Heaven " .
In this heavenly place , profits are always made ; prices only go up ; interest rates only go down ; developers keep building , marketing , and selling megabuck , luxurious spa-like residences , that are all sold pre-construction ; property speculators always make money , and pyramid their purchases into owning many properties to flip for a quick profit ; and , second - homes are not an expensive luxury , but a wise investment for retirement .
If you really needed to make ends meet while living in this so - called Housing Heaven , all you had to do was buy a vacation home , rental property , or second - home and proceed to " install your own ATM on the side of your financed house " with your bank 's help , of course .
Who needs to work , when you can simply go to the bank and rob your own house ?
It 's easier than robbing the bank !
Living this way is fine in Housing Heaven , but not down here on earth .
Here 's why .
Consumer debt is up to $ 2 trillion ( not including $ 440 billion of revolving home equity loans and $ 600 billion of second mortgages ) .
Not only do consumers owe a whopping $ 9 trillion in mortgage debt , but home equity extraction has reached $ 600 billion annually .
Homeowners have basically received , and spent , in excess of $ 2 trillion that they never earned .
( Just take a look at the increase in total mortgage debt in the Federal Reserve 's Flow of Funds Data since 2000 ) .
Below are some of the reasons why many property owners are about to descend into " Housing Hell " : - When housing prices are flat or falling , there is no Angel , Tooth Fairy , Easter Bunny or Santa Claus you can call , to refill the ATM machine when it runs out of cash ; - Home equity can suddenly shift from a market reality to a purely existential concept .
The homeowner is now engaged in an " Existential Equity Extraction " or " EEE " .
An example of this in today 's world is when a home , with equity taken out , is routinely appraised for a mortgage refinancing at 5 to 10 percent higher than it would be appraised for an actual sale ; - Home prices are under horrible pressure .
There are probably a few million property owners , including speculators , flippers , and second - home buyers , who are in way over their heads .
We 've all heard stories about second - home buyers who really could n't afford the luxury and high expense of a second - home priced at $ 200,000 , yet they purchased one for $ 250,000 and rationalized its affordability because " the value would only go up to $ 300,000 or more " .
Besides , they naively believed " it could always be sold quickly in a bidding war for a profit " .
In resort areas given the number of days people actually use their second home staying at the Ritz for $ 500 a night could be a much better deal .
Do the math ; it 's not pretty .
- Demand for over - priced housing is slowing and new buyers are taking their time , being picky , and even renting .
Homeownership , as a percentage of the population , is already at a record - high .
This level was achieved by using every trick in the mortgage lending book , regardless of income or down payment .
Virtually every borrower was approved for a loan of some kind .
Fifty percent of mortgages written over the last two years have been adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) and many buyers qualified for a mortgage because of the low teaser rates .
In addition , sub - prime mortgage lending has reached $ 700 billion , or 12 percent of total mortgages .
As interest rates adjust up , housing prices are forced down .
Given these statistics , it should be no surprise that the affordability index for the first time buyer is at a 20 - year low , or that the University of Michigan 's Home Buying Index is approaching an all - time low .
In the housing crash of 1991 , that index low was set once the housing price crash was well underway and more than a year old !
- Speculative buyers have stopped buying and many potential buyers are canceling orders and leaving deposits on the table .
-
In many states , property insurance is up 25 to 30 percent , right up there with soaring heating and air - conditioning costs .
-
The record rise in home prices has helped balance state budgets , but at the expense of property owners who are not capped on their real estate taxes .
The Alternative Minimum Tax is also emptying homeowner 's checking accounts !
- $ 2 trillion of ARMs were written in 2004 and '05 and are scheduled to reset in 2006 and ' 07 to much higher market interest rates , making them much less affordable .
-
On the supply side for housing , sheer panic is beginning .
As home buyers cancel orders , developers are taking their deposits , slashing prices 10 to 20 percent , and offering incentives such as free furnishings , granite countertop upgrades , wall - mounted TV's , closing costs , etc .
In specific home developments and condominium complexes , price reductions of $ 40,000 to $ 100,000 are not unheard of .
Despite these new tactics , last month new home sales still dropped 10 percent and the supply of new homes for sale hit a new high of 550,000 , nearly a seven - month supply .
( The nationwide supply of existing homes for sale is up 40 percent over last year . )
Adding insult to injury , new housing starts are holding up !
This is about as silly as GM and Ford running their factories full tilt when it is clear no one is buying cars .
As the supply piles up , the buyers take a vacation .
Housing prices in active real estate markets have gone up so much that the costs associated with owning vs. renting make renting a far more attractive choice now .
The situation is , of course , extraordinary .
The flip side of this is household real estate assets that are rising as a percentage of GDP .
In 1997 , the percentage was 105 % ; today , it 's 150 % .
The degree to which owning is so much more expensive than renting is the true measure of the extent of the housing price bubble .

AFA members are expected to bombard Tourism Australia with thousands of emails and phone calls in coming weeks to vent their feelings .
Members are also expected to boycott Australia as a holiday destination .
" I just feel pretty sure the typical American family who is watching TV with their children and they 're exposed to this ad are going to be upset , " AFA director of special projects , Randy Sharp , said .
" I do n't want my children to hear that phrase .
" It 's a shocking phrase because we 're not familiar with it .
" I guess they use it all the time in Australia , but it 's a foreign language here so I think it 'll have a negative impact rather than positive . "
However , Tourism Australia was not worried by the prospect of an AFA campaign , a spokesman said .
The ad's North American target market was well - educated , high - earning , widely travelled people from Canada and the US west coast , the Tourism Australia spokesman said .
" And I think we have the right campaign to do the job , " he said .
" The popular series Commander - in Chief runs in all US states and features a character called Nathan ' Bloody Hell ' Templeton , so it 's a term understood by Americans . "
Research in the US showed the ad's target market " enjoyed its humour and took it in the way it was intended " , the spokesman said .
The original uncut version of the ad had been downloaded from the Internet in 85 per cent of the world 's countries , he said .
British TV authorities dropped a ban on the use of the word " bloody " after pressure from Australia , but now Canadian authorities are unhappy with the way the ad portrays beer drinking .
Tourism Australia launched the ad in the US with a 30 - second spot during the hit TV series Lost , which draws around 20 million American viewers each week .
The ad also aired on some of America 's most - watched cable TV channels , including Rupert Murdoch 's FOX News , the popular A&E channel , TNT , TBS , Fine Living and the home improvement network , HGTV .
The ad has not upset America 's broadcast regulator , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , but all it takes is for one viewer complaint for the FCC to launch an investigation .
FCC spokesperson Rebecca Fisher said she was unaware of any complaints .
The Mississippi - based AFA 's campaigns have had enormous lobbying success in the US .
Last year the group called on its members to file formal complaints against US TV network CBS for a " teenage orgy scene " depicted in Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia 's hit TV series , Without A Trace .
The FCC last week fined more than 100 CBS affiliate stations $ US3.6 million ( $ A5 million ) for airing the orgy scene .
The AFA website congratulates its members on the campaign with a " You did it ! " headline and a link to send the FCC a thank - you message .
The AFA is also calling on its members to lobby Pizza Hut to ban a " sexually suggestive " ad featuring pop princess Jessica Simpson , in which she feeds food into a teenager 's mouth , causing the boy to faint .
Sharp said he enjoyed the Tourism Australia ad until the end when Bingle asks " where the bloody hell are you ? "
" When you think ' bloody ' in America you think the red liquid that flows from human bodies which is usually a sign of some kind of violence , " Sharp said .
Tourism Australia contact details will be made available to AFA members .
" They will hear from a lot of our members who are going to be insulted , " Sharp said .
" Australians are spending all of these millions of dollars inviting us , and if we go over there are we going to be exposing our kids to foul language and images of bloody ?
" We do n't want our kids to hear the term ' bloody ' .
" We certainly do n't want our kids to hear profanity . "

Renowned heart specialist Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub today expressed delight at the successful outcome of a pioneering operation that restarted the original heart of a girl after her body rejected her donor organ .
Sir Magdi came out of retirement to advise on the groundbreaking surgery that reconnected 12 - year - old Hannah Clark 's own dormant heart - 10 years after he performed her heart transplant .
Hannah underwent the operation , believed to be the first of its kind in the UK , at London 's Great Ormond Street hospital on February 20 after doctors discovered her body was rejecting her donor heart .
Sir Magdi was persuaded to come out of retirement to advise on the operation by Hannah 's parents , Paul and Elizabeth Clark , of Mountain Ash in south Wales .
The couple say their daughter is now recovering well .
The professor told BBC Breakfast that it was " not usual " for a transplant patient 's original heart to be left in place , and that his surgical team had thought there was a chance Hannah 's own heart would eventually recover .
" Her own heart has recovered .
It really is absolutely wonderful news , " he told the programme .
" At the time we had the idea that she had this very severe muscle disease and there was the outside possibility that her heart would recover .
That was the idea and it worked out , so that was wonderful .
Now she is a happy little girl with her own normal heart .
The complications have all gone .
This is a very happy ending . "
The transplant , carried out when Hannah was just two , saved her life because she had cardiomyopathy , which made her heart double the size it should have been and therefore likely to fail within a year .
The donor heart worked fine until last November when a routine visit to a cardiologist revealed that her body was rejecting it .
Mrs Clark said surgeons at Great Ormond Street hospital were initially reluctant to remove her daughter 's donor heart and reconnect the dormant one because they said it had never been done before .
But the transplant team later agreed to perform the surgery .
Mrs Clark said : " Hannah recovered so well she was able to come home within five days .
Nobody thought she would be like she is now .
She is just enjoying her life and is looking forward to going back to Mountain Ash Comprehensive school after Easter .
It has been like a breath of fresh air for her .
She is doing a lot more by herself now and she is making me redundant ! "
Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director of the British Heart Foundation , hailed the operation as an " exciting and important event " .
He said : " Surgeons like BHF Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub have thought for some time that if a heart is failing because of acute inflammation , it might be able to recover if rested .
This seems to be exactly what has happened in this case .
The piggyback heart allowed the patient 's own heart to take a rest .
" Today , the approach would be to implant a mechanical heart , called a ventricular assist device , to take over the work of the inflamed heart in the hope that the heart will recover and the device can be taken out after a few months .
Ten years ago such devices were not sufficiently reliable , which is why Hannah received a donor heart alongside her own . "
One major benefit of the operation is that Hannah no longer needs to take the strong anti-rejection drugs she was on while she had the donor heart .
She has also battled lymph cancer for the past few years but is currently in remission after a successful course of chemotherapy in January of this year .
A spokesman for the cardiac team at Great Street Ormond hospital said : " We are delighted that Hannah is doing so well .
We believe that this combination of circumstances is the first for children or adults in the UK . "

Voices expressing concern over the armed forces ' failures are getting louder .
One Israeli cabinet minister said last week : ' We gave the army so much money .
Why are we getting these results ? '
Last week saw Hizbollah 's guerrilla force , dismissed by senior Israeli military officials as ' ragtag ' , inflict further casualties on one of the world 's most powerful armies in southern Lebanon .
At least 12 elite troops , the equivalent of Britain 's SAS , have already been killed , and by yesterday afternoon Israel 's military death toll had climbed to 45 .
As the bodies pile up , so the Israeli media has begun to turn , accusing the military of lacking the proper equipment , training and intelligence to fight a guerrilla war in Lebanon .
Israel 's Defence Minister , Amir Peretz , on a tour of the front lines , was confronted by troubled reserve soldiers who told him they lacked proper equipment and training .
Israel 's chief of staff , Major - General Dan Halutz , had vowed to wipe out Hizbollah 's missile threat within 10 days .
These claims are now being mocked as rockets rain down on Israel 's north with ever greater intensity , despite an intense and highly destructive air bombardment .
As one well - connected Israeli expert put it : ' If we have such good information in Lebanon , how come we still do n't know the hideout of missiles and launchers ?...
If we do n't know the location of their weapons , why should we know which house is a Hizbollah house ? '
As international outrage over civilian deaths grows , the spotlight is increasingly turning on Israeli air operations .
The Observer has learnt that one senior commander who has been involved in the air attacks in Lebanon has already raised concerns that some of the air force 's actions might be considered ' war crimes ' .
Yonatan Shapiro , a former Blackhawk helicopter pilot dismissed from reserve duty after signing a ' refusenik ' letter in 2004 , said he had spoken with Israeli F - 16 pilots in recent days and learnt that some had aborted missions because of concerns about the reliability of intelligence information .
According to Shapiro , some pilots justified aborting missions out of ' common sense ' and in the context of the Israeli Defence Force 's moral code of conduct , which says every effort should be made to avoiding harming civilians .
Shapiro said : ' Some pilots told me they have shot at the side of targets because they 're afraid people will be there , and they do n't trust any more those who give them the coordinates and targets . '
He added : ' One pilot told me he was asked to hit a house on a hill , which was supposed to be a place from where Hizbollah was launching Katyusha missiles .
But he was afraid civilians were in the house , so he shot next to the house ...
' Pilots are always being told they will be judged on results , but if the results are hundreds of dead civilians while Hizbollah is still able to fire all these rockets , then something is very wrong . '
So far none of the pilots has publicly refused to fly missions but some are wobbling , according to Shapiro .
He said : ' Their target could be a house firing a cannon at Israel and it could be a house full of children , so it 's a real dilemma ; it 's not black and white .
But ...
I 'm calling on them to refuse , in order save our country from self - destruction . '
Meron Rappoport , a former editor at the Israeli daily Haaretz and military analyst , criticised the air force 's methods for selecting targets :
' The impression is that information is sometimes lacking .
One squadron leader admitted the evidence used to determine attacks on cars is sometimes circumstantial - meaning that if people are in an area after Israeli forces warned them to leave , the assumption is that those left behind must be linked to Hizbollah ...
This is problematic , as aid agencies have said many people did not leave ... because they could not , or it was unsafe to travel on the roads thanks to Israel 's aerial bombardment . '
These revelations raise further serious questions about the airstrike in Qana last Sunday that left dozens dead , which continues to arouse international outrage .
From the outset , the Israeli military 's version of events has been shrouded in ambiguity , with the army releasing a video it claims shows Katyusha rockets being fired from Qana , even though the video was dated two days earlier , and claiming that more than 150 rockets had been fired from the location .
Some IDF officials have continued to refer vaguely to Katyushas being launched ' near houses ' in the village and to non-specific ' terrorist activity ' inside the targeted building .
In a statement on Thursday , the IDF said it the air force did not know there were civilians in what they believed was an empty building , yet paradoxically blamed Hizbollah for using those killed as ' human shields ' .
Human rights groups have attacked the findings as illogical .
Amnesty International described the investigation as a ' whitewash ' , saying Israeli intelligence must have been aware of the civilians ' .
One Israeli commander from a different squadron called the Qana bombing a ' mistake ' and was unable to explain the apparent contradiction in the IDF 's position , although he insisted there would have been no deliberate targeting of civilians .
He said he had seen the video of the attack , and admitted : ' Generally they [ Hizbollah ] are using human shields ...
That specific building - I do n't know the reason it was chosen as a target . '

The WorldWideWeb browser
The first web browser - or browser - editor rather - was called WorldWideWeb as , after all , when it was written in 1990 it was the only way to see the web .
Much later it was renamed Nexus in order to save confusion between the program and the abstract information space ( which is now spelled World Wide Web with spaces ) .
I wrote the program using a NeXT computer .
This had the advantage that there were some great tools available - it was a great computing environment in general .
In fact , I could do in a couple of months what would take more like a year on other platforms , because on the NeXT , a lot of it was done for me already .
There was an application builder to make all the menus as quickly as you could dream them up .
there were all the software parts to make a wysiwyg ( what you see is what you get - in other words direct manipulation of text on screen as on the printed - or browsed page ) word processor .
I just had to add hypertext , ( by subclassing the Text object )
This is a ( 242 kB ) screen shot of the browser , taken when things had got to the point that Communications of the ACM was interested in an article , in 1993 .
The differences between this and the first edition ( whimsically dated 901225 although I was NOT working on Christmas Day -- it was prepared some time before closed for Christmas ) were :
The whole thing would have been grey scale as NeXTs were at the time just grey scale ;
The inline images such as the world / book icon and the CERN icon , would have been displayed in separate windows , as it did n't at first do inline images .
See also :
another screen shot , this one by JFG , later but grey scale
A quick tour of this screen to answer the FAQs :
In this shot I am making a link from the word " ATLAS " in the list of experiments to some web page .
The NeXTStep operating system put the menu for each application in the top left of the screen .
The application is called WorldWideWeb .
because the menus are in this block they windows are very unencumbered .
A little like like the windows " start " menu later .
The Navigate menu had things like " back " and " next " and " previous " .
these last two were useful when you follows a link from a list of links - they meant " go back a step and then take the next link from the same page instead " .
The document menu was like the " file " menu for windows I suppose .
The " find " menu is fairly self - explanatory , as is " edit " .
The " Link " menu you can see .
" Mark all " would remember the URI of where you were .
" MArk selection " would make an anchor ( link target ) for the selected text , give it an ID , and remember the URI of that fragment .
" Link to Marked " would make a link from the current selection to whatever URI you had last marked .
So making a link involved browsing to somewhere interesting , hitting Command / M , going to the document you were writing and selecting some text , and hitting Command / L. " Link to new " would create a new window , prompt for a URI ( ugh - it should have made one up ! ) and make a link from the selection to the new document .
You never saw the URIs - you could of course always find documents by following the link to them .
The " style " menu was interesting -- you could load a style sheet to define how you liked your documents rendered .
You could also set the paragraph style to an HTML element 's style - as lists did n't nest , the user could think of the process as styles ( heading1 , heading 2 , list element , etc ) and then this implied an HTML structure when the document was written back .
At the time , the " X " close box was unique to NeXT , before Windows copied it .
The broken X in the " Tim 's home page " window means that the document has been edited and not yet saved .
( A " dirty " flag ) .
As a convenience , pressing Command / Shift / S would save back all modified web pages .
Nineteenth - century English social scientist Herbert Spencer made this prescient observation : " Those who cavalierly reject the Theory of Evolution , as not adequately supported by facts , seem quite to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all . "
Well over a century later nothing has changed .
When I debate creationists , they present not one fact in favor of creation and instead demand " just one transitional fossil " that proves evolution .
When I do offer evidence ( for example , , a transitional fossil between ancient land mammals and modern whales ) , they respond that there are now two gaps in the fossil record .
This is a clever debate retort , but it reveals a profound error that I call the Fossil Fallacy : the belief that a " single fossil " -- one bit of data -- constitutes proof of a multifarious process or historical sequence .
In fact , proof is derived through a convergence of evidence from numerous lines of inquiry - - multiple , independent inductions , all of which point to an unmistakable conclusion .
We know evolution happened not because of transitional fossils such as A. natans but because of the convergence of evidence from such diverse fields as geology , paleontology , biogeography , comparative anatomy and physiology , molecular biology , genetics , and many more .
No single discovery from any of these fields denotes proof of evolution , but together they reveal that life evolved in a certain sequence by a particular process .
One of the finest compilations of evolutionary data and theory since Charles Darwin's
On the Origin of Species is Richard Dawkins 's magnum opus , The Ancestor 's Tale : A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution ( Houghton Mifflin , 2004 ) -- 688 pages of convergent science recounted with literary elegance .
Dawkins traces numerous transitional fossils ( what he calls " concestors , " the last common ancestor shared by a set of species ) from Homo sapiens back four billion years to the origin of heredity and the emergence of evolution .
No single concestor proves that evolution happened , but together they reveal a majestic story of process over time .
Consider the tale of the dog .
With so many breeds of dogs popular for so many thousands of years , one would think there would be an abundance of transitional fossils providing paleontologists with copious data from which to reconstruct their evolutionary ancestry .
In fact , according to Jennifer A. Leonard , an evolutionary biologist then at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History , " the fossil record from wolves to dogs is pretty sparse . "
Then how do we know whence dogs evolved ?
In the November 22 , 2002 , Science , Leonard and her colleagues report that mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) data from early dog remains " strongly support the hypothesis that ancient American and Eurasian domestic dogs share a common origin from Old World gray wolves . "
In the same issue , molecular biologist Peter Savolainen of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and his colleagues note that even though the fossil record is problematic , their study of mtDNA sequence variation among 654 domestic dogs from around the world " points to an origin of the domestic dog in East Asia " about 15,000 years before the present from a single gene pool of wolves .
Finally , anthropologist Brian Hare of Harvard University and his colleagues describe in this same issue the results of a study showing that domestic dogs are more skillful than wolves at using human signals to indicate the location of hidden food .
Yet " dogs and wolves do not perform differently in a nonsocial memory task , ruling out the possibility that dogs outperform wolves in all human - guided tasks , " they write .
Therefore , " dogs ' social - communicative skills with humans were acquired during the process of domestication . "
No single fossil proves that dogs came from wolves , but archaeological , morphological , genetic and behavioral " fossils " converge to reveal the concestor of all dogs to be the East Asian wolf .
The tale of human evolution is divulged in a similar manner ( although here we do have an abundance of fossils ) , as it is for all concestors in the history of life .
We know evolution happened because innumerable bits of data from myriad fields of science conjoin to paint a rich portrait of life 's pilgrimage .
Nancy Jones , vice president for marketing at Garfield & Marks , said customer feedback on the Fitlogic system was positive but that " we have not figured out how to get this concept out to our stores in a fashion they can accept financially and commit to in terms of space . "
There is little doubt that consumers would benefit from Fitlogic , or any other standardized sizing system , if it were widely adopted .
Size , by definition a standardized measure , has become one of the most flexible concepts in retailing .
The creation of vanity sizes -- intentionally smaller than an objective size , to flatter the buyer -- has introduced pure guesswork into shopping .
A size 10 from one clothing manufacturer is a size 8 from another and a 12 from still another .
According to a survey of 84,000 women , conducted by the NPD Group , a market research firm , 36 percent return a product every year because it does not fit .
Those returns equal 12 percent of all clothing sales .
As a result , industry executives say , women shop at fewer stores and buy fewer clothes than they would if sizing were more transparent .
Julia Pierson , 46 , from Baltimore , buys pants from one company , Jones New York , because it is the only brand that produces a size 12 that fits her .
" My waist is disproportionately large , " said Ms. Pierson , who was shopping in the Jones New York department at Macy 's Herald Square , wearing a pair of Jones New York corduroy pants .
Fitlogic is the not the first company to tackle the sizing riddle .
In the mid-1990 's Levi Strauss developed a system that allowed consumers to order jeans cut precisely to their measurements .
Using a different approach , a company called Intellefit designed scanning machines that took shoppers ' measurements -- including shoulder slope and calf thickness -- in stores .
And Neiman Marcus provides a kind of CliffsNotes to sizes in its catalogs .
But an industrywide solution has never materialized .
The developer of Fitlogic is Cricket Lee , who has frequently expressed her own frustration with clothing sizes .
On Q.V.C.'s
Web site , Ms. Lee describes herself as a 52 - year - old who weighs 245 pounds , adding , " Like many women , I was unable to find clothing that fit and I was sick and tired of it . "
Ms. Lee declined to comment for this article .
As you probably already know , Windows saves your user password in something called the SAM Database .
It can store it using 2 different password presentations , or " hashes " : The Lan Manager hash ( LM hash ) and the Windows NT Hash ( NT hash ) .
NT
Hashes are considered to be pretty secure , but unfortunately , LM ones are not and are prone to brute force attacks .
There are 2 ways you can force XP to store your password using the NT hash presentation , and here they are :
1- Use a password that is longer then 14 characters
This is by far the simplest technique .
Just use a password that is longer then 14 characters .
If you do this , Windows will store a meaningless LM Hash value in the SAM database and use an NT Hash to represent your password instead .
2- Add up the NoLMHash value to the registry
This registry hack will force windows XP to store your password using the NT Hash presentation .
( Warning : Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method .
These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system .
Microsoft or I cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved .
Modify the registry at your own risk . )
Start , run , type regedit , click OK
Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
Under the Lsa key , create a DWORD Value named NoLMHash , and assign a value of 1 to it ( as shown in the screenshot below )
Restart your computer , and change your password .
Voilà , you are done .
You might want to test the strenght of your password via a brute force attack before and after having done the procedure .
This guide will show you how to do this .

Retired Supreme Court Justice hits attacks on courts and warns of dictatorship RAW STORY
Published : March 10 , 2006 Print This | Email This Via NPR .
Rush transcript by RAW STORY .
Listen to the audio report here .
Supreme Court justices keep many opinions private but Sandra Day O’Connor no longer faces that obligation .
Yesterday , the retired justice criticized Republicans who criticized the courts .
She said they challenge the independence of judges and the freedoms of all Americans .
O’Connor ’s speech at Georgetown University was not available for broadcast but NPR ’s legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was there .
Nina Totenberg :
In an unusually forceful and forthright speech , O’Connor said that attacks on the judiciary by some Republican leaders pose a direct threat to our constitutional freedoms .
O’Connor began by conceding that courts do have the power to make presidents or the Congress or governors , as she put it “ really , really angry . ”
But , she continued , if we do n’t make them mad some of the time we probably are n’t doing our jobs as judges , and our effectiveness , she said , is premised on the notion that we wo n’t be subject to retaliation for our judicial acts .
The nation ’s founders wrote repeatedly , she said , that without an independent judiciary to protect individual rights from the other branches of government those rights and privileges would amount to nothing .
But , said O’Connor , as the founding fathers knew statutes and constitutions do n’t protect judicial independence , people do .

And then she took aim at former House GOP leader Tom DeLay .
She did n’t name him , but she quoted his attacks on the courts at a meeting of the conservative Christian group Justice Sunday last year when DeLay took out after the courts for rulings on abortions , prayer and the Terri Schiavo case .
This , said O’Connor , was after the federal courts had applied Congress ’ onetime only statute about Schiavo as it was written .
Not , said O’Connor , as the congressman might have wished it were written .
This response to this flagrant display of judicial restraint , said O’Connor , her voice dripping with sarcasm , was that the congressman blasted the courts .
It gets worse , she said , noting that death threats against judges are increasing .
It does n’t help , she said , when a high - profile senator suggests there may be a connection between violence against judges and decisions that the senator disagrees with .
She did n’t name him , but it was Texas senator John Cornyn who made that statement , after a Georgia judge was murdered in the courtroom and the family of a federal judge in Illinois murdered in the judge ’s home .
O’Connor observed that there have been a lot of suggestions lately for so - called judicial reforms , recommendations for the massive impeachment of judges , stripping the courts of jurisdiction and cutting judicial budgets to punish offending judges .
Any of these might be debatable , she said , as long as they are not retaliation for decisions that political leaders disagree with .
I , said O’Connor , am against judicial reforms driven by nakedly partisan reasoning .
Pointing to the experiences of developing countries and former communist countries where interference with an independent judiciary has allowed dictatorship to flourish , O’Connor said we must be ever - vigilant against those who would strongarm the judiciary into adopting their preferred policies .
It takes a lot of degeneration before a country falls into dictatorship , she said , but we should avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings .

Someone forwarded me a request for information put out by a USA Today reporter .
He was writing an article about entrepreneurial personality traits .
He wanted suggestions from " experts " in compiling his list .
The idea was to help people decide whether they should seek self - employment or not .
I was intrigued by the idea so I submitted my list to him .
He did not email or call back so I assume either he was not amused or my submission was not his cup of chai .
In any case , I thought my list was cool so I now present it to you and wait ( with lazily suspended breath ) for your insightful reaction .
P.S. Additions , enhancements and / or subtitutions are heartily encouraged .
Fred 's Top 10 Signs
You 're Made to be an Entrepreneur
10 . You are unemployable .
You ca n’t hold a job .
You do n’t want to hold a job .
And you react to getting a job the same way a cat reacts when you try to give it a bath .
9 . You are anti-authoritarian .
You ca n’t fathom the thought of being anything less than Boss , President , Chairman , Don , and / or Emperor .
8 . You have the uncanny ability to get other people to do all the work .
7 . You are always looking for and / or seeing economic opportunity everywhere and in everything .
While at a concert , you occupy yourself by estimating the evening ’s take and its gross margins instead of listening to the music .
6 . You spend more time and energy looking for easier , faster , cheaper , more effective ways of accomplishing something than if you just did the task outright .
5 . You would enthusiastically trade a life - time pass to Disneyland for one ride in the Vomit Comet .
In other words , you would give up a secure , even - keeled , bland existence for a life that whipsaws uncontrollably between exhilaration and terror .
4 . You do n’t see lack of money , lack of knowledge , and lack of experience as barriers to entry .
You are also not deterred by the existence of formidable competition .
3 . You favor multiplication over addition and you lull yourself to sleep by calculating price - earnings ratios .
2 . You would happily invest your home ’s equity and your life savings ( and your mother ’s life savings ) in your start - up .
And the Number One sign you are made to be an entrepreneur . . .
1 . When you project future earnings , your spread sheet shows that by Year 5 , you can buy Argentina and sell it to Brazil .

I was trying to figure out why on earth you spent so much time writing about something that you apparently do n't like .
Then it hit me : HCGS .
So thanks for your help .
Software needs philosophers .
This thought has been nagging at me for a year now , and recently it 's been growing like a tumor .
One that plenty of folks on the ' net would love to see kill me .
People do n't put much stock in philosophers these days .
The popular impression of philosophy is that it 's just rhetoric , just frivolous debating about stuff that can never properly be answered .
" Spare me the philosophy ; let 's stick to the facts !
" The funny thing is , it 's philosophers who gave us the ability to think rationally , to stick to the facts .
If it were n't for the work of countless philosophers , facts would still be getting people tortured and killed for discovering and sharing them .
Does it ever strike you as just a teeny bit odd that after a brief period where philosophy flourished , from maybe 400 B.C.E. to ~ 100 C.E. , we went through a follow - on period of well over one thousand five hundred years during which the Roman Catholic Church enslaved everyone 's minds and killed anyone who dared think differently ?
What 's weirder is that we tend to pretend it did n't really happen .
We like to just skip right over the dominance of religion over our minds for a hundred generations , and think of religion today as a kindly old grandpa who 's just looking out for us kids .
No harm , no foul .
Let bygones be bygones .
Sure , there were massacres and crusades and genocides and torture chambers with teeth grinding and eyes bleeding and intestines torn out in the name of God .
But we were all just kids then , right ?
Nobody does that kind of thing today , at least not in civilized countries .
We try not to think about the uncivilized ones .
It was philosophers that got us out of that Dark Ages mess , and no small number of them lost their lives in doing so .
And today , the philosophy majors are the butts of the most jokes , because after the philosophers succeeded in opening our minds , we forgot why we needed them .
And if we stop to think about it at all , we think that it was other people , people who are very unlike us , who committed those atrocities in the name of Faith ( regardless of whether it 's faith in a god , or in a political party , or any other form of mind control carried out by force ) .
We like to think we live in an enlightened age , but we do n't .
Humans have n't changed significantly in 10,000 years .
We 're still killing and torturing each other .
It 's apparently incredibly easy to decide to kill someone and then do it .
Happens every day , all around the world .
Torture , too .
But those people are just people .
If they had been born down the street from you , they'd have gone to school with you , been friends with you , learned to program with you , written blogs and comments , never tortured or killed anyone in the name of an idea .
They 'd have been you .
Which means they are you ; you just got lucky in where you were born .
One of the commenters on my last blog entry expressed the fervent wish that I drop dead .
To be sure , they qualified it with " on the internet " .
But if they really feel that way , especially about something as hilariously and absurdly unimportant in the Grand Scheme as whether the Lisp programming language has any acceptable implementations , then what does it say about us ?
Everyone who commented angrily on that blog entry was caught .
I caught you , anonymous or not , being a religious fanatic .
The only " negative " commenter who does n't appear to be a religious zombie was Paul Costanza ( ironic , since he claims to be the opinionated one ) , who relegated his comments to pedantic technical corrections .
They 're welcome , of course ; I 'm always looking to correct any technical misconceptions I harbor .
But they 're moot , since even if I was wrong about every single technical point I brought up in that entry , my overall point —
Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp — remains largely uncontested by the commenters .
Some of them just do n't get it , which is fine ; no harm in that .
If you 've been using Lisp for years and years , and you 've written books and articles and zillions of lines of Lisp code , then you 're unlikely to remember anything about what it 's like coming to Lisp for the first time .
They 're religious because they 've forgotten what it 's like to be a skeptic .
But make no mistake ; a substantial percentage of people who take a side in any programming language discussion that devolves into a flamewar know exactly what the other side means , and they want to invoke the Ultimate Censorship : drop dead !
Killing someone , after all , is one of the best ways to silence them .
You also have to burn all their writings , which is getting harder these days ; hence the increased vehemence on the 'net .
Those of you who 've followed what I 've written over the past year or so know where I 'm going .
I 'm taking a stand , all right , and it's a very definite one .
I 'm finding myself drawn inexorably towards a single goal : stamping out technological religion , because I 'm frigging tired of not being able to stick to the facts .
FACT : Java has no first - class functions and no macros .
This results in warped code that hacks around the problem , and as the code base grows , it takes on a definite , ugly shape , one that 's utterly unique to Java .
Lisp people can see this clear as day .
So can Python folks , so can Ruby folks .
Java people flip out , and say " macros are too much power " , or " what do u mean i dont understand u " or " fuck you , you jerk , Lisp will NEVER win " .
You think I do n't hear ALL that , and much more , in the hate mail I get every day ?
I sure would n't want to be alone with a Java fanatic in a medieval torture chamber , because God only knows what they 're capable of .
Turn the mirror towards Python , and what happens ?
Funny , but the Java folks will mail me saying : " yeah , I 've always known I detested Python , and you really nailed exactly why .
Thanks ! "
Meanwhile , Python folks are literally frothing at the mouth , looking for the " Kill That Bastard " key on their 101 - key keyboards .
I turned the mirror towards Lisp yesterday .
Had to go to the bathroom like nobody 's business , and my wife was expecting me home any minute , so I rushed it out : just a few thoughts here and there .
So the Gorgon only caught the tiniest glimpse of itself , but hell evidently hath no fury like that of a Lisper scorned , and all that .
It does n't matter that I rushed it out .
I 'm glad I did ; spending any more time on it , trying to get it " right " by looking up useless factoids like how you can override length 's non-polymorphicness with some weird setting ( when it plainly should just be the default ) , would have had the exact same net effect :
Lisp zealots would have found some way to turn it into a flamewar .
And I 'd have been out 2 or 3 more hours .
Let 's call it a troll , then , because it was poorly researched ; it was just some months - old recollections of pain I 'd gone through last year trying to commit to Common Lisp , after another year of trying the same with various flavors of Scheme and finding them all wanting .
As far as I 'm concerned , Lisp is unacceptable today ; it 's my opinion and just that , but I 'll stick with it .
I still need Lisp ; after you learn enough of it , it becomes part of your soul .
I get my fix hacking elisp , and I do a lot of it .
The commenters are quite right ; I 've never written anything substantial in Common Lisp , because in each of my serious attempts , there was too much friction .
Risk / reward was n't high enough , and believe me , I wanted it .
But after many attempts , I 've given up on Common Lisp .
They wo n't let me use it where I work , and there are probably more Lispers per capita where I work , including some famous ones , than at any other big company in the world .
If we can't use it where I work , then it 's frigging unacceptable ; that 's the shortest proof I can offer .
What I 'm far more interested today is the situation that arises if you consider my post a troll .
I 'm far more interested in the social consequences of working in a world filled with religious fanatics of different religious persuasions .
Especially given that it's a world in which " natural religion " has , by and large , been marginalized through the work of philosophers .
Let 's look at this world in a little more detail , starting with Peter Siebel 's comment , which I believe is the most interesting .
Peter said :
His first sentence speaks volumes about the sociology .
His viewpoint is exactly what they teach us all as kids :
If you do n't have anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all .
We like to think people have a right to believe whatever they want , and that it 's not nice to say mean things about other people 's beliefs , especially when their livelihoods are at stake .
That 's where philosophers come in , folks .
They pick your beliefs apart and show you in unforgettable ways the consequences of what you believe in .
I 'm no philosopher ; I know basically nothing about it , but I can tell you I wish fervently that some great philosophers would come along and effect change in our technical society .
Because if nothing else , I can see the consequences of the way we 're thinking about things .
One of many such consequences is that languages are n't getting any better , and the worst offenders are Lisp and Scheme , which by rights should be racing along the innovation curve faster than their supposedly less capable peers .
But they 've stagnated worse than any other non-dead language I can think of .
Programming languages are religions .
For a long while now I 've been mildly uncomfortable calling it " religion " , but I do n't feel bad about it anymore .
They 're similar enough .
At the top of the language religion is the language itself ; it serves as the deity and the object of worship .
Like any other organized religion , there 's always a Pope ( or a politburo chairman , in countries where the government has brutally set itself up as what is for all intents the religion of choice ) : a spiritual leader that gives the religion the human touch .
This person is almost always the language designer , of course .
In Lisp 's case it 's complicated , because McCarthy , Sussman and Steele are n't very active as spiritual leaders for their languages anymore .
Every major organized religion is a heirarchical government , and programming languages are no exception .
You 'll find equivalents of cardinals , bishops , priests and laity in programming language camps : the closer you are to the fire , to the spiritual center , the higher your rank .
It 's a great way to quantify your perceived self - importance : a high - score list , in effect .
Great for the ego , but it makes you a piss - poor debater , because you 're so emotionally invested in your status .
You'd think your rank would be accrued by virtue of your technical and / or documentation contributions , but in practice it 's usually more of a function of how many converts you 've gained , how many followers you have , how much you 've been spreading the Word .
That 's why Paul Graham is n't the Pope of Lisp .
He 's eminently qualified , but unfortunately he 's a heretic .
Notice that almost none of the commenters on my last blog mentioned the PG argument I made .
The only one who did ( as of this writing ) tried to make it an argument for Common Lisp .
Let 's face it : you can't give those heretics too much press ; people might start listening to them !
Peter , are you beginning to understand why I write so much about something I apparently do n't like ?
It 's because I wanted to like it but found it fatally flawed , technically and culturally .
It 's as if I were a would - be convert to Roman Catholicism , but I can't bring myself to commit because I 've seen too much of their role in creating a history that ironically we all wish we could rewrite .
I was born and raised a Roman Catholic , and I renounced it when I was thirteen years old , after my Uncle Frank ( a devout terrorist Catholic if there ever was one ) told me to stop reading the Bible , that it would " really screw a person up " to do that , that you needed someone to interpret it for you .
That was n't the only reason I renounced it , but it'll suffice for our purposes .
Technologically I was born and raised an assembly - language programmer ; at least that 's what my first real job was , for 5 years after I got my CS degree .
Assembly is just flagellation , though , and damned uncomfortable at that , so I joined the Church of Java for fully seven years .
And practically at the very moment I 'd finally tired of chafing at Java 's limitations , Paul Graham came along and through his early essays , showed me Lisp .
What a great new religion !
Problem is , each time you switch religions , the next one has less impact on you .
Once a Catholic , always a Catholic , they say .
I do n't know what that means for me , since I was raised by the assembly - language wolf , but it appears to mean that I 'm never going to be enthralled with another programming language .
And now that I 've swallowed the red pill , what choice do I have ?
I need to try to show people what 's out there .
Interestingly , it was Peter Siebel 's most excellent book , Practical Common Lisp , that played the role of Uncle Frank and killed my desired to continue with Common Lisp .
Peter was the first person to show me beast 's underbelly .
Every other Lisp book had pretended it was pure and beautiful and uncorrupted , because they left all the nastiness out as " implementation - defined " .
Once I saw what you really need to do in order to build something resembling a portable Lisp code base , and then had a few runs at it myself , I threw in the towel .
I much prefer Lisp the idea to Lisp the implementation .
I can tell you this : I 've tried writing this essay for a year .
I 've tried fully a dozen times .
I 've tackled it from a dozen angles .
I 've wanted to say it — — so many times , in so many ways .
We need great thinkers — the Fyodor Dostoyevskys and David Humes and Aristotles and Jean - Paul Sartres and Ben Franklins and Galileo Galileis and Bertrand Russells and Albert Einsteins to show us the way through the Software Dark Ages we 're in today : a time that will doubtless be remembered as every bit as mired in darkness and ignorance as the Dark Ages themselves .
But I 've failed .
This is n't the essay I wanted to write , because I 'm neither a great thinker nor a great writer .
However , you might be : if not now , then perhaps someday .
So I think it 's better to get the idea out now than to hoard it in the hopes of someday writing a world - changing essay .
For those of you who were surprised at the suddenness and vehemence of the Lisp community 's backlash to my little rant , I hope I 've helped shed a little light , helped you see its inevitability .
Basically they 've had a lot of practice .
Lisp is one of the oldest technology religions , and they 've both experienced and doled out their share of religious persecution .
But that 's not the lesson you should take away .
The lesson is that they are you .
Whenever you hear someone ranting about something you take for granted as wonderful and praiseworthy , and you 're wondering why they do n't leave well enough alone so we can all get back to our incestuous cheerleading , just remember : we went from the Dark Ages to our reeeeasonably enlightened society today by questioning our most cherished beliefs .
So keep questioning them . [ 1 ]
Yes , I 've read all of R6RS .
It 's a lukewarm compromise that punts on most of the important issues .
It 's not going to make Scheme any more successful than it is today , which to me feels practically criminal ; it was their one big chance to break out of the rut they 're in .
But it does n't matter .
Let 's pretend this footnote is just a troll .
If your hackles went up , then you 're a techno - religious zombie , and I hope in my lifetime to find you a cure .
Try your best to think about that long and hard before responding . [ 2 ]
For the record , the commenter I agree the most with is the one who said the problem basically boils down to an IDE issue .
SLIME does n't cut it , either , as beautiful as SLIME is .
Ca n't use it on Windows to save your life , for instance .
But that 's one of a thousand problems with the Lisp IDE situation ; it 's pointless to try to discuss them all in blogger .
It 's probably pointless to discuss them at all , because it 's just going to make me more miserable that no decent IDE exists for Lisp , except for Emacs - as - Elisp - IDE .
Which is why I get my Lisp fix by hacking elisp these days .
Even as far back as 1590 , magnetic measurements were typically very accurate – sailors lives depended on it ( Image : Master and Commander / Aquarius Collection )
The voyages of Captain Cook have just yielded a new discovery : the gradual weakening of Earth ’s magnetic field is a relatively recent phenomenon .
The discovery has led experts to question whether the Earth is on track towards a polarity reversal .
By sifting through ships ’ logs recorded by Cook and other mariners dating back to 1590 , researchers have greatly extended the period over which the behaviour of the magnetic field can be studied .
The data show that the current decline in Earth ’s magnetism was virtually negligible before 1860 , but has accelerated since then .
Until now , scientists had only been able to trace the magnetic field ’s behaviour back to 1837 , when Carl Friedrich Gauss invented the first device for measuring the field directly .
Advertisement
The field ’s strength is now declining at a rate that suggests it could virtually disappear in about 2000 years .
Researchers have speculated that this ongoing change may be the prelude to a magnetic reversal , during which the north and south magnetic pole swap places .
But the weakening trend could also be explained by a growing magnetic anomaly in the southern Atlantic Ocean , and may not be the sign of a large scale polarity reversal , the researchers suggest .
Crucial measurements
David Gubbins , an expert in geomagnetism at the University of Leeds , UK , led the study which began scouring old ships ’ logs in the 1980s , gathering log entries recording the direction of Earth ’s magnetic field .
It was common practice for captains in the 17th and 18th centuries to calibrate their ship ’s compasses relative to true north and , less often , to measure the steepness at which magnetic field lines entered the Earth ’s surface .
Even as far back as 1590 , these measurements were typically very accurate – to within half a degree .
“ Their lives depended on it , ” Gubbins explains .
Such ship - log records may not be adequate for reconstructing the planet ’s past magnetic fields in fine detail , but the data can estimate large - scale features quite well .
“ In that regard , I think it ’s a very solid result , ” says Catherine Constable , an expert in palaeomagnetism at the University of California , San Diego , US , who was not involved in the study .
Mineral evidence
Using the locations of the ships at the time of measurement , these records allowed Gubbins to construct a map of the relative strength of Earth ’s magnetic field between 1590 and 1840 , which was published in 2003 .
The data was combined with 315 estimates of the field ’s overall strength during that period , based on indirect clues , such as mineral evidence in bricks from old human settlements or volcanic rock .
Gubbins showed that the overall strength of the planet ’s magnetic field was virtually unchanged between 1590 and 1840 .
Since then , the field has declined at a rate of roughly 5 % per 100 years .
Every 300,000 years on average , the north and south poles of the Earth ’s magnetic field swap places .
The field must weaken and go to zero before it can reverse itself .
The last such reversal occurred roughly 780,000 years ago , so we are long overdue for another magnetic flip .
Once it begins , the process of reversing takes less than 5000 years , experts believe .
Growing anomaly
A large - scale reversal might indeed be underway , Gubbins says , but the acceleration of the magnetic decline since the mid-1800s is probably due to a local aberration of the magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly .
“ It looks like that ’s responsible for most of the fall we ’re seeing , ” he says .
This patch of reversed magnetic field lines covering much of South America first appeared in about 1800 , according to the ship - log data .
It slowly grew in strength , and by about 1860 it was large enough to affect the overall strength of the planet ’s magnetic field , Gubbins says .
If the field does flip 2000 years from now , the Northern Lights will be visible all over the planet during the transition , and solar radiation at ground level will be much more intense , with no field to deflect it .
There is no need to worry , though , argues Gubbins , as our ancestors have lived through quite a few of these transitions already .

Man , this is painful .
Washington Post :
The first pitch of the Washington Nationals ' second season at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium was low and away , bouncing in the dirt before being scooped up by catcher Brian Schneider .
For that , Vice President Cheney received a round of boos from the home crowd this afternoon .
You see ?
The booing happened because Cheney missed the strike zone .
Reuters :
The vice president , whose popularity is slumping along with that of President George W. Bush , walked out on the field to cheering and booing from the near - sellout crowd .
The boos appeared to be little louder than the cheers at RFK Memorial Stadium .
Now go see video at the Washington Post 's own site and see how many " cheers " you can hear .
It 's not even close .
It sounds like a riot is about to break out .

AIDS in Africa : Too Bad to Be True By Bryan Caplan
I ’ve long been skeptical of the statistics for AIDS in Africa .
The whole story had a quasi-Soviet flavor to it .
The main difference : Soviet growth statistics were too good to be true , while African AIDS statistics were too bad to be true .
Reflecting on the incentives cemented my skepticism : Just as the Soviet Union had a strong incentive to exaggerate its growth numbers in order to get the world ’s respect , researchers and advocates had a strong incentive to exaggerate their AIDS number in order to get the world ’s money .
However , whenever I shared my doubts with others , they almost always told me I was way off - base .
Biased statistics about Soviet growth were hard to expose ; biased statistics about AIDS would not be .
Now the Washington Post is backing me up :
The new data suggest the rate never reached the 30 percent estimated by some early researchers , nor the nearly 13 percent given by the United Nations in 1998 .
The study and similar ones in 15 other countries have shed new light on the disease across Africa .
Relying on the latest measurement tools , they portray an epidemic that is more female and more urban than previously believed , one that has begun to ebb in much of East Africa and has failed to take off as predicted in most of West Africa .
Why were the numbers exaggerated for so long ?
Such disparities , independent researchers say , skewed years of policy judgments and decisions on where to spend precious health - care dollars .
“ From a research point of view , they ’ve done a pathetic job , ” said Paul Bennell , a British economist whose studies of the impact of AIDS on African school systems have shown mortality far below what UNAIDS had predicted .
“ They were not predisposed , let ’s put it that way , to weigh the counterevidence .
They were looking to generate big bucks . ” [… ]
“ It ’s pure advocacy , really , ” said Jim Chin , a former U.N. official who made some of the first global HIV prevalence estimates while working for WHO in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
“ Once you get a high number , it ’s really hard once the data comes in to say , ‘ Whoops !
It ’s not 100,000 .
It ’s 60,000 . ’ ” Chin , speaking from Stockton , Calif. , added , “ They keep cranking out numbers that , when I look at them , you ca n’t defend them . ”
Still , Peter Ghys , a UNAIDS epidemiologist who now acknowledges that earlier numbers were too high , implausibly chalks the the mistakes up to random error :
Ghys said he never sensed pressure to inflate HIV estimates .
“ I ca n’t imagine why UNAIDS or WHO would want to do that , ” he said .
“ If we did that , it would just affect our credibility . ”
Ca n’t imagine it ?
Here ’s a simple model : People face a trade - off between getting the results they want and protecting their credibility .
Sometimes they decide that risking their credibility is worth it – and this was one of those times .

Chris Camisa , who lives near Chicago , offers technical support to Windows XP users for $ 1.49 a minute .
He takes calls even when he's out at night , by cellphone , if someone " needs support immediately and he 's willing to pay for it . "
Ingenio helps users choose the best adviser by compiling feedback ratings from past users , like the feedback on eBay .
Mr. Camisa 's track record of helping people with Windows XP problems , though not unblemished , is impressive : the overall rating from his more than 1,700 customers is five out of five stars .
Not all of the research sites charge .
On Wondir.com , anyone can respond to a question , but there is no fee ; the site allows those responding to list a PayPal account for tips .
In addition , those answering questions can compete for weekly prizes -- this week , a tote bag -- on a changing set of criteria .
One week , the winner may have the fastest response time .
On another , it may be the person with the highest approval rating .
The site derives revenue from text ads , generated by Google , related to the subject of a query .
Matthew Koll , chief executive of Wondir , says the simplicity of the approach means that advice often arrives quickly .
The system fields about 10,000 questions a day , and Mr. Koll says about 40 percent are answered within 10 minutes .
Why do people take part ?
Mr. Koll cites three main types of answer providers : people who get " a good feeling out of helping others , " those who " have a passion for a subject and they like engaging in a subject " and those with " something to promote . "
Mr. Koll says he welcomes the last group as long as people are open about their interests .
He sees nothing wrong " if someone gets on and answers some plumbing questions and says , ' BTW , if you can't handle it yourself , here 's my number . " '
Wondir 's approach is also different because it makes little distinction in knowledge between the questioner and the answerer .
" No one is proclaimed to be an expert , " said Michelle Hardenbrook , a moderator on the site .
That means , of course , that " anyone can answer any question even if the person answering has n't got a clue what they are writing or even if the information they are giving is totally inaccurate . "

For 20 years , Sundar Sundararaman has led a stream of well - intentioned Westerners into India 's dark corners , bringing his often - wealthy guests face - to - face with AIDS - afflicted sex workers to drive home the depth of need .
" For many of them it 's a big challenge to step out of the glass case , " says Dr. Sundar , a mentor with Mysore and Mandya Direct Intervention , an organization that works to stem the spread of HIV .
About two months ago he welcomed Melinda French Gates , a woman whose own guest list – at the earth - sheltered lakefront mansion in Medina , Wash . , that she shares with her husband , Microsoft multibillionaire Bill – has included the premier of China .
" As an onlooker , I was taken aback , " says Sundar .
Even away from the cameras Ms. Gates had an easy rapport with " the marginalized , " he says , the drug - addicted and the transgendered .
" She was engaged in asking very specific questions about whether this project was touching their lives ....
There was a natural person in her , an individual who connects with people . "
It is a selective kind of connectedness .
The enigmatic Gates – her interviews famously rare , her close associates reticent , her three young children shielded – could be considered the anti-Angelina Jolie in her approach .
Gates – by all accounts an active partner in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation – is , as a Fort Worth , Texas , paper recently declared , " the most powerful woman you know next to nothing about . "
Her clout has begun to swell of late , and along with it public curiosity about her .
Philanthropist ( and close family friend ) Warren Buffett 's recent record - setting $ 31 billion gift to the foundation heightened the mystery around the woman whose face recently was book - ended by those of Mr. Gates and rock star Bono on the cover of Time – but was unrecognizable to all but four of 20 Seattle - area residents shown her photo , without context , by the Monitor .
" There are many other people in Seattle who make sure they 're seen at all the big events , " says Dottie Simpson , wife of the late Seattle philanthropist W. Hunter Simpson and a longtime friend of Bill Gates 's parents , William H. and Mary .
" That 's not Melinda 's style . "
A spokeswoman for Gates Foundation rules out an interview in a month largely set aside for family .
" When they 're off , " says Amy Siegel , " it 's very guarded time . "
A portrait emerges slowly from scattered clues among Gates 's public statements and from tales coaxed from those just outside the formidable cone of silence .
A distance - runner and kayaker , she admits to bouts of stage fright .
She considers the late independent and tenacious Washington Post grand dame Katharine Graham a role model .
Gates reportedly had her activist 's epiphany when , while on safari in Africa in 1993 , she watched women trekking shoeless for miles in the dust to sell a few vegetables .
" Bill and I believe one life is worth no more or less than any other , " Gates told the Times ( London ) last year .
" That issue of equity is what the foundation stands for . "
In another sense , greater equity could be key to the foundation 's success .
It could call for Gates to shed the relative anonymity she has nurtured since she met Bill Gates at a company event in New York in 1987 .
It 's a step out that she indicated in a 2002 Newsweek interview she 'd probably try if it would help advance the development of an AIDS vaccine .
" Women often do not claim their power and put their whole identity out there in the public so that they become the engine , " observes Swanee Hunt , the former ambassador , philanthropist , and director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard 's Kennedy School .
" I think it will be great as she increases her voice . "

But Gates ispracticed at insularity .
A Microsoft employee from 1987 to 1996 ( developing multimedia products ) , she often ate alone in the company cafeteria after her 1993 engagement to the company 's founder because she was too intimidating a lunch date , recalls a former Microsoft employee who worked under her at the time but asked not to be named .
" It was a tough spot to be in , an employee engaged to Bill Gates , " says the ex-employee , who found her boss to be bright and pragmatic , if a little aloof .
" When I say she reminded me of a Catholic schoolgirl , I mean it in the best possible way , " she says .
" She had a real sense of humanitarian virtue . "
Not that her success has n't rankled .
Gates 's e-mail announcing her departure from the firm cited the tug of war between family and work , says Rebecca Hughes , another co-worker of Gates at the time .
" For me , I felt sad , " says Ms. Hughes , " because I was playing that same tug of war with my son and my work , but I did n't have the luxury of quitting . "
Gates still appears to wrestle with establishing normalcy .
The Gateses occasionally venture out to movies and parks .
Melinda is said to have softened a house some initially described as having the aura of a corporate retreat .
As Bill Gates told Newsweek in 1999 : " Melinda was saying ' Maybe we should n't move in , because [ it may not ] really feel like a home is supposed to feel . ' "
***
Born in Dallas in 1964 to Raymond ( an engineer ) and Elaine Amerland French , Gates attended the all - girls Ursuline Academy – school motto , " Serviam . "
She often credits teacher Susan Bauer with putting her on a path to math and computers .
Gates earned a bachelor 's degree at Duke University , in Durham , N.C. , in 1986 , and a Duke MBA the following year .
Rich Burton , professor of management at Duke 's Fuqua School of Business remembers Melinda French , a student in his management - control class , as reserved , " very serious " – and insightful .
" As an instructor you make up a key of model answers , " Professor Burton says .
" I was grading [ exams ] and I came to one on which the answers were better than mine , " he says .
" That was Melinda's .
I started using it as a key . "
Another professor , Alan Biermann , remembers being struck by Gates 's ability to advise without flaunting her intellect .
In the late 1990s , Gates visited his computer - science class .
A student described the difficulty he was having making a tabletop robot " see " variations in shading of color - coded blocks it was programmed to move .
" Melinda was quite interested , " he recalls .
" And then exclaimed how she now understood why the robot lab at Stanford had the very uniform soft lighting that she had seen there . "
Gates has been graceful , too , at the receiving end of guidance .
Mary Gates reportedly wrote a letter to the couple before their 1994 wedding about the responsibilities that come with wealth .
Today , the money is moving : more than $ 1.3 billion in grants in 2005 .
The pair has reportedly promised to give away 95 percent of their wealth in their lifetimes .
" I 'm so pleased with what the Gateses have done with their funds , " says Mrs. Simpson , adding in reference to the Buffett bequest , " I think it 's catching on . "
Renowned for her arcane knowledge of diseases , Gates also exudes business savvy .
" Although [ international governments ' ] funding increased from $ 65 million in 2000 to $ 163 million in 2005 , " she wrote in a Newsweek article in May , " current spending is only about half of what is needed to advance the most common microbicide candidates . "
It is classic Melinda : specific , unflashy , quietly passionate .
" I have met with a lot of influential people , " says Sundar . " [ Gates ] has a very unique ability to comprehend what she sees and hears . "
What sets her apart , he says , is that she responds to need in a way that is personal and direct .
" That simplicity , " he says , " is what is inside her . "

Managing user accounts is a fundamental task for any systems administrator .
Working with user and computer accounts in a network is often a common part of many IT and technical support jobs as well .
To manage user accounts in a Mac OS X environment , it helps to understand how they are stored and accessed on both individual workstations and in shared directories in Mac OS X Server .
This article covers the conceptual and practical aspects of how Mac OS X workstations and servers use Apple ’s Open Directory architecture to store and make use of user account information .
It also includes information about computers and other resources within a network .
First , I ’ll explain what Open Directory is , how it works , and the basics of an Open Directory infrastructure .
Then , I ’ll move on the practical steps involved in creating and editing user accounts within Open Directory under Mac OS X Server .
Understanding Open Directory
Directory services are one of the backbones of a network operating system .
Each major network operating system includes at least one type of directory service that stores information about users , servers and workstations , and network resources .
A directory service is essentially a database that contains predetermined fields for storing information .
This predetermined structure is called the service ’s schema .
Each type of directory service has a unique schema that formats data about users , groups , computers , printers , and so forth .
It ’s possible for an administrator to modify that schema if the fields included in it do n’t provide enough flexibility for resources in a network , although this is usually done only if one needs to integrate multiple directory services in a single network ( such as Apple ’s Open Directory and Microsoft ’s Active Directory ) .
In modern operating systems designed for use in a network , such as Mac OS X , a directory service exists on each computer to support multiple users of that computer .
This local directory service typically includes just a list of user accounts that can be used for multiple users to log in to the computer , each with his or her own computing experience and using a folder on the local hard drive as each user ’s home directory or home folder .
The local directory service can also store information about which components of the computer a particular user is allowed to access .
Network operating systems , such as Mac OS X Server , include much more robust directory services .
At a server level , directory services provide administrators with several important capabilities .
The most significant of these is that they centralize the data that could be stored in the directory services of individual workstations in a single place .
Beyond storing directory data in a central place , network - based directory services allow that data to be shared with all the workstations and servers within a network .
Users can authenticate against a shared directory for access to any workstation on the network , not just the one in their office or classroom .
The user account can also be used for ownership of any files that they create anywhere within the network .
Likewise , it can be used for setting access restrictions for not only files created by other users but also to files and folders created by the system administrator , to whole share points , to printers and other shared devices , and to establish predefined preferences and restrictions for any workstation or application to which the user has access .
By incorporating home directories with directory services , users can maintain a consistent user experience across all workstations and have a secure place to store their files that can be accessed from any workstation .
Directory services under Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server are part of a multipart architecture called Open Directory .
Open Directory goes beyond being a single directory service and truly goes beyond the basic functions of a directory service .
It includes a series of components that manage access to multiple types of directory services ( Apple ’s LDAP implementation — which is often referred to simply and slightly confusingly as Open Directory , other LDAP directory types , Apple ’s legacy NetInfo directory service , Microsoft ’s Active Directory , and Unix NIS servers and BSD configuration files ) .
Open Directory components also manage Mac OS X ’s interaction with self - discovering network protocols such as AppleTalk , Rendezvous / Bon Jour , Microsoft ’s SMB , and the open standard SLP protocol .
In both the client and server versions of Mac OS X , you can manage each of these components by using the Directory Access application .
Although Open Directory is a very robust collection of network components , discussion of Open Directory generally refers to the Apple LDAP or NetInfo directory databases , which are used for storing and sharing directory data .
Apple ’s LDAP and NetInfo directory databases are the two that can be considered native to Mac OS X ; that is , the operating system is designed specifically to interact with them and with their particular schema for storing directory information .
Open Directory is a central piece of Mac OS X , which was designed from the ground up as a multiuser and network operating system .
The majority of Mac OS X components and applications interact with Open Directory .
For example , the Mac OS X Login Window application , which authenticates user access to a computer , interacts with Open Directory whenever a user attempts the login .
Login Window simply passes the username and password to Open Directory ; Open Directory attempts to locate an entry in one of its databases ( a user entry in a directory database can also be referred to as a user object or a user account ) that matches the username entered and , assuming that it finds a match , verifies the password .
The results are then passed back to the Login Window , which either processes the user ’s login or rejects it .
For another example , the Mac OS X file system allows users to be designated as owners of the folders and files they create and enables access rights to be assigned to folders and files for other users .
The file system is n’t concerned with usernames or passwords ; it is concerned solely with user ID numbers that are associated as having access to or ownership of a folder or the group ID numbers that are specified as having some level of access to the folder .
When a user tries to access the folder , the file system looks to Open Directory for the user ID number to know whether the user is the folder ’s owner .
If not , it looks to Open Directory to know whether the user has permission to access the folder or is a member of a group designated with access rights to the folder .
The file system does n’t need to know the user ’s name or which groups the user belongs to .
Open Directory has that information stored as part of the user object , along with the relevant user ID and group ID numbers .
Open Directory does n’t just act as a moderator for user information .
It can contain entries or objects for groups of users , workgroups ( groups that have managed preferences settings ) , computers , computer lists , print queues , share points that are auto - mounted by computers , and varying kinds of presets .
Each of these objects has a series of unique attributes that contain identification or configuration information .
A user object , for example includes attributes ( or database fields ) for user ID number , full user name , shortname (s ) , password and password type , home directory location and storage quota , group membership , printer access and quotas , managed preferences configurations , email information , and administrative rights and options .
Through the broad range of information that Open Directory stores , it acts as a perfect repository for the information that various operating system and application components might need to access .
Keeping this information independent of the components or processes that need access to it ensures its integrity and availability .
It also allows the information to be centrally stored and managed , whether on a local workstation or in a shared directory stored on a Mac OS X Server Open Directory server .
Apple calls individual Open Directory databases domains ( they are also commonly called shared directories or shared domains ) .
Each Mac OS
X computer contains a built - in local Open Directory domain .
This domain is a NetInfo domain that contains information about local users and local resources for that computer .
Local domains provide you the ability to create multiple user accounts on a single computer .
Those user accounts are limited to that particular computer .
They can be used to connect to the computer over a network for file sharing , although this is accomplished using the Connect to Server option from the Finder ’s Go menu .
What happens when you use the Connect to Server command ( if it is not part of a shared domain ) is that the computer you are using establishes a connection to the requested computer ( a server or a workstation with file sharing enabled ) using a file sharing protocol , which will prompt you for a username password if both computers are not part of a shared directory domain .
The file sharing protocol on the requested computer then accesses its local directory domain to determine whether you are allowed access to any shared folders .
This process is very different from a shared directory domain .
A shared domain is an LDAP domain that is hosted on an Open Directory server ( for older Mac OS X Server infrastructures , the domain may also be a shared NetInfo domain , although using shared NetInfo domains has been significantly discouraged in the two Mac OS X Server versions ) .
The domain is shared over TCP / IP with other computers .
When you log in to a computer that is configured to access a shared domain , the computer first looks for your user entry in its local NetInfo domain and , if it does n’t find a match , looks to the shared domain .
When you log in , specified share points can be mounted automatically , giving you access to a network home directory and possibly other shared folders as well .
If you use the Connect to Server command to access resources on a server that is also part of the same directory domain ( whether you are connecting the same server that is hosting the domain or another server that is part of the domain ) , your user account is verified based on the shared domain without you needing to provide any separate information for the server .
Shared domains are the basis of Mac OS X administration .
They are where you store user accounts , create user groups , configure managed preferences , set up auto - mounting of share points , configure access to group folders and resources , and ca publish print queues to which your users can have access to and to which you can restrict their use .
You can have a single shared domain or you can have several .
If you have multiple directory domains , you need to determine the order in which Mac OS X computers will search them for Open Directory information .
This process is called establishing a search path .
A search path exists for all Mac OS X computers .
Even those with only local NetInfo domains have a search path , although their search path only contains the local domain .
If you have a single shared domain , the search path would be first the local domain and then the shared domain .
If you have more than one shared domain , the search path designates which shared domain to search first ( and then second , third , and so on ) .
Search paths can be configured in a number of ways .
Located in the / Applications / Utilities folder of any Mac OS X installation , Directory Access is the utility that allows you to configure which components of Open Directory are active and how those components interact with shared resources and shared directory domains .
Directory Access allows you to configure access to a shared domain for a workstation ( or , in certain situations , a server ) and allows you to specify the workstation ’s search path .
Directory Access consists of three tabs : Services , Authentication , and Contacts .
The Services tab contains a list of all the modules that are part of Open Directory .
Each of these modules relates either to a self - discovering network protocol or a directory service type .
The Authentication tab allows you to specify the Open Directory search path .
The Contacts tab allows you to specify a search path for contact information ( which can also be stored in an LDAP directory ) .
The Search path specified in the Contacts tab can theoretically be accessed by a number of Mac OS X applications , although only the Address Book and ( because of its integration with Address Book ) the Mac OS X Mail application make use of a Contacts search path in any practical method .
Contacts search paths are configured in the same way as Authentication search paths .
Each Open Directory module listed on the Services tab can be enabled or disabled using the checkbox next to it .
Note : you will need to authenticate using a local administrator account for the workstation using the padlock button to make changes in Directory Access , and you will need to click the Apply button to save and activate changes .
Disabling those modules related to self - discovering protocols can help you restrict user access to those protocols .
However , Open Directory modules do n’t provide full control of all of these services .
Those modules that provide directory services should be disabled only if you are certain that you will not provide authentication or user information based on those services .
By default , the search path is defined automatically as the local NetInfo domain and any shared domains specified by a DHCP server .
You can manually configure a search path or you can set Directory Access to create one automatically using the Authentication tab .
The Authentication tab contains a Search pop -up menu and a Directory Domain list .
The Search menu allows you to configure an automatic search path ( the default ) in which shared domains provided by a DHCP server are searched after the local NetInfo domain ( which is always first in any search path ) , a local directory search path that searches only the local NetInfo domain regardless of Open Directory module configurations , and a custom search path in which you manually specify which shared directories are included in the Directory Node list and the order in which they are searched .
To create a custom search path , you should first configure the appropriate Open Directory modules in the Services tab to access the directories you want to include in the search path .
For Open Directory LDAP domains ( those hosted by Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and higher ) , you would enable and configure the LDAP v3 module .
With each version of Mac OS X , configuring this module has gotten significantly easier .
In Mac OS X Tiger , it is simply a matter of clicking the New button and entering the IP address or DNS name of the Open Directory server ( along with choosing whether SSL will be used to secure the connection , which requires SSL configuration of the server , and whether the directory domain will be used for user authentication and access and / or for contact search paths ) .
Depending on the version of Mac OS X , you might also need to select Open Directory as the LDAP mappings for the domain , which specifies that the Open Directory schema is used by the domain , and enter the domain ’s search base ( which I ’ll explain in a bit ) .
Depending on the Mac OS X version , you might also need to configure the LDAPv3 module to allow automatic search paths to include domains specified by a DHCP server , as shown in the following figure .
Once access to the directories is configured , select Custom Path from the Authentication tab ’s Search pop -up menu .
Depending on the type of directories you choose , they can be listed automatically in the Directory Node list .
If they are not , click the Add button .
All available directories ( that is , those you have configured and that the workstation can locate over the network ) should be listed in the Available Directories dialog box that is displayed .
Select the directories you want to include in your search path and click OK .
They will be added to the Directory Domain list .
Drag the directories into the appropriate order ( top being first ) to create your search path , noting that the local NetInfo / root directory is grayed - out because it is always searched first .
If there are any directories in the Directory Domain list that you do n’t want included , select them and click the Remove button .
When you have configured your search path , click the Apply button to save and activate it .
Restart the computer , and the new search path will be implemented .
If you believe the internet is the fount of all wisdom , giving free rein to bloggers to exercise their vocal cords , think again .
Ancient English cliches and expressions are being mangled by the culture of cut and paste and the spread of unchecked writing on the internet .
According to the Oxford English Corpus , a database of a billion words , dozens of traditional phrases are now more commonly misspelled than rendered correctly in written English .
" Straight - laced " is used 66 % of the time even though it should be written " strait - laced " , according to lexicographers working for Oxford Dictionaries , who record the way English is spoken and written by monitoring books , television , radio and newspapers and , increasingly , websites and blogs .
" Just desserts " is used 58 % of the time instead of the correct spelling , " just deserts " ( desert is a variation of deserve ) , while 59 % of all written examples of the phrase in the Corpus call it a " font of knowledge or wisdom " when it should be " fount " .
It has become so widely used that the wrong version is now included in Oxford dictionaries alongside the right one .
Other mistakes fast becoming the received spelling include substituting " free reign " for the correct phrase , " free rein " .
The original refers to letting a horse loose , but many use " reign " and assume the expression means to allow a free rule .
Other examples of common mistakes include " slight of hand " instead of " sleight " , " phased by " when it should be " fazed by " , " butt naked " instead of the correct " buck naked " and " vocal chords " for " vocal cords . "
" We have to accept spelling is not fixed and can change over the years , " said Catherine Soanes , of Oxford Dictionaries .
" You only have to look back 100 years , when the word rhyme was spelled rime .
But since then we adopted rhyme as the correct spelling because this is more like the Greek word from which it originally came . "
She added : " Our Corpus has around 150 m words from the web and the way words are written often has to do with familiarity .
" For instance , 35 % of people say ' a shoe - in ' when actually it should be ' a shoo - in ' .
" But the original is an American phrase using a US version of the word " shoe " in the first place . "
According to the Corpus , another linguistic trend is the American habit of turning two words into one , such as someday , anymore and underway .
The Corpus also records how some words are used almost exclusively to apply to men and others to women .
Only men seem to hijack , crouch , kidnap , rob , grin , shoot , dig , stagger , leap , invent or brandish .
Women , meanwhile , tend to be the only ones to consent , faint , sob , cohabit , undress , clutch , scorn or gossip .
IS IT a new medium on a par with film and music , a valuable educational tool , a form of harmless fun or a digital menace that turns children into violent zombies ?
Video gaming is all these things , depending on whom you ask .
Gaming has gone from a minority activity a few years ago to mass entertainment .
Video games increasingly resemble films , with photorealistic images , complex plotlines and even famous actors .
The next generation of games consoles — which will be launched over the next few months by Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo — will intensify the debate over gaming and its impact on society , as the industry tries to reach out to new customers and its opponents become ever more vocal .
Games consoles are the most powerful mass - produced computers in the world and the new machines will offer unprecedented levels of performance .
This will , for example , make possible characters with convincing facial expressions , opening the way to games with the emotional charge of films , which could have broader appeal and convince sceptics that gaming has finally come of age as a mainstream form of entertainment .
But it will also make depictions of violence even more lifelike , to the dismay of critics .
This summer there has been a huge fuss about the inclusion of hidden sex scenes in “ Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas ” , a highly popular , but controversial , game in which the player assumes the role of a street gangster .
The sex scenes are not a normal part of the game ( see above for a typical image ) .
But the offending scenes can be activated using a patch downloaded from the internet .
Senator Hillary Clinton and a chorus of other American politicians have called for federal prosecutors to investigate the game and examine whether the industry 's system of self - regulation , which applies age ratings to games , is working properly .
Mrs Clinton accused video games of “ stealing the innocence of our children ” and “ making the difficult job of being a parent even harder ” .
As a result of the furore , “ Grand Theft Auto ” had its rating in America changed — from “ M ” for mature ( over - 17s only ) to “ AO ” for adults only ( over - 18s ) — by the industry 's rating board .
But since most big retailers refuse to stock “ AO ” titles , of which very few exist , Rockstar Games , the maker of “ Grand Theft Auto ” , is producing a new “ M ” - rated version without the hidden sexual material .
This is merely the latest round in a long - running fight .
Before the current fuss over “ Grand Theft Auto ” , politicians and lobby groups were getting worked up over “ Narc ” , a game that depicts drug - taking , and “ 25 to Life ” , another urban cops - and - robbers game .
Ironically , the “ Grand Theft Auto ” episode has re-ignited the debate over the impact of video games , just as the industry is preparing to launch its biggest - ever marketing blitz to accompany the introduction of its new consoles .
Amid all the arguments about the minutiae of rating systems , the unlocking of hidden content , and the stealing of children 's innocence , however , three important factors are generally overlooked : that attitudes to gaming are marked by a generational divide ; that there is no convincing evidence that games make people violent ; and that games have great potential in education .
Start with the demographics .
Attitudes towards gaming depend to a great extent on age .
In America , for example , half of the population plays computer or video games .
However most players are under 40 — according to Nielsen , a market - research firm , 76 % of them — while most critics of gaming are over 40 .
An entire generation that began gaming as children has kept playing .
The average age of American gamers is 30 .
Most are “ digital natives ” who grew up surrounded by technology , argues Marc Prensky of games2train , a firm that promotes the educational use of games .
He describes older people as “ digital immigrants ” who , like newcomers anywhere , have had to adapt in various ways to their new digital surroundings .
Just getting by in a foreign land without some grasp of the local language is difficult , says Mr Prensky .
Digital immigrants have had to learn to use technologies such as the internet and mobile phones .
But relatively few of them have embraced video games .
The word “ game ” itself also confuses matters , since it evokes childish playthings .
“ What they do n't understand , because they 've never played them , is that these are complex games , which take 30 , 40 or 100 hours to complete , ” says Mr Prensky .
Games are , in fact , played mainly by young adults .
Only a third of gamers are under 18 .
“ It 's just a generational divide , ” says Gerhard Florin , the European boss of Electronic Arts , the world 's biggest games publisher .
“ It 's people not knowing what they are talking about , because they have never played a game , accusing millions of gamers of being zombies or violent . ”
Digital natives who have played video games since childhood already regard them as a form of entertainment on a par with films and music .
Older digital natives now have children of their own and enjoy playing video games with them .
The gaming industry is trying to address the generational divide .
It is producing games designed to appeal to non-gamers and encouraging casual gamers ( who may occasionally play simple web - based games , or games on mobile phones ) to play more .
This has led to the development of games with a wider appeal .
Some of them replace the usual control pad with novel input devices : microphones for singing games , cameras for dancing and action games , and even drums .
In addition , the industry has started to cater more to women , who seem to prefer social simulation games such as “ The Sims ” , and to older people , who ( if they play games at all ) often prefer computerised versions of card games and board games .
Other promising avenues include portable gaming , mobile gaming and online downloads of simple games .
Many people enjoy gaming , but do not necessarily want to commit themselves to an epic quest that will take dozens of hours to complete .
The industry , in short , is doing its best to broaden gaming 's appeal , which is of course in its own best interests .
For the time being , however , the demographic divide persists , and it does much to explain the polarisation of opinion over gaming and , in particular , worries about violence .
It also provides the answer to a question that is often asked about gaming : when will it become a truly mainstream form of entertainment ?
It already is among the under - 40s , but will probably never achieve mainstream status among older people .
But are n't critics right to worry that gaming might make people violent ?
Hardly a week goes by in which a game is not blamed for inspiring someone to commit a violent crime .
After all , say critics , acting out violent behaviour in a game is very different from passively watching it in a film .
Yet surveys of studies into games and violence have produced inconclusive results , notes Dmitri Williams , who specialises in studying the social impact of media at the University of Illinois .
And , in a paper on the subject published in June in Communication Monographs , he notes that such research typically has serious shortcomings .
For example , studies have examined only the short - term effects of gaming .
There have been no studies that track the long - term effects on the players themselves .
Another problem , says Mr Williams , is that it is meaningless to generalise about “ game play ” when there are thousands of games in dozens of genres .
It is , he notes , equivalent to suggesting that all television programmes , radio shows and movies are the same .
Better - designed studies that measure the long - term effects of specific types of games are needed .
They 're beginning to happen .
In his paper , Mr Williams describes the first such study , which he carried out with Marko Skoric of the University of Michigan .
The study concentrated on a “ massively multiplayer online role - playing game ” ( MMORPG ) called “ Asheron 's Call 2 ” .
This type of game requires the player to roam around a fantasy world and kill monsters to build up attribute points .
It is “ substantially more violent than the average video game and should have more effect , given the highly repetitive nature of the violence ” , the researchers noted .
Two groups of subjects were recruited , none of whom had played MMORPGs before and many of whom had never played video games at all .
One group then played the game for a month , for an average of nearly two hours per day .
The other group acted as a control .
All participants were asked questions about the frequency of aggressive social interactions ( such as arguments with their spouses ) during the course of the month to test the idea that gaming makes people more aggressive .
Moral choices
Game players , it turned out , were no more aggressive than the control group .
Whether the participants had played games before , the number of hours spent gaming , and whether they liked violent movies or not , made no difference .
The researchers noted , however , that more research is still needed to assess the impact of other genres , such as shoot - ' em-ups or the urban violence of “ Grand Theft Auto ” .
All games are different , and only when more detailed studies have been carried out will it be possible to generalise about the impact of gaming .
But as Steven Johnson , a cultural critic , points out in a recent book , “ Everything Bad Is Good for You ” , gaming is now so widespread that if it did make people more violent , it ought to be obvious .
Instead , he notes , in America violent crime actually fell sharply in the 1990s , just as the use of video and computer games was taking off ( see chart 2 ) .
Of course , it 's possible that crime would have fallen by even more over the period had America not taken up video games ; still , video gaming has clearly not turned America into a more violent place than it was .
What 's more , plenty of games , far from encouraging degeneracy , are morally complex , subtle and , very possibly , improving .
Many now explicitly require players to choose whether to be good or evil , and their choices determine how the game they are playing develops .
In “ Black & White ” , for example , the player must groom a creature whose behaviour and form reflects his moral choices ( get it wrong and the results can be ugly — see the illustration ) .
Several games based on the “ Star Wars ” movies require players to choose between the light and dark sides of the Force , equivalent to good and evil .
Perhaps most striking is the sequence in “ Halo 2 ” , a bestselling shoot - 'em - up , in which the player must take the role of an alien .
Having previously seen aliens as faceless enemies , notes Paul Jackson of Forrester , a consultancy , “ suddenly you are asked to empathise with the enemy 's position .
It 's very interesting .
Games are much more complex than the critics realise . ”
The move away from linear narratives to more complex games that allow players to make moral choices , argues Mr Prensky , means that games provide an opportunity to discuss moral questions .
“ These are wonderful examples for us to be discussing with our kids , ” he says .
Indeed , perhaps the best way to address concerns over the effects of video games is to emphasise their vast potential to educate .
Even games with no educational intent require players to learn a great deal .
Games are complex , adaptive and force players to make a huge number of decisions .
Gamers must construct hypotheses about the in - game world , learn its rules through trial and error , solve problems and puzzles , develop strategies and get help from other players via the internet when they get stuck .
The problem - solving mechanic that underlies most games is like the 90 % of an iceberg below the waterline — invisible to non-gamers .
But look beneath the violent veneer of “ Grand Theft Auto ” , and it is really no different from a swords - and - sorcery game .
Instead of stealing a crystal and delivering it to a wizard so that he can cure the princess , say , you may have to intercept a consignment of drugs and deliver it to a gang boss so he can ransom a hostage .
It is the pleasure of this problem - solving , not the superficial violence which sometimes accompanies it , that can make gaming such a satisfying experience .
Nobody is using “ Grand Theft Auto ” in schools , of course , since it is intended for adults .
But other off - the - shelf games such as “ Sim City ” or “ Rollercoaster Tycoon ” , which contain model economies , are used in education .
By playing them it is possible to understand how such models work , and to deduce what their biases are .
( In “ Sim City ” , for example , in which the player assumes the role of a city mayor , no amount of spending on health care is ever enough to satisfy patients , and the fastest route to prosperity is to cut taxes . )
Games can be used in many other ways .
Tim Rylands , a British teacher in a primary school near Bristol , recently won an award from Becta , a government education agency , for using computer games in the classroom .
By projecting the fantasy world of “ Myst ” , a role - playing game , on to a large screen and prompting his 11 - year - old pupils to write descriptions and reactions as he navigates through it , he has achieved striking improvements in their English test scores .
Another area where games are becoming more popular is in corporate training .
In “ Got Game ” , a book published last year by Harvard Business School Press , John Beck and Mitchell Wade , two management consultants , argue that gaming provides excellent training for a career in business .
Gamers , they write , are skilled at multi-tasking , good at making decisions and evaluating risks , flexible in the face of change and inclined to treat setbacks as chances to try again .
Firms that understand and exploit this , they argue , can gain a competitive advantage .
Pilots have been trained using flight simulators for years , and simulators are now used by soldiers and surgeons too .
But gaming can be used to train desk workers as well .
Mr Prensky 's firm has provided simple quiz games for such firms as IBM and Nokia , to test workers ' knowledge of rules and regulations , for example .
For Pfizer , a drug company , his firm built a simulation of its drug - development process that was then used to train new recruits .
Other examples abound : PricewaterhouseCoopers built an elaborate simulation to teach novice auditors about financial derivatives .
Some lawyers are using simulators to warm up for court appearances .
Convincing older executives of the merits of using games in training can be tricky , Mr Prensky admits .
“ But when they have a serious strategic training problem , and realise that their own people are 20 - year - olds , more and more are willing to take the leap , ” he says .
So games are inherently good , not bad ?
Actually they are neither , like books , films , the internet , or any other medium .
All can be used to depict sex and violence , or to educate and inform .
Indeed , the inclusion of violent and sexual content in games is arguably a sign of the maturity of the medium , as games become more like films .
Movies provide one analogy for the future of gaming , which seems destined to become a mainstream medium .
Games already come in a variety of genres , and are rated for different age groups , just like movies .
But just how far gaming still has to go is illustrated by the persistence of the double standard that applies different rules to games and films .
Critics of gaming object to violence in games , even though it is common in movies .
They worry about the industry 's rating model , even though it is borrowed from the movie industry .
They call upon big retailers ( such as Wal - Mart ) not to sell AO - rated games , but seem not to mind that they sell unrated movies that include far more explicit content .
In June , Senator Charles Schumer held a press conference to draw attention to the M- rated game “ 25 to Life ” , in which players take the role of a policeman or a gangster .
“ Little Johnny should be learning how to read , not how to kill cops , ” he declared .
True , but little Johnny should not be smoking , drinking alcohol or watching Quentin Tarantino movies either .
Just as there are rules to try to keep these things out of little Johnny 's hands , there are rules for video games too .
Political opportunism is part of the explanation for this double standard : many of gaming 's critics in America are Democrats playing to the centre .
Another analogy can be made between games and music — specifically , with the emergence of rock and roll in the 1950s .
Like games today , it was a new art form that was condemned for encouraging bad behaviour among young people .
Some records were banned from the radio , and others had their lyrics changed .
Politicians called for laws banning the sending of offending records by post .
But now the post - war generation has grown up , rock and roll is considered to be harmless .
Rap music , or gaming , is under attack instead .
“ There 's always this pattern , ” says Mr Williams of the University of Illinois .
“ Old stuff is respected , and new stuff is junk . ”
Novels , he points out , were once considered too lowbrow to be studied at university .
Eventually the professors who believed this retired .
Novels are now regarded as literature .
“ Once a generation has its perception , it is pretty much set , ” says Mr Williams .
“ What happens is that they die . ”
Like rock and roll in the 1950s , games have been accepted by the young and largely rejected by the old .
Once the young are old , and the old are dead , games will be regarded as just another medium and the debate will have moved on .
Critics of gaming do not just have the facts against them ; they have history against them , too .
“ Thirty years from now , we 'll be arguing about holograms , or something , ” says Mr Williams .

Of course , exercising at your desk is a great way to break up the day .

« Quote of the day | Main | Meeting Moe »
Earlier this month , the Western Standard was sued in human rights court for publishing the Danish cartoons .
It 's been ten years since I 've graduated from law school , and I 've never seen a more frivolous , vexatious , infantile suit than this .
But that 's the point -- this complaint is not about beating us in the law .
Freedom of speech is still in our constitution ; we 'll win in the end .
It 's a nuisance suit , designed to grind us down , cost us money , and serve as a warning to other , more timid media .
The hand - written scrawl and the spelling errors were what first disgusted me with the suit ; but the arguments were what really got me .
The complainant , Imam Syed Soharwardy , a former professor at an anti-Semitic university in Saudi Arabia , does n't just argue that we should n't have published the cartoons .
He argues that we should n't be able to defend our right to publish the cartoons .
The bulk of his complaint was that we dared to try to justify it .
He argues that advocating a free press should be a thought crime .
Here is a letter I sent out to our e-mail list , explaining our legal situation .
Here is the formal response I shall file with the human rights commission tomorrow .
And here is where you can chip in to our legal defence fund if you want to support us .
Our lawyers tell me we 'll likely win , but it could cost us up to $ 75,000 to do so -- and the case against us is being prosecuted by government employees using tax dollars .
We 're a small , independent magazine and we do n't have deep pockets to fight off nuisance suits , so please chip in if you can .
ADDENDUM : In response to various commenters , unfortunately , even if we are successful in the human rights commission , we will not be compensated for our legal fees .
It 's not like a real court , where an unsuccessful plaintiff would be ordered to pay a successful defendant 's costs .
So even if we win , we lose -- the process is the penalty .
Worse than that , the radical imam who is suing us does n't have to put up a dime -- the commission uses tax dollars to pay lawyers and other inquisitors to go at us directly .
Human rights tribunals themselves are illiberal institutions .
Read my larger brief , linked above .
UPDATE 1 : Here is a scan of the imam 's complaint .
UPDATE 2 : We are currently working to change our legal defence fund web page to accept donations from outside Canada .
In the meantime , please e-mail Rita at [ email protected ] or phone us at 403-216-2270 and we can help you that way -- thanks !

If you win , can you counter sue to recover your legal costs ?
Posted by : qwerty | 2006-03-29 8:23:03 PM
It 's a very good reply , Ezra .
I have a few comments .
In 6 (d ) , where the complainant is stating his objection to the cartoons - that they violate fundamentalist Muslim prohibition against any depictions of Mohammed - well :
1 ) Is all Islam also fundamentalist ?
That is , must Islamic observance be only of one type - namely - fundamentalist ?
2 ) It is untrue that Mohammed is not imagized ; I 'm sure you are aware of the rebuttals of this false assertion - with the references to the many Islamic produced images of Mohammed in paintings in museums etc .
3 ) This ' rule ' can only apply to Muslims .
If you are not a Muslim , then , the rule cannot apply to you .
The Islamic community has no right to insist that its religious laws must be followed by non-Muslims .
After all , in Catholic Christianity , it is a rule that one must go to mass at certain times , e.g. , Christmas eve .
Now , is Canada going to insist that all Muslims obey this rule ?
Again - the rule applies only to Muslims .
If you are not Muslim - the rule cannot apply .
4 ) The fundamental role of free speech , and the freedom to question , debate , dissent and criticize is a basic component of western society .
It has to be retained .
See Karl Popper 's examination of this in ' The Open Society and Its Enemies ' .. where he talks about the dangers of the Closed ( tribal ) society ..e.g. , as found in the Islamic world .
And , there 's Natan Sharansky 's book on the vital role of dissent ( The Case for Democracy ' .
5 ) The cartoons were asking necessary and legitimate political questions - namely , IF Islam is a religion of peace , then , why are you , in the name of that religion , advocating terrorism and carrying out terrorist actions ?
These questions MUST be asked of the religion , and must be answered .
6 ) There is also something else important .
A political ideology , such as is found in fundamentalist Islam , which has an open , public and fully stated agenda , to conquer all peoples and force them to submit to their Sharia Law , CANNOT be hidden from debate under the cover of a ' religious ideology ' and thereby , moved beyond the openness of questions , debate and dissent .
To move a political ideology out of the realm of questions , by saying that it is a religious ideology and cannot be discussed - puts us , the west , into the situation of ' slavery ' .
We can not argue about what these people wish to do to us .
That is extremely dangerous .
Posted by : ET | 2006-03-29 8:43:14 PM
This should not even receive the dignity of a response except to demand the Commission dismiss the case forthwith .
All who care about freedom of speech should send a copy or link to the cartoons in question to the Commission and ask to be added as co-respondents with The Western Standard .
Cheers .
Eric

Why are n't your lawyers recommending to the WS to counter sue for compensation of all legal fees and other costs bourne by members of the Western Standard .
That is standard practice .
If they are so sure that you will win they should be recommending this to you .
Good luck , I am sure you will win also , with your eyes closed .
Posted by : wasp | 2006-03-29 9:21:51 PM
Levant is being slightly dishonest in his representation of the facts here .
First of all , one is not " sued " before the Human Rights Commission .
A complaint is filed with the Commission , with the HRC is then obligated to investigate .
If there is no cause for further action , then the complaint is dismissed .
Cases are not " prosecuted " as Levant suggests .
The HRC is an administrative tribunal , not a court .
In terms of a civil suit , the plaintiffs in this case have as much right as anyone else to lay a claim .
They have the burden of proving their claim .
Levant and crew could counter - sue , but more likely they will just seek costs in the event that they win .
Do n't be duped into providing funds to defend the poor little Western Standard .
Law suits are a part of being in the public eye ... media organizations sue and are sued all the time .
That 's just part of the game .

1 . Ofcourse , being a lawyer , you would know that the mens rea of the Criminal Code offence is higher than the provincial legislation -( intentional vs. likely ) .
Just becasue the police did n't lay charges does n't prove that you have not crossed the threshold of the Human Rights Act .
2. “ during the years when my colleagues and I were labouring to create such commissions , we never imagined that they might ultimately be used against freedom of speech ” sez Borovoy .
Then why did he and his colleagues include s. 3 of the act - which begins with a very explicit NO PERSON SHALL PUBLISH ...
seems like a clear limitation on free speech to me - where 's the ambiguity there ?
3 . If you have counsel why not let them respond .
You know what they say about having a fool for a client .
Your response strikes me as more PR than legal argument .

If this is about " freedom of speech " why is there no mention on this blog about the * Canadian * journalist imprisoned in Belarus during a pro-democracy rally ?
It is hypocritical ( to say the least ) to bleat about " freedom of the press " to print cartoons published in Europe , meanwhile ignoring the plight of a fellow Canadian , and a colleague for heaven 's sake , who is thrown in a foreign jail under who knows what kind of conditions .
Not very consistent coverage .

If I 'm reading the Alberta Human Rights & Citizenship Commission web site correctly :
If a complainant chooses to use the services of a lawyer to present his / her case - the complainant will bear the cost of this .
Implied seems to be that one can also choose to argue their own case .
I do n't see where it says that government employees will " prosecute the case " .
There is no prosecution of a case - it is initially only the presentation of a complaint and the requirement of a response .
The complaint will be investigated as to merit to see if the tribunal will hear the case or not .
Perhaps there is also a civil suit happening as well as a complaint to the Human Rights Tribunal ??
One of the 6 commissioners on the Human Rights Commission is Diane Colley - Urquhart - who is also an alderman in the City of Calgary .
In the event that she is eventually sitting on the tribunal to adjudicate this case - my question would be as to how her situation is not a conflict of interest .
This would be a high profile case and how could she not be cognizant of her political constituency in coming to a decision .

I once heard a Muslim say , " The two things I have not seen are the face of God and the compassion of a mullah " .
It would seem perhaps that a third item , and IQ larger than his foot size , is missing from the intellect of the particular Muslim who feels that the entire world should follow in his radical steps and who is seeing fit to abuse our laws and customs .

Originally , I thought the cartoons were essentially tasteless , condescending and irrelevant .
Thanks to people like Imam Syed Soharwardy , I now see how foolishly naive and idealistic I have been .
If we 're going to keep score , then why not start with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Canadian Constitution ?
I am appalled to think that my country would give the time of day to anyone who , as a way of life , is unfailingly contemptuous of the following :
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ( United Nations , 1948 ) :
Article 18 .
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief , and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance .
Article 19 .
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers .
Article 21 . ..... ( 3 ) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government ; this shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures .
Article 26 .
( 1 ) Everyone has the right to education .
Education shall be free , at least in the elementary and fundamental stages .
Elementary education shall be compulsory .
Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit .
(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
It shall
promote understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , racial or religious groups ...
Article 28 .
Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized .
And from the CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS :
Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law :

Maclean 's cover shot today was suggesting that Jesus did not really die on the cross .
Now I am in a quandry , shall I burn a falafel stand or shall I donate to free speech ?
Actually , Ezra , do n't show up .
Take a fall and appeal all the way to the Supreme Court .
Arguing against them only legitamizes thier complaints and allows the commision a bit more pomposity .
Excuse the language , but fuck the idiots over .

1 . A human rights panel has jurisdiction to order costs ( s.32 ( 2 ) ) .
If you get costs will you give back the money or use the legal defense fund to pay off some of the magz debt ?
2 . What if you incur no costs or take in more than you spend will you give back the money or use the legal defense fund to pay off some of the magz debt ?
3 . The director can dismiss the complaint outright , attempt to effect a settlement ( and note that if the complainant refuses to accept a fair and reasonable settlement the director can dismiss ) .
If a settlement can't be reached the complaint can be investigated .
If the investigation reveals the complaint is without merit it will be dismissed .
There should be very little , if any legal costs associated with the above .
If any of those occur will you give back the money or use the legal defense fund to pay off some of the magz debt ?
4 . You 're bound to get much more than $ 75 , 000 in PR out of this so it 's a little hard to feel sorry for you .

More than one person here has already called out Mr Levant 's latest attempt at headline grabbbing and twisting of the facts , so I will not labor any more the obvious .
What disturbs me is the callous lack of accountability on behalf of the Western Standard and Mr Levant .
He knowingly and willingly publishes a high risk article , and lo and behold the crap hits the fan .
Any basic risk analysis as would be conducted by an intelligent person such as Mr Levant would have revealed this outcome as highly probable .
He then asks his readership to bail him out .
Get real !
Mr Levant , you took the risk , now assume the responsibility for that risk .
And please do n't hide behind the " poor Western Standard " schtick .
Any credible news media has contingencies ( read : insurance ) in place for the inevitable litigation that follows such journalistic ventures .
If not , like the guy above said , its part of the game .

I always thought the HRC was a quasi- judicial kangaroo court from its inception .
Was it actually intended to have anything to do with civil liberties ?
Or was it set up as an unjust way to punish political incorrectness by bypassing our actual rights ?
Posted by : Javahead | 2006-03-29 11:52:11 PM
I think it is wrong to use a " Human Rights Commission " to sue for any violation of rights .
In fact I think if any rights have been violated , i.e. any laws broken , then the courts should be used for that .
If no law was broken ( in this case it was lawful to publish the cartoons ) , then no legal action of any kind should be taken .
I say that the HRC should be abolished and the regular courts used for any law breaking .
It seems to me that the HRC is a parallel legal system with its own rules and this is dangerous to a society governed by rule of law .
The idea of a Human Rights Commission implies that there are certain rights that cannot be protected by law .
If there are any rights not currently protected in our constitution then this should be remedied , but not in a " Human Rights Commission "

I wonder if people would react the same way if the comments published affected jewish or christian sensibilities .
while i agree that freedom of speech is a right , we really must wonder what would happen if a muslim paper published comments that jews found anti semitic .
surely the outcry would have been overwhelming .
I often wonder whether , in our wonderfully ' open ' society , our freedoms are only there for us when convenient but when others criticize us they become racist or ' the other ' .

I 'll pass on saying I told you this was going to happen , but only because it was obvious to anyone with a brain .
now that it has , a few questions and some free advice
1 ) if this complaint is indeed entirely without merit - and while I presume it is , it 's hard to tell , since the only evidence offered is Levant 's overheated description of the complaint , which is long on bluster and short on detail -- then why do you have to bring in the big legal guns ?
Seems to me that anyone with a little legal training - like , oh , Ezra -- should be able to knock this baby out of the park , especially since human rights commissions are used to hearing from self - represented litigants .
2 ) How the hell did you not see this one coming ?
Or perhaps you did and recognized the potential for fundraising offered by just such as complaint ?
3 ) Maybe a good place to start is being honest with your readers about the process , ?
On second thought , naaaah , that would be out of character .
It 's so much better to blubber , play the martyr and pass the hat .
5 ) A word of advice : if ET thinks your legal briefs are " very good " , consider tearing them up and starting again .

Java Head is right .
The CEO of the NB Human Rights Commission refuses to accept the authority of the NB Government which created the HRC , to define or amend regulations and to answer
for decisions .
In Nova Scotia the HRC is strictly a political vehicle , focused on racial
complaints .
I have long felt that HRC's in Canada should be terminated since they in fact are driven by bias and profound ignorance ; they serve no useful purpose .
Posted by : Jack Macleod | 2006-03-30 1:08:44 AM
Hey guys at the WS ..... good job upholding the
standards and responsibilities of the press ..... all alone .
Hopefully the " Human Rights Commission " will immediately rule for the fundamental rights you exercised , rather than lending any credence to someone who seeks to impose his feverish views on others .
Any entertainment of this type of complainant in any positive manner reflects a belief that the rights we have in Canada are subjective rather than fundamental .
That is the issue , and so you can be assured of any support I can give should the case move anywhere other than the wastebasket it belongs in .
I would nevertheless thank the imam for raising into the light the debate ( or glaring lack of ) regarding Canada 's immigration policies .
Political correctness is just a poor excuse for not asking uncomfortable , but very valid , questions .
Are muslim beliefs compatible with Canada ?
Does the imam's wish to subjegate our freedoms represent what all muslims want ?
Do all muslims in Canada want to see us bow to their religious whims ?
I 'm not hearing any denials of this man 's actions from other " Canadian " muslims ..... are they Canadians or just soldiers of infiltration ?
There is no greater importance to an advanced education system than the teachings of history .
It is there that we are supposed to learn from the many mistakes and failures of past eras and avoid the same results .
We tread now on a well worn path .
If our society is not going to stand and defend it 's freedoms hard won over many years , our society will vanish .
Rights and freedoms are either absolute , for all citizens , and not open to interpretation , equivocation and grey areas ..... or they mean less than nothing .
They become words used to suppress the rights and freedoms they claim to quantify .
After all .... you 're just two islamophobic jews from a western hick town ..... isn't that how it goes ?

Yeah !
Publishers should n't take risks or make a stand for freedom of speech , because something bad might happen !
How DARE he ask for support !
Everyone knows the Canadian way is to lobby the government to support the mag with taxpayer funds to maintain " Canadian identity " in media !
Geez , the guy 's looking at a substantial cost to his mag because some nutbar 's feelings were hurt and Canada 's legal system can't find its arse with both hands .
All he 's doing is asking .
He 's not demanding anybody pay him anything .

Right on Phil , Jack and Cyprian Libera .
Do we really need the thought police to be called to rule on a case of toonophobia ?
If the HRC does not recognize this complaint as an attack on our freedom of thought , speech , and press , ultimately they facilitate and enable religious terrorism .
No author , publisher , or bookstore will be exempt from threats or attack .
If the HRC is complicent in this they must be disbanded ( and should be anyway ) .
There have recently been peaceful demonstrations in London and New York reaffirming freedom of speech and solidarity with Denmark - complete with placards depicting the Mohammed cartoons and Danish flags .
People are waking up .
From a speech by Leonard Peikoff entitled " Religious Terrorism vs. Free Speech " , he writes :
" But two California bookstores have already been bombed , a New York weekly newspaper has been demolished by firebombing , at least 178 threats of death or destruction have been received by booksellers nationwide , major American publishers ( primarily Viking ) are barricaded at ruinous cost behind an army of private security guards -- and every American author , speaker , and reader must wonder if and when he will become a target of armed Islamic fundamentalists with orders to kill heretics . "

" PM " above is being unfair .
PM claims that the Shotgun should have necessarily covered the Belarussian detention of a Canadian in order to be not - inconsistent vis-a - vis this stupid stunt by some Islamic fundamentalnut claiming to be related to the Prophet Who Must Not Be Depicted .
PM does n't want to remember that the Shotgun has limited resources and all .
The Shotgun cannot cover and comment on everything that happens any more than can I or PM .
I suspect PM is a leftist .
And I believe that " human rights " courts already are in great disrepute , having demonstrated a pigheaded agenda of aggressive social reengineering in line with the overall leftist state apparatus forced upon us by Liberals .

Mr. Levant :
As a lawyer myself , I commend the strength and eloquence of your brief to the AHRCC .
Who says those wretched three years of law school were for naught ?
In the event that the AHRCC hears this farcical complaint ( as a secular Canadian , I hope that the hearing does proceed and the the WS succeeds absolutely ) , may I suggest calling Mr. Borovoy as a supporting witness for the WS ?
That is , use Mr. Borovoy 's considerable intelligence and lengthy human rights cv to refute absolutely the bases of the Islamist 's complaint .
Take heart - CAIR was recently soundly trounced in a US court by Anti-CAIR - you might want to speak to Andrew Whitehead about his experience in that matter .
Good luck , cheque to follow .

Now the Muslims are suing in Denmark for defamation , after failing to get a criminal prosecution .
http://tinyurl.com/eldjh
COPENHAGEN , Denmark --
A group of 27 Danish Muslim organizations have filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper that first published the carricatures of Islam 's Prophet Muhammad , their lawyer said Thursday .
The lawsuit was filed Wednesday , two weeks after Denmark 's top prosecutor declined to press criminal charges , saying the drawings that sparked a firestorm in the Muslim world did not violate laws against racism or blasphemy .

Ezra , I would suggest you hire your own contributor David Warren for your defense .
This post is your defense ..
http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?artID=590
A quote .. “ like the organized Danish cartoon apoplexy ( still continuing in some parts of the world , where Muslim demagogues are still using it to whoop up anti-Western hysteria ) , brings us face to face with Islamic doctrines inimical to the survival of our civilization . ….
…. We cannot pretend for long , the way President Bush has been doing ( albeit from humane and sound tactical motives to begin with ) , that the Shariah is compatible with freedom and democracy .
The systems of government we advocate , or by necessity impose , must explicitly provide civil protection to non-Muslims and Muslims alike , against Shariah courts and their rulings .
I have come to realize there is no alternative to this . ”

Freedom of expression is being tested in Canada and I fear we are may not be up to the test .
Ezra , I tend to agree with WallyJ , do n't respond to the Human rights suit . .
My understanding is that Human rights commissions can accept secondhand or hearsay evidence as truth .
I have no legal knowledge but common sense tells one that such a commisson with massive powers needs correcting itself .
While I cannot contribute now , I will certainly do so if you ignore the Human rights fight and take this into courts where heresy evidence is not accepted into the decision making .
Its time to put Human rights tribunal 's validity on trial and what better entity than Western Standard ?
You may even get the opportunity to show the cartoons again

Posted by : deepblue | 2006-03-30 8:15:55 AM
nomdenet - thanks for the link .
It 's a good outline of the incompatibility of Sharia Law and western laws .
But , this brings up the question - is this case about Sharia law vs western law ?
Sharia is not legal in Canada .
Or -
Is it ?
Consider our deeply flawed Canadian Charter of Rights , which gives a few cursory brief nods to basic human rights - four fundamental freedoms ; the right to vote and the length of time without a vote ; the right to enter / leave Canada , rights of trial , equality ..
All of this takes up a mere two and 1/2 pages .
The major part of the document and I maintain the real reason for its development - is the ' Official Languages of Canada ' , sections 16 through 23 , with many subsections , which takes up more than the rest of the rights ( 3 pages ) .
Now , in this flawed charter , with most of its specifics focused on bilingualism , we find :
2 fundamental Freedoms
- freedom of conscience and religion
- freedom of thought , belief , opinion and expression , including freedom of the press and other media of communication
- freedom of peaceful assembly ; and
- freedom of association .
OK .
Now , a US definition of ' fundamental ' is that ' fundamental liberty interests must be so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental ' .
So , the question then moves to ' what / whose traditions and conscience " ?
How are Canada 's traditions defined ?
For that - you have to move to our Charter 's Section 15 , 26 , 27 .
And that 's a problem .
We find in our Charter , that flawed clause 15 - Equality Rights - in which ' subsection a ' assserts our equality and ' b ' denies that equality .
All in one clause .
15 ( 1 ) .. Every individual is equal ... the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination ... based on race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , sex , age or mental or physical disability ' .
15 ( 2 ) ' Subsection ( 1 ) does not preclude any law , program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , sex , age or mental or physical disability ' .
So - in ONE clause , you have both an affirmation of equality and an open denial of equality .
Any group could latch onto subsection 2 , and claim that printing the cartoons was an act of discrimination that did not ' ameliorate the conditions '.. of ' disadvantaged Muslims in Canada ' who are disadvantaged and discriminated against in Canada because they are blamed for terrorism ... when everyone knows that it was Bush and the CIA and whoever .. who blew up the towers and etc ...
And , there 's Section 26
" The guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada " .
Now - what 's that supposed to mean ?
In this flawed Charter , the only real crisp detailed articulations deal with Bilingualism .
The rest is amorphous , contradictory and so open to interpretation as to be meaningless .
And then , Section 27
' This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians ' ?
Again - what 's that supposed to mean ?
Does that mean that if my immigrant group has a heritage of murdering a woman who is raped , that I ought to have this right preserved , because it 's part of our ' multicultural heritage ' ?
Remember , the SCC has already ruled that I can wear a ' knife ' to school , because it 's part of my ancient religion .
My point is that our deeply flawed Charter provides us with very few rights - because the ' fundamental four ' of Section 2 - which did n't need a Charter for their affirmation , are readily denied by THREE other Sections ( 15 , 26 , 27 ) .. whose meaning is so ambiguous that any EverReady Multiculturalist can make them mean whatever he wants .
And what he might want , would be to deny freedom of expression .
That 's the agenda of the Muslim attempt to install ' blasphemy laws ' in Canada .
The serious problem with Islam is that it is not merely a religious ideology , which ought to deal only with metaphysical issues ; it is also a social ideology - which deals with personal human interactions , BUT , BUT , it is a political ideology - which deals with state and legal issues .
And , by defining this political / legal ideology as ' religious ' , Islam asserts that any discussion and debate about this agenda - is not permitted .
That 's totalitarianism .

So if the cartoons are blasphemous in some way , then so is the entire muslim religion which says Christ is not the son of god !

They should shut down the entire religion and turn the mosques into public housing .

Ezra ,
Please keep us informed as to your fundraising success .
Although being sued will discourage others from expressing freedom of the press , your success at raising funds , will encourage others , to be brave .
The Dutch have produced a video that shows would - be immigrants what kind of nation they are , and what would - be immigrants should expect , once they hit the soil running .
As Canadians , we should produce one ourselves .
And you do n't have to look at it , if you do n't like it !
I move we produce one with all the scantilizing benefits of being a Canadian ( beer , peanuts AND rednecks ) along with the entire spectrum of the Canadian population , without gloss .
First they came after Western Standard , then they came after middle of the road standard .
The next thing you know , they will be running around beating us ladies , and demanding we cover oursleves , and stay at home , because it is a violation of their interpretation of their religion .
Then they will insist they have the right , according to their beliefs , to beat women and cut off women 's genitalia , like they do in other countries !
And we never see them fanatical extremist types getting offended at the genocide in Sudan .
Now why is that ?
Is it because those who are perpetrating those crimes , are in agreement with those who object to the publishing of the Danish cartoons ?
Or perhaps it is because they are interested in Jihad more than being good people in the world ?
Enoughs enough Ezra .
Nil carborundum bastardii !
" If they do n't like what they see here , ( expletive deletive ) " , then perhaps they should re-evaluate whether they made the right choice to come here in the first place ?

Millions of dollars have been provided in a " pro-democracy programme " that Chávez supporters claim is a covert attempt to bankroll an opposition to defeat the government .
The money is being provided by the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) through its Office of Transition Initiatives .
The row follows the recent announcement that the US had made $ 80 m ( £ 42 m ) available for groups seeking to bring about change in Cuba , whose leader , Fidel Castro , is a close ally of Mr Chávez .
Information about the grants has been obtained following a Freedom of Information request by the Associated Press .
USAID released copies of 132 contracts but obscured the names and other identifying details of nearly half the organisations .
The Office of Transition Initiatives , which also works in such " priority countries " as Iraq , Afghanistan , Bolivia and Haiti , has overseen more than $ 26 m in grants to groups in Venezuela since 2002 .
Among the grants detailed in the information are : one for $ 47,459 for a " democratic leadership campaign " ; $ 37,614 for citizen meetings to discuss a " shared vision " for society ; and one of $ 56,124 to analyse Venezuela 's new constitution .
" What this indicates is that there is a great deal of money , a great deal of concern to oust or neutralise Chávez , " said Larry Birns , director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs ( Coha ) in Washington yesterday .
" The US is waging diplomatic warfare against Venezuela . "
He said that while the US had accused Mr Chávez of destabilising Latin American countries , the term " destabilisation " more aptly applied to what the US was trying to do to Mr Chávez .
" It 's trying to implement regime change , " Eva Golinger , a Venezuelan - American lawyer who wrote The Chávez Code : Cracking US Intervention in Venezuela , told AP .
" There 's no doubt about it .
I think the US government tries to mask it by saying it's a noble mission . "
She added : " It 's too suspicious to have such a high level of secrecy . "
President Chávez has also accused groups of taking American money and predicted that the US will seek to use its influence in Venezuela 's December polls .
USAID officials denied any suggestion the money had any political aim and said the reason for anonymity for some groups was to protect them from potential harassment .
" The goal of the programme is to strengthen democracy , which is consistent with President Bush 's ' Freedom Agenda ' , " said a USAID official yesterday .
" A strong civil society is a critical part of any healthy democracy , just as it is in the United States , England or anywhere else in the world . "
The official said that the money was used to pay for " a wide range of seminars , educational programmes and even public service TV commercials aimed at promoting dialogue between pro- and anti-Chávez camps .
Other projects include workshops on conflict resolution , efforts to promote human rights , and training for positive citizen involvement in their communities . "
USAID also supports programmes such as day - care centres for the poor , improvement for schools , junior sports teams , and children 's homes , the official said , adding that the sums being spent in Venezuela were much smaller than those allocated elsewhere this year in Latin America , with USAID budgeting $ 3.8 m for Venezuela compared with $ 84.8 m for Bolivia and $ 85.1 m for Peru .
The row comes just as China has agreed to invest $ 5bn in energy projects in Venezuela , including the building of 13 oil rigs and 18 oil tankers .
Last week Mr Chávez announced that China was endorsing Venezuela 's bid for the rotating Latin America seat on the 15 - member security council , a candidacy strongly opposed by the US .
The commercial arrangements with Beijing are seen as part of the Chávez government 's strategy of establishing new links so as to lessen the country 's dependence on US trade .
As a symbol of the friendly relations established between Mr Chávez and the London mayor , Ken Livingstone , there will be a festival of Latin - American music with a Caracas theme in Trafalgar Square this Friday evening .
The two men met earlier this summer when the president was a guest at an event hosted by the mayor .
· Results of AP 's Freedom of Information Act request : hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/_documents/ven_dollars.xls
GENERAL BACKGROUNDGW :
In 2001 , you were working as an information technology specialist for Fiduciary Trust .
Were you the main IT person for Fiduciary Trust , or were you an assistant IT person ?
SF : I worked within an IT department of around 100 as a senior DBA [ database administrator ] and team leader .
GW : Fiduciary Trust had floors 90 and 94 -97 of the South Tower at that time .
Did you work on a specific floor , or did your duties normally keep you roaming on several floors ?
SF : I and my technology colleagues worked on the 97th floor ... in the course of the day we would have meetings or give support on other floors but most our time would have been spent on the 97th floor .
THE WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER 8TH AND 9THGW :
You 've previously stated that on the weekend of September 8 and 9 , 2001 , there was a " power down " condition in world trade center Tower 2 , the South Tower , and that this power down condition meant there was no electrical supply for approximately 36 hours from floor 50 up .
Do you know what time the power - down started ?
SF : All systems were shutdown on Saturday morning and the power down condition was in effect from approximately 12 noon on Saturday September 8 , 2001 .
GW : When did it end ?
SF : Approximately 2 PM on Sunday 9/9.GW : How do you know that there was no electricity from floor 50 up , if Fiduciary Trust was on much higher floors -- starting at the 90th floor ?
SF : I can't absolutely verify that there was no power on lower floors ... all I can validate is that we were informed of the power down condition , that we had to take down all systems and then the following day had to bring back up all systems ... GW : You 've previously stated that you were aware of the power down since you worked in the IT department and had to work with many others that weekend to ensure that all systems were cleanly shutdown beforehand ... and then brought back up afterwards .
How many other Fiduciary Trust folks were you working with ?
Can any of them verify your story ?
SF : Many , many people worked on the power down , both from the IT department and from the business , revalidating systems when they were available again .
Other people can validate my information .
Some people do not remember the circumstances , some people will not revisit that time ... but others acknowledge the power down freely and can validate my information .
GW : You said the reason given by the World Trade Center or Port Authority for the power down was that cabling in the tower was being upgraded .
Do you know what parts of the building or how extensive the area would have been for upgrading cabling ?
In other words , would the area being worked on have been near the outer walls of the tower ?
Near the core ?
In the middle ?
SF : I have no knowledge about this and can't comment ... GW : You also stated that , without power , there were no security cameras .
How do you know that ?
Could there have been backup generators which powered the security cameras ?
SF : Within my company security cameras were monitored and videos retained for reference .
They were powered from the usual power supplies so they would ave been out of action like all other electrical appliances .
GW : You also stated that , without power , there were security locks on doors .
Are you just referring to outside doors , or also office doors ?
Were the locks electrical or key ?
If electrical , were they battery - operated ?
SF : I was referring to the secure doors accessing my companies floors ( and other companies ) .
I do not believe there were any battery operated doors .
GW : You also stated there were many , many ' engineers ' coming in and out of the tower .
Did you see any of these folks yourself ?
SF : Yes .
By “ engineers ” I mean there were workmen on site , in overalls .
GW : Did these folks look " middle eastern " ?
SF : No , not particularly , I mean I do n't recall registering that theguys were of one racial group or another .
GW : Did you recognize any of them from previous " work " in the tower ?
SF : No .
THE MORNING OF 9/11GW : You were home on the shore of Jersey City on the morning of 9/11 , and -- according to what you have said previously -- you were " convinced immediately that something was happening related to the weekend work " .
Why did you think that ?
SF : When the South Tower collapsed , like a pillar of sand , it seemed unreal and inconceivable and I immediately thought something weird was going on .
I became more suspicious several months later when the power down condition was never acknowledged and in some instances was denied by authorities .
THE 9/11 COMMISSIONGW : Finally , you 've stated that you gave your information to the 9/11 Commission , but it took no interest .
How did you get the info to the Commission ( phone , email , letter ? )
SF : I contacted the commission through their website and by mail .
But I was never acknowledged nor contacted .
GW : Did the Commission ever follow up with you ?
SF : NoGW : Anything else you wish to tell us ?
SF : I have another piece of interesting information ... after 9/11 my company , along with others , was in disaster recovery mode at a location in New Jersey .
At that site were literally hundreds and hundreds of eye witnesses to the events of 9/11 .
As a British National I was contacted by Scotland Yard in London to interview me on the events ... but I 've often wondered why us authorities , like the New York police or FBI , did not interview all those witnesses available altogether in New Jersey .
It seems like incompetence to me at best ... negligence at worst .

Open -Closed Principle とデザインパターン Document Actions [ ホームへもどる ]
Open - Closed Principle とデザインパター ン 1999/09/03 更新 石井 勝 さて，このセクションではデザインパターンを統一的に理解するために，「
Open - Closed Principle ( OCP ) 」
という設計ルールに基づいてパターンを眺めてみることにします．まず
OCP の意味と解説を行い，その後デザインパターンを
OCP の観点から見てみます．実は，デザインパターンのうちの多くは
OCP を満たすために用意されたものと考えることができるのです．このセクションでは，
OCP を理解し，数あるデザインパターンの中からどういう場合にどのパターンを使うのが一番効果的なのかを考えます．
GoF のデザインパターンは，全部で 23 個ものパターンがあります．このデザインパターンは，多くの局面で繰り返し現れる設計を抽出したものですから，オブジェクト指向のエッセンスを集めたものだと言えるでしょう．オブジェクト指向には，カプセル化，継承，ポリモルフィズムといった数少ない道具しかありません．では，なぜ
23 個もの多くのパターンになってしまったのでしょうか？ このことは，デザインパターンの中に何かかくされた原理というべきものが存在するということを暗示しています．それが今回紹介する
OCP です． それではまず，優れたソフトウェアとは何かということから始めましょう． 優れたソフトウェア まず，ソフトウェアの仕様変更とそれにかかるコストという観点から考えます．コストの観点から見て優れたソフトウェアとは，仕様の変更とソフトウェアに対する修正が対応しているものだといえるでしょう．つまり，仕様の変更が小さければソフトウェアの修正も小さく，大きければ修正も大きくなる自然なソフトウェアです．しかし，ソフトウェアによっては，少しの修正に対して大幅な修正を引き起こしてしまう場合もあります．こうした状況を「仕様変更に対してそのコストが連続していない（不連続）」といいます．言うまでもなく，コスト的に優れたソフトウェアとは仕様変更に対して連続性を持つことを意味します．
よくある例としては，ユーザの考えている仕様変更と実際のプログラムの仕様変更のギャップです．ユーザが考えている仕様変更が単純に見えても実際そうでないことが往々にしてありますが，そうしたギャップを最小限に抑えたソフトウェアにするべきでしょう．したがって，仕様変更や拡張性への感覚を鋭くすることが優れたソフトウェアを設計するためのカギになります．つまり，ある仕様変更，機能追加という変化に対してソフトウェアはどういう影響をうけるのか，ほとんど修正がなく安定しているのか，それとも大幅な修正が必要でかなり不安定なのか……このことを絶えず意識することで，そのソフトウェアの長所と短所ははっきりし，仕様変更に強くメンテナンスしやすいものになります．これは先のセクションで述べたホットスポットを考慮することにつながります．しかし現実には，すべての仕様変更に強いソフトウェアはあり得ないでしょう．したがってもっとも可能性の高い仕様変更を予想し，その仕様変更に対して十分安定したソフトウェアを作ることが必要となります．つまり「ソフトウェアがさまざまな仕様変更でどういう修正が加わるのかを常に考える」ことが，優れたソフトウェアをつくるための第一歩なのです．
それでは，仕様変更に対してどう対応できれば一番よいのでしょうか？
バグを減らすためには，なるべく修正個所を抑える必要があります．修正個所が広範囲にわたると，それだけでバグの可能性が多くなり，修正コストも大きくなってしまいます．可能な限り，修正個所は
1 個所に絞りたいところです．共通する部分をうまく共有しているプログラムなら，これを実現するのはさほど難しくはありません．
仕様変更への別の対応方法としては，コードの追加があります．コードの修正ではなく，コードの追加だけで対応できれば，バグを産む可能性はかなり減ります．さらに，コードを修正する必要がなくなったモジュールは，再利用できるというメリットもあります．コードの修正ではなく，コードの追加で変化に対応するという方法は，従来の構造化プログラミングでは簡単には実現できなかったことですが，オブジェクト技術の道具である継承とポリモルフィズムを使えば，これが可能になります．この考え方が，次に述べる
OCP に従ったソフトウェアのもつ最大の特徴なのです．
Open - Closed Principle Bertrand Meyer 氏によれば， 「 Open - Closed Principle ( OCP ) 」とは次のことを意味します． 「 モジュールは拡張に対して開いて ( Open ) おり，修正に対して閉じて ( Closed ) いなければならない 」 Open - Closed Principle は，オブジェクト指向設計を考える際，その設計が正しいかどうかの指針を与えてくれるもっとも基本的な原理です．
あるモジュールの機能が拡張可能なとき，そのモジュールは「開いている」といいます．開いているモジュールは，機能追加や仕様変更に応じて異なった振る舞いをするようにできます．モジュールは将来どのように拡張されるかは予想できません．したがってそのモジュールは柔軟性，つまり「開いている」ことが求められます．また，あるモジュールが他のモジュールから利用されていて，そのソースコードを修正することが許されないとき，そのモジュールは「閉じている」といいます．モジュールが頻繁に修正されると，そのモジュールに依存しているほかのモジュールはその度に更新されることになります．ソフトウェアが安定するためには，修正に対して閉じていることが求められます．「開いているのに閉じている」これはどうやったら実現できるのでしょうか？ ここでは，OCP の例として，次のような単純な音楽ソフトを考えましょう．このツールには，音符をあらわす
Note クラス，四分音符をあらわす Quater クラス，二分音符をあわら す
Half クラスがあるとします． class Note { public : virtual void Play ( ) = 0 ; } ; class Quarter : public Note { public : virtual void Play ( ) ; } ; class Half : public Note { public : virtual void Play ( ) ; } ; これらの音符を集めて演奏する楽譜クラス
Staff は次のようになっているとします． class Staff { public : void AddNote ( Note* ) ; void Play ( ) ; private : typedef std::vector Notes ; Notes mNotes ; } ; void Staff : : Play ( ) {
Notes : : iterator i ; for ( i = mNotes.begin( ) ; i != mNotes.end ( ) ; ++i ) ( * i ) -> Play ( ) ; } 楽譜クラス Staff は， AddNote メソッドで音符を追加していき登録された音符を
Play メソッドを使って演奏します．さて，この Staff :: Play メソッドは単純ですが，次の 2 つの特徴を持っています． 開いている ( Open ) 八分音符や四分休符などの音符を追加するという機能追加に対して拡張性がある．
閉じている ( Closed ) 八分音符や四分休符などの音符を追加するという機能追加に対して修正する必要がまったくない． このように， Staff :: Play の振る舞いを拡張するには，コードの修正ではなくコードの追加で十分です．つまり，
Staff :: Play は OCP を満たしているわけです． 一方，同じ音楽ソフト を C 言語を使って実装してみましょう ． C 言語の構造体を使って音符オブジェクトを表し，列挙型
NoteType でどんな種類の音符なのか判断できるようにします． enum NoteType { Quarter , Half } ; typedef struct { NoteType mNoteType ; double m Pitch ; //音程 } Note ; void Quarter_Play ( Note* self ) ; void Half_Play ( Note* self ) ; 同様に，楽譜オブジェクトも構造体で表します． typedef struct { Note ** m Notes ; int mNoteCount ; } Staff ; void Staff_AddNote ( Staff * self , Note* a Note ) ; void Staff_Play ( Staff * self ) { int i ; Note * a Note ; for ( i = 0 ; i < self -> mNoteCount ; ++i ) { aNote = self -> mNotes [i ] ; switch ( aNote-> mNoteType ) { case Quarter : Quarter_Play ( aNote ) ; break ; case Half : Half_Play ( aNote ) ; break ; } } } 関数 Staff_AddNote で音符を追加し ，Staff_Play で演奏をします．関数 Staff_Play は，明らかに OCP を満たしていません．つまり，八分音符や四分休符などの音符オブジェクトを追加したいときに，コードを修正する必要があります．この例での修正は簡単ですが，ある程度規模が大きいプログラムではこのような関数がプログラムのあちこちに現われる可能性があります．修正個所が分散し，ある箇所を修正するたびに，また別の箇所も更新する必要がある状況では，バグを生む可能性はかなり高くなります．またこの例では，なぜ switch 文がオブジェクト指向プログラミングで好まれないのかということも示唆しています．これは， switch 文の分岐を変更するような要求に対して， OCP がみたされていないからなのです． オブジェクト指向と OCP ここでは， OCP をもう少し深く見るために， 図
A のような単純なモデルを考えます．このクラス図では，
ClientA と ClientB は Server を使って，それぞ れ Server にメッセージを送っています． 図 A ：単純なモデ ル
開発が進むにつれ， ClientB クラスはそれまで の Server クラスでは要求が満たされないことがわかりました．つまり，
Server ' クラスとい う
Server と大部分が同じで振る舞いが異なるクラスが必要になってしまいました．これに対応するため，例えば図
B のような設計をします．この設計では，バージョンが異なる 2 つの Server クラスがあります．これはコピー＆ペーストプログラミングの典型例です．このプログラミングスタイルがよくないのは明らかでしょう．つまり，微妙に異なる
Server への仕様変更に対して，上のモデルは OCP を破っていることになるのです． 図 B ：単純なモデル -- 変更後
次に， Client と Server の間にクラスをはさんで考えてみましょう（図 C ）．AbstractServer クラスは抽象クラスで， Server クラスのスーパークラスになっています．再び Server ' クラスが必要になった場合を考えましょう．今度は図
D のようなモデルになります．このとき， ClientA クラスと AbstractServer はまったく修正されていません．また， Server ' への機能追加（あるいは変更）をコードの修正ではなくコードの追加によって実現しています．したがってこのモデルは
OCP を守っているといえるでしょう．以上から，オブジェクト指向で
OCP に対応するためには， 変更の可能性のあるところ（ホットスポット）を見つける． その部分を抽象化してクラスにしてしまう． 抽象クラスのサブクラスで変化に対応する． とすればよいことが分かります．これが OCP を満たすオブジェクト指向ソフトウェアの戦略だといえます． 図 C ：継承モデ ル
図 D ：継承モデル -- 変更後
デザインパターンと OCP OCP に沿った設計では，まず予想される仕様変更に注目する必要があります．そこで変更の観点からデザインパターンを見てみると，多くのデザインパターンが変更に対して柔軟に対応するために用意されていることに気づきます．表
A のように，各デザインパターンは何に対して柔軟性を持たせるかが明確になっています．さらに多くのパターンの名前は，柔軟性を持たせるために導入されたクラスの名前に対応しています． 表
A ：変更からみたデザインパターンの例 変更箇所 パターン アルゴリズ ム Strategy , Visitor オブジェクトの状 態 State オブジェクトの振る舞い Decorator インターフェイ ス Adapter 実装方法 Bridge オブジェクト間の通信方法 Mediator コンテナクラスのアクセス方法 Iterator オブジェクト指向の利点は現実世界の「もの」に対応したオブジェクトを作ることが可能で，したがってモデル化しやすい，とよく言われます．しかし，もう 1 つの利点である「抽象化」にはあまりフォーカスが当たりません．上記のような変更部分そのものには，現実世界に対応する「もの」が存在しませんが，抽象化された概念をそのままコードに埋め込んでプログラムできるという特徴は非常に重要です．
ただし，抽象的な概念というのは理解しにくいのが普通です．例えば，数学ではそういった概念に明確な名前を与えて，考えやすくするようにしています．これと同じく（先にのべたように），デザインパターンにも「概念に名前を付ける」という意義があり，抽象化設計をより具体的に進めるための道具となります．デザインパターンには，何も新しいことはありません．デザインパターンの中で良いパターンの条件とは，
古いパターン 何度も使われているパターン シンプルなパターン なのです．デザインパターンは新しい技術ではなく「新しいものごとのとらえ方」なのです．抽象的な概念をデザインパターンで捉えることにより，普通ならなかなか思い付かないクラス設計をすることができるようになるのです．
このように，どんな修正に対して柔軟性をもたせるのかに注目することで，デザインパターンはかなり分かりやすくなります．デザインパターンは抽象的すぎてよく分からないといった方は，こういった
OCP の視点からデザインパターンを眺めてみることをお勧めします． デザインパターンの例 ：
Iterator ここでは ，OCP がデザインパターンにどう関わっているかを見るため，
Iterator パターンを取り上げます．リンクリスト，動的配列などのデータ構造を集めたコンテナクラスライブラリには，必ずといっていいほどイテレータというクラスが存在します．このイテレータはどうして必要になったのでしょうか？
OCP の立場から考えてみましょう． まず，出発点としてリンクリストが与えられ，これをシーケンシャルにアクセスしたいと考えたとします．一番最初の設計では，カプセル化を考えて次のようなクラスになるでしょう． class Item ; class LinkList { public : void AddItem ( Item * ) ; void RemoveItem ( Item * ) ; // シーケンシャルアクセスのためのメソッド Item * FirstItem ( ) ; Item* NextItem ( ) ; bool More ( ) const ; } ; この LinkList クラスを利用した関数は，例えば次のようになります． void TraverseList ( LinkList& aLinkList ) { for ( Item * i = a LinkList. FirstItem ( ) ; i = a LinkList.NextItem ( ) ; aLinkList. More ( ) ) { cout << i-> Name( ) << endl ; } } その後，このリンクリスト内のオブジェクトをランダムアクセスする必要がでてきました．このランダムアクセスを実現するため，配列にしたいという仕様変更が発生したのです．このとき関数
TraverseList は OCP を満たしていません．つまり，コンテナクラスの種類を変更するということに関して拡張性がなかったのです．そこで次のように修正しました． class Item ; class Container { public : void AddItem ( Item * ) ; void RemoveItem ( Item * ) ; Item * FirstItem ( ) ; Item * NextItem ( ) ; bool More ( ) const ; } ; class LinkList : public Container {...} ; class Vector : public Container {...} ; void TraverseContainer ( Container& aContainer ) { for ( Item * i = a Container .
FirstItem ( ) ; i = a Container .
NextItem ; aContainer . More ( ) ) { cout << i-> Name( ) << endl ; } } このように， Container クラスという変更部分を抽出したクラスを作ることで，あとはどんな種類のコンテナクラスがきても拡張はコードの追加で実現できるようになりました．動的配列は，
Container クラスのサブクラスとして追加すれば，関数 TraverseContainer はまったく修正する必要がありません．コンテナクラスの変更という仕様変更に対して
OCP を満たしています． さて，また仕様変更が生じました．今度は TraverseContainer を使うときに，逆方向にスキャンしたり，順方向にスキャンしたりしてコンテナクラスのアクセス方法をいろいろ変えたいと考えました．これを次の様に修正してしまってよいのでしょうか？ class Container { public : ... void SetForward ( ) ; //順方向にスキャンする void SetBackward ( ) ; //逆方向にスキャンする ... } ; これは，明らかにアクセス方法という仕様変更について
OCP を満たしていません．今度は，こういうアクセス方法を抽象化してイテレータというクラスに分離すればよいわけです． class Iterator { public : Iterator ( Container& ) ; Item * FirstItem ( ) ; Item * NextItem ( ) ; bool More ( ) const ; } ; class FowardIterator : public Iterator {...} class BackwardIterator : public Iterator {...} このようにアクセス方法を別クラスにすることで，いろいろなアクセス方法に対応できるようになりました．実際には，各イテレータを
LinkList や Vector に対応するためもう少し複雑になりますが，大体の趣旨は分かっていただけたかと思います．このように，
OCP を満たすべく設計を進化させた結果をデザインパターンと見ることができるわけです． デザインパターンの選択 ：
Observer と Mediator オブジェクト指向モデルは，複数のオブジェクトが互いにメッセージを送って協調しあうものですが，これを素直にうけとめてモデル化すると，あちこちで処理が分散し，結果的に分かりにくくメンテナンスしにくいモデルになってしまいます．つまり各オブジェクトが他のオブジェクトと密接に関連しあう複雑なモデルになってしまうわけです．これではそもそも何のためにクラスやオブジェクトに分けたのか，わからなくなってしまいます．こうしたモデルを簡略化したものを 図
E に示します． 図 E ：オブジェクト間の通 信
デザインパターンには，そうしたオブジェクト間のやりとりをうまく扱うものがあります．代表的なものは
Mediator と Observer でしょう．ここでは，どういうときにどんなパターンを使えばいいのかを，
Observer と Mediator パターンを比較して考えてみます． Mediator パターンは，オブジェクト間のやりとりそのものをカプセル化してクラスにしてしまったものです．このことによってオブジェクト間のやりとりに秩序ができ，メンテナンスしやすいものになります（図
F ）． Mediator パターンが採用されたシステムでは，各オブジェクトが個別に通信せずに，
Mediator を経由してメッセージ通信を行います．こうすることで，システム全体の見通しが良くなります．それではこのパターンは，
OCP を満たしているのでしょうか？ 図
F のモデルにおいて変更の可能性があるのは協調しているオブジェクト間のやりとりと，協調オブジェクトの追加・削除です．
Mediator パターンは，こういった変更に対して OCP を満たしていません．特に協調オブジェクトの追加と削除には，
Mediator クラスの内部を修正することでしか変化に対応できないのです．では，このパターンは価値のないパターンなのでしょうか？ 一概にそうは言い切れません．少なくともこうした修正箇所を
1 箇所に閉じ込めるという利点があります．あえていうなら， 弱い OCP を満たしているといえるでしょう．その意味で Mediator パターンはあまりオブジェクト指向的であるとはいえないですが，妥協点としては良いパターンになります． 図 F ： Mediator パターン
次に Observer パターンを見てみましょう（ 図 G ）．このパターンは，オブジェクト間に 1 対多の依存関係がある場合に使われます．オブジェクト
Obaservable に依存しているオブジェク ト Observer を自動的に更新するような処理がある場合によく使われるパターンです．再びこのパターンが
OCP を満たしているかどうか見てみましょう．ここでは，
Observable に対して Observer を新しく追加する仕様変更を考えます．このとき，
Observable と他の Observer はまったく影響をうけません．つまり ，
Observer を追加するという仕様変更に対しては OCP を満たしているといえるわけです． 図 H ： Observer パター ン
さて， Observer と Mediator パターンの特徴がわかったところで，フォントダイアログを作る例を考えましょう．このダイアログにはコンポーネントが並んでいて，フォントの種類を指定するフォントリストボックス，フォントの大きさを指定するフォントサイズリストボックス，ユーザにフォントがどんなものになるのか表示するフォントのサンプル表示ビューなどがあります．フォントリストボックスの中にあるフォントを選択したら，フォントサイズリストをそのフォントに対応するフォントサイズが並ぶよう変更し，フォントのサンプル表示をそのフォントが表示されるように更新して……という具合に処理を行うとします（画面
A ）．このとき，設計の第一案としては，フォントリストボックスを
Observable ，フォントサイズリストボックスとフォントサンプル表示ビューをその
Observer にするということが考えられます．つまり，フォントが変わったときフォントサイズの種類とフォントのサンプル表示が変わらないといけないので，
Observer のパターンを応用するわけです．この場合，まず各コンポーネントに
Observer としての機能を持たせる必要があります．また，サンプル表示ビューはフォントサイズにも依存しているので，この 2 つのコンポーネント間にも Observer パターンを使うことになってしまいます．少し考えただけでもこれではずいぶん複雑です． 画面 A ：フォントダイアロ グ
この場合は， Mediator パターンにしてしまった方がシンプルでメンテナンスもしやすくなります．その理由は簡単です．この例では，
Observable としてのフォントリストボックスよりも 1 対多の依存関係のほうが変化しやすいからです．コンポーネント間の依存関係が将来変更されやすいのに，現在の仕様で各コンポーネントが
Observer - Observable の関係があるからといって安易に Observer を使ってはいけません．この場合はコンポーネント間の依存関係が変化しやすいので，それに対応した
Mediator パターンを使うのがよいでしょう ．Observer だから良い，というような発想ではなく，それぞれのケースで将来の変更に対応できるよう柔軟に設計するのが第一なのです． このようにデザインパターンを効果的に使うためには次のように考えるのが間違った使い方をしないための指針となるでしょう． 変更の可能性があるのはどこか？ 柔軟性を持たせなければならないところはどこか？ 例えば，柔軟性を持たせなければならないのがアルゴリズムなら
Strategy のパターン，オブジェクトの状態なら ば
State のパターンなどを検討してみます． そのパターンを使うことで柔軟性を失うのはどこか？ 例えば， AbstractFactory パターンを使うと，生成するオブジェクトの集合を変えることが可能ですが，その集合に新しい種類のオブジェクトを追加するにはかなりの修正が必要です．つまりこのパターンは，オブジェクトの種類を変更することについて
OCP を満たしていないことが分かります． このように， 「 OCP が最も効果的に成り立つようにデザインパターンを使う 」 ことが重要です．個々のデザインパターンには長所と短所の両方あり，そのトレードオフを見極めて使わなければなりません．自分が好きなパターンだからといって何度も同じパターンを使うのは単なるワンパターンに過ぎません．また，
1 つのシステムにより多くのデザインパターンを適用することが良いことでもありません．こういった意味で，デザインパターンは従来のアルゴリズムとデータ構造に似ているでしょう．アルゴリズムとデータ構造にはそれぞれ長所と短所があります．例えば，あるアルゴリズムは高速に処理できるがその分メモリをたくさん消費する．また，別のデータ構造を使うと検索は速いが更新は遅いということがあります．これと同様に，すべての局面で優れた設計を提供するようなパターンはありません．どういう状況で，何を目的にして使うのか判断することが重要で，逆にそうしたことを念頭においてデザインパターンを習得する必要があるでしょう． [ ホームへもどる ] [ 先頭へもど る ]

What is Hizbullah ?
Western and Israeli pundits keep comparing Hizbullah to al - Qaeda .
It is a huge conceptual error .
There is a crucial difference between an international terrorist network like al - Qaeda , which can be disrupted by good old policing techniques ( such as inserting an agent in the Western Union office in Karachi ) , and a sub-nationalist movement .
Al - Qaeda is some 5,000 multinational volunteers organized in tiny cells .
Hizbullah is a mass expression of subnationalism that has the loyalty of some 1.3 million highly connected and politically mobilized peasants and slum dwellers .
Over a relatively compact area .
I take sub-nationalism as a concept from Anthony D. Smith .
It would be most familiar to Western readers under the rubric of the Irish Catholics of North Ireland , or even the Scots of the UK .
Subnationalism , like the larger , over - arching nationalism , is a mass movement .
Thus , a very large number of the Pushtuns in Afghanistan are sub-nationalists with a commitment to Pushtun dominance .
They deeply resent the victory of the Northern Alliance ( i.e. Tajiks , Hazara Shiites , and Uzbeks ) in 2001 - 2002 .
A lot of what our press calls resurgent “ Taliban ” activity is just Pushtun irredentism .
There are approximately 14 million Pushtuns in Afghanistan and another 14 million or so in Pakistan .
The Shiites of southern Lebanon are compact enough to likewise offer a subnationalism .
Note that this is a new phenomenon .
The Shiite masses were not socially and politically mobilized until at least the 1970s , and probably it is more accurate to say the 1980s .
( “ Social mobilization ” refers to literacy , access to media , urbanization , industrialization and so forth ; isolated small villages have difficulty organizing big movements . )
The main factor in causing these peasant sharecroppers to become politically aware and mobilized was the Arab Israeli conflict .
The Israelis stole some of their land in 1948 and expelled 100,000 Palestinians north into south Lebanon , where they competed for resources with local Lebanese Shiites .
In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Palestinians became politically and militarily organized by the PLO .
The Shiites ’ conflict with the PLO in the southern camps in the 1970s was probably a key beginning , but from 1982 it was primarily their conflict with the Israeli Occupation army that spurred them on .
Processes of integration into the world market and increased mechanization of south Lebanon agriculture , as well as urbanization ( Tyre , south Beirut ) provided a * social * mobilization substrate that enabled but did not cause their * political mobilization * ( see A. Richard Norton ’s book on early AMAL ) .
The rise of a Shiite wealthy class , especially as a result of commerce with the Oil Gulf , added to the community ’s organizational capacity and resources .
Still , the Shiites of south Lebanon are generally poor and a lot of them are still rural .
The Sunni Arabs of central , west and north Iraq are now also creating a subnationalism and organizing extensive paramilitary cells with highly significant asymmetrical warfare capabilities .
The entire might of the formidable US military machine has made no headway against these 5 million persons .
Where subnationalisms are organized by party - militias willing to use carbombings and other asymmetrical forms of warfare , they are extremely difficult , if not impossible to defeat militarily .
It would take a World War II style crushing military defeat of these populations , with the willingness of the conqueror to suffer tens of thousands dead in troop casualties .
Israel is not even in a position to risk such a thing , given its small population .
Hizbullah is not like al - Qaeda in any way , sociologically speaking , and making such an analogy is a sure way for a general or politician to trick himself into entering the fires of hell .
What the Israelis set out to do , if they intended to “ destroy ” or even substantially attrite Hizbullah , was completely impractical .
What they have done is to convince even Lebanese formerly on the fence about the issue that Hizbullah ’s leaders were correct in predicting that Lebanon would again be attacked in the most brutal and horrible way by the Israelis and that an even more powerful deterrent is needed .
I.e more silkworms , not fewer . .
The days when the Israelis could lord it over disconnected unmobilized Arab peasant villagers with their high tech army are coming to a close .
The Arabs are still very weak , but are throwing up powerful asymmetrical challenges ( e.g. party - militias with silkworm missiles ! ) .
Israeli alarm about the new connectedness of their foe explains the orgy of destruction aimed at bridges , roads , television and radio facilities and internet servers .
But it is too late to disconnect the south Lebanese , who can easily and quickly rebuild all those connectors .
One hope the Israeli hawks appear to entertain is that they can permanently depopulate strips Lebanon south of the Litani river .
Since most Shiites vote Hizbullah and offer political support and cover to it , fewer people means fewer assets for the party - militia .
This project would require the total destruction of large numbers of villages and the permanent displacement of their inhabitants north to Beirut .
That is why the massacre at Qana occurred .
The Israelis had bombed Qana 80 times .
They were destroying all of its buildings .
Therefore , of course , they destroyed the building where dozens of children and families were hiding .
This tactic is both collective punishment and ethnic cleansing all at once .
It is not only a matter , as the Israelis claim , of hitting Hizbullah rocket launchers .
They are destroying all of the buildings .
The Israeli demographic project of thinning out the population of the far south of Lebanon will fail .
They do not control that territory , and cannot stop people from coming back and rebuilding .
The Israelis have an Orientalist myth that the Arabs are Bedouin and not attached to their ancestral villages .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon still group their neighborhoods around their camps in accordance with the geography of their former villages .
The Lebanese Shiites will mostly come back .
The Israelis cannot win this struggle against a sophisticated , highly organized and well armed subnationalism .
The only practical thing to do when you ca n’t easily beat people into submission is to find a compromise with them that both sides can live with .
It will be a hard lesson for both the Lebanese Shiites and the Israelis .
But they will learn it or will go on living with a lot of death and destruction .
“ I have to be careful that I , myself , do n’t have a bad day , ” Landis said after today ’s stage .
“ Things can change quickly . ”
Image Floyd Landis won the Tour de France title after a remarkable comeback .
Credit ... Stefano Rellandini / Reuters
Landis ’s lead might have been slightly larger if he had finished third today , a position that would have given him a time bonus of 8 seconds .
But he was outsprinted at the finish by Stefano Garzelli , an Italian rider for the Liquigas squad .
It appeared that Landis started his final sprint nearly 500 meters from the finish line , a distance over which it is difficult to sustain maximum speed — particularly after a climb like l’Alpe d’Huez .
Now Landis is in a position he said on Monday that he did not want — in the lead .
His Phonak team will now be charged with riding at the front of the pack over the next two days , trying to make sure that no riders who are a threat to Landis in the overall standing are able to escape in a breakaway .
Landis said he was confident enough in his team that he could ride conservatively over the next two days , leaving it to his rivals to try to attack and leave him behind .
“ I do n’t feel the need win either of those stages , ” he said of the next two days .
“ I ’d like to win a stage , but I want to save my team , ” as well as some of his own energy for the final time trial on Saturday , a day before the Tour ends .
Landis ’s teammate , Axel Merckx , helped him early today by jumping into a breakaway group that gained 2 to 3 minutes over the main pack as they crossed each of the stage ’s first two climbs , the Col d’Izoard and the Col du Lautaret .
That allowed Landis to get reports on the group ’s status over the team ’s radio , thus keeping an eye on the escapees .
NOTE :
CODE PINK is reporting that the idea of Thursday arrests started with speculation , not a threat from authorities .
I am unable to confirm or deny that .
Meanwhile , I have a voice message from Cindy saying that they left their spot on the side of the road because of a storm and now the Sherrif 's men are trying to post no trespassing signs and force them to leave .
I am unable to confirm or deny this or provide any more details .
UPDATE :
I got Cindy on the phone and she continued to maintain that the threat of arrest was real , but said that it came to her via Diane Wilson .
I spoke to Diane , who said that it came from Texas State Rep Lon Burman , a Democrat .
She said that he was not speaking on behalf of or communicating any information from the Bush Administration or the Secret Service or the Sheriff 's Department .
But she maintained that what he had predicted was already starting .
Both Sheehan and Wilson said that the County Sherrif 's deputies on Saturday identified several areas as county property on which they could stand .
Now they claim that most of these area are private property , and that they had not known that .
So , this afternoon the deputies forced Cindy and about 25 people with her onto one small area on one side of a road .
Wilson said that they threatened arrest if anyone refused to move to the proper small area .
Cindy was skeptical of the claims about who owned the land .
" Can you believe that on the road to the President 's house they do n't know exactly who owns it ? "
Both she and Wilson said they expected they would get arrested Thursday .
Cindy said , " I think we need as many people here on Thursday anyway , because Rice and Rumsfeld will be here ....
I 'd rather not get arrested , but I 'm willing to , I 'm willing to have them pick me up and carry me away . "

In the previous post on Installing Empowering Beliefs , you learned the importance of consciously selecting and deliberately installing your beliefs about reality instead of merely swallowing what you were taught growing up .
Now I ’ll go into more detail on how to determine whether or not a belief will be effective for you .
So here are 8 guidelines for choosing effective beliefs .
Effective beliefs are …
Accurate .
Effective beliefs must be consistent with your observations of reality .
Your beliefs cannot contradict any facts you know to be true .
All - inclusive .
For your beliefs to be effective , they must collectively address your entire field of experience .
If you experience things you cannot explain from within your belief system , then your belief system is incomplete .
And an incomplete belief system can never be fully trusted .
Flexible .
Effective beliefs adapt well to new circumstances .
They serve you well regardless of your career , income level , relationship situation , lifestyle , etc. Ethical .
It is never effective to choose beliefs that lead you to harm yourself or others .
Such beliefs are rooted in fear , and fear comes from ignorance .
If your beliefs are true , then you can accept reality rather than fear it , which means there is no cause for violence or dishonesty .
Congruent .
Either your beliefs must be internally consistent with each other , or you must have a higher order meta - belief that tells you how to resolve lower level incongruencies .
Consciously chosen .
You inherit your initial set of beliefs from your upbringing and societal conditioning .
But as a fully awake adult , those beliefs should be identified , examined , and then deliberately altered or integrated .
This is an ongoing process that can take years , if not your entire lifetime .
Pleasure - increasing and / or pain - reducing .
Effective beliefs make you feel good , either by elevating your emotional state directly or as a side - effect of generating results you desire .
Effective beliefs also reduce fear ; when your beliefs are accurate , certainty replaces fear .
Empowering .
Your beliefs should allow you to experience whatever is technically possible ; they should never mislabel the possible as impossible .
Subject of course to ethical / moral considerations , your beliefs should not unduly limit your abilities .
If you belief something is impossible for you , then it must truly be impossible regardless of your thinking .
If a belief shift would change your abilities ( like the placebo effect ) , then your belief is both disempowering and inaccurate .
Let ’s consider a couple examples to illustrate these criteria .
Belief Example 1 : Most people just want to be left alone .
Imagine a young man who believes most people just want to be left alone .
Let ’s call him Paul ( not a real person ) .
Paul ’s belief dictates the terms by which he interacts socially .
He has a few friends , and he ’s fine socializing with people he already knows , but he has a hard time making new friends .
He ’s unlikely to take the initiative because it ’s too big a risk with a high probability of rejection .
Paul does n’t want to annoy people who want to be left alone , so he mostly keeps to himself .
His social circle remains small and stagnant , and most of his social connections come from his work .
Paul has virtually no relationship prospects because he considers women to be unapproachable except under extremely rare circumstances .
If he sees a woman he ’d like to date , he remains silent and aloof .
Paul feels that to ask her out would be a social faux pas because after all , she just wants to be left alone .
How does Paul ’s belief perform against our criteria ?
Let ’s take a look .
1 . Is it accurate ?
I think most people would agree this belief is inaccurate and too pessimistic .
The best way for Paul to find out would be to test alternative beliefs and note the results .
The problem with this belief is that Paul would rarely ever test it , so he ’ll gather little or no evidence either way .
Perhaps he formed this belief by overgeneralizing after a bad experience .
On those rare occasions when he does push himself socially , his belief will negatively affect his communication style , thus encouraging the rejection he expects .
2 . Is it all - inclusive ?
This criterion does n’t apply because we ’re taking a single belief out of context here .
But this single belief will influence Paul ’s entire field of social interaction .
3 . Is it flexible ?
No .
Paul ’s belief is unnecessarily rigid .
A more accurate belief might be that some people are more friendly and approachable than others .
And even the same person will be more or less approachable depending on the exact conditions .
Paul ’s belief is a worst - case scenario , and it will limit him socially even when conditions are excellent .
It will also serve him poorly in people - oriented careers , such as sales or communication .
4 . Is it ethical ?
You could make a case that this belief is somewhat immoral .
If Paul sees a stranger in need , he ’d likely avoid that person instead of offering help .
Paul would n’t become a criminal , but he ’d behave apathetically towards others .
He might be internally motivated to act , but his belief will cause him to hold back .
5 . Is it congruent ?
That would depend on Paul ’s other beliefs .
There are many popular beliefs that would be incongruent with this one though .
For example , if Paul was a practicing Christian who strongly believed in loving service to others , Paul would be internally conflicted .
His religion would urge him to help people , but his social resistance would cause him to hold back .
At best he might donate money from the sidelines , but he would n’t feel free to give openly from his heart and express his generosity .
If Paul were an atheist , however , there would be no inherent conflict with atheism itself , but there could certainly be conflicts with other parts of Paul ’s social and moral code of conduct .
6 . Is it consciously chosen ?
Not likely .
This was probably a socially conditioned belief or one that developed as an unconscious reaction to social rejection .
It ’s doubtful Paul would have chosen to adopt this belief consciously .
If he ’s consciously aware of this belief at all , he probably wants to replace it , but he may be stuck if he also believes that he can’t change his beliefs .
7 . Is it pleasure - increasing and / or pain - reducing ?
On balance , no .
This belief may reduce the amount of rejection Paul experiences by causing him to avoiding risky social situations .
However , by avoiding a 10 - second rejection , Paul kills off the possibility of a long - term relationship as well as abundant new friendships .
This belief also keeps
Paul focused on his fears , which will likely cause him to experience far more pain in the long run , including the pain of regret .
This belief will almost certainly drive Paul ’s emotional state in a negative direction , possibly for his entire life .
8 . Is it empowering ?
Definitely not .
This belief causes Paul to unnecessarily limit himself .
Paul will miss opportunity after opportunity .
But if he could get himself to take action , some of those opportunities would pay off .
He wo n’t ask for the date , for the promotion , for the raise , for help , etc .
Technically all of these things lie easily within Paul ’s power , but this belief will prevent him from tapping that power .
Consequently , Paul will lead a far more stagnant life than necessary .
His belief effectively makes the possible impossible .
Clearly Paul ’s belief that most people just want to be left alone does n’t perform too well according to our criteria .
Let ’s consider a second example .
Belief Example 2 : People are usually friendly and approachable .
Consider another young man named Chris who believes that people are usually friendly and approachable .
Like Paul ’s belief , Chris ’ dictates the terms of his social interaction .
Whenever and wherever he sees people , Chris is open to interacting with them because he expects they ’ll be open to it .
While standing in line , he ’ll strike up a conversation with the person behind him .
Chris has an abundance of friends and contacts because he ’s constantly meeting new people .
He enjoys a rich social life and goes on dates often because he ’s always asking .
Sure he gets a cold response on occasion , but he knows that everyone has an off day now and then .
Because Chris openly interacts with people on friendly terms , people usually respond to him in kind .
Consequently , Chris ’ enjoys an ever - expanding social circle .
How does Chris ’ belief measure up ?
1 . Is it accurate ?
Partially .
Like Paul ’s belief , Chris ’ is also something of a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Even when the people around him are socially neutral , Chris ’ openness often draws them out .
So while Chris ’ belief may not be totally accurate from a purely objective sense , it is accurate from a subjective one .
2 . Is it all - inclusive ?
This criterion does n’t apply because we ’re taking a single belief out of context here .
But this single belief will influence Chris ’ entire field of social interaction .
3 . Is it flexible ?
Yes .
This belief can adapt well to a variety of social circumstances .
The word “ usually ” gives Chris an out whenever he encounters people who react coldly to him .
To him it ’s just a fluke but not the norm .
This belief should serve Chris well across a variety of careers .
He could succeed in sales , engineering , or other disciplines .
This belief does n’t make Chris an automatic extrovert — it simply opens social doors for him .
4 . Is it ethical ?
Yes .
This belief is at least ethically neutral .
It enables Chris to freely interact with others in need , but it does n’t compel him to do so , nor does it push him to pester anyone who ’d rather be left alone .
This belief wo n’t get in the way of Chris ’ moral code , and it would likely help him wherever service to others is concerned .
5 . Is it congruent ?
That would depend on Chris ’ other beliefs .
But overall it meshes well with popular belief systems .
It does n’t create conflicts with Christianity , Buddhism , atheism , or other major philosophies .
6 . Is it consciously chosen ?
Maybe .
Typical Western conditioning encourages isolation and social cocooning , but Chris could have been raised within a family and cultural structure that installed this belief .
It ’s also possible that Chris started with a belief like Paul ’s , realized it was limiting him unnecessarily , and consciously reconditioned himself to adopt this new belief .
7 . Is it pleasure - increasing and / or pain - reducing ?
Yes .
While Chris may encounter some rejection as a result of his openness , overall this belief should help him attract abundant positive social interaction .
This belief will help steer Chris away from fear and isolation and towards rewarding relationships .
It ’s been said that 80 % of our happiness in life comes from our relationships , and Chris will be able to tap into that .
8 . Is it empowering ?
Yes .
First , this belief will allow Chris to benefit from open social interaction with others .
Secondly , by taking action Chris will gain experience , which will help him make new distinctions and continuously refine his social skills , thus increasing his success rate and reducing the amount of rejection he experiences .
For example , if Chris works in sales , he ’ll become better at pre-screening prospects so that he does n’t waste as much time presenting to people who are n’t ready to buy .
And in terms of relationships , Chris will become more adept at interpreting subtle signals , allowing him to solve problems before they devolve into resentment .
Overall Chris ’ belief appears very effective according to our criteria .
Such a belief should serve him well for a lifetime .
In reality Paul and Chris would each have their own unique web of thousands of individual beliefs with countless interdependencies .
Considering a single belief in isolation has its limitations , but it ’s a good place to start .
Simply becoming conscious of a limiting belief you ’d like to change is the first step towards replacing it with a more empowering one .
Your homework
Take a moment to write down some of the beliefs you have about reality .
What do you believe to be true about your health , career , relationships , finances , spirituality , etc ?
Then go over the eight criteria above to see how they measure up .
If you do n’t like what you see , craft more effective beliefs to replace the old ones .
Remember that your beliefs are not mere observations of reality — they shape and create your reality as well .
Many of the thoughts you hold most sacred may reveal their hidden falsehoods once you take the opportunity to test one or two alternatives .

The glacial retreat at Pastoruri shows no sign of stopping
Mounds of dark rock rise up between the snow and ice , discoloured after years of being covered by the glacier .
This is Pastoruri .
In the past 10 years , its ice caps have retreated by about 200m .
Soon it , like many other glaciers in Peru , will have disappeared almost completely .
At about 5,000 m , or just over 16,000 ft , it is one of the glaciers worst affected by climate change in Peru .
And Peru , in turn , is one of the countries worst affected by climate change in the world .
Sitting between the tropics , where the sun is particularly fierce , and home to more tropical glaciers than anywhere else , this South American country is especially vulnerable to rising temperatures .
Experts predict all the Peruvian glaciers below 5,500 m will disappear by 2015 .
This is the majority of Peru 's glaciers .
Marco Zapata works at the Institute for National Resources in the Andean town of Huaraz , in northern Peru .
He has studied glaciers for more than 30 years and says in that time Peru has lost more than 20 % of its glaciers .
One of the main reasons why Peru is so vulnerable to climate change has to do with water .
Water needs
The majority of its population lives in a narrow strip of land between the Andes mountains and the sea .
Local farmers depend on the glacial water to irrigate their crops
Pressure on water resources is only likely to grow as more and more people move to coastal cities like the capital Lima and industry expands .
But the source of that water is also under pressure .
Standing at the Puerto Chuelo mountain pass above the glacier lakes at Llanganuco , Mr Zapata said :
" At the moment , we are experiencing a very strong process of glacial retreat .
There is an apparent abundance of water in these mountains .
" In the rainy season there are no problems , but in the dry season the glaciers are the only ecosystem that is supporting the river .
" And this problem of the process of glacial retreat is so fast , that in a very short time , it 's possible the glaciers will disappear and there will be a problem of a lack of water for future generations . "
Snow caps
Emilio Himenez has farmed land in the shadow of the Llanganuco lakes for almost four decades .
He irrigates his land with water from the glaciers that supply the lakes and grows a variety of fruit and vegetables which he sells at market .
Emilio Himenez and his family have farmed the land for almost 40 years
As he works in the fields with his wife and daughters , one of his grandchildren , four - year - old Frank Michael looks on .
" Perhaps in 20 more years , there wo n't be water if the snow caps go , " Mr Himenez adds .
" It will be very sad because when there is water there is life and when there is no water , there is no life , not for the animals , or the humans , or for the agriculture .
And , I do n't know what situation our grandchildren will be in . "
She burst on the scene as the new Kate Moss in 2004 , but has Sienna Miller ’s star does n’t seem to be shining as bright these last few months .
Could it be that everyone is sick of boho chic ?
Or could it be the fact that the on - again , off - again nature of her relationship with Jude Law is boring everyone ?
( Because frankly , who cares anymore ?
The latest is that Jude dumped her because of his children , and James Franco is not dating Sienna )
Or that her wardrobe these days is not so special anymore ?
While Kate Moss ’s star has shone even brighter , Sienna ’s has dimmed .
So can she really be called a fashion icon ?
Her outfits over the last few months will have a few people puzzled .
There is black swimsuit paired with a ra-ra skirt outfit , the matching green outfit with a pink cowboy hat – that matched her mother ’s outfit down to the T , and the other random outfits she throws together that have people wondering if she got dressed in the dark .
And did I mention her new bleached blonde hair ?
Even Go Fug Yourself is not amused , calling the shiny gold outfit she wore to the MET awards absurd .
What do you think ?
I ’ve been watching the del.icio.us Popular Page quite closely lately .
I ’m fascinated by the list for many reasons – for one it ’s a great source of content ideas and links , secondly it helps keep a finger on the pulse of what people are into at any given time and thirdly it ’s a highly trafficked page that has the potential to send out large quantities of traffic very quickly and is increasingly being targeted ( along with other social bookmarking pages ) by bloggers who are doing quite well from the traffic it sends them ( in fact I know of three bloggers who credit del.icio.us and digg.com as kick starting ( and feeding in an ongoing way ) their blogging careers .
I know last time I hit the top of the list I had an extra 8000 visitors that day directly from it and the links from others who saw it there .
While I have n’t done an in depth study into del.icio.us – it is interesting to note the type of links that consistently get to the top of the del.icio.us popular page .
Here are seven of the characteristics that are often present in these popular links ( often more than one of the following apply in each instance ) which could improve the chances of getting into the mix as a popular link :
Make a List – Just by scanning the current popular links titles it is evident that lists dominate the… list ( they make up over 40 % of the current links ) .
One of the first times I made it to the top of del.icio.us was with a list ( fittingly it was a list of why lists are good for getting traffic ) .
Of course some people are ‘ anti- list ’ – they argue that breaking things down into lists ‘ dummifies ’ the content .
While I ’ve seen plenty of lists where this is the case – I would also argue that lists that are well crafted can be just as meaty as other forms of writing .
Number your List –
It ’s not just any old list that gets popular but quite often lists that have a number in the title .
I ’m not quite sure what it is about numbers that capture the attention of del.icio.us users – but they do .
I ca n’t remember the last time when there was n’t a title in the popular list like ’ 10 rules for …’ , ‘ 5 ways to …’ , ‘ 6 trends that …’ , ’ 50 tips on ….’.
There is obviously something about quantifying a list that readers respond to .
How many points is ideal ?
The jury is still out on this one .
As I look at the current popular page I see a list of 50 , numerous lists of 10 and a list of 3 .
Write a ‘ How to …’ – Another type of link that is often popular is the ‘ how to ’ post .
Walk your readers through a process that teaches them how to achieve a goal they might have and they ’re more likely to want to bookmark it .
Again as I scan the current list I see a number of titles that indicate that the links will teach or guide readers through a particular issue .
Often the titles use the actual words ‘ how to …’ in them .
Others use ‘ Guide to ’ , ‘ Tips to …’ or ‘ Tutorials ’ etc .
On the flip side of the ‘ how to ’ I also regularly see ‘ how not to ’ type articles or articles that talk about ‘ common mistakes ’ that people make .
Make Big Promises and Claims –
It ’s interesting that the del.icio.us popular page relies totally upon the title of the link to get people to click on it ( ie there are no descriptions to draw readers to visit – just the title ) .
As a result the way titles are constructed has a lot to do with converting the link into visitors .
One strategy that some successful del.icio.us links use is to make a big promise or grand statement .
A recent post on ProBlogger that did this that got into the popular list was Three simple actions that doubled my website traffic in 30 days .
While it ’s not a promise – it ’s a title that certainly got some attention ( well worded Adrian ) .
Of course a good title is n’t enough , unless you have something worth reading you ’ll not get the necessary bookmarks to create the social bookmarking wave to surf to the top .
Get Technological –
The vast majority of links in the popular list as I write this post have some sort of technological bent .
It features links about SOAP , Powerpoint , video games , AJAX , CSS , Blogging , Top Websites , Linux , Microsoft , Cell Phones etc.
Obviously del.icio.us users are tech savy folk – so to get their attention you ’ll want to tickle their tech bone .
Inspire – I notice here at ProBlogger that sometimes my most helpful ‘ how to ’/ techie posts are not the only ones to get attention from readers – in fact probably the most linked to and bookmarked posts at ProBlogger fit more into the inspirational / motivational category rather than an educational one .
People like to be inspired and touched on an emotional level .
Use Humor –
Of course it ’s not only techie or inspirational posts that get to the top of the del.icio.us heap .
Sometimes it ’s links that go for the funny bone that are also popular .
Ten Simple Rules for Dating My Daughters was a link that caught my eye a few days back for this reason – it got close to the top of the popular page .
Of course if you can use humor in the form of a numbered list on a techie , inspirational topic and make a big claim at the same time you ’re set !
I ’m sure there are plenty of other characteristics of del.icio.us links that make it to the popular page – interested to hear what others think .
All airports have been put under the restrictions
Reid statement
It is thought the plan was to detonate explosive devices smuggled in hand luggage on to as many as 10 aircraft .
Police are searching premises after 21 people were arrested .
Home Secretary John Reid said they believed the " main players " were accounted for .
High security is causing delays at all UK airports .
The threat level to the UK has been raised by MI5 to critical after the arrests in London , High Wycombe and Birmingham .
Critical threat level - the highest - means " an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK " .
Three US airlines are believed to have been targeted .
Mr Reid said had the attack gone ahead it would have caused a loss of life of " unprecedented scale " .
He said they were " confident " the main players were in custody , but neither the police nor government are " in any way complacent " .
We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction
Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Stephenson Flights disruption across UK At - a - glance : Travel advice
Police statement
Prime Minister Tony Blair , on holiday in the Caribbean , paid tribute to the the police and the security services .
He said they had tracked the situation for a " long period of time " and had " been involved in an extraordinary amount of hard work . "
" I thank them for the great job they are doing in protecting our country .
" There has been an enormous amount of co-operation with the US authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it , " he said in a statement .
BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the plot was thought to have involved a series of " waves " of simultaneous attacks , targeting three planes each time .
He also said the plan " revolved around liquids of some kind " .
" Officials say the explosives would have been sophisticated and extremely effective , " our correspondent said .
Airport ' crammed '
Meanwhile , at Heathrow Airport incoming short - haul flights have resumed , but long - haul services are seriously delayed .
Several outbound services have been cancelled .
The airport is crammed with thousands of passengers , while at Stansted more than 2,000 people are queuing to pass through customs .
Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Stephenson said the alleged plotters had intended " mass murder on an unimaginable scale " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This disruption is one of the short term limits on freedom that are needed

" We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit , quite frankly , mass murder , " he said .
" We believe that the terrorists ' aim was to smuggle explosives on to aeroplanes in hand luggage and to detonate these in flight .
We also believe that the intended targets were flights from the United Kingdom to the United States of America . "
Police had spoken to a " good number of community leaders to make them aware that a major operation was under way , " he added .
Head of the Met 's anti-terrorist branch Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke said the investigation had had " global dimensions " and had seen an " unprecedented level " of surveillance .
The decision to take action had been taken on Wednesday night , he added .
According to BBC sources the " principal characters " suspected of being involved in the plot were British - born .
There are also understood to be links to Pakistan .
BBC home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said police sources had told him they had found " interesting items " which were being examined .
In other major developments :
Houses in High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire , are evacuated by police
US air marshals are being sent to the UK to provide extra air security
The US Department of Homeland Security increased the threat level applied to US - bound commercial flights originating in the UK to " red " - the first time it has done this for flights coming in from another country
The Home Office confirmed there had been meetings overnight and on Thursday morning of the Cabinet 's emergency committee , Cobra , chaired by Home Secretary John Reid , to discuss the terror alert
A spokesman for Number 10 said Tony Blair had briefed US President George Bush on the situation during the night
BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said despite the arrests the threat level had been raised " in case there is some other sub - plot , back - up plot around this that the police are n't aware of " .
Total : 21 people arrested London : ' Majority ' of arrests - exact locations not known Birmingham : Two arrests High Wycombe :
At least one arrest
The Department for Transport set out the details of the security measures at UK airports .
Passengers are not allowed to take any hand luggage on to any flights in the UK , the department said .
Only the barest essentials - including passports and wallets - will be allowed to be carried on board in transparent plastic bags .
" We hope that these measures , which are being kept under review by the government , will need to be in place for a limited period only , " the statement said .
I 've collected thousands of inspirational quotes .
It seems that nearly everything that can be said , already has been said , simply and eloquently , in a way that can seldom be improved .
Ralph Waldo Emerson , the most widely - quoted American author lamented that " All my best thoughts were stolen by the ancients . "
There 's a beauty in brevity , and my favorite epigrams are brief .
Winston Churchill wrote , " Broadly speaking , the short words are the best , and the old words best of all . "
Here are " The world 's best quotes in 1 - 10 words , " followed by my comments : Love .
 The Prophets
Jesus , Gandhi , Buddha .
All the world 's religious saints and prophets hold love as a central value , the glue that anchors the universe .
We hear , " Love makes the world go round , " and " Love heals all wounds . "
These are familiar themes : love of friends , ideas , and self .
Love of God and of country .
Even love of life itself .
If I could only have one word for all eternity , love would be my choice .
Know thyself .
 Socrates
In college I studied philosophy under Professor Don Crosby , and met Socrates early .
In career development , self - knowledge is everything .
In a career , you can be two or three degrees off course and walk into a wall , instead of through a doorway .
You do n't have to be far off to have it fail .
Career unhappiness often results from lack of focus , and lack of focus stems from limited self - knowledge .
But self - knowledge takes time , introspection , and effort .
So it 's easy to avoid .
Inches make champions .
 Vince Lombardi
Under Vincent Thomas Lombardi's direction , the Green Bay Packers collected six division titles , five NFL championships , two Super Bowls , and record of 98 - 30 - 4 .
Lombardi knew a lot about winning .
If football is a game of inches , so is career success .
In the competitive world , you seldom win by a landslide .
Buzz Sullivan , my high school diving coach , told me , " A champion is someone who goes so far they can't go another inchand then they go that inch . "
As a youth I wondered why that was important .
Now I know .
Winning in business or in personal life is all about inches : going small distances successfully , then going farther still .
Nothing gold can stay .
 Robert Frost
We are swamped in change .
And we had better get used to it , or at least figure out how to deal with it .
In our parents ' day , career change was uncommon .
The norm was lifetime employment .
Now CAREER = CHANGE .
You 'll have five careers in a lifetime , maybe six .
Perhaps you 'll do part - time , project , interim , or consulting work .
And even if you 're in your ideal dream job today , that might change tomorrow .
Nothing gold can stay .
Martin Bucco taught English literature at Colorado State University , and first brought my attention to what words could mean .
Bucco spoke of what he called " the great dead minds , " those who have come before us and written their thoughts .
He also said , " Time in life is short .
You can only read so many books , so choose wisely . "
We spent many classes unwrapping Robert Frost 's genius , and this is one of the poems that hit home .
It earned him the 1924 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry .
NOTHING GOLD CAN STAY  by Robert Frost
Nature 's first green is gold ,
Her hardest hue to hold .
Her early leaf 's a flower ;
But only so an hour .
Then leaf subsides to leaf .
So Eden sank to grief ,
So dawn goes down to day .
Nothing gold can stay .
Work is love made visible .
 Kahlil Gibran
About 80 % of people are unhappy at work , and 20 % are happy .
Our culture has separated work from passion , and taught us to prefer a higher paycheck to higher happiness .
That mistake costs us our souls .
The goal of career development is to uncover one 's gifts and passions , and to link them to the practical needs of the world .
We call that " being in the right place , " " finding a good fit , " or " making the best use of one 's talents . "
I sometimes call it " Being planted in the right pot . "
In What Color Is Your Parachute ?
my mentor , Dick Bolles , quotes Fred Buechner , who writes , " There are all different kinds of voices calling you to all different kinds of work . . . ( and ) the place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world 's deep hunger meet . " [ 2001 Edition , page 57 . ]
High compensation and high happiness are not incompatible .
It 's not that we should n't seek money , and lots of it ; many of our clients do .
But we should first seek to love , or at least to like , what we 're doing .
That 's the realization of our highest calling .
No great thing is created suddenly .
 Epictetus ( A.D.200 )
We live in a Twitter - Instagram culture .
We want everything instantly and without effort .
And we bristle when others around us appear to be getting more , sooner .
Waiting for rewards or results is out of favor .
It is so uncool .
Many things are created suddenly : the two - day house makeovers on HGTV , for example .
They 're good but not great .
They are adequate , functional , or practical improvements .
Greatness requires thought and time , effort and sacrifice .
Especially sacrifice .
Stellar careers are n't built overnight .
Take the orthopedic surgeon , whose education extends 15 years past high school .
Take the country western star on Grand Ole ' Opry .
Take the NFL quarterback or wide receiver , the CEOs , CFOs , and Vice Presidents of brand - name companies .
Think about Edison , Einstein , or Galileo , or anyone else you might admire .
None of them got there overnight .
Great careers are built upon hundreds of thousands of small efforts , undertaken daily , that eventually grow into a series of satisfying wins .
An ad for Paul Masson Vineyards picturing a bottle of wine said , " Nothing good happens fast . "
I framed it , and hung it in my office .
Well done is better than well said .
 Benjamin Franklin
This is a variation on " Actions speak louder than words " and on Shakespeare 's superb quote , " Talkers are no good doers . "
An executive search consultant who recruited 500 bank presidents told me , " There are two kinds of candidates : tap dancers and superstars .
Tap dancers go through the motions and superstars get the work done .
I recruit the superstars . "
No wind favors s/he who has no destined port .
 Montaigne
The cliche , " If you do n't know where you 're going , any road will take you there , " is valid .
And many careers are broken by lack of direction .
Corporations define this concept as having a mission or vision , and organizations lacking vision usually flounder .
" Career Planning " speaks to the idea of creating a blueprint for your future .
That is , having a goal , a destined portfulfilling your destiny .
Stephen R. Covey said it well in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People when he advised us to " Begin with the end in mind . "
Sometimes even to live is an act of courage .
 Seneca
I 've been there .
You 've been there .
Sometimes life is hard .
You hit a career roadblock or dead end .
Nothing seems to be working .
You 're fired or laid off .
Or worse yet , you and your spouse are both unemployed .
It happens .
And it happens more frequently than you might imagine , to good people , qualified candidates , because of circumstances beyond their control .
I like Churchill 's words , " Never give in , never , never , never , never ; in nothing , great or small never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense . "
And I especially like the quote by Edmund Burke , who said : " Never despair , but if you do , work on in despair . "
I admire those who attempt to overcome adversity , and compiled these quotes to help .
Do first things first , and second things not at all .
 Peter Drucker .
It 's so easy to do what 's familiar , comfortable , or fun .
It 's so difficult , sometimes , to tackle the highest priority .
And sometimes it 's difficult to even know your top priorities ; hence , the phrase , " I ca n't see the forest for the trees . "
We suffer from over - choice : 867 varieties of toothpaste , 10,487 styles of shoes , 186 brands of cell phones with 137 telephone companies .
We demand more variety than we could possibly need or want ; and as a result , we get lost in options , opportunities , and choices .
There are 87 varieties of lawyers , and 75 specialties inside medicine .
The world of work can be a confusing landscape .
When you 're flooded with career possibilities , or " swimming up Niagara Falls , " it 's good to spend time answering questions like , " What is the best and highest use of my talents ? " and , " How can I make a bigger impact ? "
If you can't establish clear career priorities by yourself , use friends and business acquaintances as a sounding board .
They will want to help .
Ask them to help you determine your " first things " and " second things . "
Or seek an outside coach or advisor to help you focus .
Because if you do n't know what your " first things " are , you simply can't do them FIRST .

バージョン管理システムで使われる用語の意味のメモ。主に
CVS 、Subversion 、VSS
( Visual SourceSafe ) で使われる用語が対象 。
- リポジトリ repository バージョン管理の履歴が保存されているところ。リポジトリのバックアップだけはしっかり取っておこう。
- ツリー tree リポジトリにある一連のファイルをまとめるディレクトリのようなもの。ツリー状になるのでこう呼ばれているようだ。VSS ではプロジェクト 、CVS ではモジュールとも呼ぶ 。
- チェックアウト checkout , 取得 チェックアウトと取得のどちらもリポジトリからファイルを取ってくることを指すが、バージョン管理システムの動作モデルによって微妙に意味が異なる。
コピー・修正・マージの動作モデルで動いている
Subversion では、リポジトリからファイルを取ってきてローカルに作業コピーを作ることをチェックアウトと呼ぶ。
ロック・修正・ロック解除の排他動作モデルで動いている
VSS では、リポジトリから単に取得することを「取得」と呼び、ロック付きで取得することを「チェックアウト」と呼ぶ。他のメンバーはチェックアウト中のファイルを修正できない。
- チェックイン checkin , コミット commit リポジトリに修正を反映させることをチェックインやコミットと呼ぶ。
- タグ tag , ラベル label 複数のファイルやツリーをまとめて名前付けするものをタグやラベルと呼ぶ。タグを指定した時点のファイルをまとめて取得したりするために使う。
たとえば、新バージョンの開発が終わってリリースするときなどにタグを打ったりする。こうしておけば
リリースしたバージョン *** のビルドに必要なソースを全部取得したい、という場合もすぐに対応できる。
ちなみにタグは「打つ」もので、ラベルの場合は「貼る」もの。私の場合、なぜかバージョン管理のタグは「付ける」のではなく「打つ」という。
- 共有 share VSS で複数のプロジェクト間で同じファイルを扱うための仕組み。エイリアスやシンボリックリンクのようなもの。複数のプロジェクトで「共有」されたファイルを修正してチェックイン
( CVS 風に言うと commit ) すると、すべてのプロジェクトに修正が波及する。
- ブランチ branch ツリーを分岐させること。ブランチすると分岐元とは別にバージョン管理されるようになり、チェックインされた内容が他に自動的に波及しないようになる。明示的に分岐元と同期することはマージと呼ぶ。
分岐させる理由としては、元のツリーを壊すことなく大規模な機能追加をおこないたいとか、リリースに向けてバグ修正だけをするツリーを作りたいなどといったものがある。
ちなみに branch は枝という意味。朝ごはんと昼ごはんを一緒に食べるブランチ ( BReakfast + lUNCH ) は brunch なのでスペルが違う 。
- マージ marge ブランチしたツリーに対し、別のツリーにチェックインされた修正を適用すること。VSS
や Subversion では、マージは単なる差分の適用でしかなく、ブランチが統合されたりするわけではない。
- トランク trunk 主流となっているブランチのこと 。HEAD とも呼ばれる。ちなみに trunk は幹という意味で、そこか ら 「 主流のブランチ」という意味になったのだろう。かばんを意味する trunk も同じスペルだけど、別の意味。
failures related to maintenance can explain rapid forgetting , prospective memory failures , and absent - mindedness ( claim supported here ) .
memory search failures can result in interference , levels - of - processing phenomena , infantile amnesia ( claim supported here ) , as well as directed forgetting , tip - of - the - tongue phenomena , retrieval - induced forgetting , and consolidation - related forgetting ( claim supported here ) .
monitoring failures can explain false memory effects , consistency biases , source misattribution errors , and incorrect recall from the DRM paradigm ( supported here ) .
In a series of posts last week , I have reconceptualized the “ seven sins of memory ” as a group of memory inaccuracies arising from just three types of system failure .
To recap briefly :
I have described how each of these failures can cleanly account for much of the evidence used to support a classification scheme with seven categories ( although it should be noted that I have not covered Schacter 's sin of " persistence , " which in truth is not really a memory failure anyway ) .
However , the current classification scheme has a few additional benefits , as described below .
First , this framework is capable of accounting for memory phenomena not considered in Schacter ’s original proposal .
For example , I have described how infantile amnesia and interference in the AB - AC task can both result from failures of cue specification in the process of memory search .
Second , this framework can be extended to explain yet other memory inaccuracies as resulting from multiple failures .
For example , déjà vu might be considered a failure of both maintenance and search , in which sufficiently precise cues are unavailable ( which would otherwise elicit the original experience giving rise to the sensation of familiarity ) .
However , déjà vu is also characterized by a simultaneous failure to maintain the item or characteristic of the current experience that originally triggered the sensation of familiarity .
Third , this framework is more parsimonious ( by virtue of positing fewer constructs ) , and is much more compatible with the functional anatomy of memory than Schacter ’s “ seven sins . ”
For example , some evidence suggests that maintenance , cue specification , and monitoring may be implemented by distinct neural regions in prefrontal cortex ( Dobbins et al. , 2002 ) .
In contrast , it is almost unthinkable that concepts as abstract as bias or transience could be localized to a specific brain region .
In conclusion , Schacter ’s “ seven sins ” did an admirable job of classifying memory inaccuracies in an intuitively appealing way .
Further examination of these phenomena , however , has afforded the re-classification proposed above .
This proposal is just as complete , while both more parsimonious and more compatible with an emerging view of the neuroanatomy supporting memory functions .

New Ground New York : Noisy , ugly , busy , smelly , dirty .
Public transport in New York and the surrounding area is really bad : incomprehensible public announcements , poor signage , ancient rolling stock .
Traffic is a nightmare .
Tourist hot spots are badly managed .
Altogether , could be better .
Actually , when I say " New York " , I probably really mean " Manhattan " .
The name " New York " itself seems to be a bit vague , what with it being a state , a city in that state , a county in that city , and a metropolitan area that includes the city and other cities in the surrounding states .
What a mess .
Anyway .
Two weeks ago I visited Nadia in Princeton .
Princeton itself is a small village with a huge university on the side ( well , it 's huge to me , who went to Bath ) .
One night we hung out with some of Nadia 's new friends , watching Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy .
Another night I played board games with some other new friends of hers .
Here I was introduced to Medici , an interesting game that consists of bidding for goods in order to get the most points .
There are various ways to get points , there are various ways to prevent others from getting points .
One interesting aspect of this game that is unusual is that the currency that you bid is in fact your actual victory points .
( Having said that , I guess that 's not that unusual — any game where you bid money and the winner is the one with the most money is basically doing the same thing . )
It 's one of those " three days " games , where you simply play three rounds and then the game ends .
Just before I left Oslo Wilhelm bought Guillotine , a card game with the same mechanic .
When I was walking around the lake that one finds on the other side of the university I caught a glimpse of a deer , who seemed surprised to find me there and ran off when he saw me getting up .
Apparently there are many deers over there .
I also visited Manhattan , as I alluded to at the top of this entry .
There are lights everywhere .
It 's quite ridiculous .
My brain would n't let me read the signs because it thought they were spam .
Which I guess they were .
But my eyes kept darting around becuase there are flashing lights everywhere .
The trains at New York Penn Station ( which , by the way , sounds exactly like the totally unrelated stop called Newark Penn Station which all the trains happen to also stop at , and which is in a completely different state ) stop at platforms which are only announced ten minutes before they leave .
This causes everyone to rush to the platforms en bloc , a stampede for each train .
Quite ridiculous .
The PA system is horrendous .
I 'm not sure why they bother , I seriously could not understand a single word most of the time .
Later in the week I saw Corpse Bride at the AMC at 8th and 42nd , while Nadia went dancing ( my dancing skills are , ah , not yet to her standard , to put it mildly ) .
The AMC has some 25 full - scale theatres with fully raked seating , which they achieve by stacking them on top of each other on multiple floors .
I do n't know how many they have but when I left I had to go down some 9 flights of stairs .
We had only vaguely planned a time to meet up afterwards , but I got back first , so after reading a few chapters of The System of the World I decided to look for her .
Miraculously , I actually managed to find someone I was looking for in a random Korean restaurant in Manhattan .
Talk about needles and haystacks .
All in all it was a fun week .
I am a bad guest .
Then I went to visit Ben and Leslie in Campell on the West Coast .
Not much to report except that having now seen their TiVo's To Do list , I am a little concerned about the effect Ben is having on Leslie .
Or Leslie on Ben .
Either that or I 'm just worried about their joint taste in TV .
Over the course of the week I was forced ( well , techncially not forced but you get the idea ) to watch one particular disturbing Southpark episode not once but twice .
" I love Tacos , and Burritos . "
The second time was at their housewarming party , which was nice .
I met and spoke with several lovely people .
Ben cooked .
( Man. Fire .
Make food . )
Over the weekend I saw another movie , Serenity .
It was ok .
I 'm not a huge fan of Joss Whedon 's style ( e.g .
I only liked Buffy seasons 5 through 7 , and that had probably more to do with Dawn and Spike than anything else ) .
Serenity is very Whedonesque ( I hear that 's a word ) .
Oh and today I started my new job at Google .

Window of Opportunity Back in August I tried an experiment : two weeks offline with family and friends in Switzerland .
It was awesome .
Extremely relaxing and full of that personal growth stuff .
Thus , I have decided to give it another try .
I 'm going to take another two weeks off , mostly Internet - free again , this time on the US East Coast .
Back on the WHATWG spec , the section I 'm currently working on is the local network broadcast feature , which would allow applications written as Web pages running on browsers on devices in a LAN or PAN to communicate .
This would allow things like party lines , multi-player games , and the like .
For Ethernet networks , I 'm leaning towards a UDP - based system .
Each packet would consist of the broadcasting page 's domain , a colon , and the page data ( text encoded as UTF - 8 ) to the broadcast address , on a known port .
The domain would then be used to ensure that only Web pages from the same domain could read that data .
Well , Web pages and any native applications , of course — we want to allow anyone to write native code that interacts with these pages .
( For example , a game server could be written in C++ and run somewhere on the local network , with the game client written in HTML and served from a known network address .
Since the server knows the address , it knows what address to put on its headers , and which packets to read from the network when it receives some . )
I 'm not sure what size packets to allow ; research has suggested that if you want UDP packets to make it through the Internet you might want to limit yourself to 512 byte packets since those are the biggest size that will usually make it through intact ( since some routers apparently drop bigger packets rather than fragmenting them , or something ) .
But the idea here is local - network broadcast , not distant unicast , so fragmentation over routers seems irrelevant .
That would suggest we could allow up to the full 65507 byte packets ( 216-1 - 8 ( UDP packet header size ) - 20 ( IP v4 packet header size ) , or 65487 if we want to be forwards - compatible with IPv6 ( IPv6 headers are 20 bytes longer ) .
Then the question becomes " how do we handle transmissions above this limit " ?
I guess we just raise an exception , but it seems odd to allow US - ASCII users to send more text than people using , say , the plane - 1 Shavian alphabet .
Sadly I know very little about those levels of the networking stack , so I 'm probably spouting nonsense .
If so , do n't hesitate to moan at me so I can fix it .
Even worse than not knowing much about Ethernet , though , I do n't know anything about Bluetooth and similar standards .
I tried reading the Bluetooth spec but its 1230 pages overwhelmed me .
It would be really cool to transparently support things like Bluetooth as well , though .
What I want is a way to broadcast to any listening device the name of the broadcasting page 's domain , and the data that the page is sending .
Anyone know how to specify this ?

Message in a Bottle Recently Google announced their Blog Search service .
This caused me to look up " WHATWG " on both this new system and the Technorati search engine , to see what people were saying .
I found several posts giving suggestions and feedback on the WHATWG specs .
But as far as I can tell , none of those messages were sent to the list .
I 've made a note of those posts so that I can make sure to incorporate the comments that were made , but please , if you have comments ... send them to the list !
Or to me !
Leaving them on your Web log will not ( unless I happen to run into those comments like I did those above ) result in the spec improving .
Your comments are welcome , whoever you are , and however minor or controversial you might think your comments are .

Cor-ai
If someone accused me of writing sentences that made people go cross-eyed , I 'd have to plead guilty .
While trying to define the first draft of the client - side persistent storage API in HTML5 , I just ended up writing the following : When the setItem ( ) method is called on a Storage object that is associated with a global storage entry for a domain d and was created by a StorageList object associated with a Window object x , then in every DocumentWindow object whose Window object is not x and whose globalStorage attribute 's StorageList object 's getDomain ( ) method would not raise a security exception according to the rules above if it was invoked with the domain d , a storage event must be fired , as described below .
My only defence is that I 'm just trying to be exact !
People are already trying to find better ways to phrase it , so do n't be surprised if , by the time you check the spec , the sentence has been replaced by something much saner .
As always , feedback on WHATWG specs is welcome .

Small Victories Back in July Allan and I went to Shadowcon 10 .
I went to Shadowcon 9 with Eira last year , and the Buffy Sing - Along was the best thing there , and this year I basically went there only for the sing - along , which was just as fun .
It helps that I 've been listening to the Once More , With Feeling soundtrack so much recently that I know most of the words by heart , even when there are multiple overlapping lines ...
I 've also over the past few months been watching lots of Top Gear , the UK motoring show ( which is hilarious even if , like me , you understand nothing of what they 're saying ) .
More recently I bought Gran Turismo 4 , the racing simulator .
This is all part of an effort to learn more about cars in general since many of my friends seem obsessed by them and it would be nice to at least have some clue what they 're talking about .
I have n't played GT4 much but so far I 've done my National A and B licenses , with about two thirds bronze and one third silver .
One day I should probably get a real license too .
On Saturday we went to see The Lord of the Rings performed by the Oslo Philharmonic and supported by various other groups .
Tim has the scoop .
On Sunday , Allan , Wilhelm and I played Civilisation the Board Game .
It 's a strategy game .
Much better than Risk , better than Attack ; not as good as Twilight Imperium III .
I 'm not a huge fan of any of those games , because they basically boil down to fighting instead of cooperating .
The only strategy game I 've really liked is OpenTTD ( the free Transport Tycoon clone ) , and that 's not a board game .
I won , leading a completely peaceful strategy , not attacking a single time ( well , I attacked once , but that was with the agreement of the target and was merely so we could swap cities so he could consolidate his forces ; there was no violence involved ) .
I was a little lucky in that Allan and Wilhelm decided to keep fighting each other instead of doing the same as me , peacefully living without conflict .
Almost all my settlements ended up happy , with a few exceptions which would have been happy within a few rounds if the game had n't been ended ( Allan got the UN and declared the game over ) .
Earlier in the week we also played Fearsome Floors , which is an interesting game where the only randomness is player - neutral .
I like that kind of game .
It constrasts with games like Super Munchkin , the latest in the long series of Munchkin games ( of which we have all but the Fu2 expansion , I think ) which are all basically completely random .
I remember joining a game of Munchkin a few weeks ago that had been going on for some hours — I managed to get to level 8 or 9 in short order , while the player next to me , who had been playing since the start , was mostly hovering around level 2 or 3 .
There is some skill involved but frankly it 's mostly about what cards you happen to get .
The skill usually involves confusing people with obscure rules .
Over the past few days the SVG and CDF working groups have sent feedback to the CSS working group on CSS2.1 , and Björn and I have been fielding their requests on behalf of the CSS group .
Most of their requests seem to have been misunderstandings , so we 've managed to answer most of them already .
IRC is a great tool for dealing with this kind of thing !
A few of the issues were real issues , though , so we 'll be discussing those at our telecons .

House members say C - 130's defenses repelled missile ; Boxer argues for similar equipment on commercial jets 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Members of Congress are used to being attacked by their political opposition , but being attacked by anti-aircraft missiles is another matter entirely .
In January , a six - member delegation of the House Armed Services Committee , led by Rob Simmons , R - Conn. , came under missile attack as they traveled " lights out " on a military plane from Baghdad to Kuwait , according to three members of that delegation .
Reps . Jeb Bradley , R - N.H. , John Spratt , D - S.C. , and Neil Abercrombie , D - Hawaii , confirmed the incident to The Chronicle .
Sources familiar with the Defense Department investigation into the attack said the missile used in the attack on the C - 130 carrying the delegation was an SA - 18 , considered the most sophisticated of Russian shoulder - fired missiles , or MANPADS ( man- portable air defense systems ) .
Missile avoided
According to those same sources , the missile was deflected by the plane 's countermeasures -- based on technology Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , and other lawmakers have been seeking for commercial airliners .
Maj .
Robert Palmer , spokesman for U.S. Central Command Air Forces , refused to comment on the reported attack and what specific means were used to protect the plane .
" Coalition aircraft operating in Iraq have defensive countermeasures .
For purposes of operational security , we cannot discuss the types or capabilities of these countermeasures , " Palmer said .
Although missile attacks on Air Force transports occur regularly in Iraq , the type of missile said to have been used in the attack on the delegation 's plane ratchets up the threat to both military and commercial aircraft .
" The SA - 18 is significantly harder to defend against " than earlier - generation MANPADS , said Daniel Goure , vice president of the Lexington Institute , a military affairs think tank based in Arlington , Va .
" The SA - 18 has increased range , increased altitude , and is much better able to home in on a vital piece of aircraft equipment . "
Countermeasures
Concern over missiles such as the SA - 18 prompted the military to begin installing systems that use lasers to deflect the missile 's aim from its intended target .
Shortly after the November 2002 attack on an Israeli airliner in Mombasa , Kenya , Boxer and Rep. Steve Israel , D - N.Y. , began pressing for the installation of similar defenses on the U.S. commercial airline fleet .
In 2003 , Congress ordered the Department of Homeland Security to determine how best to adapt the military 's laser - based infrared countermeasures systems ( know as DIRCM , or directed infrared countermeasures ) for use on commercial aircraft .
That study , begun in January 2004 , is not likely to conclude for another 18 months , when a report is submitted to Congress .
Meanwhile , no countermeasures have been installed on any U.S. airliners , including the Civil Reserve Air Fleet , civilian airliners that ferry troops to and from the Middle East for deployment to Iraq .
A call for protection
" The Civil Reserve Air Fleet ... ( is ) a prime target for terrorists or enemies with MANPADS , " Rep. Israel said .
" The impact of the loss of just one such aircraft would be incalculable .
...
It is past time to extend this protection to the CRAF fleet and , ultimately , to the entire commercial air fleet . "
According to recent press reports , a number of SA - 18 missiles have slipped out of Russia .
Baker Spring , a fellow in national security policy at the Heritage Foundation , said people should be " incredibly concerned with missiles from the former Soviet Union 's stockpiles " flowing into the black market .
James Tuttle , head of the Homeland Security Department 's counter - MANPADS efforts , has stated publicly that such weapons " are readily available worldwide . "
Although there have been no definitive examples of MANPADS being used within the United States , Defense Department documents show that MANPADS have hit civil aircraft 43 times worldwide and destroyed 30 of the targeted aircraft .
About 900 passengers and crew died in these attacks .
In an interview , Boxer urged the Bush administration to address the threat posed by shoulder - fired missiles .
' The cost of not doing this '
" We had a scare in Los Angeles last year when an American Airlines pilot reported seeing a rocket right after takeoff .
Authorities could n't rule out the possibility it was a shoulder - fired missile , " she said .
" We had a scare in Iraq in January , when my colleagues said they believed a shoulder - fired missile was fired at their plane . "
According to Boxer , two companies have developed countermeasure systems for use on commercial aircraft that can be installed for less than a million dollars per plane .
" I do n't think a million dollars to protect a $ 120 million aircraft -- that 's the cost of a sound system on one of these jets -- is too much , and frankly , the cost of not doing this is absolutely incalculable , " Boxer said .

There was a time when a significant percentage of unsolicited submissions to thewere faux Hunter Thompson : long , methamphetamine rants  hallucinations , political diatribes , bizarre social observations , and boasts of prodigious personal consumption of a laundry list of drugs delivered in a stream - of - consciousness torrent .
None came close to appreciating or emulating Thompson 's easily overlooked professionalism .
His work offered impressive writing skill , powerful imagery , and detailed descriptions employed in the service of often brilliant reporting  whether a relatively straight depiction of the Hell 's Angels motorcycle gang or a somewhat more fevered account of a drug - fueled Las Vegas visit .
When Thompson spun out of control , his pieces began to read like self - parody and severely diminished his importance , already diluted by changing times .
No author since has emerged as such a pervasive influence on would - be writers .
Now we are witnessing similar activity , but in publications ' letter pages ( including the Chronicle's ) .
In correspondence defined by an air of smugness and pomposity , dismissive of the positions they dispute , these letter - writers offer a certain world - weary condescension as they deign to point out the ignorance of the writer they attack , eruditely enumerating the flaws in logic and historical ignorance evidenced .
Frequently , this is done with the biggest words possible ( one hears thesauri being thumbed across the country ) .
At first , this seemed simply a frat - boy political dialogue , but then the source became obvious .
In the way Thompson once influenced renegade writers , Rush Limbaugh is now the literary mainstay of a generation of conservative / Republican / right - wing champions .
These letter - writers imagine themselves as dominating , right - wing , radio talk - show hosts engaged in dismissive dialogue with their callers .
Gutsy defenders of the status quo , unapologetic apologists for anything this administration does , they simultaneously despise government while wishing they could somehow re-create the far more perfect past .
Rush was the modern pioneer of sneering debate in which the unimaginative , sometimes reactionary celebration of the status quo is presented as daringly heroic , renegade individualism .
As often as he was imitated , Thompson was unique , with few of the writers most influenced by him attaining popularity .
Limbaugh 's success has launched more voices than the Mormon Tabernacle Choir .
Hosts of shows throughout the country , many syndicated , follow Limbaugh 's model ( though most would bristle at this description ) : Passionately supportive of the most hard - right , conservative Republican positions , they are pro-Iraqi invasion , anti-tax , and anti-big - government .
Conversely , they are deeply anti-Democrat , finding that party 's adherents the traitorous root cause of all contemporary political problems .
Inherently distrustful of democracy ( they disdain minority views and protections ) , they almost all claim to be nonpartisan  which only means that often even far - right - wing Republicans are not fanatically conservative enough .
They share certain stylistic characteristics : contempt and complete disrespect for any opposing position , accompanied by the continual setting up of straw men in order to discredit them .
Their positions are tapestries of bits of accepted administration logic , conservative cant , and select historical references woven together with " common sense " assertions .
Those who disagree are dishonest , traitorous , stupid , and unquestioning conformists to radical , anti-American ideology .
Often the letter - writers will point out how amused they are by the stupidity of their opponents and their arguments .
Invariably , they will sneer and strut .
They claim they just want intelligent debate and  while deriding others  dare you to refute their positions .
Do n't venture into this quicksand !
You 'll soon discover that , as they know what is the " truth " and what is a " lie , " what is " fact " and what is " distortion , " you are fighting air , with your opinions , sources , and information summarily denied .
These letters , as are the talk shows that inspire them , are about attitude rather than ideas .
In defining their superiority , politics and ideology are almost incidental , serving the same function as brands of clothes or cars :
They are simply to distinguish one from the masses .
They do n't believe nor are they interested in principled disagreement or sincere discussion aimed at compromise and understanding .
They believe in good guys and bad guys ; who belongs in each category is a given .
The construction of talk radio encourages this ; it is about placing blame rather than offering constructive suggestions .
As they brag about their influence and the size of their audiences , radio talk - show hosts insist on their uniqueness , denying the proliferation of such shows .
Thus , they attack American media for being mono-voiced and Democrat - controlled while ignoring the existence of not just talk radio but all conservative media .
They decry the slanted media coverage of news in the most dishonest terms .
Often they will discuss a major story of the day by stating that mainstream media is ignoring it and no one else is talking about it .
It is not just that invariably every other talk - show host is talking about the same story , but frequently the story is on the front page of The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and The Washington Post .
They count on their audience 's need to feel embattled and the assumption that most do n't read those papers .
The Republican right controls Congress and the presidency ; they believe God is on their side and that they hold the true vision of this great country in their hearts .
Still , they make every argument from the point of view of the besieged , indulging in celebrating their triumphs only as proof of the complicity of God in their cause ( as well as oasis - stops of gloating ) .
Alienated righteousness is a potent , protected place to be :
You know your beliefs are pure , you know you hold truths , but the easily manipulated masses have voted into power fools who are determined to destroy this nation .
Listen carefully to them :
The problem really is n't the stated - as - fact liberal bias of mainstream media ; it is that media does not adhere unswervingly to expressing their biases .
Demanding " objectivity , " they deride any information or position with which they disagree .
They claim Fox News is " fair , " that Bill O'Reilly is offering a " no- spin zone , " and that the American media is overwhelmingly anti-war .
Certainly , mainstream media has an urban , homogenized sensibility that reflects the status quo .
But try to find a longtime liberal / progressive who believes media reflects / has reflected his beliefs .
You wo n't .
Along the same lines is the conservative fiction that this was a liberal - controlled country until the conservatives took it back .
It was n't .
On the other side , a journalism professor chided The New York Times a few weeks back , asking why they just did n't rename it something like " The Administration 's Official Position . "
As if the Bush administration would endorse the Times .
People are actually more pissed about media presenting information they wished it would n't , or that they do n't want to believe , than they are that it 's not presenting enough information .
A bottom line is the conviction of all , regardless of political stripe , that news is supporting and reinforcing not just their ideological opposites but the great , unsophisticated , easily manipulated masses , who are not to be trusted .
Most complaints about what is lacking in coverage of Iraq concern issues that are being covered .
The concern is really emphasis .
A reading of a range of easily accessed materials offers a complex , rather than one - sided , view of the situation .
There is just the reluctance to trust what you disagree with and the conviction that you are not being told about more of what you do believe is happening .
The most ridiculous were the attacks on media for portraying the war in Iraq as anything but antiseptic .
CNN was labeled traitorous for showing destroyed buildings and American casualties , as well as wounded and dead civilians  war supporters ' arrogant assumption being that most Americans are n't tough enough to deal with the truth , or hardened enough to understand that a war means blood , death , and destruction : " If you just show them a little mayhem , they 'll turn against the war . "
The ridiculous rose to the preposterous with comparisons to D - Day : " If there had been the same kind of reporting then , we would have abandoned the war and all be speaking German now . "
This is a just plain stupid analogy on so many grounds .
Most offensively , it insults the American people , who neither question sacrifice nor are so easily dissuaded by gruesome realities .
The problems with Iraq are not dead bodies and bloody children but the question , " Why ? "
Why is this happening ?
Why did we invade ?
What will be the outcome ?
Astonishingly , supporters of the war and the aristocratic letter - writers regard themselves as fearless , truth - seeking renegades whose eyes are open to the world , while the liberals are so swamped by sentimental morality , they 're essentially blind .
Buying the administration 's position hook , line , and sinker , they embrace the status quo , accepting government propaganda as gospel while assaulting any legitimate questioning .
In superior tones , they advocate positions clearly authored by the government 's enormous opinion - manufacturing machinery .
Regardless of specific ideology , we can all grant that all governments heavily slant information with deliberate shading , withholding , excessive control , and outright censorship .
By setting up the straw men of liberal media and traitorous Democrats , the right positions this endorsement of propaganda as a courageous , patriotic act of independent thinking .
Deeply fearful , this blatant authority - worship is necessarily coupled with disgust at different perspectives .
Wrapped up in his own insecurities , feeling embattled and disenfranchised , Limbaugh brilliantly re-created the mainstream , blindly loyal , unquestioning conformist as a daring , oppressed , truth - seeking revolutionary .
Now read the letters .
Government and press often have a love - hate relationship , but a tiff turned into a sustained clash last week after the disclosure by the New York Times of a secret US government effort to monitor international money transfers .
The tracking programme is n't new , and its legality is not seriously in question , but with the fifth anniversary of the 11 September attacks approaching and the administration 's holiday from press scrutiny long over , it has become the touchstone for the most hotly debated subject in American life : the conduct of the ' war on terror ' .
The data - tracking operation is only the latest clandestine programme the US press has exposed this year .
It comes on the heels of a Washington Post report on secret CIA prisons abroad and an NYT scoop in January that revealed President Bush had authorised the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on American citizens without court warrants .
Though the new report does not have the import of either of the previous exposés , the NYT 's decision to publish it over the sustained objections of the administration has given White House strategist Karl Rove - now free of his legal worries - a rare opportunity to rally the support base .
In Republican America , in need of uplift after recent failures to pass anti-gay marriage legislation or enact a permanent repeal of death duties , accusing the paper of undermining the war on terror is an easy hit .
The New York Times , after all , is shorthand for every bogey at Republican spin-masters ' disposal : it means liberal , gay , Jewish , intellectual , big - government , pro-choice , unpatriotic .
For the paper 's constituency , too , the existence of a programme to monitor money transfers re-confirms fears that Bush 's regard for authority echoes Nixon 's Vietnam - era assertion that the executive branch of government has the ' inherent authority ' to spy on anyone it deems to be the enemy .
The fact that the US government is trying to glean information from the vast database of financial transactions maintained by Swift , the Belgium - based payments and clearing consortium , is not a surprise .
Tracking bank transactions as a means of pursuing potential terrorists has been central to US intelligence efforts since before 9/11 , and its importance has been reiterated several times since 24 September 2001 , when Bush asserted : ' We 're putting banks and financial institutions around the world on notice : we will work with their governments and ask them to freeze or block terrorist ability to access funds in foreign accounts . '
None the less , in choosing to reveal the specifics of the monitoring effort - known as the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program - the NYT has come in for sustained criticism .
Bush called the paper 's conduct ' disgraceful ' and told a fundraiser in St Louis last week : ' This programme has been a vital tool in the war on terror .
There can be no excuse for anyone entrusted with vital intelligence to leak it - and no excuse for any newspaper to print it . '
Vice - President Dick Cheney said the paper had made it ' more difficult for us to prevent attacks in the future ' .
The National Review , a conservative weekly magazine , suggested the NYT should be stripped of its White House press credentials .
In Congress , a resolution was drafted supporting the data - tracking programme and condemning the publication of its existence .
The resolution said it ' expects the co-operation of all news media organisations in protecting the lives of Americans and the capability of the government to identify , disrupt and capture terrorists by not disclosing classified intelligence programmes ' .
Further , the director of national intelligence and US ambassador to the United Nations in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , John Negroponte , ordered a review of any damage to counter - terrorism efforts resulting from the leak .
The right - wing Weekly Standard called the NYT a 'national security threat ... drunk on its own power ' .
New York Republican congressman
Pete King said the paper had an ' arrogant , elitist , left - wing agenda ' and should be prosecuted .
There is surprise at quite this level of fury being directed at the paper .
' Even by modern standards of media - bashing , the volume of vitriol ... is remarkable , ' notes Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz - especially given that the Los Angeles Times , the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal also published accounts of the programme .
The NYT 's executive editor , Bill Keller , suggests the paper 's critics are still angry at it for disclosing the government 's domestic eavesdropping programme .
' In their view , this adds insult to injury ...
The Bush administration 's reaction roused their base , but also roused the anti-Bush base as well , ' he says .
But besides political expediency , there are deeper reasons for the government 's protest .
The paper 's actions threatens what is known as the ' New Paradigm ' - a reading of the US constitution that rests on the idea that the President , as commander - in - chief , has authority to override legal restrictions in the name of national security .
This reading , which took a fresh blow on Thursday when the Supreme Court struck down the legality of holding military tribunals for prisoners in Guantanamo , remains the centrepiece of the administration 's wartime thinking .
The Bush White House likes to appear blase about the media , but it makes strenuous efforts to get the right message out .
In an address to the Council on Foreign Relations in February , Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld told its members that the US was losing the war of ideas .
Now , he added , ' some of the most critical battles may not be in the mountains of Afghanistan or the streets of Iraq , but in newsrooms - in places like New York , London , Cairo , and elsewhere ' .
To win the war of influence , Rumsfeld 's Pentagon established several well known but clandestine - sounding programmes , including the ' Office of Strategic Influence ' and the ' Office of Global Communications ' , which operated with a view to ' developing , co-ordinating , de-conflicting and monitoring the delivery of timely , relevant , and effective messages to targeted international audiences . '
But according to ' Mind Games , ' a study of the government 's strategy to frame reality published by the Columbia Journalism Review , the true purpose of the OSI and the Office of Global Communications was not to shape international opinion .
' The global issue was n't the reason why they were created , ' Daniel Kuehl , a retired Air Force colonel at the National Defence University , told the magazine .
' They clearly had a completely domestic focus .
They were part of the effort to re-elect the president ... their goal was psychological operations on the American voting public . '
In 2002 , the New York Times exposed the existence of the OSI and it was disbanded shortly thereafter , its duties assigned elsewhere .
The Office of Global Communications also now seems to be inactive .
But the Pentagon 's desire to use the media as a weapon has not ended .
Instead , the line between providing information and spreading propaganda has further blurred .
The ' war on terror ' ( now being called ' the long war ' ) is increasingly viewed as one of values and ideologies .
With the NYT 's editorial opposition to the war established , it is an obvious target .
It was never a soldier to the Republican cause ( although it was at least unwittingly complicit in supporting plans for the war by offering enthusiastic , but incorrect , evidence of Saddam Hussein 's alleged weapons of mass destruction ) .
Keller says he spent an hour with Treasury secretary John Snow listening to arguments for not publishing the money - transfers story .
' I always start with the premise that the question is , why should we not publish ?
Publishing information is our job , ' he later explained .
' What you really need is a reason to withhold information . '
And this , it seems , could not be found .
