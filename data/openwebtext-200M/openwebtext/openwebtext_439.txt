If you ’ve decided to move a few tables from MySQL to PostgreSQL , these few tips might help .
I wo n’t get into any reasons why to move to PostgreSQL or not .
There are already many discussions on the topic .
Create Syntax
The first five listed need to be done in order ; the rest can be in any .
Replace mediumint with int
with Replace tinyint with smallint
with Replace int\ ( [ 0 - 9 ] +\ ) with int .
( This is a regular expression that will find any instance of int ( ) where there is at least one number between the parenthesis )
with .
( This is a regular expression that will find any instance of int ( ) where there is at least one number between the parenthesis )
Remove all instances of NOT NULL I do n’t know what I was thinking here .
I do n’t know what I was thinking here .
Replace int \s +auto_increment with SERIAL
( Another regular expression that will catch a case with multiple spaces between int and auto_increment ) .
UPDATE : try int ( \s+|\s +NOT NULL\s +) auto_increment instead to catch when not null is in between int and auto .
UPDATE : try ( smallint|int ) ( \s+ |\s + NOT NULL\s +) auto_increment so it will catch the case when it is smallint as well .
with ( Another regular expression that will catch a case with multiple spaces between int and auto_increment ) .
Remove ENGINE=MyISAM
( Change if you use a different engine , i.e. innodb )
( Change if you use a different engine , i.e. innodb ) Remove DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
( Change if you use a different character set )
( Change if you use a different character set ) Remove AUTO_INCREMENT= [ 0 - 9 ] +
( Another regular expression to find all cases of an auto increment number )
( Another regular expression to find all cases of an auto increment number ) Remove IF NOT EXISTS
Remove all `
phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin has options when exporting that may make some of these steps unnecessary .
If you keep the create sql in a separate file from the insert sql , you save yourself from changing any data that may look like some of the above when it is n’t actual sql syntax .
Auto Increment and Serial
After running the create table SQL , a sequence table will be created for the serial column .
This sequence will need to be altered if the auto increment wo n’t be starting at one .
A query like the one below will need to be done for each table .
ALTER SEQUENCE tab_name_col_name_seq
RESTART WITH #;
Indexes
To define a column to be indexed , it is done in a separate query .
Remove anything that looks like KEY username ( username ) .
The query to run after the create table query should look like
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name ( column_name ) ;
Insert Syntax
The syntax here is pretty close , just one thing needs to be changed .
Replace “ ” with \ ” .
( MySQL and PostgreSQL use different methods of escaping these quotes . )
Make sure the complete inserts option is enabled and extended inserts is n’t .
PosgreSQL does n’t support multiple inserts with one query the same way .
( As far as I know at the moment )
Your Mileage May Vary
This was tested using phpMyAdmin export and phpPgAdmin SQL executing .
The regular expressions and other replace commands were done in jEdit .
With my few test cases I probably did n’t catch everything .
Let me know how it works out for you .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

Iraqi oil pipeline blown up again BBC News April 25 , 2008
An oil pipeline south of Baghdad has been blown up , wounding at least eight security guards , Iraqi police say .
The blast , near the town of Iskandiriya , caused a large fire and disrupted the flow of crude oil to refineries in the south of Iraq .
The pipeline carries fuel south from Baghdad 's Doura oil refinery .
It was the second time in the past year the pipeline had been hit and the latest in a series of attacks on Iraqi oil refineries , blamed on insurgents .
Pumping from the refinery was stopped because of the explosion , and production was likely to be affected , according to an official speaking anonymously .
A police officer , also speaking on condition of anonymity , said " the bombing has caused a huge fire " .
He added that at least 16 firefighting units had been sent to the area to deal with the explosion .
Iraq has the world 's third - largest oil reserves , consisting of more than 115 billion barrels .
But oil pipelines have often been targeted around the country by insurgents or saboteurs .

At the tender age of 25 , well before his work with the Auto Union Type C , Ferdinand Porsche entered the 1900 Paris World Exhibition with his all - electric car after developing the key systems for Jacob Lohner & Company .
It was heralded as the " most innovative invention " of the show and consequently orders were filled for 300 of the cars .
With 1800 lbs of lead - acid batteries , it 's quite amazing the cars would routinely achieve a staggering for the time top speed of 31 mph .
Since the motors were an in - wheel system , there was really no problem to include a second set in the back for the purposes of racing .

With Ferdinand at the wheel , the four motor car was a race winner and reached speeds of 37 mph .
He would go on to add an on - board generator to another car to provide unlimited range and also predate the Chevy Volt by about 100 years .

This is the start of a weekend of diplomacy for Nicolas Sarkozy Syria and Lebanon have agreed to open embassies in each other 's capitals , French leader Nicolas Sarkozy has said .
The announcement came after Mr Sarkozy held talks with Lebanon 's President Michel Suleiman and then Syria 's leader Bashar Assad in Paris .
Lebanon and Syria broke off diplomatic ties after former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri was assassinated in 2005 .
Beirut accused Syria of involvement .
Mr Assad 's welcome in Paris marks his return to the world stage .
" I would like to say what a historic step forward it is for France that Syrian President Bashar Assad is determined to open a diplomatic representation in Lebanon , and that Lebanon should open a diplomatic representation in Syria , " Mr Sarkozy announced after meeting both men .
Mr Sarkozy said the two leaders had authorised him to speak on their behalf .
Presidents Assad later confirmed the news .
" Our position is that there is no problem for the opening of embassies between Syria and Lebanon , " he told reporters .
Reward for Assad ?
Relations between Damascus and Beirut have been tense since the forced withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in mid-2005 after Mr Hariri 's assassination .
But the two nations have not had diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level since they became independent in the 1940s .
Rafik Hariri was killed in 2005 by a truck loaded with explosives
The US state department welcomed the announcement , but said Syria needed to take " concrete actions to end its destabilising tactics in the region " .
Mr Sarkozy also discussed other issues with his counterparts from Syria and Lebanon , during talks in the Elysee Palace .
After his meeting with Mr Assad , the French president said he had asked Syria to help resolve the international dispute over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Mr Assad said he was interested in finding a political solution , and he believed that Iran had no intention of trying to obtain nuclear weapons .
The Syrian leader also said he wanted France and the US to contribute to peace efforts between Syria and Israel , but Mr Sarkozy added that conditions were not yet right for direct Syria - Israel talks .
Mr Sarkozy added that he would visit Syria for talks before mid-September .
Mediterranean Union
The Paris visit is a big boost for Mr Assad , helping Syria to break out of its diplomatic isolation , says BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs .
But critics say Mr Assad 's reception is too much of a reward , when there are still serious question marks over human rights in Syria and its alleged role in the killing of Mr Hariri .
The meetings with Syrian and Lebanese delegates marked the beginning of a weekend of intense diplomatic effort for the French president .
Earlier on Saturday , Mr Sarkozy held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , who will be a key player in the French leader 's plan for a union of Mediterranean states .
Mr Sarkozy is hosting a summit on Sunday to launch the union , which will be attended by 43 leaders of countries in Europe , the Middle East and North Africa .
Only Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is expected to boycott it .
According to our correspondent , critics are dismissing the new union as lacking substance , but French officials say it comes at a significant moment .

What are these ?
No , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has n't been in the habit of wearing an American flag on his lapel .
Yes , he 's got some controversial acquaintances and has made some slipups lately about working Americans who " cling " to religion .
So wo n't it be easy for Republican Sen.
John McCain , Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton - and the media - to keep painting Obama as an ultraliberal elitist who is out of touch with American values and working people ?
In another era - when Baby Boomers were the overwhelmingly dominant generation - maybe so .
But with just two days until Pennsylvania kicks off the final round of primaries , political observers say there 's clear evidence that the election of 2008 represents a new universe - and a new generation - when it comes to White House contests .
And the political phenomenon of Barack Obama is symbolic of the game - changing attitudes and growing influence to be wielded by the upcoming generation of " Millennial " voters - the largest and most diverse generation in American history , born between 1982 and 2003 - who already are helping to shape the race .
Authors Morley Winograd and Michael Hais , who just released " Millennial Makeover : MySpace , YouTube and the Future of American Politics , " a book that examines the seismic generational and cultural realignments at play on the political stage this year , say the political pileups of the past week represent a perfect example of how the 20 - somethings have managed to reshape conventional politics in the current race for the White House .
There was Obama 's brouhaha over the " bitter " comments in San Francisco - fueled by Clinton , McCain and the media - followed by a rough Philadelphia debate in which Clinton got tough and ABC moderators got tougher , peppering him about his recent stumbles and gaffes .
That looked to be a perfect storm that might have swamped a first - time presidential candidate , but it was n't Obama who took the body blows .
Instead , ABC's George Stephanopoulos and Charles Gibson , the journalists , were publicly pummeled for " gotcha games , " and Clinton came away with nary a new superdelegate in her pocket .
Nothing sticking
Meanwhile , Obama literally brushed it all off as the old way of doing things , while both Pennsylvania and national polls appear to suggest that none of it has stuck to him .
Indeed , he looks even stronger , said Winograd , a former senior adviser to Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration .
Twenty - somethings " are driving the presidential race in a huge way , " said Annemarie Stephens , an organizer for the youth - oriented " Nation for Change " rally to celebrate Obama 's campaign today at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Oakland .
The event , which will star gospel , hip - hop and ethnic musicians - like similar rallies planned in nearly all 50 states today - has been put together almost entirely on the Internet , she said .
" People are concerned about the well - being of this country , " she said .
" It 's no longer politics as usual ; we 're not going to stand for the pettiness . "
Jordan D'Amato , 20 , a political science major at UC Berkeley and one of the " Millennial Generation , " says coming of age in an era of the two - term presidency of George W. Bush has had a clear impact on his political outlook .
" I think the country is headed in the wrong direction , and there have been monumental failures , like the war in Iraq , " the health care system and the economy , he said .
Obama , he said , has " run a very successful campaign so far , proposing a message of hope " to address those issues .
" So when he makes a slipup , and people point out his relationship to Jeremiah Wright , " the senator 's controversial former pastor , " you say , ' Yes , he has faults . ' " But , D'Amato said , Obama is n't influenced by pundits and politicians " trying to pick him apart . "
The apparent inability of Clinton and McCain to influence voters like D'Amato and blunt Obama 's trajectory underscores the different world and political view of the " Millennial Generation , " which some have suggested looks increasingly like the " Obamanation . "
Unlike their Boomer parents - those millions of 50 - and 60 - something activists born of protest and conflict who accept politics as a blood sport - the younger generation has come of age in an era of burgeoning new technologies providing tangible evidence of the promise of change .
" Unlike the conservative Gen - Xers who preceded them , or the harshly divided Baby Boomer Generation , the Millennials are united across gender and race in their desire to find win-win solutions to America 's problems , " Winograd and Hais write .
' Sense of urgency '
" My students feel a sense of urgency about the times and the urgency of now , " said James Taylor , an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco .
" They 're not interested in personal attack , and much more interested in the hard issues facing the country .
...
So to talk about his misstatements is off - putting for young people who want hope and their futures to mean something . "
Indeed , said Winograd and Hais , younger voters are increasingly more likely to question - and openly dismiss - the old rules of the " gotcha " politics game .
Practically born networking on social sites like Facebook and MySpace , " their attitude regarding the media is , ' Who anointed them the experts ? ' " said Hais , who is credited with identifying the power of " wired " tech workers in his research as a marketing executive .
" ' I 'd rather pay attention to my friends online , and we 'll decide what we think . ' "
And neither are they wedded to blogosphere slugfests or the talking - head shouting matches that have been the last generation 's hallmarks in political contests , said Hais .
Irreverent influences
Instead they look to figures like Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart , who has jabbed at the kings of conflict ( MSNBC's Chris Matthews and Tucker Carlson ) on his " Daily Show , " and tongue - in - cheek cable commentator Keith Olbermann , who has won their hearts by skewering media self - importance with nightly coronations of " The Worst Person in the World . "
So far , Obama - who has referenced how the " Joshua Generation " holds the promise to make good on the past struggles of the previous " Moses Generation " - has " intuitively appeared to address these generational themes , " Winograd said .
" He 's saying we 've got to heal divisions . "
By contrast , both Clinton and McCain have appeared old - school , " trying to say ( Obama is ) channeling Dukakis , an insensitive elite who does n't understand people 's fears and love of country , " said Winograd , referring to former Massachusetts governor and failed Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis .
That is " an attempt to characterize him in Boomer terms - but it 's not being heard by those who listen to a civic message . "
Not all political observers agree , and some suggest younger voters are a long way from proving their mettle .
" This is a generation far removed from any real troubles in this country ; they 've had every advantage , " said Patrick Dorinson , a veteran GOP strategist in Sacramento .
" They did n't sign up for the draft not knowing if they would be called ; they 've had the greatest prosperity of any generation in history ... look in their bedroom , and there are iPods , video games and cell phones . "
He said that 20 - somethings better recognize that - like it or not - they can't expect McCain , Clinton or any other contender to back off their candidate .
" This generation is going to have to step up and run this country some day , " he said .
" I 'm sorry , politics is tough , tough sport and it should test the mettle of the people we ask to lead us .
" And we need to know that a person who leads this country can take it , " he said .
Get used to it
But Winograd and Hais warn that Baby Boomers , Gen-Xers and political insiders - including candidates - who hope to continue to make a difference in the political universe have one real option : get used to the new guys .
The Millennials ' power , the authors say , has only just begun to be felt .
" By 2008 , almost half of the largest generation in American history will be eligible to vote , making Millennial attitudes and beliefs the key to understanding how much the dynamics of American politics will change before the first decade of the 21st century is over , " they write .
" The campaigns , candidates and events of the rest of this decade will determine which party gains the lifelong allegiance of this new generation - and with it , the dominant advantage in the next civic era of American politics . "
In Pennsylvania : Obama accuses Clinton of " slash and burn " tactics , while she implies that she 's substance , he 's flash .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States plans to shift about $ 230 million in aid to Pakistan from counterterrorism programs to upgrading the nation 's aging F - 16 fighter jets .
" We 've shifted money to help the democratically elected government of Pakistan to fight a common foe , a common enemy that we have , " said Gonzalo Gallegos , a State Department spokesman .
Pakistan is the largest recipient of payments from the Coalition Support Funds , which gives money to 27 partner countries help combat terrorism .
A senior State Department official told CNN " this has been developing for a while . "
The new government is facing " a terrible financial crisis with food and fuel problems , " the official said , and the Pakistani government " would rather tell its public they are spending their money on food and fuel , " so it asked the United States to pay for the F - 16 upgrades from the U.S. aid fund .
Last year , Congress mandated that $ 300 million in aid to Pakistan go toward fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban , partly by beefing up law enforcement and developing tribal areas of the country that are hostile to the United States .
Skeptical lawmakers worry that the F - 16 upgrades will divert funding from crucial counterterrorism programs and could be more about helping Pakistan competing with its rival , India , than fighting terror .
Nita Lowey , chairwoman of a House subcommittee on foreign operations , said the request from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to reprogram the funding " raises serious concerns . "
Lowey is asking for more information before signing off on the change .
" Congress provided these funds specifically for counterterrorism and law enforcement activities , " Lowey said in a written statement .
" It is incumbent on the State Department and Pakistan to demonstrate clearly how these F - 16s would be used to fight al Qaeda and the Taliban in order to get congressional support . "
It is not the first time U.S. aid to Pakistan has come under scrutiny .
In June , the Government Accountability Office and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs released a report that said the United States has not accurately tracked about $ 6 billion it gave to help the Pakistani government fight terrorism since 2001 .
The country , which the Department of Defense considers a key ally in the war on terrorism because of its proximity to large swaths of ungoverned tribal land , has received $ 5.56 billion of $ 6.88 billion given out since the September 11 terrorist attacks .
U.S. and Pakistani officials claim that the F - 16s are used to fly missions over regions near Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan , where the Taliban are operating and al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding .
The upgrades , which will bring the old fleet in line with new F - 16s Pakistan recently purchased from the United States , will allow Pakistan 's F - 16 fleet to operate day and night missions and " effectively employ ground operations , " Gallegos said .
The funds will be diverted from upgrades on other airplanes used for fighting terrorism , Gallegos said .

Under the fold , a few short videos apropos of the problems we face : Bill Moyers on PBS provocatively talking big oil last night , Kunstler talking the long emergency on CBC , Jeff Rubin on CNBC talking $ 7 gas , VMT , light rail , and other things , and then finally Olbermann and Krugman talking both US presidential candidates ' " energy policy . "
Include other links in the comments .
A good many videos this week .
First , wanna learn about exponential growth ?
Here 's a short video entitled " Are Humans Smarter than Yeast ? " ( mentions Bob Shaw even !-- basically an 8 min version of Al Bartlett 's hour talk over at GPM on exponential growth )
Perhaps a smidge rudimentary for this crowd , but pay special attention to the three points around 5:45 into the video .
Kunstler on CBC talking the long emergency , suburbia , and life without cheap oil ... ( 8 mins )
Here 's a provocative Bill Moyers essay on big oil that is not for the faint of heart , which aired last night on PBS .
( http://www.pbs.org/billmoyers; 6 mins ) .
" America has become little more than an energy protection force , doing anything to gain access to expensive fuel without regard for the lives of others or the earth itself . "
I wonder why that is , perhaps because the easy energy is getting harder to get ?
Hmmm ...
Jeff Rubin of CIBC predicts $ 7 gasoline on CNBC with Erin Burnett , which he says would take 10 million cars off the road .
They talk about a lot of the variables and different ideas involved in the situation - - it 's really good ( 4 mins ) .
Krugman with Olbermann on " The Energy Question of 2008 " ( critical of McCain and Obama both ) from MSNBC's Countdown ... ( 7 mins )
Nov. 21 , 2008  --
Change does n't have to wait until January .
Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , is gone .
( A sign of a new day . )
Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich. , is gone , partly , too .
( A sign of a new order . )
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , is n't going anywhere .
( But she 's gone quite a distance to get there . )
Penny Pritzker leaves before she ever even arrives .
And the auto bailout came back to life after it was declared dead , only to die again .
( It may yet rise again -- though not until next month . )
As for President - elect Barack Obama -- he is , for the most part , waiting for January .
Thus far through the transition , we 're learning that Obama remains , at his core , a cautious and patient politician -- one who can be quite stingy with his political capital .
Meanwhile , the stock market is in freefall , Detroit is near collapse , and Congress is in a stalemate .
Obama has had nearly half of his Cabinet filled for him , without a single formal announcement .
( If you 're scoring at home , he 's now had more haircuts than press conferences as president - elect . )
Other than a few comments , Obama has chosen not to play in the current crisis : " With the stock market plunging and the credit market entering a new freeze , cries are being heard for a new government intervention to prop up major financial institutions before President - elect Barack Obama takes office , " Floyd Norris writes in The New York Times .
" By resigning from the Senate before the current session began and allowing it to appear that a sense of drift could prevail until he is inaugurated , Mr. Obama may have missed an opportunity to exert leadership . "
" How much can go wrong in the two months before Mr. Obama takes the oath of office ?
The answer , unfortunately , is : a lot , " Paul Krugman writes in his column .
" At minimum , the next two months will inflict serious pain on hundreds of thousands of Americans , who will lose their jobs , their homes , or both .
What 's really troubling , however , is the possibility that some of the damage being done right now will be irreversible . "
" The problem is that nothing of significance can or will happen until the new President takes office in January , even though there is -- finally -- a great appetite for action in Washington .
This is going to be a very frustrating few months , " Time 's Joe Klein writes .
Things get more dire by the day : " As the economic signs grow ever more grim , the opportunities for the Obama administration to drive through its agenda actually are getting better , " The Wall Street Journal 's Gerald F. Seib writes .
" The thing about a crisis -- and crisis does n't seem too strong a word for the economic mess right now -- is that it creates a sense of urgency .
Actions that once appeared optional suddenly seem essential . "
Not that the news is waiting for Obama .
The word is out ( this time , because the Obama folks want it out ) : Sen.
Clinton is " on track " to be installed as secretary of state .
" Former President Bill Clinton 's financial disclosure issues that once seemed an obstacle to Sen .
Hillary Clinton 's appointment as secretary of state have been worked out , " ABC 's Jake Tapper reports .
" An aide to President - elect Obama says that everything is on track for Clinton 's nomination to be the nation 's top diplomat , though an announcement will not come until after Thanksgiving . "
Who 's pressuring whom now ?
" One week after the former primary rivals met secretly to discuss the idea of Clinton becoming the nation 's top diplomat , an Obama adviser said Thursday that the two sides were moving quickly toward making it a reality , barring any unforeseen problems , " per the AP 's Nedra Pickler .
" The senior adviser , speaking on condition of anonymity because the president - elect is not prepared to officially announce the nomination , said Obama believes Clinton would bring instant stature and credibility to U.S. diplomatic relations . "
And yet -- your drama : " One friend said Mrs. Clinton decided late Wednesday to say no , reasoning that she would have more freedom in the Senate .
By midday Thursday , the friend said , she was ' back in the indecisive column again . '
By the end of the day , another associate said she could accept by Friday , " Peter Baker and Helene Cooper write in The New York Times .
" At the end of a confused day in which even Mr. Obama 's advisers seemed unsure what was happening , a transition official reached out to reporters Thursday night to say that the president - elect 's team believed things were on track with Mrs. Clinton and that her nomination could be announced after Thanksgiving , " they write .
" Driving her consideration , friends said , is a sense of disenchantment with the Senate , where despite her stature she remains low in the ranks of seniority that governs the body , " Baker and Cooper write .
" The harder truth is that Clinton 's options as a Senator are limited , at least in the immediate future .
In that chamber , she is just one of many presidential also - rans and a relatively junior member of an institution where power and advancement require seniority , " Time 's Karen Tumulty and Massimo Calabresi report .
" And if there 's anything a First Lady who became a Senator would understand , it 's that opportunities do n't always come to those who wait for them . "
Making her wait ?
" Advisers to Bill and Hillary Clinton believe they 've given the Obama transition team much if not all of the all the information on Bill 's post - presidency the Obama team will be asking for , and see the Clinton camp as now being in a holding pattern , waiting on a formal offer of the State Department gig to Hillary from Obama , " Greg Sargent reports at Talking Points Memo .
Ah -- the dance : " Clinton in the last few days began aggressively pursuing the secretary of state slot and mounted an all - out sales campaign amid fears the job might be slipping away , sources said , " Ken Bazinet writes in the New York Daily News .
" Former Clinton campaign aides and some of her inner-circle advisers -- aka Hillaryland -- were part of a coordinated effort to win her the top State Department post , the Clinton source confirmed . "
How does this factor in ?
" Hillary Clinton continues to carry $ 7.5 million of debt owed to vendors from her failed presidential bid , " ABC 's Tahman Bradley reports .
" If Clinton accepts the position of Secretary of State , or some other post in the Obama administration , she would be barred by The Hatch Act of 1939 from soliciting and receiving political contributions . "
" Of the $ 7.5 million owed to vendors , nearly $ 5.4 million was to her former adviser and pollster , Mark Penn .
Clinton owed vendors a high of $ 12 million at the end of June , " per the AP write - up .
The rest of Obama 's national - security team is taking place : " Democratic sources tell ABC News that President - elect Obama appears to be turning to two retired four - stars for his National Security Adviser and his Director of National Intelligence , " ABC's Jake Tapper and Martha Raddatz report .
" Marine Gen. James L. Jones ( Ret. ) , the former head of NATO and U.S. forces in Europe , has emerged as the leading candidate to serve as the National Security Adviser for President - elect Obama , " they report .
" Admiral Dennis C. Blair ( Ret. ) , former Commander - in - Chief of U.S. Pacific Command and a 6th - generation naval officer , has emerged as the top candidate to be President - elect Obama 's Director of National Intelligence .
He recently met in Chicago with the president - elect . "
At Public Strategies , Inc. , Dick Keil rounds up some names : Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack for Agriculture , former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus for Education , and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , very much in the mix at EPA .
" If Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , is selected to head the Environmental Protection Agency , as informed Democrats say is likely , corporations will have more work to do complying with new environmental laws and executive orders promulgated by the Obama administration , " he writes .
Pritzker is out , after ( briefly ) being in at Commerce : " The same business holdings and connections that made Ms. Pritzker so vital to Mr. Obama 's ability to raise campaign money also came under sharp scrutiny .
On Thursday , she released a statement declaring that she would not be a candidate for the job , " Charlie Savage writes in The New York Times .
( And the rest of the story explains why vetting was n't necessary to take her out of consideration . )
" Nomination for a Cabinet post would impose significant scrutiny and financial disclosure requirements upon a powerful businesswoman who oversees a portion of her family 's giant financial empire , which includes the Hyatt Hotel chain but also ranges from construction equipment to a credit data company , " The Chicago Tribune 's Mike Dorning reports .
" Although the Pritzkers are prominent philanthropists in Chicago , the family is famously publicity - shy about its business dealings . "
At this point , it 's worth remembering that not a single one of the people mentioned thus far has been formally confirmed to have been offered anything by the president - elect himself .
On cue , from the Obama - Biden transition team : " Today , President - elect Barack Obama will hold private meetings in Chicago .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden will be in Delaware .
There are no public events scheduled . "
The illusion of control , or actual control ?
" Top aides to the president - elect had hoped to take a methodical approach to selecting and unveiling their new team , starting with the announcements of top national security and economic players shortly after Thanksgiving , " Shailagh Murray and Chris Cillizza write in The Washington Post .
" But leaks and rumors have disrupted that plan , suggesting that the ' no - drama Obama ' mantra famously repeated by his staff may not be as operational in Washington as it was at campaign headquarters in Chicago . "
His army is , just maybe , getting restless : " Now what ?
That 's the question for millions of volunteers who worked to elect Barack Obama -- and for the organization that mobilized them , " USA Today 's Martha T. Moore reports .
" Keeping Obama supporters engaged and active through the Obama transition website change.gov is ' our first priority , ' transition spokesperson Jen Psaki says . "
" Electoral campaigns , like circus tents , quickly disappear after the show is over .
But Obama is our first community - organizer president , and he sees the way he got elected as being almost as crucial as the fact that he won , " E.J. Dionne Jr. writes in his column .
" Because of the emphasis he put on organizing , barackobama.com might fairly be seen as the most successful high - tech startup of the past two years . "
Learning lessons from the Clinton years : " President - elect Barack Obama will not move for months , and perhaps not until 2010 , to ask Congress to end the military 's decades - old ban on open homosexuals in the ranks , two people who have advised the Obama transition team on this issue say , " Rowan Scarborough reports in the Washington Times .
We can't say where this ranks -- but when it comes to the auto bailout , good luck following the action :
" With a whirlwind set of press conferences , supposed deals , nixed deals and frustration over whether to bail out the auto industry with $ 25 billion in low - interest loans or take the chance of letting it go bust , the Congress 's lame duck session keeps getting longer and longer , " per ABC's Z. Byron Wolf .
Congress will be back Dec. 8 to deal with it -- but only if the automakers present a plan worth dealing with .
" Faced with the choice of bailing out the ailing auto industry or letting it fail , Congress picked a brave third option : procrastination , " Time 's Jay Newton - Small writes .
" The Big Three are on their own for now , " The Wall Street Journal 's Greg Hitt , John D. Stoll and Alex P. Kellogg report .
" Congressional efforts to rescue Detroit 's auto makers collapsed Thursday , with lawmakers saying the industry lacked credible plans to return to profitability . "
" Until they show us the plan , we cannot show them the money , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
What was going on behind closed doors ?
" For 90 minutes , it looked as if a last - minute deal had been struck to quickly pass $ 25 billion in aid to automakers .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , may have put the brakes on efforts by a group of auto - state senators to hold a vote Thursday on a compromise $ 25 billion auto bailout , " Gordon Trowbridge and David Shepardson report in the Detroit News .
" Instead , congressional leaders demanded a plan from Detroit 's automakers by Dec. 2 on how they would use the money , and said they could return to session the week of Dec. 8 if they were satisfied with the plan . "
Welcome to Nancy Pelosi's House : " Rep. Henry Waxman 's ( D - Calif. ) defeat of Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) for the Energy and Commerce Committee gavel represents a huge shift in the way the Democratic Caucus runs itself , and in the broader culture that has developed over decades around a few hard and fast rules governing the distribution of power on Capitol Hill , " The Washington Post 's Ben Pershing reports .
" The next time a chairman decides to use his committee to advance the interests of his district while ignoring the interests of most of his colleagues , he might think twice , " Pershing writes .
" Lest anyone doubted who was in charge of House Democrats , today 's vote provided a helpful reminder . "
Dingell lost his gavel on the same day that Sen .
Ted Stevens gave his last Senate speech : " Age and seniority gave way in Congress on Thursday , a transformational shift for an institution where tremendous power has traditionally been built on sheer longevity , accumulated and savored with the passage of years , " Carl Hulse writes in The New York Times .
" It was not only Mr. Stevens , an Alaska Republican , and Mr. Dingell , a Michigan Democrat , who found themselves treated like old bulls put out to pasture .
Senator Robert C. Byrd , a West Virginia Democrat who turned 91 on Thursday and has amassed 56 years in Congress , had already voluntarily relinquished the chairmanship of his beloved Appropriations Committee before his colleagues could ease him out , " Hulse writes .
" The abrupt change in status for the three lawmakers sent this fact swirling around Capitol Hill : their combined age of 258 exceeds the age of the United States itself . "
" My motto has been here :
To hell with politics , just do what is right for Alaska , " Stevens said in his final floor speech .
As for policy : " Mr. Waxman 's victory ensures that the committee will move in a more liberal direction , especially on energy and climate change , " The Wall Street Journal 's Naftali Bendavid and Stephen Power report .
" The California Democrat 's ascent caused immediate consternation in the already - reeling automobile and coal industries . "
Waxman 's win " will put him at the center of efforts to advance President - elect Barack Obama 's proposals to curb global warming , develop alternative fuels and expand health insurance coverage , " Janet Hook and Richard Simon write for the Los Angeles Times .
" Dingell 's loss is a blow to the U.S. auto industry at a time when it says it needs additional federal help to avoid collapse .
Some business interests worry that Waxman will steer the committee sharply to the left . "
" Well , this was clearly a change year , " Dingell said after his defeat .
Obama is pushing for a bit more change : " The elections are n't over , " Obama says in a radio ad cut for the Georgia Senate run- off .
" I want to urge you to turn out one more time and help elect Jim Martin to the United States Senate . "
But not so much change : Can anyone explain why Joe Biden is still a United States senator from Delaware ?
( We 're only accepting explanations that are not related to efforts to wire things so that Biden can choose his own long - term successor . )
" The Obama - Biden transition office refuses to explain or elaborate on why Biden feels it is appropriate to continue to serve in the Senate , " per ABC News .
" The lack of resolution has stoked speculation in Delaware and beyond that the only reason Joe Biden is still in office has everything to do with Beau Biden . "
The latest on Attorney General Michael Mukasey : " Attorney General Michael Mukasey is ' conscious , conversant and alert ' after collapsing during a speech in Washington Thursday evening , according to a Justice Department spokesman , " per ABC's Pierre Thomas , Jan Crawford Greenburg , and Jason Ryan .
" But there is still no word on exactly why Mukasey fell ill , " they write .
" Mukasey , 67 , had been delivering remarks on combating international terrorism to the Federalist Society 's annual meeting at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel .
A lawyer in the room said Mukasey ' started struggling with [ his ] speech , slurring ' just before he collapsed . "
ABC 's John Hendren : " Just before 7 am , President Bush spoke to Attorney General Mukasey .
The AG sounded well and is getting excellent care . "
One last trip for the current president : " President Bush departs Friday for his final scheduled foreign trip as commander in chief -- a three - day jaunt to an economic summit in Peru -- where he will continue to defend free - market capitalism and meet with an increasingly antagonistic Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , " Jon Ward writes in the Washington Times .
Whither the GOP ?
National Journal 's Ron Brownstein : " As George W. Bush 's presidency winds down , the Republican Party 's greatest problem is that it does n't appear to be reaching much of anybody who is n't already watching Fox News .
Bush leaves behind a party that looks less like a coalition than a clubhouse . "
Must - see video : Sarah Palin and the turkey .
( Turkey is pictured at right . )
In Minnesota -- narrowing by the day : " With about 46 percent of the 2.9 million ballots counted by Thursday evening , the gap between Republican incumbent Norm Coleman and DFL challenger Al Franken continued to close .
Coleman was leading by only 136 votes , a drop from his unofficial lead of 215 that was confirmed Tuesday by the state Canvassing Board , " Kevin Duchschere writes in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune .
He 's popular in many , many places : " Iranians appear to be putting as much stock in President - elect Barack Obama 's slogan of ' change ' as Americans voters , seeing his victory as an opening for possible renewed relations between the two countries , which have been cut off for nearly thirty years , " Farah Stockman writes from Tehran , in The Boston Globe .
And its impact can be felt everywhere : " While Barack Obama transitions from Chicago to Washington , his presence will be felt thousands of miles away , where finalists for the 2016 Olympics will put on their best show Friday for Europe 's Olympic voting delegates , " Philip Hersh writes in the Chicago Tribune .
" That means Chicago 's representatives will have their first chance since the election to tout the lakefront , the facilities and Chicago 's summer weather , all leavened with the bid 's connections to the president elect . "
Anyone think early voting has n't changed everything ?
" More Floridians voted for John McCain than Barack Obama on Election Day , but the Democrat sealed his victory in the state by winning more early and absentee votes , " the AP 's Jennifer Kay reports .
Friday night on ABC's " 20/20 " : Ashley Dupre sits down with Diane Sawyer .
" If it was n't me , it would have been someone else , " Dupre says .
" I was doing my job .
I do n't feel that I brought him down . "
The Kicker :
" I saw Frank Luntz , who is a moron -- I want to make sure this is clearly on the record -- he was talking to Republican governors , making fun of John for not being able to use a BlackBerry .
The man can't do it because he is much more disabled than people can imagine .
. . .
I would like to take a hammer and start breaking bones in Frank 's arms . " -- McCain pollster Bill McInturff , threatening pollster - on - pollster violence .
" As we round the curb and pull up to exit the cab , I look up , and there is your name .
And I said , ' Oh , my , Ted 's got an airport . ' " -- Sen. Larry Craig , R - Idaho , in tribute to Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska .
( Craig has a more humble claim to airport fame . )

A look at what happens when you disable the session in your Rails application controller and want to enable it elsewhere .
Also , what happens when you disable sessions , but forget to disable forgery protection ?
Rails Gotcha # 9 .
Though he celebrated his 79th birthday last month , Dr. Wilson is generating a storm of literary output that would be impressive for someone half his age .
“ The Superorganism , ” with Bert Hölldobler , a new book with information on termites , wasps , bees and ants , will be published in November .
Dr. Wilson is at work on his first novel .
He is preparing a treatise on the forces of social evolution , which seems likely to apply to people the lessons evident in ant colonies .
And he is engaged in another fight .
Image FIRST LOVE Edward O. Wilson studies the genetics of ant colonies .
Credit ... Rick Friedman for The New York Times
Beneath his gentle manner and Southern charm , Dr. Wilson is a scrapper .
He grew up in Alabama and Florida , where the local custom with respect to fistfights was that one could prevail or get knocked out , with no third option .
“ I never picked a fight , ” he wrote in “ Naturalist , ” his autobiography .
“ But once started I never quit , even when losing , until the other boy gave up or an adult mercifully pulled us apart . ”
Dr. Wilson was not picking a fight when he published “ Sociobiology ” in 1975 , a synthesis of ideas about the evolution of social behavior .
He asserted that many human behaviors had a genetic basis , an idea then disputed by many social scientists and by Marxists intent on remaking humanity .
Dr. Wilson was amazed at what ensued , which he describes as a long campaign of verbal assault and harassment with a distinctly Marxist flavor led by two Harvard colleagues , Richard C. Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould .
The new fight is one Dr. Wilson has picked .
It concerns a central feature of evolution , one with considerable bearing on human social behaviors .
The issue is the level at which evolution operates .
Many evolutionary biologists have been persuaded , by works like “ The Selfish Gene ” by Richard Dawkins , that the gene is the only level at which natural selection acts .
Dr. Wilson , changing his mind because of new data about the genetics of ant colonies , now believes that natural selection operates at many levels , including at the level of a social group .
It is through multilevel or group - level selection — favoring the survival of one group of organisms over another — that evolution has in Dr. Wilson ’s view brought into being the many essential genes that benefit the group at the individual ’s expense .
In humans , these may include genes that underlie generosity , moral constraints , even religious behavior .
Such traits are difficult to account for , though not impossible , on the view that natural selection favors only behaviors that help the individual to survive and leave more children .
There is n't much love lost between Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News Channel and the New York Times .
So , not surprising that Fox News morning hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade did n't much like Times TV reporter Jacques Steinberg 's story over the weekend on Fox News ' ratings : " Fox News Finds Its Rivals Closing In . "
So what did they do ?
Well , they had a little fun with Steinberg and TV editor Steve Reddicliffe , during " Fox and Friends " this morning .
The poodle photoshop is clearly parody , but look how Steinberg and Reddicliffe 's head shots come out on Fox 's air -- yellowed teeth , exaggerated features , and in Steve 's case , less hair .
Full segment from this morning 's " Fox & Friends " below :

MEDELLIN , Colombia ( Reuters ) - Venezuela on Tuesday accused the United States of trying to spread violence in the Andean region after a U.S. official said left - wing Colombian rebels were hiding in Venezuelan territory .
Colombia and the United States have long said Venezuela is not doing enough to combat Marxist FARC fighters waging Latin America ’s longest insurgency .
The rebels are also deeply involved in drug trafficking .
Deputy U.S. Secretary of State John Negroponte on Monday urged Venezuela to crack down on rebels hiding on its side of the border .
Venezuela ’s left - wing government , which has voiced solidarity with the rebels ’ goals , called Negroponte ’s statement “ irresponsible and abusive . ”
“ There is a campaign under way and we want to denounce it , ” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro told reporters .
“ The government of the United States is directly responsible for this campaign , which is intended to fill our region with violence . ”
Maduro , speaking at a meeting of the Organization of American States in Medellin , Colombia , said Venezuela has not offered sanctuary to rebels who have been fighting the Colombian state for four decades .
Colombia , which has received $ 5.5 billion in mostly military aid from the United States over the last seven years , shares a 1,390 - mile ( 2,237 - km ) border with Venezuela .
Tensions between the neighboring countries increased after a Colombian military raid into Ecuador in March which killed a top rebel commander , Raul Reyes .
Colombian and U.S. officials say files and e-mails found on Reyes ’ computer indicate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Ecuadorean leader Rafael Correa provided financial support to the rebels .
Both deny the charges and called the Colombian military raid a U.S. - backed violation of Ecuador ’s sovereignty .
“ The e-mails raise serious questions about Venezuela ’s relationship with the Colombian guerrillas that deserve serious answers , ” said New York - based Human Rights Watch in a statement sent to reporters .
“ At the very least , they appear to show that guerrilla commanders who were engaged in horrendous abuses believed they had the backing of the Venezuelan government , ” it said .
Colombia is Washington ’s closest ally in South America while Correa and Chavez are fierce critics of U.S. policy .
Colombia ’s war often spills over into neighboring countries .
In an electric car , the ( enormous ) battery is a major part of the price .
If electric car prices are decreasing , battery costs must be decreasing , because it's not like the cost of fabricating rubber , aluminum , glass , and steel into car shapes can decline that much , right ?
On an electric scooter , though , the effect of battery price has to be even more dramatic because scooters are such lightweight , compact , and simple machines .
They are n't much more than a battery and an electric motor to begin with .
Remember the the Zappy electric scooter from twenty years ago ?
What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that killed the electric car of year 2000 : terrible lead - acid battery technology .
It 's too heavy , it lacks power , it does n't have enough range , it takes too long to charge .
These are all different ways of saying the same thing : the battery sucks .
It was n't until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter — and pretty much electric everything , if you think about it — became viable .
Thus , one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years .
Let 's consider one of the most popular models , the Xiaomi Mi M365 :
This graph only shows roughly two years , from January 2018 to now ; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $ 800 .
So the price of a popular , common electric scooter has halved in three years .
Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types !
This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period , in the form of Bird , Lime , Skip , Spin , Scoot , etc .
Early versions of Bird scooters were actual Xiaomi M365s , slightly modified for rental .
Only by late 2018 had they migrated to custom built , ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market .
The rental industries have their own challenges , and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute .
Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months .
In early March , the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles , which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters .
It moved repairs in - house ( though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers ) .
Later that month , the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets , in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism .
In April , it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona , in which users could pay $ 25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride .
But this is n't meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models .
I want to tackle a more fundamental question : are electric scooters the future of transportation ?
Even Uber , as screwed up of a company as they still are , knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs :
Uber believes their current micro fleet of ebikes and scooters can displace trips under 3 miles .
46 % of Uber 's rides are under 3 miles 👀 pic.twitter.com/OFmb8arZ3 j — Micromobility Industries ( @MicromobilityCo ) April 12 , 2019
We have plenty of scooters here at my house , and the family and I enjoy them greatly , but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter .
So I bought one .
It is of course the popular , inexpensive , and well reviewed Xiaomi Mi M365 .
Here 's a picture of my electric scooter inside my electric car .
( I apologize that I did n't have an electric bicycle to park next to it for maximum smugness , but you can bet your sweet electrons I 'll work on that next ! )
The short version of my review is this electric scooter is incredibly fun , works great , and if you can get it for a price around $ 300 , practically a no -brainer .
I love it , my kids love it , and as long as you 're conceptually OK with the look , unlike Elon Musk 🛴💨 then you 'll probably love it too .
I found a neat video covering the " one year later " experience of owning the scooter , and what you might eventually run into or want to tweak .
( The main thing to take away from this video is that flats super suck on tires this small , so be warned .
I put Slime in my Mi's tires out of an abundance of caution , but you could also go with solid tubeless tires – at the cost of some ride comfort – if you 're really worried . )
That 's not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect .
There are some challenges with electric scooters , starting with the biggest one : your local government has no idea how to regulate the darn things .
Is this regulated like a bicycle ?
If not , why not ?
Are they allowed on the sidewalk ?
Do you have to ride them in the road , with cars … uh , depending on the speed limit ?
Do you need a driver 's license ?
Do you need a helmet ?
Are you even allowed to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property ?
The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live , and with no consistency or apparent logic .
Here are the current electric scooter laws in California , for what it 's worth , which require the rider to have a valid driver 's license ( unlike electric bicycles ) and also disallow them from sidewalks , both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions .
One aspect of those laws I definitely agree with , however , is the 15 mile per hour speed restriction .
That 's a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment .
Anything faster starts to get decidedly … uncomfortable .
Consider this monster of a 1165 KWh electric scooter , with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to forty freakin ' miles per hour .
That … is … terrifying .
Even the reviewer , in full motorcycle safety gear , was n't willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH .
And I do n't blame him !
But now that I 've shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365 , hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles .
If you want a luxury electric scooter , an ultralight electric scooter , a rugged offroad electric scooter … all things are possible , for a price .
Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor , the Xiaomi M365 Pro , was recently released , although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment .
Having ridden my M365 a fair bit , I can confirm all the Pro improvements are welcome , if incremental : bigger battery and disc brake , more power , better display , improved latch mechanism , etc .
None of those Pro improvements , however , are worth a 2 × increase in price so I 'd recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value proposition is off the charts .
Did I mention there 's a bluetooth connection , and an app , and it is possible to hack the M365 firmware ?
Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital , is n't it ?
Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit :
Please be respectful around pedestrians .
Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all , but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I ’ve seen before when using regular kick scooters ( or skateboards ) on the sidewalk , which did surprise me .
An electric scooter has more heft to it , both physically at 26 pounds , and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach – but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it .
I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians , and if there is a bike lane available , I 'd definitely recommend using that .
Hills work great .
The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills , and I 'm pleased to report that even with a cough sizable adult such as myself riding , I was able to sustain a respectable above - walking speed on most reasonable hills .
Where I looked at a hill and thought " this probably should work " , it did .
That 's impressive , considering this is n't the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor .
On flats and downhills the performance is superb , as you 'd expect .
That said , if you are a really big or tall adult , or live in a particularly hilly area , wait for the Pro model or an equivalent .
Portability is good , but borderline .
At ~ 26 pounds , the electric scooter is reasonably portable , but it's not something you a ) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b ) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time .
It 's not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter , but that 's a high bar .
You 'll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks , which turned out to be … more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires , disc brakes , and the engine in the front wheel .
They need more obvious locking points on the chassis .
To be honest with you I 'm still bitter about the whole Segway debacle .
There was so much hype back in the day .
That ridiculous thing was supposed to change the world .
Instead , we got … Paul Blart Mall Cop .
A Segway was $ 5,000 at launch in 2001 , which is a whopping $ 7,248 in inflation adjusted dollars .
Here in 2019 , cheap $ 200 to $ 300 electric scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was supposed to be , are n't they ?
Are electric scooters the future of ( most ) transportation ?
I 'm not sure , but I do like where we 're headed , even if it took us twenty years to get there .
Christians  the ancient self - designated heirs to the Jews  commemorate Christ ’s tormented way to resurrection and redemption in the weeks leading to Easter .
Zionists  the modern self - designated heirs to the Jews  have their Lent after Passover , commemorating what they construct as their via dolorosa leading to the “ Jewish State . "
In the weeks following Pesach the country indulges in a nationalistic orgy , hardly imaginable in any other modern state , reminiscent of a primitive tribe .
If you want to understand how a whole nation is led to defy its own interests , to follow a corrupt , de facto military leadership wasting the nation ’s fortune and blood on unnecessary wars and immoral occupation for decades , pay a visit to Israel shortly after Pesach .
A couple of decades ago , it all started with the Holocaust Remembrance Day , about a week after Passover ( all Israeli public holidays follow the Jewish calendar , which is otherwise used only for religious purposes ) .
This is no longer the case : the weeks before that are an ever more popular time for Jewish pilgrimage to Poland , where Israeli teenagers , a year or two before their military service , are taken to a series of concentration camps , destroyed Jewish communities , and other sites of memory .
These journeys  at least eight days long  earn the blessing of the state and are regulated by the Ministry of Education : an official goal is “ to boost national feelings . "
The ministry also demands that all the young pilgrims , even the secular ones , consume only kosher food flown from Israel and served soaked and lukewarm in Polish hostels .
Parents , however , have to pay the entire costs themselves , about $ 1,500 per child , which makes it a privilege of the middle class and above .
This makes sense , of course .
The middle class has to be persuaded ideologically ; the obedience of the poor is secured by more violent means .
I happened to be at the airport when a group returned from such a journey last April : scores of their schoolmates were taken to the terminal to greet them , drumming , dancing , and yelling “ the People of Israel live . "
One had the impression they were welcoming a group of Holocaust survivors .
The real Holocaust survivors , by the way , do not earn that much attention , nor public investment : out of 80,000 survivors still alive in Israel , one third live in poverty .
Some of those elderly people even emigrate back to Germany , where financial aid to survivors is much more generous  a march of the living .
The Hajj
The climax is the March of the Living , also called the March of Remembrance and Hope : the dire past stands for Remembrance whereas Israel , ironically , stands for Hope .
It has a double highlight , in Auschwitz at the Holocaust Remembrance Day , and then in Israel at Independence Day .
The person behind the concept is Avraham Hirschson , a politician who reached the position of minister of finance and is now facing an indictment with a string of crimes including breach of trust , aggravated fraud , theft , forgery of corporate documents , and money laundering .
This year , the key speaker in the March of the Living was Israel ’s chief of staff , who used the opportunity to once again , at Auschwitz , incite violence against Iran with an idiotic analogy to Nazi Germany .
The millions massacred there remained silent in spite of this demagogic abuse of their suffering .
It ’s amazing how the Israeli army managed to turn itself into a dominant player  perhaps the most dominant player  not only in Israel ’s politics , education , and economy , but even in the memory of the Holocaust , which had nothing whatsoever do to with a military force created on another continent three years after it was over .
The March of the Living then proceeds to Israel , where it ends a week later at the Siamese twins : Memorial Day ( for fallen soldiers ) and Independence Day , successively .
The ideological messages are built in : the alternative to Auschwitz is to live and die ( and kill ) for Israel .
“ They ” wanted to kill us in Auschwitz just as “ they ” want to kill us in Israel ; “ they , " the goyim ( gentiles ) , hate us everywhere , and we are always innocent victims .
Arabs and Nazis are all the same .
It ’s not the occupation , not Israel ’s refusal to make peace , not even a particular political setting that can be rationally analyzed : it ’s eternal , unchanging anti-Semitism .
It ’s live or let live .
Doubting Israel ’s righteousness is like doubting the Holocaust .
Criticizing Israel is supporting the Nazis .
Much like the hate - mail I get .
The Streets of Tel Aviv
On the evening of Holocaust Remembrance Day , and again on Memorial Day a week later , the streets of Tel Aviv look as if they ’re under curfew .
From dusk to dawn , not a single shop is open .
This law is enforced and respected throughout the country .
In the very Tel Aviv where so many shops are open on Saturday ( in spite of the law ) , where supermarkets are proud of serving customers on a 24/ 7 basis , where just two weeks earlier , during Passover , bread ( which the law forbids to be displayed publicly ) is baked , displayed , sold , and eaten everywhere , you wo n’t find a single kiosk open on these state holidays .
Religion is a fossilized , backward pastime for medieval Jerusalemites ; we in Tel Aviv are modern , Western , and secular  until it comes to nationalism , where no ultra - orthodox can beat our devotion .
Furthermore , it ’s our pastime to rebuke the ultra - orthodox who refuse to stand still during the two - minute siren heard all over the country , like a muezzin calling for prayer .
A columnist of ultra-orthodox background who cautiously dared to cast doubts about this tribal custom in Ha’aretz lured almost 500 responses , more than the other four daily columns combined , most of them furious .
And you wo n’t find the column in the English edition .
There ’s hardly a house without a flag ; most cars have one or two as well .
Hundreds of thousands of flags are attached to the weekend ’s newspapers  thanks to a certain bank that uses it to advertise .
A friend of mine who does not put a flag on her balcony finds one , year after year , pushed there by her patriotic neighbors ’ balcony ; after all , a flagless flat gives a bad reputation to the whole building .
The nylon flags will stay there for weeks after the orgy ends , as a shabby reminder .
Display of Hubris
The public ceremonies are aired live on all public TV channels ; the only difference is the angle of the camera .
For more than two weeks , there ’s little else in the media than pure indoctrination : Holocaust , war stories , the glory of the state .
A march of politicians on screen , airing empty slogans about Israel ’s “ uniqueness . "
What else can they offer us ?
As I am writing this column , military jets are flying above my head for the Independence Day airborne display .
It ’s the army again then , you never get enough of it .
The noise is unbearable , and there ’s no escape .
I cannot help thinking of the people in Gaza , who are regularly exposed to much more deafening noises by the same jets .
The airborne display has just ended ; a paratrooper mistakenly parachuted into the stands where spectators were seated , injuring eight .
In days immersed in artificially produced symbolism , one wonders what this accident stands for .
The fall of Icarus ?

As if sky - high gasoline prices were n't frustrating enough , many owners of thirsty SUVs , pickups and motor homes who use a credit card at the pump are being blocked from getting a full tank .
That 's because many station operators have a $ 75 limit on Visa ( V ) or MasterCard ( MA ) transactions at the pump .
If motorists hit the limit , they must do a second transaction at the pump to finish filling .
Another solution , though inconvenient :
Go see the attendant to have the card swiped inside .
But this information often is not on the pump , and it can be aggravating even if it is , so customers are venting their ire .
" It 's frustrating to them , and they let us know , " says Tom Robinson , president of Rotten Robbie , a 34 - station chain based in Northern California .
" There 's always an adjective associated with the pump , and it 's like ' stupid ' or worse . "
Station owners say they simply are passing through policies of Visa and MasterCard , which wo n't reimburse them more than $ 75 per transaction at the pump if there 's a disputed charge or a fraudulent card is used .
The card issuers say they are n't the bad guys .
" It 's the merchants ' decision to limit purchases , " says Visa spokesman Paul Wilke .
He adds : " Customers always have the option of paying with the card at the cash register " where its policy differs from the pump .
The $ 75 limit " ensures merchants and customers are protected from fraud , " says MasterCard spokesman Tristan Jordan .
Visa and MasterCard have no immediate plans to go higher .
" It 's something we always look at , " Wilke says .
Visa raised its pump limit from $ 50 in April , but $ 75 is n't keeping up with gas prices .
At $ 4 a gallon , $ 75 buys 183/ 4 gallons .
A 2008 Toyota Sequoia SUV's tank holds more than 26 gallons , a Chevy Avalanche sport pickup totes up to 311/ 2 gallons , and a 33 - foot or longer Winnebago Adventurer RV hauls 75 gallons .
" It 's a little hassle because you can't just pump and get on your way , " says Phoenix retiree Fay Iles , who says she and husband Bruce found a station coming back from New Mexico that still had a $ 50 limit .
Tulsa - based QuikTrip , which runs stations across the Midwest , raised its pump limit to $ 100 .
But Vice President Paula Cotten says there are many customers , especially small - business owners , who want more .
Station owners say they do n't like the limits .
If customers reswipe their card to fill up , it forces retailers to pay the card issuers more transaction fees .
If they drive off without a full tank , the station lost revenue .
" Retailers … are frustrated , if not downright angry , " says Jeff Lenard , vice president of the National Association of Convenience Stores .
Customers " come in and scream at the poor guy behind the counter . "

A consumer uses a credit card to pay for gasoline but as prices keep rising the $ 75 limit on charges prevents some from being able to fill up .

DjangoCon 2008
For the past year or so , people have been asking for us to hold a conference all about Django .
Putting together a conference is an imense amount of work , so it took us a while to get the ball rolling .
However , over the past couple of months we 've found a few good volunteers who've taken on the task of planning a " DjangoCon , " and now the dream is a reality !
For the details , I 'll turn this space over to Robert Lofthouse , the conference chair :
I am pleased to announce that DjangoCon will be held on the 6th and 7th of September , 2008 at the Google headquarters in Mountain View .
This will tie in with the 1.0 release of Django , and so we 'll be also having a 1.0 release party on Saturday September 6th .
All the details including a schedule of speakers will be made available when we launch the conference website on Friday .
Space will be limited to about 200 attendees , so we 'll be releasing tickets in batches to give everyone a chance to come to the conference .
Admission will be free , but we 'll be asking for an optional donation to the Django Software Foundation to help cover our costs .
Thanks to everyone who has been helping out , and also thanks to Google for working so hard to get everything done !
I look forward to seeing those that can make it !
It 's going to rock !

Eileen Malay skipped last year 's St. Patrick 's Parade to sweep her kitchen , swap library books and dabble on her computer .
On a lazy March Saturday , she heard a man command : " Kids , get away from the man with the gun . "
Rowdy neighbors often clashed down the street from her Far West Side apartment .
It had n't turned violent before .
She heard gunshots .
She called her grown son and warned him to stay elsewhere that night .
From the back door , she saw a police car .
Malay , 58 , popped in Alfred Hitchcock 's " Gaslight " to wait out the commotion in her rocking chair .
Eight feet away , a window exploded .
Oh my God , she thought , a shotgun blast .
Malay ran into her bedroom and crouched in the closet .
She heard another window explode .
Running low , she reached the kitchen and ducked behind the refrigerator .
She reached for her cell phone to call 911 .
Her kitchen window exploded .
She took the stairs to the basement .
Her skin burned and her mind had fogged .
She was gagging on gas that the police had fired into her apartment .
What Malay did n't know was that her landlord , who she described as a gentle man with a well - tended garden , had shot and wounded his wife and killed his eldest son .
Thach Ros , 62 , a resident of an attached house at 303 Gere Ave. , had barricaded himself with a rifle inside .
She dialed 911 .
An operator put her through to police .
Officers could n't enter the apartment .
They would meet her at the back door .
Rushing upstairs , she grabbed her coat and purse , blew out the incense candles , switched off the television and left .
She has never been back .
Syracuse police used CS gas , a chemical the U.S. military has agreed under international treaty not to use in warfare .
It contaminated everything from her family heirlooms to library books , leaving her homeless with only the clothes on her back .
Her apartment is still unsafe , 16 months after the gassing .
Inside are her life 's possessions , from her father 's World War II photos to her son 's Army papers .
Officers used 12 - gauge shotguns and 40 - milimeter launchers to deploy CS gas into both the Roses ' house and Malay 's attached apartment , according to a police report .
A copy of the report was released by Malay 's lawyer , Frank Gattuso of O'Hara , O'Connell & Ciotoli law firm .
City and police officials have declined to be interviewed .
Malay has never told her story -- until now .
News accounts had focused on a father killing a son and police in riot gear staging a 29 - hour standoff .
Malay is suing the city and police department , accusing them of negligence and violating her constitutional rights by subjecting her to bodily harm from CS gas .
That danger continued after she fled the house .
Running past officers who had their protective shields drawn , Malay heard someone
shout , " Do n't run that way , run towards the van ! "
She saw a police van , ran to it and got in .
She thought of her landlord 's young children , Johnny and Victoria .
" Did you get the kids out ? " she asked .
No answer .
She asked again .
Silence .
Louder : " Did you get the kids out ? "
An officer said yes , except Peter .
He had been shot .
No one knew if he was dead or alive .
Malay remembers someone saying a medical technician should check her .
But another officer said no .
They needed her to diagram the house immediately .
" We need you to help us right now , " the officer told her .
" Would you do that ? "
' What 's wrong with me ? '
Malay had no inkling Thach Ros could be homicidal .
His eldest son , Sophin " Peter " Ros , collected her rent and came with his wife .
They would sit and chat .
" He 's just the nicest man , " Malay said of Peter Ros .
" So , of course , I was going to do whatever I could to help them , you know . "
In the police van , she managed to ignore her burning skin and the metallic taste in her mouth .
She sketched a floor plan .
The Roses had invited her into their home for lunch after her refrigerator broke .
The children showed her vacation photos .
Malay was questioned and remembers being left in a police cruiser for 21/2 hours .
About 9 p.m. , she asked an officer to use the bathroom .
The officer said she was free to go .
No one offered her medical attention or told her to wash off the gas , she said .
Her son picked her up .
Malay had shared the apartment for six months with her son , Jubal , after he was discharged from the Army after two tours in Iraq .
" I feel like I brought the war home to you , " Jubal Malay told her that night .
With no place to go , Eileen Malay slept on her sister 's couch .
She did n't take a shower and crashed in her clothes , not realizing they were contaminated .
She first realized Thach Ros had killed his son , shot his wife and committed suicide while watching TV in her sister 's living room .
The next day , her sister took her clothes shopping .
She had lost everything :
Her first leather coat .
A $ 150 designer purse .
She bought a $ 20 replacement .
Malay asked her Army son and her father , a World War II veteran , about gas exposure .
Her son speculated , if it 's tear gas , it will just wear off .
Her father said she should get back to work .
A day later , she tried to retrieve her car and was told to come back the next day .
Tuesday , she picked up her 2002 Hyundai Accent GS .
She got sicker driving it .
She was having trouble breathing .
Malay called Lt. Joe Cecile and told him someone should get the car .
It was making her sick and nobody should drive it .
Police picked up the car and drove her to the emergency room at St. Joseph 's Hospital Heath Center .
" I did n't know : ' What 's wrong with me ? ' "
Malay recalled .
She told the hospital receptionist she had breathed in tear gas .
The officer said it was CS gas .
The young emergency room doctor did n't know anything about gas exposure .
He looked it up on the Internet , Malay said .
Nurses gave her oxygen .
After six hours , Malay was released with suggestions she drink water and get plenty of rest .
On the way home , the police officer gave her a $ 1,000 check on behalf of the department and apologized for what happened , Malay said .
Police and City Hall officials would not discuss the money .
A week later , Malay followed up with a general practitioner .
A former runner , Malay had n't seen her doctor in about 20 years , her lawyer said .
On top of her shallow breathing , metallic taste and skin burn , Malay said she also suffered prolonged bouts of crying and depression .
Her physical symptoms worsened whenever she came into contact with chemicals , whether at the gas station or around bleach .
She was given an inhaler to help her breathe .
Her skin felt as though it was rubbing on fiberglass shavings .
When the doctor asked what chemicals were used at the standoff , the city sent Malay 's doctor a record showing CS gas was used .
Copies were released by Malay 's lawyer .
Syracuse police guidelines for CS gas exposure include washing with soap and water , flushing of the eyes and exposure to fresh air .
Malay says police never offered her any treatment .
The victim should also seek a physician 's assistance , according to the guidelines .
No one told her to see a doctor , Malay said
A life in limbo
Even being homeless , little things nagged at Malay .
She wondered what to do about her overdue borrowed books .
Cecile , the police lieutenant , promised to call the library and explain .
" I was racking up library fines , " she said .
" For some reason , I was very upset at the time I was going to lose my library card .
It became paramount importance for me . "
She moved in with her son's girlfriend .
She called the Red Cross and was told it could only house people for one night .
She called the state , but was told there was no assistance because she was n't a victim of the shooting .
She called the state Department of Environmental Conservation , which was n't able to cleanse the apartment .
Only the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it knew what she needed : somebody who specialized in environmental hazards .
After agreeing to help , the city suggested a guy named " Rich , " Malay said in an interview .
No last name .
They had a phone number for Rich .
When Malay called him , Rich said he'd never handled CS gas in his life .
He did n't have insurance .
He had no business address .
Rich refused to give his last name , Malay said .
She said no .
Malay found a New Jersey company , Bio-Clean .
CS gas was originally developed for military use during riots , said Bio-Clean owner Andrew Yurchuck but is no longer used by the military in warfare because it violates the Chemical Weapons Convention Act .
Bio-Clean wanted nearly $ 4,000 to enter the house and estimate how much it would cost to decontaminate .
To clean it , experts would enter with chemical weapons suits , ventilators and organic vapor filters .
They would use a heat pasteurizer to raise the building 's temperature to 140 degrees to evaporate the CS gas .
They would use air scrubbers to capture and remove the hazard , Yurchuck said .
The cost ?
Between $ 25,000 and $ 100,000 , he said .
The city balked , Gattuso said .
City officials found a company in Plattsburgh that employed former military personnel .
When Malay called , the company said it was n't qualified .
After 16 months , the Gere Avenue apartment remains uninhabitable .
" Nobody knew what to do , " Malay said .
" You do n't normally use this stuff on civilians . "
A new beginning
Malay does n't want to see the apartment again .
Whoever is hired to clean up will have to take photos of her belongings so she can decide what to save .
It 's too dangerous for her to enter the house in her condition .
Her face still burns occasionally .
She has allergies .
Her hands go numb .
She moved last fall into a small apartment in Eastwood .
One of her only possessions is a stepladder she bought to do odd jobs , like hang new curtains and change bulbs .
Her table , chair and television were donated by her landlord , a fellow tenant and her family .
She sleeps on an air mattress .
Sitting in her new living room , in front of her new television , she thinks about the last time she was inside her old apartment .
She jokes the Hitchcock movie is still cued to the spot where she left it .
After being gassed out of her home , Malay said her new apartment is a sign of how her life is coming together .
" It 's mine .
It feels safe . "
Last fall , Malay 's son fled the state to escape the horror of what happened .
Jubal Malay broke up with his girlfriend and felt nothing was left for him in New York .
He joined some Army buddies in Augusta , Ga. , and is working in construction .
He had trouble getting a job because no one believed he was in the Army , he said .
All of his discharge papers are still quarantined inside the apartment .
" I spent 81/2 years in the service , two tours in Iraq , and did n't lose anything , " Jubal Malay said .
" Then I come home and my mother gets gassed and I lose everything . "
Like her son , Eileen Malay has been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
Dr. Lionel G. Deutsch , of Woodstock , who specializes in psychosomatic medicine , said Malay also suffers from minor depressive disorder .
" Prognosis is hard to estimate at this time , " Deutsch wrote in his November 2007 report .
Malay said her condition has helped her relate to Jubal 's struggles .
" Now we 're like bookends -- I get it , " she said .
" I know what I have to do to cope , so I know how to help him . "
Thanks to Paul Cook for the initial link to this fascinating little javascript script Social History .
Thes cript analyzes the css color of various links to determine whether or not the user has been to that site .
If the link has the “ visited ” style , then he marks the user as having been to that site .
Now the Social History implementation of this is rather innocuous — it ’s a clever way of only displaying only the sharing buttons of sites that the user is an active participant of .
Of course there are far more interesting applications for advertising .
One of the things that I always wanted to do but never got around to was to analyze a user ’s browsing history to estimate age and gender .
Of course the idea is definitely not new , in fact Xerox ( of all companies ? ? ) has a patent on the whole process and I ’m certain plenty of networks already do something of the sort … but what the heck , let ’s have some fun !
So what I did is I modified the SocialHistory JS so that it polled the browser to find out which of the Quantcast top 10 k sites were visited .
I then apply the ratio of male to female users for each site and with some basic math determine a guestimate of your gender .
The math is really quite simple , I just take :
1 / ( 1 + r_1 * r_2 * … * r_n )
1 / ( 1 + 2 * 2 ) = 1/5 = 20 %
where p_i is the ratio of men - to - women for the specific site .
For example , if you had been to two sites that had a 2 - 1 ratio of men to women , the probability of you being female would be :
Ok , so Click the button to give it a shot ( those of you using RSS readers probably need to click this link to open this post in a browser ) :
UPDATE : This takes a while on Internet Explorer — please be patient ( or try FireFox )
Kind of cute right ?
Do n’t worry —
I am not storing your history in any way , this is purely for fun .
I ’d appreciate it if you paste the resulting probabilities in the comments together with your actual gender , I ’m interested to know the accuracy of this simplistic approach .
In case it is n’t obvious — please do n’t do this for real .
UPDATE : I ’ve disabled comments for this post , as there are simply too many !

In a breakthrough that could eventually help tame one of the deadliest viruses known to man , researchers have laid bare the key to Ebola 's power : a lone protein that resides on its surface .
The discovery paves the way for new treatments that target and destroy the designated culprit , rendering impotent a virus that , though rare , can kill up to 90 percent of the people it infects .
The so - called Ebola virus glycoprotein , or " spike protein , " was first discovered a decade ago and has been a target for scientists attempting to design vaccines and therapies to prevent it from infecting cells .
But , until now , researchers did not understand the protein 's structure — and thus , the best way to attack it .
" It 's the only thing that the virus puts on its surface that is absolutely critical for attaching to a host and driving into that host for infection , " says Erica Ollmann Saphire , an immunologist at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif . , and a co-author of the study appearing today in Nature .
Researchers discovered that the compound is wrapped in benign carbohydrates that mask the virus 's deadliness , allowing it to elude immune system scouts .
( The human immunodeficiency virus , HIV , that causes AIDS also has this trait . )
The good news : the discovery could pave the way for drugs designed to see through that protective coating — and trigger the immune system to attack .
" The structure of the glycoprotein shows us the very few sites on its surface that are not cloaked by carbohydrate , " Ollmann Saphire explains .
" These [ sites ] are the chink in the armor , or the Achilles ' heel , that we can target antibodies against . "
" We now have a much better handle on how in the world this virus gets into cells , " Ollmann Saphire says .
" We also have new maps we can use to develop strategies to fight against it . "
Ebola is an incurable disease that was first discovered in 1976 in western Sudan and the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( then known as Zaire ) .
It seems to have arisen in the rain forests of Africa and parts of the western Pacific .
A person acquires the virus through contact with the bodily fluids of someone already infected .
It can take from two days to three weeks for symptoms of Ebola to appear .
The disease presents itself with a fever , muscle aches and a cough before progressing to severe vomiting , diarrhea and rashes , along with kidney and liver problems .
Death generally occurs as the result of either one or a combination of : dehydration , massive bleeding due to leaky blood vessels , kidney and liver failure .
The World Health Organization has documented 1,850 cases of Ebola ( mostly in sub-Saharan Africa ) since its discovery ; only 600 ( 32 percent ) of the victims survived .
Researchers made their latest finding by studying the bone marrow of a lucky survivor of a 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit , a city in the southwestern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
They found the glycoprotein attached to an antibody ( a protein unleashed by the immune system to fight viruses ) in the marrow , the soft core of bones where red blood cells are manufactured .
According to Ollmann Saphire , there is a receptor located deep in the bowl - shaped structure of Ebola 's glycoprotein that latches onto the surface of host cells and tricks a protein there into granting the virus entry .
Once inside the cells , the fast - acting Ebola co-opts their machinery to make millions of copies of itself and floods the person 's bloodstream .
Judith White , a microbiologist at the University of Virginia , says that arming researchers with the protein structure that Ollmann Saphire 's group has described will allow them to " nip [ the virus ] in the bud , " by beating down Ebola before it enters its host .
( Most antivirals target viruses such as HIV after they 're already inside a host cell . )
" For those of us in the trenches trying to study the virus entry , and the immune reactions to the virus , and how to prevent virus entry , and how to come up with better immune therapies , " she says , " this gives us all new eyes to [ solving ] those problems . "
Ithaca Times —
Last Tuesday , a group of local activists held a friendly demonstration of gratitude outside of Congressman Maurice Hinchey ’s ( D - NY , 22 ) office at Cayuga and Green Streets , thanking Hinchey for being the seventh representative to sign on to and co-sponsor Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich ’s impeachment bill .
“ Our main focus was to thank Hinchey , ” said resident John Hamilton .
It ’s very clear it was the right thing to do .
We ’re delighted .
Politically , it ’s a big step .
Democratic leadership is trying to brush all the crimes of this administration under the table .
This is a courageous step for Hinchey to take , and we want to show our support . ”
Hamilton and other demonstrators stood on the four corners near Hinchey ’s office and held up signs .
They also displayed the Mother Ithaca puppet , created and operated by the Puppetistas , and brought a cake and strawberries up to Hinchey ’s office .
While the call for impeachment has been culturally marginalized up until now , momentum seems to be building on both a local and national stage for George Bush and his administration to be held responsible for the 35 articles on the impeachment bill , which include staging pre-emptive war against Iraq without cause , violating the agreements of the UN Charter and Geneva Convention , failing to help victims of Katrina , allowing Valerie Plame to be outed , and finally , failing to defend the country from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
“ There ’s never been any doubt in my mind about the impeachability of this administration , ” Hinchey said , “ primarily because they knowingly and intentionally falsified information to justify the illegal invasion of Iraq , and before that , they displayed incompetence in not adhering to the information and recommendations they were given by intelligence operations , specifically in early August 2001 , about the upcoming attacks by Al - Qaeda and Osama bin Laden , and specifically , their failure to prevent those attacks . ”
The call for impeachment in Ithaca goes back several years , Hamilton said , under a slew of different names and different projects , including the Impeachment Group and Peace Now Ithaca .
Last year , a group of Ithacans got 3,000 signatures and petitioned the Tompkins County Legislature and the City of Ithaca to pass a resolution to begin an investigation leading to impeachment .
Ulster County , another area in Hinchey ’s district , quickly got involved , and in mid-June , Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat , defied his party leadership and introduced the bill to Congress .
He accused Bush of executing a “ calculated and wide - ranging strategy ” to deceive citizens and Congress into believing that Iraq was an immediate and urgent threat to the United States , according to the AP wire .
“ Clearly , momentum is building , ” Hamilton said , and noted that a lot of their work is being done with Iraq Veterans Against the War , who just presented 25,000 signatures to Rep.
John Conyers ( D - MI , 14th ) last week .
Why impeach Bush in the final moments of his presidency ?
Both Hamilton and Hinchey asserted two reasons : first , to keep the investigation into the Bush administration open and active even after he ’s out of office , and second , to make it clear to any incoming or future president that the actions of the Bush administration were unacceptable and intolerable .
“ It needs to be made clear that the laws apply to everyone , ” Hamilton said .
“ If we do nothing , we ’re basically saying it ’s OK for our president to break any law or treaty .
He ’s broken the two most important agreements we have in the world , the UN charter and the Geneva convention .
If he is allowed to get away with starting the war against Iraq , he might feel it ’s OK to attack Iran next .
That ’s what motivates me . ”
“ It ’s very serious , ” he added .
“ I think any of us could agree that any future we have on this planet as human beings will require that we ’re able to make agreements and honor them .
We have to strengthen , not abandon , international law .
If we can ’t , our future is shaky .
If we can , our future looks better . ”
“ There needs to be ongoing investigation into the criminal actions taken by this administration , which I believe are quite clear ” Hinchey said , “ and that information needs to be made public .
This will include pressure that will be put on the next administration coming into office next year .
There are legal ways to hold people responsible . ”
“ The energy crisis we ’re facing now is in large part due to the military action in Iraq and the potential of it in Iran , which has driven up speculation on the price of oil , ” Hinchey added .
“ We need to make it very difficult for this kind of corruption to be engaged in again .
All these people were doing things for their own corrupt reasons at the expense of the people of our country .
This has undermined and damaged the democratic principles of this country . ”
What would the bill need to move ahead ?
Simply put , more signatures , more mass , more show of support from the public .
“ Congress needs to be reinvigorated , ” Hinchey said .
“ They have not done a good job on this at all .
Their actions , overall , are n’t based on leadership , but what they think people want and believe .
Very few people are willing to stand out ahead of the situation . ”
Hamilton , a local carpenter who works particularly on farms , said his mother was present at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed , and that he learned to value the country ’s ideals through his parents , who met in Hawaii .
“ They did n’t fight World War II so that we could become the biggest bully in the world , ” Hamilton said .
“ All that sacrifice of their generation is being tossed out the window , and it ’s very sad . ”
Original Article
The drug was already being used in trials of TSC patients in England , but only to test its efficacy against kidney and lung lesions , also associated with the disorder .
Cambridge 's de Vries , who is running those trials , said that until recently , most scientists had n't expected the drug to work on cognitive problems because those had been thought to result from growths in the brain .
Peeping Tom Accidentally Falls Off 10th Floor
A 44 year old Hong Kong man accidentally fell off a 10th floor balcony while trying to video tape his next door neighbor showering .
The 29 story building was designed so that two units have their bathroom windows right next to each other .
This made it easy for the man to climb over and peep on his neighbor .
The victim , a 28 year - old sales lady , was taking a shower when she noticed a strange hand holding a cell phone outside the bathroom window .
She screamed for help and saw the person outside climb back into the next room , which was a vacant apartment .
Her husband and other residents blocked the door entering the next door apartment and called the police .
The peeping tom , realizing his only way to escape was out the window , climbed out the window back onto the ledge .
Due to the dark and slippery conditions , the man lost his footing and fell 10 floors to the ground .
Luckily he hit a tree branch which broke his fall a little .
He was found alive but critically injured with a broken rib puncturing his lung .
He was taken into custody and rushed to the hospital where he remains in critical condition .

Excluded from debate , Kucinich sells voting machines Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday January 7 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This With " change " as a watchword in 2008 's opening presidential primary contests , Oval Office seekers from both parties are making political hay of sweeping talk about America 's future .
But hard - fighting Democratic hopeful Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) in recent weeks has been drumming up precious fundraising cash by selling off relics from elections past : Genuine Palm Beach County voting machines used in Florida 's contested 2000 elections .
For a shade over $ 200 , hardcore politicos can claim the ultimate artifact from last century 's definitive political debacle -- along with a handful of " actual chads , " according to Kucinich 's website .
The machines also ship with a replica ballot and a signed copy of " The Stolen Presidential Election of 2000 , " a Kucinich missive personally signed by the candidate .
Kucinich communications Sharon Manitta told RAW STORY that sales were " perking along , " and that buyers had snapped up between 12 and 15 of the machines through the Christmas holiday .
" It was great for Christmas , but also birthdays , various events during the year , " said Manitta .
" What better gift can you give somebody in an election year really ? "
She says Kucinich and his wife , Elizabeth , helped hatch the fundraising idea following a conversation with Florida supporter and collector Jim Dobyns , who happened to mention that he owned 1,200 of the infamous punch - card devices .
" We discussed the idea at a strategy meeting and everybody around the table went ' Wow , what a hoot , ' " said Manitta .
" They 're little pieces of history . "
The machines are the very ones that Palm Beach County residents in 2000 used to mark notorious Palm Beach Post found that Democratic candidate Al Gore potentially lost more than 6,500 votes when poll - goers invalidated their ballots by voting for more than one presidential candidate .
Dobyns , who acquired the machines from another collector after the Florida state legislature outlawed their further use , told RAW STORY that buyers were getting a prize .
" It 's got all the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections property tags , " said Dobyns , adding that the machines come complete with election - ready folding legs and a metal carrying case .
" We 're shipping a lot of them to the West Coast -- Seattle and California . "
The collector also sells the machines independently , but says he is giving the Kucinich campaign a bargain basement deal to help his candidate of choice raise funds .
" I 'm selling them to the campaign at a significant discount , " he said .
" They 're getting the lion 's share of the proceeds . "
Dobyns ' equipment is also getting a supporting turn in the forthcoming HBO film Recount , which chronicles the Florida election and the legal battles that followed .
The devices will play themselves in the movie 's mock - up of South Florida polling places .
Manitta said the machines were also a great way for those still smarting over the 2000 result to let politically opposed friends know the election mess was not forgotten .
" It 's the perfect gift for your favorite political junkie , or any Republican you know , I suppose , " she jabbed .
" And you wo n't have to worry about five other people getting them the same thing . "
Kucinich has thus far been unable to gain significant traction in presidential polling , and was dealt another setback this weekend when he was excluded from ABC's Democratic debate .
The candidate has filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission stating that the network violated equal time provisions by failing to feature him in the event .
" It will just be a number of dittos up there , " said Kucinich last week .
" They are doing everything to block me out . "

This revolution , the first Russian revolution , was born of mass discontent aggravated by a deeply unpopular war , the Russo - Japanese War of 1904 .
It began with a wave of strikes , riots and street demonstrations protesting the police shooting on a peaceful mass workers ' demonstration in St Petersburg , the capital of the vast Russian Empire , on Sunday , January 22 , 1905 ( January 9 in the Julian calendar still in use in Russia at the time ) , killing 1000 and wounding 2000 of the 200,000 marchers .
The revolutionary upsurge reached its highpoint with a political general strike in St Petersburg in October under the slogan " An eight - hour day and arms ! " , which led to the establishment for 50 days of an elected city - wide strike committee called the Council of Workers ' Deputies ( in Russian , Sovieta Rabochikh Deputatov ) and an unsuccessful insurrection in December by 2000 armed and 4000 unarmed workers in Moscow , organised by the Bolshevik - led Moscow Soviet of Workers ' Deputies .
While the revolutionary mass movement peaked with these events and began to ebb afterward , being brutally crushed in June 1907 , the lessons learned by tens of thousands of class - conscious Russian workers in the course of the mass struggles of those two - and - a - half years helped prepare them to lead the Russian working people to carry out a successful revolutionary struggle for power in 1917 .
The Bolshevik - led revolution of November 1917 brought into being in July 1918 the world 's first socialist state , the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic , which , in December 1922 , united with the Ukrainian , Belarussian and Transcaucasian Federation of Soviet Republics — that is , Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia — to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , the Soviet Union .
Soviets of workers ' deputies
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin , the founding leader of the Russian Soviet Republic , in a lecture on the 1905 revolution given to young Swiss worker - socialists in Zurich in January 1917 , noted that in several Russian industrial towns the elected strike committees , the soviets of workers ' deputies , " began more and more to play the part of a provisional revolutionary government , the part of organs and leaders of the uprising " .
In these towns , Lenin added .
the " government authorities were deposed and the Soviet of Workers ' Deputies actually functioned as the new government " .
1
This was the case , for example , in the town of Ivanovo - Voznesensk , where the first soviet of workers ' deputies was formed .
Only a few years earlier , Ivanovo - Voznesensk had been an out - of - the - way little rural town where pigs and chickens roamed the streets .
By 1905 it had mushroomed into a major industrial centre with 70,000 workers , most of whom toiled for 16 or 17 hours a day in its new textile mills .
On May 9 , 1905 , the town 's Bolshevik workers held a clandestine conference in a nearby forest and decided to issue a call for a general strike .
Three days later the workers of the town 's textile mills , mostly women and children , went on strike .
They were joined by railway and metal workers .
At a town rally , the workers decided to elect a centralised body to direct the strike — a soviet of workers ' deputies consisting of 151 of their most trusted comrades .
In the course of the general strike , the soviet set up strike , food supply and finance commissions , and after the shooting of workers by police on June 3 , the soviet set up a workers ' militia to protect strike leaders and workers ' meetings and to prevent strikebreakers from entering workplaces .
The last meeting of the Ivanovo - Voznesensk soviet took place on July 19 , 1905 .
With the general strike having forced the factory owners to concede to most of the workers ' demands for higher wages and shorter working hours , the soviet decided to end the general strike and dissolve itself .
On July 23 the workers returned to their factories in an organised manner .
The general strike and the soviet in Ivanovo - Voznesensk had lasted 72 days , one day longer than the 1871 Paris Commune , up until then the only example of a revolutionary working people 's government .
From its very first days , the Ivanovo - Voznesensk soviet operated as a revolutionary government , ignoring or countermanding the orders of the tsar 's provincial governor .
It ordered the factory owners to continue to pay the striking workers their wages .
It forbade factory owners to evict workers from factory living quarters , and it made merchants give the strikers food supplies .
Later it set up a cooperative to provide strikers with foodstuffs .
One of the Ivanovo - Voznesensk soviet 's first acts was a decision to close the town 's liquor shops .
This decision was taken to stop the struggle being drowned in an orgy of drunkenness .
Some indication of why this was such an acute issue may be gleaned from the following description of the life of Russian industrial workers at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries contained in the 1948 autobiography of A. S. Shapovalov , a St Petersburg worker who later became a Bolshevik :
I was 13 years old when [ in 1884 ] the railway repair workshop accepted me in its embrace … and although I had not been spoiled by fate and had already graduated from a hard school , still , after one day spent under the authority of the coppersmith , Aleksey Ignatievich Sokolov , I wanted to run away .
Instead of giving me a chance to learn a trade , I spent the whole day being sent out to fetch vodka … Boozeups were organised for any excuse .
The birth of a child , a baptism , a funeral , a wedding — all these were marked with boozeups .
When a new worker started at the works , he had to buy " welcoming " drinks for his comrades .
When he was discharged , they demanded a " farewell " .
They drank most on the saint 's day of the icon which hung in the workshop …
The most backward of the railway workers were the foremen and labourers .
They lived in barracks , which were filthy .
They were peasants torn from the plough , who had come to St Petersburg merely to earn a bit and return to their villages .
" Recognition of their human worth was rare among the workers " , he wrote .
The workshop owner " was a `tsar ' , a `god ' …
When he walked through the workshop , the workers … would humbly bow , stutteringly remove their hats and say : ` Good morning , our lord and master ! '"

January 1905 protest
It was with this sort of serf - like mentality that tens of thousands of workers in St Petersburg , led by a Russian Orthodox priest , Father Georgy Gapon , marched solemnly on January 22 , 1905 , to the Winter Palace , the residence of the Russian Empire 's absolutist monarch , Nikolai Romanov II , in order to present him with a petition containing the people 's grievances .
The petition read in part :
We working men of St Petersburg , our wives and children , and our parents , helpless and aged men and women , have come to you , our ruler , in quest of justice and protection …
We have no strength at all , O Sovereign .
Our patience is at an end .
We are approaching that terrible moment when death is better than the continuance of intolerable sufferings …
Every worker and peasant is at the mercy of your officials , who accept bribes , rob the Treasury , and do not care at all for the people 's interests .
The bureaucracy of the government has ruined the country , involved it in a shameful war and is leading Russia nearer and nearer to utter ruin .
We , the Russian workers and people , have no voice at all in the expenditure of the huge sums collected in taxes from the impoverished population .
We do not even know how our money is spent .
The people are deprived of any right to discuss taxes and their expenditure .
The workers have no right to organise their own labour unions for their own interests …
Is this , O Sovereign , in accordance with the laws of God , by whose grace you reign ? …
Break down the wall between yourself and your people …
The people must be represented in the control of their country 's affairs …
Do not reject their help , accept it , command forthwith that representatives of all classes , groups , professions and trades shall come together .
Let capitalists and workers , bureaucrats and priests , doctors and teachers meet together and choose their representatives … let the election of members of a Constitutional Assembly take place in conditions of universal , secret and equal suffrage .
This is our chief request ; upon which all else depends .
The petition ended with the following words : " Sire , do not refuse aid to Thy people !
Demolish the wall that separates
Thee from Thy people .
Order and promise that our requests will be granted , and Thou wilt make Russia happy … "

In his January 1917 Zurich lecture , Lenin commented :
The unenlightened workers of pre-revolutionary Russia did not know that the tsar was the head of the ruling class , the class , namely , of big landowners , already bound by a thousand ties with the big bourgeoisie and prepared to defend their monopoly , privileges and profits by every means of violence …
" There is not yet a revolutionary people in Russia " , wrote Mr Pyotr Struve , then leader of the Russian liberals and publisher abroad of an illegal , uncensored organ , two days before " Bloody Sunday " .
The idea that an illiterate peasant country could produce a revolutionary people seemed utterly absurd to this " highly educated " , supercilious and extremely stupid leader of the bourgeois reformists .
So deep was the conviction of the reformists of those days — as of the reformists of today — that a real revolution was impossible !
Lenin added :
Prior to January 22 ( or January 9 , old style ) , 1905 , the revolutionary party of Russia consisted of a small group of people , and the reformists of those days ( exactly like the reformists of today ) derisively called us a " sect " …
This circumstance gave the narrow - minded and overbearing reformists formal justification for their claim that there was not yet a revolutionary people in Russia .
Within a few months , however , the picture changed completely .
The hundreds of revolutionary Social - Democrats [ here Lenin was referring to the Bolsheviks ] " suddenly " grew into thousands ; the thousands became the leaders of between two and three million proletarians .
The proletarian struggle produced widespread ferment , often revolutionary movements among the peasant masses , fifty to a hundred million strong ; the peasant movement had its reverberations in the army and led to soldiers ' revolts , to armed clashes between one section of the army and another .
In this manner a colossal country , with a population of 130,000,000 , went into the revolution ; in this way , dormant Russia was transformed into a Russia of a revolutionary proletariat and a revolutionary people .

Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
The Russian socialists entered the 1905 revolution divided into two separate party organisations — the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( Bolsheviks , or majorityites ) and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( Mensheviks , or minorityites ) .
Liberal historians invariably attribute this split to Lenin 's supposed intolerance toward anyone who did not fully agree with him .
A somewhat more sophisticated liberal explanation , which was also presented in the official 1938 Stalinist History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( Bolsheviks ) , is that , as the US liberal historian Alexander Rabinovitch put it in a 1976 book , Prelude to Revolution :
In 1903 Lenin had permanently shattered the unity of the Russian labor movement with his fanatical insistence that only a small , professional , and highly centralized revolutionary organisation was capable of leading the Russian proletariat in a socialist revolution , this at a time when many Russian Social Democrats desired a more democratically organized , broadly tolerant , mass Marxist party .
5
In reality , Lenin recognised that only a democratically organised , mass Marxist party would be capable of leading a proletarian revolution .
But he also favoured the creation of a centralised organisation of professional revolutionaries , of people who made revolutionary propaganda , agitation and organisational work their life 's commitment .
He favoured such an organisation because he believed it was the only way to get a democratically organised , mass Marxist party .
Thus , shortly after the fifth RSDLP congress , held in London in July 1907 , when the party had become a democratically organised , mass Marxist party with 150,000 members — 46,000 of whom were Bolsheviks and 38,000 of whom were Mensheviks — Lenin argued that this had proven the correctness of the earlier struggle to create a party of professional revolutionaries .
In a preface to a collection of some of his main writings , including What Is To Be Done ? , Lenin wrote :
Iskra [ the Russian Marxist paper established abroad by Lenin , Plekhanov and Martov ] fought for an organisation of professional revolutionaries .
It fought with especial vigour in 1901 and 1902 , vanquished Economism , the then dominant trend , and created this organisation in 1903 .
It preserved it in face of the subsequent split in the Iskrist ranks and all the convulsions of the period of storm and stress ; it preserved it throughout the Russian revolution ; it preserved it intact from 190102 to 1907 .
Take the whole pre-revolutionary period and the first two and a half years of the revolution ( 190507 ) .
Compare our Social - Democratic
Party during this whole period with the other parties in respect of unity , organisation , and continuity of policy .
You will have to admit that in this respect our Party is unquestionably superior to all the others .
Lenin also noted that " the Social - Democratic Party , earlier than any of the other parties , was able to take advantage of the temporary spell of freedom to build a legal organisation with an ideal democratic structure , an electoral system , and representation at congresses according to the number of organised members " .
" The question arises " , Lenin asked , " who accomplished , who brought into being this superior unity , solidarity , and stability of our Party ? "
Lenin 's answer was unambiguous : " It was accomplished by the organisation of professional revolutionaries " .
6
In any event , it was not Lenin 's insistence , whether this was fanatical or otherwise , on the need for an organisation of professional revolutionaries that shattered the unity of the RSDLP in 1903 .
In fact , it was the refusal of a minority of Iskraists led by Yuli Martov to respect the most elementary principles of democratic organisation — that is , to respect the decisions adopted by the majority of delegates at the 1903 congress — that led to the split , which did not occur at the congress , but after it .
At the congress , Lenin had proposed that the editorial board of Iskra , which it had been agreed would henceforth be the party 's organ , be reduced from its previous six ( self - appointed ) members to three , nominating himself , Georgy Plekhanov and Martov .
These three had carried out the bulk of the actual editorial work on the old editorial board and represented the distinct political trends within the Iskraists .
This composition would ensure that decisions could not be deadlocked and gave the Iskraist majority control over the central organ .
However , Martov opposed this proposal , wanting to elect the original six editors .
Lenin 's proposal was adopted by 25 votes to 2 , with 17 abstaining .
Martov and his supporters then refused to participate in the election of the three - person central committee , as a result of which it was composed exclusively of supporters of the Iskraist majority ( henceforth known as the Bolsheviks ) , and Plekhanov was elected president of the party council — the highest decision - making body between congresses , composed of two members designated by the central committee , two designated by the Iskra editorial board and a president elected by the congress .
Following the congress , Martov and his supporters — who henceforth became known as the Mensheviks — refused to accept these decisions , forming a secret faction to overturn them .
Under the pressure of the Mensheviks ' campaign , Plekhanov wavered and then capitulated , uniting with Martov to coopt the three other former board members — Pavel Axelrod , Alexander Potresov and Vera Zasulich — onto the editorial board , acting in clear violation of the decision of the congress and turning Iskra into an organ of the Mensheviks .
On October 30 , 1903 , Lenin resigned from the board and was coopted onto the central committee .
Then , at a meeting of the party council in mid-January 1904 , Plekhanov joined with Axelrod and Martov ( the two representatives of the Iskra editorial board ) to overturn the Bolshevik majority on the central committee by coopting Mensheviks onto the body .
Lenin responded by moving a resolution for the convening of a new party congress , which was voted down by Plekhanov , Axelrod and Martov .
Writing to Lenin at the beginning of 1904 , a worker active in the RSDLP inside Russia denounced all of the leaders abroad as " political intriguers " , but also touched on the important point at issue in the dispute between Lenin and the Mensheviks :
What 's the use of having congresses if their decisions are ignored and everybody does just as he pleases , saying that the congress decision is wrong , that the central committee is ineffective , and so on .
And this is being done by people who before the congress were always clamouring for centralisation , party discipline , and so on , but who now want to show , it seems , that discipline is only meant for ordinary mortals , and not for them at the top .
In reply , Lenin wrote :
The squabbles abroad among the writers and all the other generals ( who you too harshly and bluntly call intriguers ) will cease to be dangerous to the party only when the leaders of committees in Russia become more independent and capable of firmly demanding the fulfillment of what their delegates decide at the party congress .
7
During 1904 , the Mensheviks tried to justify their overturning of the decisions of the second party congress by waging a furious demagogic campaign against Lenin , accusing him of being an advocate of " bureaucratic centralism " — for insisting that they abide by the decisions of the party congress .
In response to this campaign , in May 1904 Lenin published his booklet One Step Forward , Two Steps Back , giving a detailed account of what had transpired at and after the congress and explaining from a Marxist standpoint what was at stake in the dispute between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks , pointing out that the Mensheviks were reviving the previously defeated conceptions of the Economists .
Thus Axelrod had begun to argue that the Russian Marxists should strive for the creation of an all - inclusive , non-party , workers ' organisation , which in practice would have meant the liquidation of the still very weak revolutionary socialist party .
In One Step Forward , Two Steps Back , Lenin observed :
The party , as the vanguard of the working class , must not be confused , after all , with the entire class .
And Comrade Axelrod is guilty of just this confusion ( which is characteristic of our opportunist Economism in general ) …
[ I ]t would be " tailism " to think that the entire class , or almost the entire class , can ever rise , under capitalism , to the level of consciousness and activity of its vanguard , of its Social - Democratic Party .
8
At the end of July 1904 , Lenin convened a conference of 22 Bolsheviks in Switzerland at which an appeal " To the Party " was issued calling for a struggle to convene a new RSDLP congress .
Over the following few months , conferences of local party committees inside Russia declared in support of this call and in December 1904 elected a Bureau of Majority Committees , which began publishing a weekly paper , Vperyod ( Forward ) , and constituted itself as the organising committee for the third congress of the RSDLP
This is the real story of how the Russian socialists came to be divided into two rival party organisations only a month before Russia was plunged into a revolution .
Anti-feudal revolution
In his January 1917 Zurich lecture , Lenin pointed out that the peculiarity of the 1905 revolution was that " it was a bourgeois - democratic revolution in its social content , but a proletarian revolution in its methods of struggle " .
Expanding on this point , he said :
It was a bourgeois - democratic revolution since its immediate aim , which it could achieve directly and with its own forces , was a democratic republic , the eight - hour day and confiscation of the immense estates of the nobility — all the measures the French bourgeois revolution in 1792 - 93 had almost completely achieved .
At the same time , the Russian revolution was also a proletarian revolution , not only in the sense that the proletariat was the leading force , the vanguard of the movement , but also in the sense that a specifically proletarian weapon of struggle — the strike — was the principal means of bringing the masses into motion and the most characteristic phenomenon in the wavelike rise of decisive events .9
This peculiar combination of bourgeois and proletarian revolutions was a product of the peculiar combination of socio-economic relations that had been produced by the late development of capitalism within the Russian Empire .
In his 1917 book Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism , Lenin observed that at the beginning of the twentieth century Russia was a country " where modern capitalist imperialism is enmeshed … in a particularly close network of pre-capitalist relations " .
10
In the mid-nineteenth century , when bourgeois revolutions freed the majority of European nations from the final vestiges of feudal economic and political relations , serfdom — the right sanctioned by law of the landowning nobility to use peasants as they thought fit — remained the foundation on which the despotic Russian monarchy rested .
Serfdom was legally abolished in Russia only in 1861 .
The tsarist autocracy took this step after the ignominious defeat of its army during the 1854 - 56 Crimean War .
The Emancipation
Act of 1861 was enacted principally in order to modernise the tsarist army — to transform it from a large standing army of untrained , poorly armed serfs into a smaller and much less expensive standing army of trained , paid soldiers , equipped with industrially produced weapons .
The failures of the Russian army during the Crimean War had also driven home to the tsarist government the need to create an extensive network of railways to supply quickly Russian soldiers on the battlefield with food , munitions and reinforcements .
At the end of the 1850s , though , the tsarist government did not have the revenue to fund a large - scale program of railway construction .
Indeed , not only was the government bankrupt , but the army was absorbing up to half its expenditures .
The tsar 's economic advisers believed that the abolition of serfdom would stimulate peasant production of commodities for an expanding market and generate a new class of rich peasant farmers , who would provide a new base for government revenue .
The poorest peasants would be free to migrate to the cities and towns , thus providing an expanding pool of wage workers for the emerging class of capitalist factory owners .
While formally ending 1000 years of feudalism in Russia and legally opening the way for 23 million serfs to own land , in practice the Emancipation Act changed little .
It declared that all land on landlords ' estates belonged legally to the hereditary nobility , other than the land on which the peasants ' households were situated .
To become legal owners of the farm land , including land they had previously used to support themselves , the peasants — who at that time made up ninety - four per cent of Russia 's population — had to purchase it from the landlords , under the supervision of new local government bodies .
Prior to the 1861 reform , all local government powers had been exercised by the landowners over their serfs .
The Emancipation
Act granted certain powers of self - government to peasant village associations , but subordinated these powers to local government officials who , under an 1864 law , were to be selected by district and provincial assemblies ( zemstvo ) , made up of delegates elected from different social classes .
Up to 1906 , these were the only elected government bodies .
They tended to be overwhelmingly dominated by the hereditary , landowning nobility .
At the end of the 1850s , there were about one million nobles in the Russian Empire , of whom 250,000 belonged to the hereditary nobility , and of these only 90,000 owned serfs .
Most of these nobles were so poor that they lived like peasants alongside their serfs .
About 18,000 nobles each owned100 or more serfs , and it was from this small group — constituting , with their families , about 0.5 per cent of the total population — that the government ministers , provincial governors and the top echelons of the civil and military bureaucracy were drawn .
The nobles themselves wanted to abolish serfdom , in order to rid themselves of their debts to the government .
By 1858 , around sixty per cent of landlords had mortgaged their serfs to the government to cover their tax bills .
The Emancipation
Act transferred these mortgages from the landlords to the newly freed serfs , giving them a period of 49 years to pay off these mortgage debts .
The " great reforms " of the early 1860s left the peasantry in possession of about three - quarters of the land they had previously regarded as theirs .
Population growth during the next half century further reduced the average landholdings of the peasantry , making land hunger a problem serious enough to turn the peasants into a potentially powerful force for revolutionary change .
Between 1860 and 1900 , the average allotment of farm land per male peasant declined by about forty - six per cent , from 5.2 to 2.9 hectares , which was too little for them to live off .
About two - thirds of all peasant households were not able to make a living from their tiny farms , and their members had become semi-proletarians relying for the most part on income from wages , from the sale of their labour power either to the big landowners or to richer peasants to produce agricultural or handicraft commodities .
Marxism versus Narodnism
Widespread disillusionment among liberal - minded university students at the results of Tsar Aleksandr II 's " great reforms " led to the formation of a petty - bourgeois revolutionary democratic current in Russia — the Populist or Narodnik current .
The Narodniks held out the hope that capitalist development could be bypassed in Russia through a peasant revolution that would not only overthrow the tsarist autocracy but create a " socialist " society based upon the peasants ' communal landholdings .
Marx and Engels , who throughout their political lives had regarded tsarist Russia as the bastion of reaction in Europe , welcomed the emergence of the Narodnik current as a potential ally of the socialist workers ' movement in western Europe , and many Narodniks became interested in Marx and Engels ' writings .
They organised the first translations of a number of them into Russian , including Marx 's Capital .
In turn , Marx and Engels both learned Russian in order to read the literature and correspond with Russian revolutionary democrats .
Against the Narodniks ' perspective of " agrarian socialism " , Marx and Engels argued that without the assistance of proletarian revolutions in the much more industrially developed West , a process of capitalist development in Russia and the breaking up of peasants ' communes ( mir ) was inevitable .
In their jointly authored 1882 preface to the Russian edition of the Communist Manifesto , for example , Marx and Engels argued , " If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West , so that both complement each other , the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as a starting for a communist development " .
In 1879 the principal Narodnik organisation , Zemlya i Volya ( Land and Liberty ) , split into two rival organisations .
The majority formed the Narodnaya Volya ( People 's Will ) , while the leaders of the minority — Plekhanov , Zasulich and Axelrod — evolved toward Marxism , founding the first Russian Marxist organisation , the Emancipation of Labour group , in exile in 1883 .
In opposition to the Narodniks , the pioneer Russian Marxists argued that Russia had already entered the road of capitalist development , and that the principal task of Russian socialists was to organise the emerging urban working class as the leading force in the struggle against the despotic tsarist regime .
In his speech to the 1889 Paris international meeting of socialist parties , for example , Plekhanov argued :
In order to overthrow and finally destroy tsarism , we must rely on a more revolutionary element than student youth [ which was the real social base of Narodnism — dl ] , and this element , which exists in Russia , is the class of proletarians , a class which is revolutionary by reason of its distressing economic situation , revolutionary in its very essence .
In conclusion I repeat — and I insist on this important point — the revolutionary movement in Russia will triumph only as a working - class movement or else it will never triumph !
11
When Lenin became a Marxist in the early 1890s , Russia was undergoing a rapid process of capitalist industrialisation .
By the end of 1890s , Russia had become the world 's sixth largest industrial power , with some 6000 industrial plants , and ranked tenth in the world , just behind Italy , in per capita industrial production of goods .
In the thirty years between the early 1860s and 1890 , the number of industrial workers — wage - workers employed in large mills , mines and factories — doubled to 1.4 million .
In the 1890s , however , the rate of capitalist industrial growth accelerated enormously .
By end of that decade , the number of industrial workers had doubled again to about 2.8 million , which was about half the size of the industrial work force in the United States .
Almost sixty per cent of these workers were employed in large factories ( factories having more than 500 workers ) , which accounted for seventy per cent of the country 's total industrial output .
By comparison , enterprises employing more than 500 workers accounted for only one - third of the US industrial workforce .
Like Plekhanov 's Emancipation of Labour group , Lenin saw the principal task of Russian Marxists as building a revolutionary socialist party capable of leading the Russian working class in the struggle for democracy and socialism .
But more than any other Russian Marxist , he emphasised the enormous importance of the struggle for democracy — including the agrarian question — and its relationship to the struggle for socialism .
In an 1894 polemic against Narodnism , Lenin wrote :
In Russia the relics of medieval , semi- feudal institutions are still so enormously strong ( as compared with Western Europe ) , they are such an oppressive yoke upon the proletariat and the people generally , retarding the growth of political thought in all estates and classes , that one cannot but insist on the tremendous importance which the struggle against all feudal institutions , absolutism , the social estate system , and the bureaucracy has for the workers .
The workers must be shown in the greatest detail what a terribly reactionary force these institutions are , how they intensify the oppression of labour by capital , what a degrading pressure they exert on the working people , how they keep capital in its medieval forms , which , while not falling short of the modern industrial forms in respect of the exploitation of labour , add to that exploitation by placing terrible difficulties in the way of the fight for emancipation .
The workers must know that unless these pillars of reaction are overthrown , it will be utterly impossible for them to wage a successful struggle against the bourgeoisie because so long as they exist , the Russian rural proletariat , whose support is an essential condition for the victory of the working class , will never cease to be downtrodden and cowed , capable only of sullen desperation and not of intelligent and persistent protest and struggle .
And that is why it is the direct duty of the working class to fight side by side with the radical democracy against absolutism and the reactionary social estates and institutions — a duty which the Social - Democrats must impress upon the workers , while not for a moment ceasing also to impress upon them that the struggle against all these institutions is necessary only as a means of facilitating the struggle against the bourgeoisie , that the worker needs the achievement of the general democratic demands only to clear the road to victory over the working people 's chief enemy , over an institution that is purely democratic by nature , capital , which here in Russia is particularly inclined to sacrifice its democracy and to enter into alliance with the reactionaries in order to suppress the workers , to still further impede the emergence of a working - class movement .
12
Lenin concluded the polemic by summarising the perspective that was to guide his work for the next three decades :
The political activity of the Social - Democrats lies in promoting the development and organisation of the working - class movement in Russia , in transforming this movement ... into an organised struggle of the WHOLE Russian working CLASS directed against the bourgeois regime and working for the expropriation of the expropriators and the abolition of the social system based on the oppression of the working people .
Underlying these activities is the common conviction of Marxists that the Russian worker is the sole and natural representative of Russia 's entire working and exploited population .
Natural because the exploitation of the working people in Russia is everywhere capitalist in nature , if we leave out of account the moribund remnants of serf economy ; but the exploitation of the mass of producers is on a small scale , scattered and undeveloped , while the exploitation of the factory proletariat is on a large scale , socialised and concentrated .
Accordingly , it is on the working class that the Social - Democrats concentrate all their attention and all their activities .
When its advanced representatives have mastered the ideas of scientific socialism , the idea of the historical role of the Russian worker , when these ideas become widespread , and when stable organisations are formed among the workers so as to transform the workers ' present sporadic economic war into conscious class struggle — then the Russian WORKER , rising at the head of all the democratic elements , will overthrow absolutism and lead the RUSSIAN PROLETARIAT ( side by side with the proletariat of ALL COUNTRIES ) along the straight road of open political struggle to THE VICTORIOUS COMMUNIST REVOLUTION.13
The idea that only a party of class - conscious workers could provide consistent leadership to the working masses in the struggle to overthrow the tsarist autocracy and secure political liberty was in no way particular to Lenin .
As the manifesto adopted by the first congress of the RSDLP in 1898 demonstrated , this was the commonly held view at the time among the Russian Marxists .
The manifesto , written ironically by Pyotr Struve , the future political leader of the liberal bourgeoisie , observed :
The further to the east of Europe ( and Russia , as we know , is the east of Europe ) the weaker , more cowardly and baser in its political attitude is the bourgeoisie , and the greater the cultural and political tasks that fall to the proletariat .
The Russian working class must and will take upon its strong shoulders the task of winning political freedom .
This is a vital , but merely an initial step towards realising the great historical mission of the proletariat : namely , the creation of a social system in which there will be no exploitation of man by man .
The Russian proletariat will cast off the yoke of autocracy in order to pursue more energetically the struggle against capitalism and the bourgeoisie until the total victory of socialism .

Marxism and the peasantry
This statement and Plekhanov 's earlier 1889 statement that the overthrow of tsarism required a working - class revolution debunk the later contentions by liberal , Menshevik and Trotskyist writers that Mensheviks , including Plekhanov , were defending orthodox Marxism when they argued from 1905 onward that the objective conditions did not exist for a proletarian revolution in Russia .
This liberal myth is in turn based on another — that it was Marx and Engels ' view that proletarian revolutions would occur first in the most developed capitalist countries .
In fact , they expected the first proletarian revolutions to occur in less economically developed capitalist countries .
Thus , in the first programmatic statement of the proletarian socialist movement , the Communist Manifesto of 1848 , Marx and Engels did not call on the international communist vanguard to turn its attention to England , the most highly developed capitalist country not only in Europe but in the entire world , where uniquely the proletariat constituted a majority of the population , but to Germany , which at that time was one of the most backward capitalist countries of Europe , still under feudal rule :
The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany , because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth , and of France in the eighteenth century , and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution .
15
After the liberal bourgeoisie had betrayed the 1848 - 49 German bourgeois - democratic revolution — by supporting the feudal rulers ' military suppression of the peasants ' revolutionary war against the landed nobility —
Marx drew the conclusion that the complete victory of bourgeois - democratic revolution in Germany would require a proletarian revolution .
In a letter to Engels in 1856 , Marx wrote : " The whole thing in Germany will depend on the possibility of backing the proletarian revolution by a second edition of the Peasant War .
Then things will go splendidly .
"
16
This statement also demonstrates the falsity of another liberal myth , also first spun by the Mensheviks , namely that Lenin broke with orthodox Marxism by regarding the peasantry as a potential anti-capitalist revolutionary force , a potential ally in the proletariat 's struggle for socialism .
In fact , again it was Marx who first expounded this supposedly heterodox " Leninist " view .
Thus , in his 1850 work The Class Struggles in France 1848 to 1850 , Marx argued that a decisive factor in the defeat of the first attempted proletarian revolution , the revolutionary uprising of the Parisian workers in June 1848 , had been its failure to appeal to and enlist the French peasantry , who still constituted the big majority of France 's population at the time , in the anti-capitalist struggle .
" Only the fall of capital " , Marx wrote , " can raise the peasant , only an anti-capitalist , proletarian government can break his economic misery , his social degradation .
17
He returned to this point in his 1852 work The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte , arguing that with the complete abolition of feudal relations , the peasants would be subjected to economic ruination by big capital and that this would give them a material interest in taking joint action with the most powerful anti-capitalist social force , the urban wage workers .
" Hence the peasants " , Marx wrote , " find their natural ally and leader in the urban proletariat , whose task is the overthrow of bourgeois rule " .
Furthermore , Marx stressed that with the support of the peasants , " the proletarian revolution will obtain that chorus without which its solo song becomes a swan song in all peasant countries " .
18
It is certainly true that Lenin , more than any other Russian Marxist , stressed that a revolutionary worker - peasant alliance , led by a class - conscious workers ' party , was key to a successful struggle for democracy and socialism in Russia .
But in doing so , he was not departing from orthodox Marxism , but applying it and enriching it in the context of the concrete socio-economic conditions of tsarist Russia .
Monopoly capitalism
Bourgeois historians like to lay great stress on the fact that tsarist Russia was a country in which the peasantry constituted the big majority of the population , in order to affirm that in early twentieth century Russia the objective socio- economic conditions did not exist for an anti-capitalist revolution .
They downplay , and even deny , the fact that by the beginning of the twentieth century , capitalism had become the economically dominant system of production in Russia .
For example , in his 2001 book Lenin : The Practice and Theory of Revolution , James White , reader in Russian and east European history at Glasgow University , claims , " There is no doubt that Lenin came to power with abundant theoretical preparation , but in the event none of it proved of any great relevance .
If anything , it was a revolution made on false premises .
"
19
According to White , the chief false premise was the view that , by the beginning of the twentieth century , capitalism had become the dominant system of production in Russia .
In his 1899 book The Development of Capitalism in Russia , Lenin provided a detailed demonstration of this fact .
White , however , dismisses all the factual evidence assembled by Lenin in his book by claiming that since the categories of handicraft , manufacture and machine industry could also be found in Russia in the 1850s , " not a great deal had changed in the post - reform era .
The same categories of industrial undertaking , for example , can be found .
"
20
Then , in a demonstration of his own utter ignorance even of bourgeois economics ,
White presents the following refutation of Lenin 's analysis
Lenin's approach to the question is legalistic .
It is sufficient for him to show that the economic categories which Marx had used in his analysis of the capitalist system could be applied to Russia .
Thus , all economic phenomena are interpreted as manifestations of capitalism , in particular all goods produced for sale are regarded as commodities .
What is missing is some criterion for judging whether goods are or are not commodities .
White does not seem to have noticed that in the immediately preceding sentence he has already acknowledged that Lenin does provide such a criterion , the criterion used not only by Marxists but by bourgeois economics , that is , " all goods for sale are regarded as commodities " .
What Lenin demonstrated in his 1899 book was that capitalist production and circulation of commodities , production and circulation of commodities by wage labour , by workers employed by capitalist firms , dominated Russia 's economic life .
Concluding his refutation of Lenin 's analysis of the development of capitalism in Russia , White states :
Goods produced for sale would be commodities if production for the market were generalised , if commodity production were the system which prevailed .
But at the time Lenin was writing not even he would have maintained that capitalism was the predominant economic system in Russia .
21
But that is precisely what — only a few sentences earlier , White correctly acknowledges — Lenin set out to demonstrate in his 1899 book !
In fact , by the beginning of the twentieth century , not only was economic production in Russia subordinate to the international and domestic capitalist market , but Russian capitalism had — like the capitalisms of the other major industrial powers — entered capitalism 's imperialist stage — the stage in which the various branches of production are dominated by monopolistic associations of capitalists , by a small number of big capitalist corporations , what bourgeois , particularly US , economic analysts have subsequently called " corporate capitalism " .
Three corporations dominated the Russian oil industry ; a single one was in almost complete control of the production of railway carriages .
Another giant corporation marketed more than 80 per cent of Russia 's iron and steel output .
Behind these corporations stood a handful of giant banking corporations , which at the beginning of the century already controlled half of Russia 's steel output , sixty per cent of its coal and eighty per cent of its electrical goods production .
The rate of monopolisation in industry and banking in tsarist Russia was actually higher than in France and Britain , being behind only the rate in Germany and the United States .
While foreign capital , either as loans or direct investments , accounted for forty per cent of the total capital invested in Russian industry , unlike the colonial and semi-colonial countries , where foreign capitalist investment took direct control of branches of production that were peripheral to the development of domestically oriented production , foreign capitalist investment in Russia was in the key branches of domestically oriented industry and in partnership with the Russian monopolists .
Russo - Japanese War
Tsarist Russia was also a major colonial power , having an empire that , in population terms , was the third largest in the world — after Britain 's and France's .
Russia 's colonial possessions , however , were not overseas territories , but countries directly on its borders on the Baltic Sea , in eastern Europe and in central Asia .
At the end of the nineteenth century , the imperialist states began an intense struggle for mastery over China .
In 1898 , the tsarist government forced China to surrender the Liaodong Peninsula with its fortress and naval base at Port Arthur [ Lushun ] , opening the way for Russia to lay its hands on Manchuria and Korea .
The annexationist policy in the Far East brought Russia into direct collision with another imperialist predator , Japan , which sought to transform Korea and China into colonial possessions .
On the night of January 24 , 1904 , without declaring war , the Japanese navy attacked and set siege to Port Arthur .
The tsarist government welcomed the war , hoping that it could be used to whip up a patriotic fervour among the Russian masses that would stifle the growing , and potentially , revolutionary , opposition to the government among workers and peasants .
In early 1904 , the tsar 's minister of internal affairs was reported to have told a critic of the war : " You are not familiar with Russia 's internal situation .
We need a little victorious war to stem the tide of revolution .
"
22
However , the war that followed turned out to be neither " little " nor " victorious " for Russia , but a series of disasters for the ill - prepared and incompetently commanded tsarist navy and army .
The Japanese navy quickly sank most of the Russian Pacific Fleet .
An attempt by 300,000 Russian troops to break the siege of Port Arthur resulted in another disastrous defeat , 120,000 Russian soldiers being killed , wounded or taken prisoner in a single battle .
The war brought new sufferings to the Russian working people .
Indirect taxes , to fund the war , were sharply increased , causing consumer prices to soar .
The real wages of the workers dropped by twenty - five per cent , while hundreds of thousands of working - class and peasant families lost their primary breadwinners to military service .
As a result , the war was highly unpopular among the Russian masses .
The pro-war patriotic fervour that the tsarist government hoped the mass media would whip up failed to eventuate because the capitalist class , which owned most of the mass media , was from the outset not only opposed to the war , but stood for the tsarist regime 's defeat , hoping in this way to force political concessions out of it , particularly a constitution that would enable them to share political power with the landed nobility .
The bourgeoisie knew perfectly well that if Russia was victorious , the autocratic regime would be politically strengthened and any hope of it acceding to their calls for a constitution and a parliament — i.e. , the sharing of power between the landed nobility and the bourgeoisie — would be ruled out for years to come .
The series of disastrous defeats suffered by the tsar 's navy and army emboldened public opposition to the war and to the autocracy , hastening the outbreak of revolution .
In many towns large protest rallies — all of which were illegal — were held under the slogan " Down with the war ! " .
The capture of Port Arthur by Japan in December 1904 brought a fresh wave of antiwar street demonstrations across Russia .
This was the context in which the mass march took place on January 22 , 1905 .
The brutal attack on this march was the spark that ignited a wave of strikes and rallies in February , in which the main slogan was " Down with the autocracy ! "
Russia had entered the road of revolution , but this the revolutionary movement of 1905 failed to topple the tsarist regime .
Lessons drawn by Lenin
In the years after the revolution 's definitive defeat in June 1907 , Lenin devoted considerable time to analysing the reasons for this , so that the class - conscious Russian workers would be better prepared when the next revolutionary crisis erupted in Russia .
In his 1917 Zurich lecture , Lenin pinpointed the key reasons for the failure of the revolutionary upsurge to overthrow the autocratic government .
He noted that " the combination of the proletarian mass strikes in the cities with the peasant movement in the rural areas was sufficient to shake the `firmest ' and last prop of tsarism " , that is , the army .
Continuing , Lenin said :
The revolutionary ferment among the people could not but spread to the armed forces .
It is indicative that the leaders of the movement came from those elements in the army and the navy who had been recruited mainly from among the industrial workers and of whom more technical training was required , for instance , the sappers .
The broad masses , however , were still too naive , their mood was too passive , too good - natured , too Christian .
They flared up rather quickly ; any instance of injustice , excessively harsh treatment by the officers , bad food , etc. , could lead to revolt .
But what they lacked was persistence , a clear perception of aim , a clear understanding that only the most vigorous continuation of the armed struggle , only a victory over all the military and civil authorities , only the overthrow of the government and the seizure of power throughout the country could guarantee the success of the revolution .
Later in the lecture , Lenin pointed out that these weaknesses were true not just of the broad masses of workers and peasants in uniform , but of the broad masses of workers and peasants in general :
The movement spread to all sections of the people , and for the first time in Russia 's history involved the majority of the exploited .
But what it lacked was , on the one hand , persistence and determination among the masses — they were too much afflicted with the malady of trustfulness — and , on the other , organisation of revolutionary Social - Democratic workers in military uniform — they lacked the ability to take the leadership into their own hands , march at the head of the revolutionary army and launch an offensive against the government .
Hammering home this crucial lesson to his audience , Lenin remarked :
The history of the Russian revolution , like the history of the Paris Commune of 1871 , teaches us the incontrovertible lesson that militarism can never and under no circumstances be defeated and destroyed , except by a victorious struggle of one section of the national army against the other section .
It is not sufficient simply to denounce , revile and " repudiate " militarism , to criticise and prove that it is harmful ; it is foolish peacefully to refuse to perform military service .
The task is to keep the revolutionary consciousness of the proletariat tense and train its best elements , not only in a general way , but concretely , so that when popular ferment reaches the highest pitch , they will put themselves at the head of the revolutionary army .
Referring to massive wave of peasant revolts that swept Russia in the latter part of 1905 , Lenin drew out the same basic lesson :
Unfortunately , the peasants destroyed only one - fifteenth of the total number of landed estates , only one - fifteenth part of what they should have destroyed in order to wipe the shame of large feudal landownership from the face of the Russian earth .
Unfortunately , the peasants were too scattered , too isolated from each other in their actions ; they were not organised enough , not aggressive enough , and therein lies one of the fundamental reasons for the defeat of the revolution .
A little over a month after Lenin gave this lecture , a new revolution erupted in Russia .
This time the revolutionary Marxists , the Bolsheviks , entered the revolutionary struggle not with a few hundred relatively new and inexperienced members but with 23,000 battle - tested professional revolutionaries , who had thoroughly assimilated the lessons of the 1905 revolution .
In the course of the next nine months of revolutionary ferment , they recruited more than a quarter of a million new members to the Bolshevik Party , reflecting their success in imbuing the millions of workers and peasant soldiers with a level of proletarian class consciousness , persistence and determination sufficient to carry the proletarian revolution to victory .

The security forces have been accused of backing President Mugabe Zimbabwe 's " war veterans " militia plan to intimidate voters by posing as police officers during the presidential run-off , a policeman has told the BBC .
He said they would be based inside polling stations during the vote , whose date has not yet been fixed .
It has been confirmed that police have arrested two top trade union officials .
Meanwhile , South African President Thabo Mbeki , the lead negotiator on Zimbabwe , has left Harare after talks with President Robert Mugabe .
Zanu - PF are determined to continue ruling the country , and continue destroying it
Police officer
Harare diary : Suffering violence
A trade union official on Thursday said that 40,000 farm - workers and their relatives had fled their homes because of violent attacks .
The government has in turn accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) of staging political attacks , while saying the extent of the violence has been exaggerated .
But a South African election observer has said that the violence makes it impossible to hold a run- off .
' Uniforms issued '
The BBC's Orla Guerin met the police officer deep in Zimbabwe 's bush , as he was afraid of being identified .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement " The war veterans will be wearing police uniforms , " he said .
" They will be given ranks and force numbers .
They 'll be part and parcel of the police deployed in every ward .
" So when people come in to vote they will see war veterans from their area in among the police , and they will be intimidated . "
He said that preparations were at an advance stage - that the order to issue uniforms had already been given by provincial police headquarters .
Though opposed to the plan , he said he was powerless to stop it because if he objected he would be risking his life .
" Anything can happen , " he said .
" You can be abducted , or just disappear , or your family can be endangered .
You never know who is watching you .
You ca n't trust anyone in Zimbabwe . "
The opposition says its supporters are being systematically targeted
The police , he added , had been told to go out and campaign vigorously for Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party , and to remind people that they had won the country 's freedom through the barrel of a gun .
" They are trying to threaten people into voting for them , so they do not get off the throne , " he said .
" Zanu - PF are determined to continue ruling the country , and continue destroying it . "
According to this officer , there are many in the junior ranks of the police who talk privately about the need for change , but dare not speak out .
He said no - one could be certain of attitudes among the senior commanders , because they had benefited greatly under the ruling party .
Many of those who fought in the 1970s war of independence went on to become police officers and soldiers and remain deeply loyal to their war - time leader , Mr Mugabe .
But many of the so - called " war veterans " are too young to have fought in the war .
Trade unionists held Two leading Zimbabwean trade union officials have been arrested .
Lovemore Matombo and Wellington Chibebe from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) , which is close to the MDC , were detained after making anti-government speeches during rallies on May Day .
They are being held at Harare Central Police Station and are expected to be charged with inciting public violence .
Police say that they want them to substantiate claims that MDC supporters have been killed by ruling party supporters .
The MDC says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election outright and should be declared president .
According to official results , Mr Tsvangirai gained more votes than Mr Mugabe but not the 50 % needed for outright victory .
The run -off is supposed to be held within 21 days of the publication of the results - last Friday - but the electoral commission head has reportedly said it could be delayed for up to a year .

What are these ?
The following is reprinted from Bathroom Reader Plunges Into History Again Did you know that the word " cubicle " used to mean sleeping quarters ( actually , it still is for some people ) , " suit " came from the uniforms of stable servants , and " team " used to mean beasts of burden ?
Here are the origin of words you hear a lot in the office ... and after you read this , get back to work !
Boss
This word came from the Dutch word baas , meaning " master . "
But early americans did n't like using master - it was too aristocratic to survive as a general term .
So they started using " baas " in the late 18th century .
It caught on ( against the objections of some word snobs ) and eventually became " boss . "
Cubicle Dating back to the 1400s , this word stemmed from the Latin cubiculum , meaning " sleeping area " ( completely apropos ) .
It became obsolete after the 16th century , but it was revived in the 19th century as a word for " dormitory sleeping compartments . "
Its use as any partitioned space did n't surface until the 1920s .
Getting Fired
The phrase " fired out , " meaning to throw out or eject someone from a place , was first used in 1871 .
When the " out " was dropped a few years later , the phrase was narrowed to mean " dismissal of an employee . "
There 's a consensus among etymologists that both " fired " and " fired out " refer to the firing of a gun .
Learning the Ropes Before an old - time apprentice sailor could really help out on a big ship , he had to learn which ropes had what effect on which sails .
Before he did , he was n't much use to anyone .
After he " learned the ropes , " he could finally hoist the right mast - and avoid being flogged .
Logging On
This phrase 's predecessor was " logging in " ( sometimes still used interchangeably ) .
Back when mainframe computer operators used to go on shifts , they'd have to write everything they did in a paper log , beginning when they arrived .
So when you log on to a computer today , you 're signing in .
Memorandum From the Latin word " to be remembered , " it was originally a word written at the top of a note .
But by 1542 , it became the word for the note itself .
Rank and File
This phrase that refers to an organization 's mass of low - ranking peons has military origins : soldiers in formation marched side by side ( rank ) and one behind the other ( file ) .
Its first known usage was in 1598 .
Later , it became generalized to mean common soldiers and then further generalized to refer to common people .
Suit
The word dates back to the 1200s , to the funky English - French word siwte , referring to the uniform worn by the royal court 's stable servants .
It came to mean a more general set of clothes to be worn together in the 14th century .
As a derisive term for a businessman , it dates from 1979 , possibly from the hippie term for an FBI agent , circa the late 1960s .
The term " empty suit , " meaning a person of small intellect or personality , evolved in the 1980s .
Teamwork
The original Middle English meaning of team was applied to a group of draft animals yoked together .
Around 1828 , someone thought of combining the word " team " with the word " work " - probably hoping to spur sluggish workers into action .
So " teamwork " really mean working like one of many beasts of burden .
Depressing , huh ?
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union agreed on Thursday to scrap its sanctions against Cuba , EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner said .
“ Cuban sanctions will be lifted , ” she told reporters after foreign ministers of the 27 - nation bloc clinched agreement at a summit dinner in Brussels .
The EU measures were imposed after a crackdown on dissent in 2003 and include a freeze on visits by high - level officials .
The sanctions were suspended in 2005 .
Their full abolition was decided to encourage more reforms by President Raul Castro , who took over after the February 24 retirement of his brother Fidel .
Breaking law , Bush Administration fails to declassify 30 - year - old files Nick Juliano

Thirty years .
That 's how long it's taken the State Department to publish an accounting of US foreign relations .
And they 're not even done -- the Department is again going to miss a mandatory three - decade legal deadline to publish an accounting of its foreign relations activities .
" The ' Foreign Relations of the United States ' ( FRUS ) series , which is the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy , remains unlikely to meet the legal requirement that it be published no later than 30 years after the events that it describes , an official advisory committee has told the Secretary of State , " The Federation of American Scientists ' Steven Aftergood reported Tuesday .
 Despite many and repeated assurances that this problem would be addressed by 2010 , the committee is now very skeptical that the Office of the Historian will succeed in meeting the 30 - year requirement for the Foreign Relations series at any time within the next decade ,  the State Department Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation writes in its latest report .
" Compliance with the 30 year deadline is not optional ; it is a binding legal requirement , " Aftergood notes .
He cites a 1991 statute :  The Secretary of State shall ensure that the FRUS series shall be published not more than 30 years after the events recorded . "
Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice was admonished for the department 's failure to keep up with declassification rules by the advisory committee created in concert with that 1991 law .
" The committee , however , is disappointed to have to report on the continuing failure to meet the 30 - year requirement for the Foreign Relations series .
Although there are many factors that may have contributed to this failure  the always present concern with balancing secrecy and the publics right - to - know , possible shortages of personnel and / or resources , and recent presidential directives  they do n't even think they 'll be able to meet their deadline by 2010 .
Foot dragging the department apparently has affected morale and may lead to retirement of some career employees , Aftergood wrote .
" The committee must really be concerned for the report to be so explicit and emphatic ,  one former State Department official told Secrecy News .
Adds Aftergood : " In a delicate allusion to reports of morale problems in the Office of the Historian and the ensuing resignations of professional staff , the Advisory Committee strongly recommended that State Department Human Resources personnel " conduct mandatory exit interviews to determine the principal reasons behind the departure of skilled researchers . ' "
Of note : the State Department also plans to offer reduced coverage of US policy during the Reagan Administration -- if and when they eventually complete the report .
 The committee is concerned that despite a collection of 8.5 million classified pages in the Reagan Library , compared with the Nixon years  2.5 million pages , the Office plans substantially fewer volumes of the FRUS series ,  they wrote .
Not just the economy is sagging .
Cash - strapped folks are cutting back on body - firming services such as gym memberships , diets and cosmetic procedures .
Some 53 % of plastic surgeons say business has slowed , according to a recent survey by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery of nearly 700 members .
Cost is only one deterrent ; another is fear of time away from work for recovery in this job market , says Alan Gold , ASAPS president .
Cosmetic work at San Diego 's Scripps Mercy Surgery Pavilion — top choices are liposuction and breast augmentation — fell 30 % in the first quarter vs. a year ago , says executive director Steve Green .
" We are a luxury provider " and people have less discretionary money , says Richard D'Amico , president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons .
Yet , even cheaper " body work " has gone soft :
• Workouts .
Gym memberships , which average $ 35 per month , fell last year for the first time in more than a decade to 41.5 million from 42.7 million in 2006 , says the International Health Racquet & Sportsclub Association .
The fitness industry is not immune to " the credit crunch , increasing fuel and food prices , slowing employment and the housing crisis , " said IHRSA 's 2008 report in June .
• Diets .
Nestlé Nutrition CEO
Richard Laube told investors in June that its Jenny Craig diet program is " seeing some of the economic dampening in the U.S. "
Growth is " not at the 30 % to 40 % rates that we had seen in the first few months " of the year .
The plan 's food costs an average of $ 100 a week .
• Cosmetic procedures .
Cheaper , more temporary help such as Botox injections are the growth leaders in cosmetic procedures , a $ 12.4 billion business in the USA last year .
" More and more people are going to non-surgical alternatives and postponing surgery , " says Grant Stevens , a plastic surgeon in Marina del Rey , Calif .
A report by Cowen and Co. analyst Eli Kammerman sees demand for breast implant maker Mentor " continuing to be slow for the next two quarters at least . "
Mentor shares are down 33 % this year , closing Tuesday at $ 26.55 .
D'Amico says he thinks most people are only delaying cosmetic surgery plans .
" The specialty will weather the current decline in economic growth just as previous declines , such as the stock market correction after the Internet bubble . "
One bright spot in the nip - and - tuck business :
Thanks to the dollar 's drop , New York City plastic surgeon John Sherman is seeing more euro - and pound - spending patients from abroad .
" As the dollar got weaker , suddenly expensive New York plastic surgeons are n't as expensive anymore . "

The U.S. government continually claims that it does not torture people , yet it admits to using “ waterboarding ” as a method of interrogation .
If there was ever a debate about whether or not waterboarding was a form of torture then it has now been definitively answered .
Neo -Con author and journalist Christopher Hitchens , a former Trotskyite turned staunch Iraq war proponent , underwent the lightest form of waterboarding possible and at the end of it still concluded , “ Believe Me , It ’s Torture ” .
Writing in Vanity Fair , Hitchens described the experience .
In this pregnant darkness , head downward , I waited for a while until I abruptly felt a slow cascade of water going up my nose .
Determined to resist if only for the honor of my navy ancestors who had so often been in peril on the sea , I held my breath for a while and then had to exhale and — as you might expect — inhale in turn .
The inhalation brought the damp cloths tight against my nostrils , as if a huge , wet paw had been suddenly and annihilatingly clamped over my face .
Unable to determine whether I was breathing in or out , and flooded more with sheer panic than with mere water , I triggered the pre-arranged signal and felt the unbelievable relief of being pulled upright and having the soaking and stifling layers pulled off me .
I find I do n’t want to tell you how little time I lasted .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Now watch the video and compare it to a real waterboarding situation likely to be experienced by one of the goat herders , taxi drivers or teenage kids rounded up and incarcerated at Gitmo or Abu Ghraib .
The most terrifying aspect of waterboarding , according to accepted definitions , is that the victim experiences the strong sensation that he is drowning and near death .
In contrast , Hitchens is constantly reassured that he can stop the exercise at any point not only by dropping steel implements but also by uttering the code word .
Detainees at Abu Ghraib would not enjoy the same privilege , and would be undergoing the experience in the knowledge that fellow inmates had already been tortured to death .
In addition , water is gently trickled onto Hitchens ’ head in contrast to how it would gush down upon a “ terror suspect ” while they were screamed at and also brutally restrained by interrogators .
After a matter of seconds , Hitchens drops the steel implements and the mock interrogators help him to recover .
The wider point here is that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged “ mastermind ” of 9/11 , underwent the same process in entirely different circumstances .
This is why he admitted to being responsible for all manner of things , only stopping short of claiming culpability for killing Kennedy , creating AIDS and being the real Santa Claus .
As Hitchens notes , “ Even the C.I.A. sources for the Washington Post story on waterboarding conceded that the information they got out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was “ not all of it reliable , ” underscoring the point that torture has no benefit other than further disgracing America ’s name , conditioning the public to accept a government that tortures , and putting American POW ’s in more danger in the future .

Miley 's Myspace pics caused a storm of controversy , and criticism continued with an Annie Liebovitz photo shoot for Vanity Fair magazine in which the teen pop star posed topless .
This came on the heels of another controversy for Disney , when nude photos of High School Musical teen star Vanessa Hudgens surfaced .
Allie and her girlfriends ham it up for the camera in these bikini pictures that have been " leaked " online .

In early 2004 , John was living it up in Argentina at a startup working on a VCI product .
For those unfamiliar with Value Chain Integration , in layman 's terms it synergizes backward overflow while optimizing cardinal grammeters in addition to allowing customers to parabolize slithy toves at the least embiggoned cost possible .
The software 's development was handled in Argentina , though there were offices around the globe .
They were just starting to pull together a real , live QA team to replace the last QA team ( one guy in one of the US offices ) .
They were happily building their software , expanding the team , burning through their VC capital , and entertaining dreams of a huge IPO .
It did n't take long to assemble a full QA team — everyone was excited to work at a startup that was so full of potential .
After some brief training , the new QA team was turned loose to do their worst to the in -development application .
In a few days , the bug list had more than quadrupled in size .
Developers cranked out fixes , and the testers found more bugs .
One issue that kept cropping up was that email alerts were unpredictable .
Sometimes the alerts would arrive immediately , sometimes they 'd come several hours later than they were supposed to , and more often than not the tester just would n't receive emails at all .
After reading the bug report 's heading , John sighed .
The email alert issue ... again .
Different members of the dev team had investigated the issue , checked in little changes , only for the issue to crop back up a few days later .
They 'd pored over the code time and time again , and could n't find any reason that the application would fail at sending emails .
We 've got to settle this once and for all , John thought .
The case had been opened by one of the newer recruits on the QA team , Fred .
John got up and walked to Fred 's desk for a demonstration .
" OK , have a look , " Fred said .
He filled out a form and clicked a button , then Alt - Tabbed to his email .
" So I should have an email now , right ? "
He hammered the send / receive button .
Nothing .
Damn , John thought , hoping the bug would n't be reproducible and he could just close the issue and pretend it never happened .
John returned to his desk and ran the same test , and it failed again .
This has to be a config -
On the verge of a breakthrough , John 's thoughts were cut short by his ringing phone .
It was a call from the US , but strangely not from one of their US offices .
John : This is John .
Polly : Yeah , hi , my name is Polly .
I 'm calling because I want you to stop spamming us .
John : ... spamming you ?
Polly : According to the CAN - SPAM
Act of 2003 , any and all electronic mail messages -
John : I 'm sorry , Polly , I think you may have the wrong number .
We 're a tech startup , and we do n't do any bulk mailings .
Polly :
Does your company own and operate the mail server mail .[ company ].com ?
John :
Yes , we do , but -
Polly : But nothing !
In the last twelve hours we 've recieved ... over seven thousand emails from you !
John :
Are you sure it 's from u-
Polly :
And they 're still coming in !
Our mail server keeps crashing every time we bring it back online !
The CAN - SPAM
Act is very specific abou -
John :
Wait , I 'm sorry , I think I know what 's happening .
Give me five minutes .
During the brief conversation , John was checking up on their mail server , opening a few logs , and checking up on the outbound queue .
What he saw was startling .
There were 109,311 messages queued for delivery to test@sdfjgi.com .
All of which originated from Fred 's system .
During some stress testing , Fred had gotten annoyed and overwhelmed by an avalanche of email alerts ; often amassing thousands of emails per minute .
As a quick fix so that he could test without destroying his inbox , Fred opened up a web browser and mashed his keyboard to get a random domain name — sdfjgi.com ( changed to protect the innocent ) .
When he opened it in a web browser and got a 404 , he assumed that meant the domain was unregistered , and that it was therefore safe to bombard sdfjgi.com with tens of thousands of emails .
After the embarrassing incident , they realized that they could make some serious cash if they switched from VCI software into spamming , so that 's exactly what they did .
Just kidding , they added an option to turn off email alerts and continued testing .
Kennedy :
No veep slot for Clinton
It 's fun to think about , but there are so many obstacles , and Ted Kennedy is n't buying , he said on Bloomberg Television 's " Political Capital With Al Hunt , " which airs this weekend .
" I do n't think it 's possible , " he told Hunt of the joint ticket , continuing that :
Obama should choose a running mate who " is in tune with his appeal for the nobler aspirations of the American people , " Kennedy said .
" If we had real leadership — as we do with Barack Obama — in the No. 2 spot as well , it'd be enormously helpful . "
Ouch .
UPDATE : Kennedy spokesman Anthony Coley says in a statement :
Senator Kennedy thinks Senator Clinton is more than qualified to be Vice President , but does n't think it 's likely given the tenor of the campaign in recent weeks .

At the drop of a hat , it seems , almost anything can predictably get me worked up about inflation , and I was just getting ready to , you know , go freaking ballistic about how the damned Federal Reserve has condemned us to the Hell Of Inflationary Horror That Makes The Mogambo Scream His Guts Out In Terror ( HOIHTMTMSHGOIT ) with its insane - yet - irresponsible over - creation of money and credit for all these long lonely decades ( and especially so since 1997 ! ) , when Barron 's cuts me off by noting that " a recent analysis of oil prices over the past 50 years , adjusted for the increase in the money supply as measured by a gauge known as M3 " , shows that " the price of a barrel of petroleum today should be LOWER than it was in 1959 " .
And why is n't crude oil today priced lower than at anytime in the last half of a freaking century , but instead is a zillion times higher ?
I think to myself , " That question is easy !
It 's because the damned Congress ( except Ron Paul ) let the damned Federal Reserve create so much money and credit , so insanely much money and credit , so freaking damned insanely much money and credit that the purchasing power of the dollar was destroyed in the process , and that means that things priced in dollars will go up in price , such as oil , as we see here ! "
Naturally , I was startled and surprised that I knew the answer to a question !
After all these long , lonely years of teachers calling on me in class and asking me some stupid questions to which I had no answer - or even any clue !
But where I learned that , like all cornered , paranoid rats , I instinctively get vicious and belligerent , snarling and biting , ruthlessly clawing my way out of the situation .
But now , at last , I know the answer !
I raise my hand to get permission to speak so that I can show off , but then I figure , " What 's the point ?
Nobody will believe the Austrian school of economics after all these decades , especially after every one of them has been indoctrinated in that whole neo-Keynesian , ' deficits do n't matter ' , ' inflation does n't matter ' , ' lowering - interest - rates - works - every time without limit ' , econometric crapola of a stupid , stupid , stupid economic theory , which is my excuse for wasting my health and my life by getting drunk and having a ruined family life . "
So you can imagine that I was pretty despondent , in that I knew the answer , but resigned myself to being ignored again .
Instead , imagine my delight and surprise that Barron 's correctly " lays the blame for surging petro prices squarely at the feet of Uncle Sam , particularly the Federal Reserve " !
Hooray for Barron's !
Again , I am despondent because it shows that Barron 's no longer needs me to call them up and yell into the phone , " We 're freaking doomed , you bozos , because the Fed is creating so damned much money and credit that a roaring inflation will descend upon us !
Why do n't you alert the nation , or put me on the cover and I 'll do it for you , you morons ! "
Well , maybe I finally got through to them , or maybe they got smart because the cover of this week 's Economist magazine screams out " Inflation 's back " , but with the qualifier " but not where you think " , which is their clever way of saying that America and Europe are not the centers of the universe , but that " Double - digit prices rises are about to afflict two - thirds of the world 's population . "
The Economist dryly notes , " the average world inflation rate has risen to 5.5 % " , because central bankers made a mistake " to hold monetary policy too loose " , which brings up the pivotal point that " it is worrying that global monetary policy is now at its loosest since the 1970s : the average world real interest rate is negative . "
Hahaha !
Negative !
It 's " worrying " , they say !
Hahaha !
Monetary policy is so loose that real interest rates ( the nominal interest rate less the rate of inflation ) are less than zero , and they think it is " worrying " ?
Hahahaha !
Talk about British reserve and understatement !
Hahahaha !
Wow !
The net result is that not only is this self - serving , world - wide spider 's web of " investment professional " cretins tying up everyone 's money for up to 30 years or more , at yields that are at record lows , so that for the rest of your life you are derisively known around the office as " old buy - at - the - top " , but they are also guaranteeing that you will suffer a huge , huge net loss as the market price of your debt goes down as interest rates rise !
And you think that interest rates are NOT going to climb dramatically , handing huge , huge , HUGE freaking losses to any idiot stupid enough to own debt that is so grossly , grossly , grossly over - priced ?
Do you actually , really , truly believe that interest rates will always stay below the rate of inflation ?
Hahahaha !
Stop it !
My sides are hurting from laughing !
Hahahaha !

Well , the recent Ruby 1.8.6 issues , including an apparent memory leak problem that was plaguing my blog ’s mongrel caused me to evaluate what should have been obvious long ago .
That I should put my money where my mouth is and upgrade to JRuby on Glassfish using JRuby - Rack and Warbler .
And so it ’s done .
I ’m now running the blog in Glassfish V2 with JRuby 1.1.1 and JRuby - Rack 0.9 ( facilitated by Warbler 0.9.9 ) , along with activerecord - jdbc- adapter 0.8.2 .

OK , OK , kinda misleading headline - his production company is producing " Atari " a biopic about Nolan Bushnell , Pong 's developer and Atari 's founder .
Paramount bought the rights yesterday .
Indications are that he will star , but not knowing the story yet , I do n't know if that means he would play Bushnell or , perhaps , another character through whom the story of Bushnell and Atari is presented .

The Hollywood Reporter describes " Atari " as drawing on themes of " Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , " and " Tucker : The Man and His Dream . "
I was hoping it'd be a movie adaptation of " Space War " - just two ships drifting to the center of the screen , shooting each other .
Maybe a love interest .
Somewhere .
Maybe not .
Wherever the story ends up , it sounds like it 's getting very serious treatment , and the outlook sounds favorable for a well made biography .
Plus I love period pieces , even if I 've lived in the period described .

Swedish researchers have found that some physical attributes of the homosexual brain resemble those found in the opposite sex , according to an article published online ( June 16 ) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Some psychological tests have shown differences between men and women in the extent to which they employ the brain ’s hemispheres in verbal tasks .
Other research has hinted that homosexuals may exhibit the tendencies of the opposite sex in brain behavior unrelated to sexual activity .
Ivanka Savic and Per Lindström , of the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden , now report that the brains of heterosexual men and homosexual women are slightly asymmetric — the right hemisphere is larger than the left — and the brains of gay men and straight women are not .
Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans taken by the researchers also show that in connectivity of the amygdala ( which is important for emotional learning ) , lesbians resemble straight men , and gay men resemble straight women .
The researchers analyzed the brains of 90 subjects , using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to assess brain volume and PET data partly gleaned from previous olfactory studies .
One possible interpretation of the connectivity pattern in straight men and lesbians is that the amygdala is wired for a greater fight - or - flight response , the authors say .
The Earth has entered a new geological epoch because man-made changes to the climate are having a dramatic and long - term impact on the land and the oceans , a study has found .
A team of geologists believes that humans have altered the Earth so much since the start of the industrial revolution that we are now living in a new epoch called the Anthropocene , which began when the previous Holocene epoch ended in about 1800 .
The geologists have proposed that the new epoch should be formally recognised by the international body governing geological terms .
" On our exploration of the evidence , there 's potential justification for the use of the new term , " said Jan Zalasiewicz , of the University of Leicester and chairman of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London .
" The surface environmental processes of the Earth are sufficiently different from pre-industrial times that the Earth 's geology has in fact changed . "

The geologists believe that human activity over the past 200 years has transformed the worldwide patterns of sediment erosion and deposition , disturbed the carbon cycle and global temperatures , triggered a mass extinction of animals and plants , and has caused the acidification of the oceans .
Dr Zalasiewicz said the dominance of humans had physically changed the Earth so much that there was little justification for believing that we are still in the Holocene epoch , which began when global temperatures rose at the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago .
The Anthropocene , meaning " human influenced " , was coined in 2002 by the Nobel chemistry laureate Paul Crutzen .
With food and fuel costs soaring and the financial costs of global warming becoming reality , a new cure - all prescription has emerged :
The average American should eat less .
And with a new University of Illinois report forecasting even higher food prices next year , the suggestion could become an inevitable way of life for people on tight budgets .
It would of course have the added benefit of trimming waistlines and improving health , which would provide additional savings in reduced health care costs .
And cutting back would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , scientists point out , helping reduce the billion - dollar price tags put on damage and woe predicted to come with a warming world .
Fat and unhappy
Roughly 19 percent of U.S. energy consumption goes toward producing and supplying food , David Pimentel and his colleagues at Cornell University write in the current issue of the journal Human Ecology .
Considering that the average American consumes an estimated 3,747 calories a day , — at least 1,200 more than health experts advise — the researchers suggest everyone cut back .
Animal products and junk food , in particular , use more energy and other resources for their production than staples such as potatoes , rice , fruits and vegetables .
Producing all the stuff that goes into a single hamburger , for example , requires some 1,300 gallons of water , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
A study in 2006 by University of Chicago researchers Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin found that a vegetarian diet is the most energy - efficient , followed by one that includes poultry .
Diets with red meat or fish are the least efficient .
" By just reducing junk food intake and converting to diets lower in meat , the average American could have a massive impact on fuel consumption as well as improving his or her health , " Pimentel and his team write in a statement released today .
The idea is not brand new .
As LiveScience 's Bad Science columnist Benjamin Radford put it earlier this year : " If you really want to help save the Earth , you can start by dropping a few pounds . "
You may have to cut back
Meanwhile , prices at the grocery store could force changes in consumption .
Soaring energy prices will yield sharp increases for corn and soybean production next year , according a separate study announced today .
Fertilizer prices are expected to surge 82 percent for corn and 117 percent for soybeans , said Gary Schnitkey , an agricultural economist at University of Illinois .
" Roughly 80 percent of the cost of producing nitrogen fertilizer is natural gas , so as natural gas costs have gone up so have the costs of those inputs , " he said .
Rising fuel prices also mean it costs more to harvest and transport food .
While farmers will likely absorb some of the added costs , Schnitkey says consumers also should expect to pay more for products ranging from cereals and syrups to grain - fed beef .
" There 's not going to be a reduction back to lower food costs as long as we have these higher production costs , " Schnitkey said .
" Energy prices are driving a lot of what 's going on and ultimately that hits the consumer . "
Additional savings
If people ate less , and therefore fossil fuel consumption declined , other savings could ensue .
For instance , a third study coincidentally also out today finds that global warming , fueled by greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of fossil fuels , is costing money in the United States and that situation will grow worse .
The scientists argue that costs will be in the billions for each of the eight states included in the study : Colorado , Georgia , Kansas , Illinois , Michigan , Nevada , New Jersey and Ohio .
California and other well - studied states were not included .
The losses will be due in part to water resource issues , coastal flooding , health effects and reduced tourism .
" We do n't have a crystal ball and can't predict specific bottom lines , but the trend is very clear for these eight states and the nation as a whole : Climate change will cost billions in the long run and the bottom line will be red , " said Matthias Ruth , who coordinated the research and directs the Center for Integrative Environmental Research at the University of Maryland .
" Inaction or delayed action will make the ink run redder . "
The study was funded by the Environmental Defense Fund .
You 're in control
The Cornell study led by Pimentel argues that the consumer is in the strongest position to contribute to a reduction in energy use .
" As individuals embrace a ' greener ' lifestyle , an awareness of the influence their food choices have on energy resources might be added encouragement for them to buy good , local produce and avoid highly processed , heavily packaged and nutritionally inferior food , " the scientists write .
" As well as leading to a cleaner environment , this would also lead to better health . "
Scientists say cutting calories is one of the sure - fire ways to extend the human life span .

The following table details the situation in six of the worst hit provinces .
Production and GDP figures are for the end of 2007 , all power figures are in gigawatts ( GW ) .
SHANXI PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 33.9 Pct of national GDP : 2.3 Forecast Shortage ( GW ) : 5.0 Total Power Capacity ( GW ) : 34.4 Power Fuel Use : Largely coal Metals Production Profile : Produces nearly 9 percent of China 's aluminium , and 5 percent of China 's crude steel .
Industrial Profile : Top coal and big metals producer .
Remedy : Rationing .
This northern Chinese province is too poor , and its industry too energy - thirsty for diesel generators to be a realistic option .
It has little hydropower and no neighbours with surplus power for imports .
SHAANXI PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 37.5 Pct of national GDP : 2.2 Forecast Shortage ( GW ) : 1.3 Total Power Capacity ( GW ) : 11.5 * Power Fuel Use : Largely coal Metals Production Profile : Small amounts of crude steel and non-ferrous metals output .
Industrial Profile : Significant coal resources Remedy : Rationing .
Like neighbouring Shanxi , it has little alternative when its supplies run low .
GUANGDONG PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 94.5
Pct of national GDP : 12.4 Forecast Shortage ( GW ) : 6.5 Total Power Capacity * ( GW ) : 68.0 Power Fuel Use : Hydropower , fuel oil , coal , natural gas and nuclear power .
Metals Production Profile : About 2 percent of China 's steel .
Industrial Profile : Leading export , manufacturing hub .
Remedy : Guangdong can increase fuel oil generation when supplies run low , it imports hydropower from neighbouring provinces and many of its factories have their own individual diesel generators .
It still rations power however .
SHANDONG PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 93.7
Pct of national GDP : 10.5 Forecast Shortage ( GW ) : 7.6 Total Power Capacity ( GW ) : 55.4 Power Fuel Use : Mostly coal , growing number of wind farms and some hydropower .
Metals Production Profile : About 9 percent of China 's steel Industrial Profile : Big agricultural base , significant manufacturing base with strong links to S. Korea and Japan .
Remedy : Shandong is taking advantage of its coastline to boost wind power , and as a relatively big coal producer it can try and keep more of its output within provincial borders .
Diesel generators are an option for some .
ZHEJIANG PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 33.9
Pct of national GDP : 3.0 Forecast Shortage ( GW ) : >3.0 Total Power Capacity ( GW ) : 33.7 * Power Fuel Use : Natural gas , coal Metals Production Profile : Some steel products Industrial Profile : Major manufacturing hub known for small , privately owned factories .
Remedy : Rationing , diesel generators SICHUAN PROVINCE Population ( mln ) : 81.3
Pct of national GDP : 4.3 Forecast Shortage : 2.0 Total Power Capacity : 30.3 Power Fuel Use : Hydropower , coal .
Metals Production Profile : Major zinc and lead producer Industrial Profile : Big agricultural production base , especially for pork .
Rich in natural gas and hydropwer .
Not a major export hub .
Remedy : Sichuan -- usually a net power exporter -- is importing power from its neighbours after a massive earthquake in May devastated swathes of the province , destroying or putting out of action mines and dams .
* This figure covers only generating capacity connected to the provincial grid , leaving out small - scale generation and stand - alone plants that supply local users only .

The neurotransmitter serotonin , which acts as a chemical messenger between nerve cells , plays a critical role in regulating emotions such as aggression during social decision - making , new research by scientists at England ’s University of Cambridge and UCLA suggests .
Their findings appear June 6 in the peer - reviewed journal Science .
Serotonin has long been associated with social behavior , and low levels of serotonin are associated with depression and anxiety , but its precise involvement in impulsive aggression has been controversial .
Though many scientists have hypothesized a link between serotonin and impulsivity , this is one of the first studies to show a causal link between the two .
The findings highlight why some of us may become combative or aggressive when we have not eaten .
The essential amino acid necessary for the body to create serotonin can only be obtained through diet ; our serotonin levels naturally decline when we do n’t eat .
The research also provides insight into clinical disorders characterized by low serotonin levels , such as depression and obsessive - compulsive disorder , and may help explain some of the social difficulties associated with these disorders .
UCLA scientists reported in April that the human brain responds to being treated fairly the same way it responds to winning money and eating chocolate ; being treated fairly turns on the brain ’s reward circuitry .
In the new Science study , they and their Cambridge colleagues report that people with low serotonin levels were found to be more sensitive to being treated unfairly .
The Science study involved 20 subjects , 14 of them female , with an average age of 25 .
As in the April study , published in the journal Psychological Science , participants were presented with fair and insulting offers for dividing sums of money .
If they declined , neither they nor the person making the offer would receive anything .
Some of the offers were fair , such as receiving 5 Brisith pounds out of 10 or out of 12 , while others were unfair , such as receiving 5 pounds out of 23 .
In this study , however , after initially responding to the offers , participants were given a drink that significantly reduced their serotonin levels .
They were then presented with the offers again .
When their serotonin levels were reduced , they rejected 82 percent of the unfair offers ; when their serotonin levels were normal , they rejected only 67 percent of the unfair offers .
Thus , people with low serotonin levels were more likely to reject unfair offers .
“ The same person may experience the same thing as fair and unfair on different days based on how the neurochemistry of the brain is functioning , ” said study co-author Matthew D. Lieberman , UCLA associate professor of psychology and a founder of social cognitive neuroscience .
“ When we feel something is unfair , that may have to do with how our brain causes us to experience the world .
Our subjects are not aware their serotonin levels are affecting the way they experience the world .
This suggests we should be more forgiving of other people ’s perspectives . ”
“ A sense of fair play is not a purely rational process , ” he added .
“ It seems not to be the case that , like a math formula , if something is fair , it ’s fair for all time , in all situations . ”
Imagine someone created an award ceremony for every possible use of paper , with awards for the best supermarket tabloid , the most disingenuous autobiography by a former government official , the most comprehensive bibliography and the best folding for a paper airplane .
That ’s what the Webby Awards are like , just substitute the Internet for paper .
In a cavernous former bank branch on Wall Street , more than 100 winners in the 12th annual Webby awards trotted to the stage .
They were honored in such categories as best home / welcome page , best insurance site and the ever - competitive best self - promotion / portfolio .
( Yet another ceremony was held Monday night for Web video awards . )
The whole thing was conducted with the mix of ironic detachment and campy devotion to awards that you would expect from a group of downtown Web designers who check TMZ at every Red Bull break .
The Webby Awards were founded in 1996 by IDG ’s now long - defunct The Web magazine and is currently owned by a group of private investors .
It is a profit - making venture that charges as much as $ 475 to enter and earns more from tickets , sponsorships and program ads .
At Slate , Jack Schafer dismisses the awards , writing “ I ’ve heard of mail - order diploma mills that are more exclusive than the Webbys . ”
I might add the four - hour affair was singularly disconnected from any of the topics that seem to dominate the Internet world these days .
For example , the concept of search was not mentioned .
And Google , to pick one company that has been known to create interesting Web sites from time to time , was not represented among the nominees .
You might well call them the “ WebOnePointOhsies . ”
If the awards had been given in Palo Alto , I might imagine categories for best object to throw at someone on Facebook , best service to tell the world what you ’re ordering for lunch , and , new this year , best defense against a trouble - making hedge fund .
I would be remiss in pointing out that some very worthy companies won awards for great work .
The winner of the most awards was NYTimes.com ( with eight awards ) , followed by the Onion ( seven awards ) and then Post Secret , National Geographic and Apple.com ( four each ) .
Despite any griping , the ceremony was an affable affair , hosted by Seth Meyers of “ Saturday Night Live , ” who provided a quick - witted foil to the stream of earnest entrepreneurs , befuddled executives and assorted eccentrics modeling the latest innovations in thick black eyewear .
As the winners in each category assembled in a curtained - off waiting area , Mr. Meyers rattled off his nominees for runners - up such as , Pimpmygoldfish.com , Doesthismolelookfunny.org and Areyoumydad.gov .
The central gimmick of the program is that each winner must make an acceptance speech of exactly five words .
( “ If you use four words , the extra word does not roll over to next year , ” Mr. Meyers said . )
Here are a few of the highlights .
( The people accepting the awards were not named , but I know some of them .
If you know any others , send them in . )
For Best Political Blog , Huffington Post ( Arianna Huffington ) : “ President Obama sounds good , right . ”
For Law , the ABA Journal : “ Had we lost , we ’d sue . ”
For Lifestyle , Epicurious : “ The icing on the cake . ”
For Pharmaceuticals , Estroven : “ Hot flashes are cool , too . ”
For Humor , I Can Has Cheezburger ?
( Ben Huh ) : “ We haz too webbyz ?
Kthxbai !!1 ! ”
For Mobile News , Mobile New York Times ( Jim Roberts ) : “ Please help us monetize this ”
Of course , the winner of the Webby Person of the Year , Stephen T. Colbert , crystallized the spirit of the evening , the Internet industry and the national mood in his five words : “ Me. Me. Me. Me. Me . ”
America 's mortgage crisis has spiralled into " the largest financial shock since the Great Depression " and there is now a one - in - four chance of a full - blown global recession over the next 12 months , the International Monetary Fund warned today .
The US is already sliding into what the IMF predicts will be a " mild recession " but there is mounting pessimism about the ability of the rest of the world to escape unscathed , the IMF said in its twice - yearly World Economic Outlook .
Britain is particularly vulnerable , it warned , as it slashed its growth targets for both the US and the UK .
The report made it clear that there will be no early resolution to the global financial crisis .
" The financial shock that erupted in August 2007 , as the US sub - prime mortgage market was derailed by the reversal of the housing boom , has spread quickly and unpredictably to inflict extensive damage on markets and institutions at the heart of the financial system , " it said .
After warning earlier this week that the world 's financial firms could end up shouldering $ 1 trillion ( £ 500 bn ) worth of losses from the credit crunch , the IMF said it expects the US to achieve GDP growth of just 0.5 % this year , and 0.6 % in 2009 , with the housing crash getting even worse .
Simon Johnson , the IMF 's director of research , said later the key risk to the forecasts was the danger of a vicious circle emerging , as house prices continue to fall , dealing a fresh blow to the banks , and exacerbating the problems in the markets .
" Sentiment in financial markets has improved in recent weeks since the Federal Reserve 's strong actions with regard to investment banks .
But we have seen how strains in markets can quickly become reinforcing , and the possibility of a negative spiral or ' financial decelerator ' remains a possibility . "
President George Bush has already signed off a $ 150 bn tax rebate package to kick - start the economy , and the Federal Reserve has backed an emergency buyout of investment bank Bear Stearns , but the IMF said this may still not be enough : " Room may need to be found for some additional support for housing and financial markets . "
In the UK , the chancellor has repeatedly insisted that the economy is " better - placed " to weather the storm , because of its flexible labour market and low unemployment , but the IMF calculated that the British housing market is overvalued by up to 30 % , and could be destined for a damaging correction .
Alistair Darling is due to fly to Washington tomorrow to discuss the turmoil with fellow G7 finance ministers .
Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , will also be in Washington this weekend to discuss the ramifications of the credit crunch with central bankers from around the world .
· This article was amended on Friday April 11 2008 .
We said that the IMF expects the US to achieve GDP growth of 0.6 % in 2008 , when this is actually their prediction for 2009 growth .
This has been corrected .
As many major financial groups are now centered around London , New Yorkers find themselves wondering exactly how this all came about .
There are a number of reasons why London has become a stronger financial center , and they ’re often surprising .
Here ’s we ’ll take a look at a few that you may not have considered .
Geographic location : London ’s location offers an advantage as a financial center .
It ’s in the middle of everything , literally .
With America on the left and Asia on the right , it ’s easier than New York when it comes to both travel and time zones .
" Wimbledonisation " :
It ’s joked that London can host a great tennis tournament , but ca n’t win it themselves , as the last British win came in 1936 .
This phenomenon , however , has worked towards London ’s financial advantage .
London brought US banks to their financial table , but did n’t have the workforce to back it up , resulting in an influx of European immigrants with financial expertise to London .
Visas : Since 9/11 , it ’s been difficult to get visas for foreign workers or even vistors on business trips to come to New York .
In contrast , London ’s visas are much more easy to come by , creating a situation in which it ’s more favorable for foreign financial entities and employees to do business with firms in London .
Financial regulation :
After scandals like Enron , the financial industry is more heavily regulated .
The Sarbanes - Oxley
Act required lots of tightening of financial controls .
As a result , it ’s less attractive to do business in a country where every transaction is scrutinized .
Patriot Act and Dept. of Homeland Security : After 9/11 , US security was tightened quite a bit .
That means there ’s less openness with foreign transactions , travel , and more .
In contrast , London is easier to deal with .
Time zones :
Who wants to keep weird hours ?
London ’s time zone is more favorable for many world areas .
Investors , generally outside of the US , who want to keep more regular hours trade on London time .
International flavor : With London ’s immigrant financial workforce and relatively open work and travel visas , the city ’s financial makeup is very internationally diverse .
Last year , a Russian pipe manufacturer chose to list with London ’s stock exchange rather than NYSE because it ’s " very internationally flavored , " a sentiment that is likely echoed by many others with financial interests .
Euro zone : Although London is not a part of it , the euro zone has attracted financial interests to Europe .
The strengthening of the currency is good for finance in Europe , including London .
Tax rules : Britain has flexible tax rules when it comes to foreign nationals .
Essentially , they can earn British income free of taxation .
This is clearly more attractive than US tax rules , and as a result , skilled financial workers see London as a better place to earn their living .
Openness :
The US is seen as less open after 9/11 .
Terrorism has scared off some business travel , and mistrust of foreign entities has damaged the image of the US .
For example , when Dubai Holdings took over a company that controlled US ports , there was a large negative American backlash , even though Dubai is an ally .
This created an impression that the US is not open to world business , and many investors now see London as a more open , safe investment .
Lawyers :
It ’s not just outside forces that prop up London as a financial center .
The industry in London is growing as well .
The city is home to three of the four biggest commercial law firms in the world .
These law firms generate almost £ 11 billion in fees every year , a figure that certainly helps London ’s financial status .
The Big Bang : Margaret
Thatcher shook up the way London ’s financial markets behave .
Financial workers used to be boozy , lax , and generally inefficient .
Thatcher put a stop to that with a radical deregulation of the markets , which created more openness and attracted some of the world ’s biggest financial services groups , like Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , and Deutsche Bank .
These reasons behind London ’s new financial popularity are not likely to change .
If New York wants to win back the crown , it ’s going to need more openness and a renewed embrace of international flavor .
This guy ’s rape joke is infamous .
He ’s the one from Texas who said that if a woman is being raped she might as well lie back and enjoy it .
I remember this jerk .
On Friday , McCain says he ’s canceled a fundraiser with guy who tells rape jokes :
Clayton Williams stirred controversy during his 1990 campaign for governor of Texas with a botched attempt at humor in which he compared rape to weather .
Within earshot of a reporter , Williams said : “ As long as it ’s inevitable , you might as well lie back and enjoy it . ”
But yesterday we learned that the event has simply been postponed ( I guess June is far too early for rape jokes – better in August ) .
But Saturday afternoon , the McCain campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the Midland event had been postponed until this summer and would be held in a public venue .
This pig says he ’s raised $ 300,000 already for McCain .
And by McCain saying he ’s still planning on having the fundraiser later this year , he obviously has no problem with this guy or his attitude towards the rape of women .
Then again , McCain is the guy reportedly called his wife the c-word .
I ’m thinking McCain ’s outreach to Hillary voters is n’t going so well .

All you gamers out there are surely familiar with that “ monstrous humanoid ” race known as “ orcs ” .
You know what an orc is — right ?
Are you sure about that ?
The Common Perception
Amongst players of RPGs , the orc race is generally assumed to have certain characteristics , regardless of gameworld :
Large : Orcs are taller , broader of shoulder , thicker boned , more solidly muscled , and much heavier than humans .
Strong : Orcs are more physically powerful than humans .
In fact , simply being a half - orc hybrid makes for a + 2 Strength bonus in most , if not all , incarnations .
Green :
While there are cases where you ’ll see gray - skinned orcs , that is at most usually just a variation from the norm — which is the green - skinned orc .
I do n’t recall ever seeing a published D&D gameworld where orcs did n’t typically have green skin .
Piggish :
The appearance of orcs in D&D gameworlds ( as well as in worlds inspired by D&D ) is pretty uniform in terms of facial features as well as appearance .
They have a pair of tusk - like lower teeth that extend over the tops of their upper lips , squashed pig - like snouts , wide mouths , tiny little piggish eyes , and often weirdly ape - like or neanderthal - like head shapes .
Stupid : Orcs are stupid .
They ’re often cartoonishly stupid .
Even half - breeds , like the half - orc PC race , has a - 2 Intelligence modifier , contributing to a stereotype of a rock - stupid thuggish brute with no sense of culture .
This , too , one might describe as a “ piggish ” approach to defining an orc ; they ’re all pigs , metaphorically speaking .
Disunity : Orcs are violent , savage creatures who apparently cannot organize themeslves worth a tinker ’s damn .
They are habitually chaotic , incapable of discipline or much forward thinking ( playing into the “ stupid ” descriptor of course ) , and would rather kill each other than waste any time in careful plotting for more successful raids against their human neighbors .
Unsuccessful : Orcs simply cannot expand their territory .
When they raid a settlement , they take things , burn things , break things , and leave .
Then , they sit around like imbeciles until a group of adventurers or a troop of disciplined soldiers shows up and wipes them out .
The only reason they ’re such a consistent plague is that they breed like rabbits .
There ’s more , but it gets a little less consistent across implementations in differing game worlds .
I think that pretty much hits the high points of what everyone expects of orcs in D&D .
The Origin
The race of orcs actually appeared in fantasy literature first in the writings of JRR Tolkien .
In his writings , orcs were in fact a corrupted offshoot of the noble elven races , created by Morgoth ’s will , which twisted them to serve his evil purposes .
They are a militant race , among the fiercest and most effective soliders in all of Middle Earth .
Only the Uruk - Hai seemed to outdo them in this regard — and the Uruk - Hai were effectively half - orcs , created by cross - breeding typical orcs with humans .
Even the name “ orc ” is not necessarily so familiar .
Tolkien ’s earliest elvish dictionaries spelled the word “ Ork ” , with a K instead of a C .
While some of his writings use the “ orc ” spelling , he expressed in writing his intent for the word to be spelled with a K , though in several cases ended up overruled in the posthumous publication of his books ( such as The Silmarillion ) .
Let ’s revisit those seven familiar orcish descriptors above :
Large :
Ork size varies widely across Middle Earth , from the smaller cave - dwelling “ goblins ” of the Misty Mountains to the imposing beasts known as the Uruk - Hai .
In fact , the largest orks ( those Uruk - Hai ) are essentially half - orks .
Strong :
The strength of an ork varied as widely as its size — the smaller varieties tending to be weaker than humans , the larger stronger .
Green :
Orks were never green - skinned in Tolkien ’s writings , where they tend more toward shades of gray , sometimes tending toward black .
Piggish :
There ’s nothing piggish about orkish appearance in Tolkein ’s conception of the race — in its original conception .
Stupid : Intrinsic intelligence might vary between specific varieties of ork , but Tolkien never directly addressed this , to my knowledge .
While they tend to focus on a combination of baser desires and military discipline , to varying degrees depending on the specific orkish subrace , these characteristics are in no way directly related to stupidity .
The assumption I would draw from this lack of specific treatment of the matter of their intelligence is that they tend to be as intelligent as humans , on average — though how they employ that intelligence likely differs significantly .
Disunity : Far from being inherently fractious , orks are in many cases accustomed and even well - suited to military discipline .
Great orkish commanders have led well - organized armies of their racial brethren , even in mixed units of subraces .
Only in cases where different varieties of orks were loyal — yes , loyal — to diverging interests of separate masters ( such as the orks and Uruk - Hai in The Two Towers who had captured Merry and Pippin ) , or when low - ranking soldiers are cooped up in very limited spaces for generations with only the most tedious of purposes without any notable supervision , do they tend to fall into fighting amongst themselves .
Having been in the Army , I can tell you that isolating a group of low - ranking soldiers in restrictive circumstances for long periods of time can drive any race to infighting .
Compare that to the infighting that occurred amongst the humans , elves , and dwarves of Tolkien ’s works some time .
Unsuccessful :
Those orkish commanders to which I referred in point 6 have often led their armies to stunning victories against overwhelming odds .
Consider that orks served as the majority forces of both Sauron and Saruman , and that both were militarily very successful — in Saruman ’s case , at least until Saruman ’s own leadership led his plans to failure .
No , I do n’t think orks are incompetent in the pursuit of their goals .
If they have a failing in this regard , it is in aligning themselves with leaders who tend to pursue failure rather than success — and in the fact that , in fantasy swords and sorcery tales , the bad guys tend to lose , regardless of race .
Orkish Virtues
So . . . where did all those orkish virtues go , anyway ?
In Tolkien ’s Middle Earth , the term “ goblin ” was often used to refer to the smaller varieties of ork , such as those in the Misty Mountains , though “ ork ” is also a perfectly suitable term for them .
More typical orks , larger than these goblins and smaller than the battle - bred Uruk - Hai , were sometimes called “ hobgoblins ” — though later , upon realizing that in mythic folklore “ hobgoblin ” was normally a term applied to smaller , more capricious goblins , Tolkien invented the term “ Uruk - Hai ” to refer to his ( newer ) largest form of ork .
In D&D , meanwhile , someone decided to create three separate , substantially redundant races out of this mess — goblins , hobgoblins , and orcs .
The characteristics of orks , in translation to D&D , then got split up amongst these three separate races .
Because of the similarity of names , of course , goblins and hobgoblins were imagined to be related somehow , but orcs were spun off into their own separate race of creatures entirely , divested of any relation at all to their own initial characteristics that were claimed by the now separate goblins and hobgoblins .
Hobgoblins got the militant lifestyle and habits , and the fierce soldierly spirit , of Tolkien ’s orks .
Goblins got some of their appearance characteristics , often becoming an exaggerated “ smaller breed ” approach that takes the Misty Mountain goblin example to greater extremes of pettiness , malevolence , and petite stature .
Orcs , meanwhile , seem to have barely maintained any relation at all to Tolkien ’s orks , bearing some minor ( and apparently accidental ) similarities to Uruk - Hai in terms of size and strength , but have otherwise been mutated beyond recognition .
Rather than being descended from elves , D&D orcs now appear to be descended from boars or even farm hogs ( depending on their depiction in a given gameworld ) , perhaps with a touch of the Hulk ’s irradiated blood thrown in for fun ( “ Orc smash !
Me am green ! ” ) .
Even half - orcs serve primarily as enemy red-shirts , brainless comic relief , and mindless raging animals in barely bipedal form .
The very thought of a female D&D orc is laughable at best , as is the notion of anything like orcish “ culture ” .
From a richly imagined race of creatures , with a dark and tragic origin and a present sense of powerful , pervasive menace in Middle Earth , orks have been reduced to a half - joking excuse for PCs to spill blood , stack up experience points , and fill their belt pouches to overflowing with coinage , all without having to think about any moral implications of their actions or deal with an enemy more dangerous than the simplistic threat it can exert by largely undirected pure brute force .
Personally , I find it difficult to maintain any kind of suspension of disbelief when a GM embarks on an evocative description of a flabby - lipped , tusk - toothed , ape - headed , green - skinned , rock - stupid , congenitally incompetent , muscular neanderthal incapable of thinking more than a few minutes ahead without risk of brain injury .
Why does n’t anyone else have this problem ?
Does everyone just like having a race of green - skinned pig-apes around as comic relief ?
Smart Zimbabweans are taking no chances : they are keeping up with the election slogans of Robert Mugabe and Zanu - PF that are handy to know at difficult moments .
The latest - " Mugabe in office by force on 27 June " - is useful for those hauled off buses by the ruling party 's militia and forced to profess their loyalty to a president who recently said only God can remove him from office .
Anyone unable to recite the slogans or sing liberation war songs with sufficient enthusiasm is likely to be pummelled to the ground by the young men and women in Zanu - PF bandanas and fresh white Mugabe T - shirts .
Even as the latest political upheaval seemed to deliver victory on a plate to the 84 - year - old in this Friday 's presidential runoff , the Zanu - PF militia - who have so effectively terrorised the population - were keeping up their assault yesterday .
From Hwange to Harare , the abductions , torture and beatings of opposition activists and supporters have continued .
The police raided the opposition Movement for Democratic Change 's headquarters and hauled away scores of men , women and children who had sought shelter there from the terror campaign .
That has left those who voted for Morgan Tsvangirai , the MDC presidential candidate who won the first round of elections in March , divided over whether he should have pulled out of the ballot .
Many wanted the chance to put a nail in Mugabe 's political coffin .
But in rural areas , which have borne the brunt of the state 's assault on voters , many had already decided that the only way to survive was to play Mugabe 's game .
" The MDC was not there to give us confidence , " said Eleanor Muzokomba , an MDC supporter who fled her rural Manicaland village after she was severely beaten .
" They were gone .
They could not protect us .
What were we supposed to do ?
Some said they would not vote .
They were the brave ones .
The others will vote for Zanu - PF and stay alive .
Now we do not have to make a choice . "
Joseph Kuratidzi , an opposition activist in Mashonaland , agreed : " Mugabe said he will never give up power .
It was a mistake to think a vote would change that .
When you vote you let him know who to kill .
We were all targets , " he said .
But there are those who say that too much blood had already been spilled not to make the final push .
" People are angry , " said Albert Muhpango , a Harare voter .
" They would have voted and voted for MDC .
Tsvangirai has betrayed them .
We have already risked our lives to get rid of Mugabe .
He did n't have the right to tell us to stop .
No one thinks Mugabe is going to stop killing us .
Now he is going to try to wipe out the MDC . "
According to some , every day that Mugabe extends his rule costs lives through the quiet , largely unseen deaths of those condemned by insufficient food , lack of medicines in the hospitals and a shortage of anti-retroviral medicines to hold Aids at bay .
The crisis has also left the country 's white population more edgy than they have been in a long time .
Even during the farm invasions , the tens of thousands of white Zimbabweans who live in the cities felt largely protected .
But as Mugabe 's racial rhetoric has intensified , they have come under increasing scrutiny and even hostility from elements in Zanu - PF .
Some have been hauled from their cars and beaten up in Harare .
Though such beatings are rare , they have sent a judder of fear through the white community , and the rumour mill is kept at full grind .
Some white Zimbabweans say there is an informal curfew on them and refuse to leave their homes .
The fears have been exacerbated by the gangs of Zanu - PF activists moving door to door after dark , rounding up the maids and gardeners for " reorientation meetings " .
What used to be viewed as a rural problem of intimidation has now penetrated deeply into Harare 's plush suburbs .
It is not enough simply to pay lip service to supporting Mugabe .
Each night state television carries video footage of rallies in which MDC voters are forced to publicly renounce their support for Tsvangirai with lengthy explanations of how they were duped into believing he stood for a better life when in fact he was just selling the country to the British .
Now , after a dose of reorientation , they know better .
At least Mugabe hopes they do , but just in case he made it clear to opposition voters earlier this month .
" We are not going to give up our country because of a mere X . How can a ballpoint pen fight with a gun ? " he said .
His message - that it does not matter how you vote , the outcome of this election has been decided by those wielding weapons - has not been lost on Zimbabwean voters .
Conceptually speaking , air conditioning has been around since the first primitive humans ducked into cool , damp caves to take refuge from summer heat .
But aside from fans of various shapes and sizes , the technology of temperature control did n't progress beyond the stone age until the 1830s .
That 's when John Gorrie , a doctor from Florida , decided to do something about the stifling heat in his hospital , which he reasoned was n't doing his malaria and yellow fever infected patients much good .
In response , he created a simple contraption that was little more than a fan that blew over a bucket full of ice — and though it was mighty inefficient , it worked .
A more complex device was rigged up in the bedroom of dying president James Garfield in 1881 .
Naval engineers constructed a kind of box filled with ice water - soaked rags .
A fan blew hot air overhead , forcing the cool air to stay low to the floor , where the ailing president 's bed was .
Half a million pounds of ice and two months later , the president was dead , though the engineers had succeeded in lowering the room 's temperature an average of twenty degrees during that time .
But those were experiments , not the norm .
Refrigeration first came into common use in some large cities during the late 1800s , typically piped from a central cooling station to meat lockers , keg rooms and even bank vaults where important documents were stored .
" Manufactured air , "  as it was known , was primarily an industrial - use phenomenon until the turn of the century , when men like Willis Carrier , an engineer and air conditioning pioneer , began to experiment with systems practical for use in commercial and residential spaces .
The key was precise control of the temperature - humidity relationship in the air , achieved by a series of chilled coils that both lowered temperature and the moisture level .
His invention , built for the Brooklyn - based Sackett - Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company , was called the " Apparatus for Treating Air , "  and it kick - started a revolution .
Suddenly cooled air did n't have to come from a centrally - located supply ; any business with enough money could have their own local system .
Schools , hospitals , printing plants and textile manufacturers lined up to have air conditioners installed ( as well as one wealthy private citizen , Charles Gates of Minneapolis , the first person to have his home — pictured at left — air - conditioned ) .
The thing stopping Carrier 's units from going into every home in America , however , was their gigantic size .
Further , the potential danger of the toxic ammonia they used as coolant did n't help .
In 1922 , however , Carrier solved those problems by replacing the ammonia with the relatively safe chemical dielene , and added a compressor to the systems , which reduced their size and expense .
Soon the inventions were popping up in movie theaters all over the country , which became refuges for sweltering cineastes during the summers .
Before long , air conditioning was debuting in office buildings , department stores and in fancy trains everywhere .
World War II slowed things down a bit since resources were scarce , but when the troops came home and embraced the suburban American dream , many of them wanted that dream air conditioned .
Within a few years , window units began selling like hotcakes : from just 74,000 in 1948 to over a million in 1953 .

First , there are two basic ways you can go – up through Montana , or up through Washington .
If you go up through Montana there is a Duty Free right before the border crossing ( you ca n’t miss it ) where you can exchange your money for Canadian money .
If it ’s more than a thousand dollars , you have to fill out the terrorist form .
If you go up through Washington , it ’s a lot more beautiful – take Rt 99 for windy mountain roads ( do not attempt this with a trailer unless your brakes and transmission are perfect ) , or take Rt 1 to get there faster and pass a bunch of sawmills and decimated forest .
Bring your passport , your drivers license , your vehicle registration and insurance , and a rabies certificate for any animals you have .
Do n’t bring alcohol , large amounts of fruit , illegal drugs , or ID ’s in names that do n’t match your passport .
Stuff to bring .
Food and water .
It ’s expensive in Canada .
A ninety nine cent jug of water is two or three dollars .
Try to bring all the food and water you ’ll need with you .
Fill up on gas right before the border , too .
You ’ll be driving through some remote , mountainous areas .
Even if your vehicle has never leaked or burned any fluids , you need to be prepared .
These are stressfull conditions for your transmission , brakes , and engine , and a quart of oil can go for as much as ten dollars along the Alaska highway .
Bring oil , Lucas transmission fluid , power steering fluid , brake fluid , and antifreeze .
Bring a jack , a lug wrench , a spare tire , a basic tool kit ( metric and regular ) , some stop leak and some liquid weld .
If you have shelves expect them to fall .
Gas prices in Canada are by the litre .
There are approximately 4 litres in a gallon .
Last year ( 2007 ) gas was $ .99 / litre ( $ 3.96 / gallon ) in the southern cities of Canada , and $ 1.34 / litre ( $ 5.36 / gallon ) in the remote northerly parts .
This year ( 2008 ) , it was $ 1.30 / litre in the southerly parts , and did n’t go any higher than $ 1.48 / litre as I went north .
When you get there – Ladies and Gentlement , it ai n’t a bathroom anymore .
It ’s a washroom now .
Try saying warsh room , you ’ll fit in better .
You also need to know about blinking green lights .
They apparently mean something different in every province , but part of what they mean is always go .
If you are driving through Vancouver or Edmonton stop and take a good hard look at your map .
Take a deep breath , and watch very carefully for signs that ’ll tell you to turn this way and that way to stay on whatever freeway you ’re trying to be on .
Once you get north of the big cities stop and fill your tank in every town .
I know places like Watson Lake , Whitehorse , Fort Nelson , do n’t seem like big towns , but they ’re as big as it gets , so get gas while you can .
The good news is that once you get north of the big cities there is plentiful and good roadside boondocking .
Places to stop , assuming that you are like me and interested in what I am , are : Liard Hot Springs – it ’s “ free ” and a lot less crowded at night .
There is a big overnight parking area across the street , tho you can apparently also pay to park overnight in their parking lot if you ’re into that .
Watch for bears , and for expensive treats that rich people drop out of their RVs .
Anywhere past Whitehorse – just stop on the side of the road .
Watch the bears .
Go for walks .
If you have dogs who are n’t bear - smart leave them in the vehicle .
Lake Kluane – Plan on spending a day or two .
It ’s just the most beautiful place on earth .
And , again , watch for bears …

Fallacies of Distraction Each of these fallacies is characterized by the illegitimate use of a logical operator in order to distract the reader from the apparent falsity of a certain proposition .
False Dilemma
Definition : A limited number of options ( usually two ) is given , while in reality there are more options .
A false dilemma is an illegitimate use of the " or " operator .
Examples :
( i) Either you 're for me or against me .
( ii ) America : love it or leave it .
( iii ) Either support Meech Lake or Quebec will separate .
Proof : Identify the options given and show ( with an example ) that there is an additional option .

Argument From Ignorance ( argumentum ad ignorantiam )
Definition : Arguments of this form assume that since something has not been proven false , it is therefore true .
Conversely , such an argument may assume that since something has not been proven true , it is therefore false .
( This is a special case of a false dilemma , since it assumes that all propositions must ether be known to be true or known to be false . )
As Davis writes , " Lack of proof is not proof . " ( p. 59 )
Examples :
( i) Since you cannot prove that ghosts do not exist , they must exist .
( ii ) Since scientists cannot prove that global warming will occur , it probably wo n't .
( iii ) Fred said that he is smarter than Jill , but he did n't prove it , so it must be false .
Proof : Identify the proposition in question .
Argue that it may be true even though we do n't know whether it is or is n't .
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 93 , Davis : 59 )
Slippery Slope
Definition :
In order to show that a proposition P is unacceptable , a sequence of increasingly unacceptable events is shown to follow from P . A slippery slope is an illegitimate use of the “ if - then ” operator .
Examples :
( i) If we pass laws against fully - automatic weapons , then it wo n't be long before we pass laws on all weapons , and then we will begin to restrict other rights , and finally we will end up living in a communist state .
Thus , we should not ban fully - automatic weapons .
( ii ) You should never gamble .
Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop .
Soon you are spending all your money on gambling , and eventually you will turn to crime to support your earnings .
( iii ) If I make an exception for you then I have to make an exception for everyone .
Proof : Identify the proposition P being refuted and identify the final event in the series of events .
Then show that this final event need not occur as a consequence of P .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 137 )
Complex Question
Definition :
Two otherwise unrelated points are conjoined and treated as a single proposition .
The reader is expected to accept or reject both together , when in reality one is acceptable while the other is not .
A complex question is an illegitimate use of the " and " operator .
Examples :
( i) You should support home education and the God - given right of parents to raise their children according to their own beliefs .
( ii ) Do you support freedom and the right to bear arms ?
( iii ) Have you stopped using illegal sales practices ?
( This asks two questions : did you use illegal practices , and did you stop ? )
Proof : Identify the two propositions illegitimately conjoined and show that believing one does not mean that you have to believe the other .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 86 , Copi and Cohen : 96 )
Appeals to Motives in Place of Support
The fallacies in this section have in common the practice of appealing to emotions or other psychological factors .
In this way , they do not provide reasons for belief .
Appeal to Force ( argumentum ad baculum )
Definition :
The reader is told that unpleasant consequences will follow if they do not agree with the author .
Examples :
( i) You had better agree that the new company policy is the best bet if you expect to keep your job .
( ii ) NAFTA is wrong , and if you do n't vote against NAFTA then we will vote you out of office .
Proof : Identify the threat and the proposition and argue that the threat is unrelated to the truth or falsity of the proposition .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 151 , Copi and Cohen : 103 )
Appeal to Pity ( argumentum ad misercordiam )
Definition :
The reader is told to agree to the proposition because of the pitiful state of the author .
Examples :
( i) How can you say that 's out ?
It was so close , and besides , I 'm down ten games to two .
( ii ) We hope you 'll accept our recommendations .
We spent the last three months working extra time on it .
Proof : Identify the proposition and the appeal to pity and argue that the pitiful state of the arguer has nothing to do with the truth of the proposition .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 151 , Copi and Cohen : 103 , Davis : 82 )
Appeal to Consequences ( argumentum ad consequentiam )
Definition :
The author points to the disagreeable consequences of holding a particular belief in order to show that this belief is false .
Example :
( i) You can't agree that evolution is true , because if it were , then we would be no better than monkeys and apes .
( ii ) You must believe in God , for otherwise life would have no meaning .
( Perhaps , but it is equally possible that since life has no meaning that God does not exist . )
Proof : Identify the consequences to and argue that what we want to be the case does not affect what is in fact the case .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 100 , Davis : 63 )
Prejudicial Language
Definition : Loaded or emotive terms are used to attach value or moral goodness to believing the proposition .
Examples : ( i ) Right thinking Canadians will agree with me that we should have another free vote on capital punishment .
( ii ) A reasonable person would agree that our income statement is too low .
( iii ) Senator Turner claims that the new tax rate will reduce the deficit .
( Here , the use of " claims " implies that what Turner says is false . )
( iv ) The proposal is likely to be resisted by the bureaucrats on Parliament Hill .
( Compare this to :
The proposal is likely to be rejected by officials on Parliament Hill . )
Proof : Identify the prejudicial terms used ( e.g. , " Right thinking Canadians " or " A reasonable person " ) .
Show that disagreeing with the conclusion does not make a person " wrong thinking " or " unreasonable " .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 153 , Davis : 62 )
Appeal to Popularity ( argumentum ad populum )
Definition : A proposition is held to be true because it is widely held to be true or is held to be true by some ( usually upper crust ) sector of the population .
This fallacy is sometimes also called the " Appeal to Emotion " because emotional appeals often sway the population as a whole .
Examples :
( i) If you were beautiful , you could live like this , so buy Buty - EZ and become beautiful .
( Here , the appeal is to the " beautiful people " . )
( ii ) Polls suggest that the Liberals will form a majority government , so you may as well vote for them .
( iii ) Everyone knows that the Earth is flat , so why do you persist in your outlandish claims ?
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 103 , Davis : 62 )
Changing the Subject
The fallacies in this section change the subject by discussing the person making the argument instead of discussing reasons to believe or disbelieve the conclusion .
While on some occasions it is useful to cite authorities , it is almost never appropriate to discuss the person instead of the argument .
Attacking the Person ( argumentum ad hominem )
Definition :
The person presenting an argument is attacked instead of the argument itself .
This takes many forms .
For example , the person 's character , nationality or religion may be attacked .
Alternatively , it may be pointed out that a person stands to gain from a favorable outcome .
Or , finally , a person may be attacked by association , or by the company he keeps .
There are three major forms of Attacking the Person :
( 1 ) ad hominem ( abusive ) : instead of attacking an assertion , the argument attacks the person who made the assertion .
( 2 ) ad hominem ( circumstantial ) : instead of attacking an assertion the author points to the relationship between the person making the assertion and the person 's circumstances .
( 3 ) ad hominem ( tu quoque ) : this form of attack on the person notes that a person does not practice what he preaches .
Examples :
( i) You may argue that God does n't exist , but you are just following a fad .
( ad hominem abusive )
( ii ) We should discount what Premier Klein says about taxation because he wo n't be hurt by the increase .
( ad hominem circumstantial )
( iii ) We should disregard Share B.C. 's argument because they are being funded by the logging industry .
( ad hominem circumstantial )
( iv ) You say I should n't drink , but you have n't been sober for more than a year .
( ad hominem tu quoque )
Proof : Identify the attack and show that the character or circumstances of the person has nothing to do with the truth or falsity of the proposition being defended .
Reference : ( Barker : 166 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 155 , Copi and Cohen : 97 , Davis : 80 )
Appeal to Authority ( argumentum ad verecundiam )
Definition :
While sometimes it may be appropriate to cite an authority to support a point , often it is not .
In particular , an appeal to authority is inappropriate if :
( i ) the person is not qualified to have an expert opinion on the subject ,
( ii ) experts in the field disagree on this issue ,
( iii ) the authority was making a joke , drunk , or otherwise not being serious .
A variation of the fallacious appeal to authority is hearsay .
An argument from hearsay is an argument which depends on second or third hand sources .
Examples :
( i) Noted psychologist Dr. Frasier Crane recommends that you buy the EZ - Rest Hot Tub .
( ii ) Economist John Kenneth Galbraith argues that a tight money policy is the best cure for a recession .
( Although Galbraith is an expert , not all economists agree on this point . )
( iii ) We are headed for nuclear war .
Last week Ronald Reagan remarked that we begin bombing Russia in five minutes .
( Of course , he said it as a joke during a microphone test . )
( iv ) My friend heard on the news the other day that Canada will declare war on Serbia .
( This is a case of hearsay ; in fact , the reporter said that Canada would not declare war . )
( v) The Ottawa Citizen reported that sales were up 5.9 percent this year .
( This is hearsay ; we are not in a position to check the Citizen 's sources . )
Proof :
Show that either ( i ) the person cited is not an authority in the field , or that ( ii ) there is general disagreement among the experts in the field on this point .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 155 , Copi and Cohen : 95 , Davis : 69 )
Anonymous Authorities
Definition :
The authority in question is not named .
This is a type of appeal to authority because when an authority is not named it is impossible to confirm that the authority is an expert .
However the fallacy is so common it deserves special mention .
A variation on this fallacy is the appeal to rumor .
Because the source of a rumor is typically not known , it is not possible to determine whether to believe the rumor .
Very often false and harmful rumors are deliberately started in order to discredit an opponent .
Examples :
( i) A government official said today that the new gun law will be proposed tomorrow .
( ii ) Experts agree that the best way to prevent nuclear war is to prepare for it .
( iii ) It is held that there are more than two million needless operations conducted every year .
( iv ) Rumor has it that the Prime Minster will declare another holiday in October .
Proof :
Argue that because we do n't know the source of the information we have no way to evaluate the reliability of the information .
Reference : ( Davis : 73 )
Style Over Substance
Definition :
The manner in which an argument ( or arguer ) is presented is taken to affect the likelihood that the conclusion is true .
Examples :
( i) Nixon lost the presidential debate because of the sweat on his forehead .
( ii ) Trudeau knows how to move a crowd .
He must be right .
( iii ) Why do n't you take the advice of that nicely dressed young man ?
Proof :
While it is true that the manner in which an argument is presented will affect whether people believe that its conclusion is true , nonetheless , the truth of the conclusion does not depend on the manner in which the argument is presented .
In order to show that this fallacy is being committed , show that the style in this case does not affect the truth or falsity of the conclusion .
Reference : ( Davis : 61 )
Inductive Fallacies Inductive reasoning consists on inferring from the properties of a sample to the properties of a population as a whole .
For example , suppose we have a barrel containing of 1,000 beans .
Some of the beans are black and some of the beans are white .
Suppose now we take a sample of 100 beans from the barrel and that 50 of them are white and 50 of them are black .
Then we could infer inductively that half the beans in the barrel ( that is , 500 of them ) are black and half are white .
All inductive reasoning depends on the similarity of the sample and the population .
The more similar the same is to the population as a whole , the more reliable will be the inductive inference .
On the other hand , if the sample is relevantly dissimilar to the population , then the inductive inference will be unreliable .
No inductive inference is perfect .
That means that any inductive inference can sometimes fail .
Even though the premises are true , the conclusion might be false .
Nonetheless , a good inductive inference gives us a reason to believe that the conclusion is probably true .
Hasty Generalization
Definition :
The size of the sample is too small to support the conclusion .
Examples :
( i) Fred , the Australian , stole my wallet .
Thus , all Australians are thieves .
( Of course , we should n't judge all Australians on the basis of one example . )
( ii ) I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new spending restraints and they agreed it is a good idea .
The new restraints are therefore generally popular .
Proof : Identify the size of the sample and the size of the population , then show that the sample size is too small .
Note : a formal proof would require a mathematical calculation .
This is the subject of probability theory .
For now , you must rely on common sense .
Reference : ( Barker : 189 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 372 , Davis : 103 )
Unrepresentative Sample
Definition :
The sample used in an inductive inference is relevantly different from the population as a whole .
Examples :
( i) To see how Canadians will vote in the next election we polled a hundred people in Calgary .
This shows conclusively that the Reform Party will sweep the polls .
( People in Calgary tend to be more conservative , and hence more likely to vote Reform , than people in the rest of the country . )
( ii ) The apples on the top of the box look good .
The entire box of apples must be good .
( Of course , the rotten apples are hidden beneath the surface . )
Proof :
Show how the sample is relevantly different from the population as a whole , then show that because the sample is different , the conclusion is probably different .
Reference : ( Barker : 188 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 226 , Davis : 106 )
False Analogy
Definition :
In an analogy , two objects ( or events ) , A and B are shown to be similar .
Then it is argued that since A has property P , so also B must have property P .
An analogy fails when the two objects , A and B , are different in a way which affects whether they both have property P. Examples : ( i ) Employees are like nails .
Just as nails must be hit in the head in order to make them work , so must employees .
( ii ) Government is like business , so just as business must be sensitive primarily to the bottom line , so also must government .
( But the objectives of government and business are completely different , so probably they will have to meet different criteria . )
Proof : Identify the two objects or events being compared and the property which both are said to possess .
Show that the two objects are different in a way which will affect whether they both have that property .
Reference : ( Barker : 192 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 257 , Davis : 84 )
Slothful Induction
Definition :
The proper conclusion of an inductive argument is denied despite the evidence to the contrary .
Examples :
( i) Hugo has had twelve accidents n the last six months , yet he insists that it is just a coincidence and not his fault .
( Inductively , the evidence is overwhelming that it is his fault .
This example borrowed from Barker , p. 189 )
( ii ) Poll after poll shows that the N.D.P will win fewer than ten seats in Parliament .
Yet the party leader insists that the party is doing much better than the polls suggest .
( The N.D.P. in fact got nine seats . )
Proof :
About all you can do in such a case is to point to the strength of the inference .
Reference : ( Barker : 189 )
Fallacy of Exclusion
Definition : Important evidence which would undermine an inductive argument is excluded from consideration .
The requirement that all relevant information be included is called the " principle of total evidence " .
Examples :
( i) Jones is Albertan , and most Albertans vote Tory , so Jones will probably vote Tory .
( The information left out is that Jones lives in Edmonton , and that most people in Edmonton vote Liberal or N.D.P. )
( ii ) The Leafs will probably win this game because they 've won nine out of their last ten .
( Eight of the Leafs ' wins came over last place teams , and today they are playing the first place team . )
Proof :
Give the missing evidence and show that it changes the outcome of the inductive argument .
Note that it is not sufficient simply to show that not all of the evidence was included ; it must be shown that the missing evidence will change the conclusion .
Reference : ( Davis : 115 )
Fallacies Involving Statistical Syllogisms
A statistical generalization is a statement which is usually true , but not always true .
Very often these are expressed using the word " most " , as in " Most conservatives favor welfare cuts . "
Sometimes the word " generally " s used , as in " Conservatives generally favor welfare cuts . "
Or , sometimes , no specific word is used at all , as in : " Conservatives favor welfare cuts . "
Fallacies involving statistical generalizations occur because the generalization is not always true .
Thus , when an author treats a statistical generalization as though it were always true , the author commits a fallacy .
Accident
Definition : A general rule is applied when circumstances suggest that an exception to the rule should apply .
Examples :
( i) The law says that you should not travel faster than 50 kph , thus even though your father could not breathe , you should not have traveled faster than 50 kph .
( ii ) It is good to return things you have borrowed .
Therefore , you should return this automatic rifle from the madman you borrowed it from .
( Adapted from Plato's Republic , Book I ) .
Proof : Identify the generalization in question and show that it s not a universal generalization .
Then show that the circumstances of this case suggest that the generalization ought not to apply .
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 100 )
Converse Accident
Definition :
An exception to a generalization is applied to cases where the generalization should apply .
Examples :
( i) Because we allow terminally ill patients to use heroin , we should allow everyone to use heroin .
( ii ) Because you allowed Jill , who was hit by a truck , to hand in her assignment late , you should allow the entire class to hand in their assignments late .
Proof : Identify the generalization in question and show how the special case was an exception to the generalization .
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 100 )
Causal Fallacies
It is common for arguments to conclude that one thing causes another .
But the relation between cause and effect is a complex one .
It is easy to make a mistake .
In general , we say that a cause C is the cause of an effect E if and only if :
( i) Generally , if C occurs , then E will occur , and
( ii ) Generally , if C does not occur , then E will not occur ether .
We say " generally " because there are always exceptions .
For example :
We say that striking the match causes the match to light , because :
( i) Generally , when the match is struck , it lights ( except when the match is dunked in water ) , and
( ii ) Generally , when the match is not struck , it does not light ( except when it is lit with a blowtorch ) .
Many writers also require that a causal statement be supported with a natural law .
For example , the statement that " striking the match causes it to light " is supported by the principle that " friction produces heat , and heat produces fire " .
Coincidental Correlation ( post hoc ergo prompter hoc , “ post hoc ” )
Definition :
The name in Latin means " after this therefore because of this " .
This describes the fallacy .
An author commits the fallacy when it is assumed that because one thing follows another that the one thing was caused by the other .
Examples :
( i) Immigration to Alberta from Ontario increased .
Soon after , the welfare rolls increased .
Therefore , the increased immigration caused the increased welfare rolls .
( ii ) I took EZ - No - Cold , and two days later , my cold disappeared .
Proof :
Show that the correlation is coincidental by showing that : ( i ) the effect would have occurred even if the cause did not occur , or ( ii ) that the effect was caused by something other than the suggested cause .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 237 , Copi and Cohen : 101 )
Joint Effect
Definition :
One thing is held to cause another when in fact both are the effect of a single underlying cause .
This fallacy is often understood as a special case of post hoc ergo prompter hoc .
Examples :
( i) We are experiencing high unemployment which s being caused by a low consumer demand .
( In fact , both may be caused by high interest rates . )
( ii ) You have a fever and this is causing you to break out in spots .
( In fact , both symptoms are caused by the measles . )
Proof : Identify the two effects and show that they are caused by the same underlying cause .
It is necessary to describe the underlying cause and prove that it causes each symptom .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 238 ) Genuine but Insignificant Cause
Definition :
The object or event identified as the cause of an effect is a genuine cause , but insignificant when compared to the other causes of that event .
Note that this fallacy does not apply when all other contributing causes are equally insignificant .
Thus , it is not a fallacy to say that you helped cause defeat the Tory government because you voted Reform , for your vote had as much weight as any other vote , and hence is equally a part of the cause .
Examples :
( i) Smoking is causing air pollution in Edmonton .
( True , but the effect of smoking is insignificant compared to the effect of auto exhaust . )
( ii ) By leaving your oven on overnight you are contributing to global warming .
Proof : Identify the much more significant cause .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 238 )
Wrong Direction
Definition :
The relation between cause and effect is reversed .
Examples :
( i) Cancer causes smoking .
( ii ) The increase in AIDS was caused by more sex education .
( In fact , the increase in sex education was caused by the spread of AIDS . )
Proof :
Give a causal argument showing that the relation between cause and effect has been reversed .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 238 )
Complex Cause
Definition :
The effect is caused by a number of objects or events , of which the cause identified is only a part .
A variation of this is the feedback loop where the effect is itself a part of the cause .
Examples :
( i) The accident was caused by the poor location of the bush .
( True , but it would n't have occurred had the driver not been drunk and the pedestrian not been jaywalking . )
( ii ) The Challenger explosion was caused by the cold weather .
( True , however , it would not have occurred had the O - rings been properly constructed . )
( iii ) People are in fear because of increased crime .
( True , but this has lead people to break the law as a consequence of their fear , which increases crime even more . )
Proof :
Show that all of the causes , and not just the one mentioned , are required to produce the effect .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 238 )
Missing the Point
These fallacies have in common a general failure to prove that the conclusion is true .
Begging the Question ( petitio principii )
Definition :
The truth of the conclusion is assumed by the premises .
Often , the conclusion is simply restated in the premises in a slightly different form .
In more difficult cases , the premise is a consequence of the conclusion .
Examples :
( i) Since I 'm not lying , it follows that I 'm telling the truth .
( ii ) We know that God exists , since the Bible says God exists .
What the Bible says must be true , since God wrote it and God never lies .
( Here , we must agree that God exists in order to believe that God wrote the Bible . )
Proof :
Show that in order to believe that the premises are true we must already agree that the conclusion is true .
Reference : ( Barker : 159 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 144 , Copi and Cohen : 102 , Davis : 33 )
Irrelevant Conclusion ( ignoratio elenchi )
Definition :
An argument which purports to prove one thing instead proves a different conclusion .
Examples :
( i) You should support the new housing bill .
We can't continue to see people living in the streets ; we must have cheaper housing .
( We may agree that housing s important even though we disagree with the housing bill . )
( ii ) I say we should support affirmative action .
White males have run the country for 500 years .
They run most of government and industry today .
You can't deny that this sort of discrimination is intolerable .
( The author has proven that there is discrimination , but not that affirmative action will end that discrimination . )
Proof :
Show that the conclusion proved by the author is not the conclusion that the author set out to prove .
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 105 )
Straw Man
Definition :
The author attacks an argument which is different from , and usually weaker than , the opposition 's best argument .
Examples :
( i) People who opposed the Charlottown Accord probably just wanted Quebec to separate .
But we want Quebec to stay in Canada .
( ii ) We should have conscription .
People do n't want to enter the military because they find it an inconvenience .
But they should realize that there are more important things than convenience .
Proof :
Show that the opposition 's argument has been misrepresented by showing that the opposition has a stronger argument .
Describe the stronger argument .
Reference : ( Cedarblom and Paulsen : 138 )
Fallacies of Ambiguity
The fallacies in this section are all cases where a word or phrase is used unclearly .
There are two ways in which this can occur .
( i) The word or phrase may be ambiguous , in which case it has more than one distinct meaning .
( ii ) The word or phrase may be vague , in which case it has no distinct meaning .
Equivocation
Definition :
The same word is used with two different meanings .
Examples :
( i) Criminal actions are illegal , and all murder trials are criminal actions , thus all murder trials are illegal .
( Here the term " criminal actions " is used with two different meanings .
Example borrowed from Copi . )
( ii ) The sign said " fine for parking here " , and since it was fine , I parked there .
( iii ) All child - murderers are inhuman , thus , no child - murderer is human .
( From Barker , p. 164 ; this is called " illicit obversion " )
( iv ) A plane is a carpenter 's tool , and the Boeing 737 is a place , hence the Boeing 737 is a carpenter 's tool .
( Example borrowed from Davis , p. 58 ) Proof : Identify the word which is used twice , then show that a definition which is appropriate for one use of the word would not be appropriate for the second use .
Reference : ( Barker : 163 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 142 , Copi and Cohen : 113 , Davis : 58 )
Amphiboly
Definition :
An amphiboly occurs when the construction of a sentence allows it to have two different meanings .
Examples :
( i) Last night I shot a burglar in my pajamas .
( ii ) The Oracle of Delphi told Croseus that if he pursued the war he would destroy a mighty kingdom .
( What the Oracle did not mention was that the kingdom he destroyed would be his own .
Adapted from Heroditus , The Histories . )
( iii ) Save soap and waste paper .
( From Copi , p. 115 ) Proof : Identify the ambiguous phrase and show the two possible interpretations .
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 114 )
Accent
Definition : Emphasis is used to suggest a meaning different from the actual content of the proposition .
Examples :
( i) It would be illegal to give away Free Beer !
( ii ) The first mate , seeking revenge on the captain , wrote in his journal , " The Captain was sober today . "
( He suggests , by his emphasis , that the Captain is usually drunk .
From Copi , p. 117 )
Reference : ( Copi and Cohen : 115 )
Category Errors
These fallacies occur because the author mistakenly assumes that the whole is nothing more than the sum of its parts .
However , things joined together may have different properties as a whole than any of them do separately .
Composition
Definition : Because the parts of a whole have a certain property , it is argued that the whole has that property .
That whole may be either an object composed of different parts , or it may be a collection or set of individual members .
Examples :
( i) The brick wall is six feet tall .
Thus , the bricks in the wall are six feet tall .
( ii ) Germany is a militant country .
Thus , each German is militant .
( iii ) Conventional bombs did more damage in W.W. II than nuclear bombs .
Thus , a conventional bomb is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb .
( From Copi , p. 118 )
Proof :
Show that the properties in question are the properties of the whole , and not of each part or member or the whole .
If necessary , describe the parts to show that they could not have the properties of the whole .
Reference : ( Barker : 164 , Copi and Cohen : 117 )
Division
Definition : Because the whole has a certain property , it is argued that the parts have that property .
The whole in question may be either a whole object or a collection or set of individual members .
Examples :
( i) Each brick is three inches high , thus , the brick wall is three inches high .
( ii ) Because the brain is capable of consciousness , each neural cell in the brain must be capable of consciousness .
Proof :
Show that the properties in question are the properties of the parts , and not of the whole .
If necessary , describe the parts to show that they could not have the properties of the whole .
Reference : ( Barker : 164 , Copi and Cohen : 119 )
Non-Sequitur
The term non sequitur literally means " it does not follow " .
In this section we describe fallacies which occur as a consequence of invalid arguments .
Affirming the Consequent
Definition :
Any argument of the following form is invalid : If A then B , B Therefore , A
Examples :
( i) If I am in Calgary , then I am in Alberta .
I am in Alberta , thus , I am in Calgary .
( Of course , even though the premises are true , I might be in Edmonton , Alberta . )
( ii ) If the mill were polluting the river then we would see an increase in fish deaths .
And fish deaths have increased .
Thus , the mill is polluting the river .
Proof :
Show that even though the premises are true , the conclusion could be false .
In general , show that B might be a consequence of something other than A .
For example , the fish deaths might be caused by pesticide run-off , and not the mill .
Reference : ( Barker : 69 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 24 , Copi and Cohen : 241 )
Denying the Antecedent
Definition :
Any argument of the following form is invalid : If A then B Not A , Therefore , Not B .
Examples :
( i) If you get hit by a car when you are six then you will die young .
But you were not hit by a car when you were six .
Thus you will not die young .
( Of course , you could be hit by a train at age seven . )
( ii ) If I am in Calgary then I am in Alberta .
I am not in Calgary , thus , I am not in Alberta .
Proof :
Show that even though the premises are true , the conclusion may be false .
In particular , show that the consequence B may occur even though A does not occur .
Reference : ( Barker : 69 , Cedarblom and Paulsen : 26 , Copi and Cohen : 241 )
Inconsistency
Definition :
The author asserts more than one proposition such that the propositions cannot all be true .
In such a case , the propositions may be contradictories or they may be contraries .
Examples :
( i) Montreal is about 200 km from Ottawa , while Toronto is 400 km from Ottawa .
Toronto is closer to Ottawa than Montreal .
( ii ) John is taller than Jake , and Jake is taller than Fred , while Fred is taller than John .
Proof : Assume that one of the statements is true , and then use it as a premise to show that one of the other statements is false .
Reference : ( Barker : 157 )
Syllogistic Fallacies
The fallacies in this section are all cases of invalid categorical syllogisms .
Fallacy of the Four Terms ( quaternio terminorum ) Definition : A standard form categorical syllogism contains four terms .
Examples :
( i) All dogs are animals , and all cats are mammals , so all dogs are mammals .
The four terms are : dogs , animals , cats and mammals .
Note :
In many cases , the fallacy of four terms is a special case of equivocation .
While the same word is used , the word has different meanings , and hence the word is treated as two different terms .
Consider the following example :
( ii ) Only man is born free , and no women are men , therefore , no women are born free .
The four terms are : man ( in the sense of ' humanity ' ) , man ( in the sense of ' male ' ) , women and born free .
Proof : Identify the four terms and where necessary state the meaning of each term .
References : Copi and Cohen : 206
Undistributed Middle Definition :
The middle term in the premises of a standard form categorical syllogism never refers to all of the members of the category it describes .
Examples :
( i) All Russians were revolutionists , and all anarchists were revolutionist , therefore , all anarchists were Russians .
The middle term is ' revolutionist ' .
While both Russians and anarchists share the common property of being revolutionist , they may be separate groups of revolutionists , and so we cannot conclude that anarchists are otherwise the same as Russians in any way .
Example from Copi and Cohen , 208 .
( ii ) All trespassers are shot , and someone was shot , therefore , someone was a trespasser .
The middle term is ' shot ' .
While ' someone ' and ' trespassers ' may share the property of being shot , it does n't follow that the someone in question was a trespasser ; he may have been the victim of a mugging .
Proof :
Show how each of the two categories identified in the conclusion could be separate groups even though they share a common property .
References : Copi and Cohen : 207
Illicit Major Definition :
The predicate term of the conclusion refers to all members of that category , but the same term in the premises refers only to some members of that category .
Examples :
( i) All Texans are Americans , and no Californians are Texans , therefore , no Californians are Americans .
The predicate term in the conclusion is ' Americans ' .
The conclusion refers to all Americans ( every American is not a Californian , according to the conclusion ) .
But the premises refer only to some Americans ( those that are Texans ) .
Proof :
Show that there may be other members of the predicate category not mentioned in the premises which are contrary to the conclusion .
For example , from ( i ) above , one might argue , " While it 's true that all Texans are Americans , it is also true that Ronald Regan is American , but Ronald Regan is Californian , so it is not true that No Californians are Americans . "
References : Copi and Cohen : 207
Illicit Minor Definition :
The subject term of the conclusion refers to all members of that category , but the same term in the premises refers only to some members of that category .
Examples :
( i) All communists are subversives , and all communists are critics of capitalism , therefore , all critics of capitalism are subversives .
The subject term in the conclusion is ' critics of capitalism ' .
The conclusion refers to all such critics .
The premise that ' all communists are critics of capitalism ' refers only to some critics of capitalism ; there may be other critics who are not communists .
Proof :
Show that there may be other members of the subject category not mentioned in the premises which are contrary to the conclusion .
For example , from ( i ) above , one might argue , " While it 's true that all communists are critics of capitalism , it is also true that Thomas Jefferson was a critic of capitalism , but Thomas Jefferson was not a subversive , so not all critics of capitalism are subversives . "
References : Copi and Cohen : 208
Exclusive Premises Definition : A standard form categorical syllogism has two negative premises ( a negative premise is any premise of the form ' No S are P ' or ' Some S is not P' ) .
Examples :
( i) No Manitobans are Americans , and no Americans are Canadians , therefore , no Manitobans are Canadians .
In fact , since Manitoba is a province of Canada , all Manitobans are Canadians .
Proof : Assume that the premises are true .
Find an example which allows the premises to be true but which clearly contradicts the conclusion .
References : Copi and Cohen : 209
Fallacy of Drawing an Affirmative Conclusion From a Negative Premise Definition :
The conclusion of a standard form categorical syllogism is affirmative , but at least one of the premises is negative .
Examples :
( i) All mice are animals , and some animals are not dangerous , therefore some mice are dangerous .
( ii ) No honest people steal , and all honest people pay taxes , so some people who steal pay taxes .
Proof : Assume that the premises are true .
Find an example which allows the premises to be true but which clearly contradicts the conclusion .
References : Copi and Cohen : 210
Existential Fallacy Definition : A standard form categorical syllogism with two universal premises has a particular conclusion .
The idea is that some universal properties need not be instantiated .
It may be true that ' all trespassers will be shot ' even if there are no trespassers .
It may be true that ' all brakeless strains are dangerous ' even though there are no brakeless strains .
That is the point of this fallacy .
Examples :
( i) All mice are animals , and all animals are dangerous , so some mice are dangerous .
( ii ) No honest people steal , and all honest people pay taxes , so some honest people pay taxes .
Proof :
Assume that the premises are true , but that there are no instances of the category described .
For example , in ( i ) above , assume there are no mice , and in ( ii ) above , assume there are no honest people .
This shows that the conclusion is false .
References : Copi and Cohen : 210
Fallacies of Explanation
An explanation is a form of reasoning which attempts to answer the question " why ? "
For example , it is with an explanation that we answer questions such as , " Why is the sky blue ? "
A good explanation will be based on a scientific or empirical theory .
The explanation of why the sky is blue will be given in terms of the composition of the sky and theories of reflection .
Subverted Support
Definition :
An explanation is intended to explain who some phenomenon happens .
The explanation is fallacious if the phenomenon does not actually happen of if there is no evidence that it does happen .
Examples :
( i) The reason why most bachelors are timid is that their mothers were domineering .
( This attempts to explain why most bachelors are timid .
However , it is not the case that most bachelors are timid . )
( ii ) John went to the store because he wanted to see Maria .
( This is a fallacy if , in fact , John went to the library . )
( iii )
The reason why most people oppose the strike is that they are afraid of losing their jobs .
( This attempts to explain why workers oppose the strike .
But suppose they just voted to continue the strike , then in fact , they do n't oppose the strike .
[ This sounds made up , but it actually happened . ])
Proof :
Identify the phenomenon which is being explained .
Show that there is no reason to believe that the phenomenon has actually occurred .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 158
Non-Support Definition :
An explanation is intended to explain who some phenomenon happens .
In this case , there is evidence that the phenomenon occurred , but it is trumped up , biased or ad hoc evidence .
Examples :
( i) The reason why most bachelors are timid is that their mothers were domineering .
( This attempts to explain why most bachelors are timid .
However , it is shown that the author bases his generalization on two bachelors he once knew , both of whom were timid . )
( ii ) The reason why I get four or better on my evaluations is that my students love me .
( This is a fallacy when evaluations which score four or less are discarded on the grounds that the students did not understand the question . )
( iii ) The reason why Alberta has the lowest tuition in Canada is that tuition hikes have lagged behind other provinces .
( Lower tuitions in three other provinces - Quebec , Newfoundland and Nova Scotia - were dismissed as " special cases " [ again this is an actual example ] . )
Proof : Identify the phenomenon which is being explained .
Show that the evidence advanced to support the existence of the phenomenon was manipulated in some way .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 160
Untestability
Definition :
The theory advanced to explain why some phenomenon occurs cannot be tested .
We test a theory by means of its predictions .
For example , a theory may predict that light bends under certain conditions , or that a liquid will change color if sprayed with acid , or that a psychotic person will respond badly to particular stimuli .
If the predicted event fails to occur , then this is evidence against the theory .
A theory cannot be tested when it makes no predictions .
It is also untestable when it predicts events which would occur whether or not the theory were true .
Examples :
( i) Aircraft in the mid-Atlantic disappear because of the effect of the Bermuda Triangle , a force so subtle it cannot be measured on any instrument .
( The force of the Bermuda Triangle has no effect other than the occasional downing of aircraft .
The only possible prediction is that more aircraft will be lost .
But this is likely to happen whether or not the theory is true . )
( ii ) I won the lottery because my psychic aura made me win .
( The way to test this theory to try it again .
But the person responds that her aura worked for that one case only .
There is thus no way to determine whether the win was the result of an aura or luck . )
( iii ) The reason why everything exists is that God created it .
( This may be true , but as an explanation it carries no weight at all , because there is no way to test the theory .
No evidence in the world could possibly show that this theory is false , because any evidence would have to be created by God , according to the theory . )
( iv ) NyQuil makes you go to sleep because it has a dormative formula .
( When pressed , the manufacturers define a " dormative formula " as " something which makes you sleep " .
To test this theory , we would find something else which contains the domative formula and see if makes you go to sleep .
But how do we find something else which contains the dormative formula ?
We look for things which make you go to sleep .
But we could predict that things which make you sleep will make you sleep , no matter what the theory says .
The theory is empty . )
Proof : Identify the theory .
Show that it makes no predictions , or that the predictions it does make cannot ever be wrong , even if the theory is false .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 161
Limited Scope
Definition :
The theory does n't explain anything other than the phenomenon it explains .
Examples :
( i) There was hostility toward hippies in the 1960s because of their parents ' resentment toward children .
( This theory is flawed because it explains hostility toward hippies , and nothing else .
A better theory would be to say there was hostility toward hippies because hippies are different , and people fear things which are different .
This theory would explain not only hostility toward hippies , but also other forms of hostility . )
( ii ) People get schizophrenia because different parts of their brains split apart .
( Again , this theory explains schizophrenia - and nothing else . )
Proof : Identify the theory and the phenomenon it explains .
Show that the theory does not explain anything else .
Argue that theories which explain only one phenomenon are likely to be incomplete , at best .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 163
Limited Depth
Definition : Theories explain phenomena by appealing to some underlying cause or phenomena .
Theories which do not appeal to an underlying cause , and instead simply appeal to membership in a category , commit the fallacy of limited depth .
Examples :
( i) My cat likes tuna because she 's a cat .
( This theory asserts only that cats like tuna , without explaining why cats like tuna .
It thus does not explain why my cat likes tuna . )
( ii ) Ronald Reagan was militaristic because he was American .
( True , he was American , but what was it about being American that made him militaristic ?
What caused him to act in this way ?
The theory does not tell us , and hence , does not offer a good explanation . )
( iii ) You 're just saying that because you belong to the union .
( This attempt at dismissal tries to explain your behavior as frivolous .
However , it fails because it is not an explanation at all .
Suppose everyone in the union were to say that .
Then what ?
We have to get deeper - we have to ask why they would say that - before we can decide that what they are saying is frivolous . )
Proof :
Theories of this sort attempt to explain a phenomenon by showing that it is part of a category of similar phenomenon .
Accept this , then press for an explanation of the wider category of phenomenon .
Argue that a theory refers to a cause , not a classification .

Fallacies of Definition
In order to make our words or concepts clear , we use a definition .
The purpose of a definition is to state exactly what a word means .
A good definition should enable a reader to ' pick out ' instances of the word or concept with no outside help .
For example , suppose we wanted to define the word " apple " .
If the definition is successful , then the reader should be able go out into the world and select every apple which exists , and only apples .
If the reader misses some apples , or includes some other items ( such as pears ) , or can't tell whether something is an apple or not , then the definition fails .
Too Broad
Definition :
The definition includes items which should not be included .
Examples :
( i) An apple is something which is red and round .
( The planet Mars is red and round .
So it is included in the definition .
But obviously it is not an apple . )
( ii ) A figure is square if and only if it has four sides of equal length .
( Not only squares have four sides of equal length ; trapezoids do as well .
Proof : Identify the term being defined .
Identify the conditions in the definition .
Find an item which meets the condition but is obviously not an instance of the term .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 182
Too Narrow
Definition :
The definition does not include items which should be included .
Examples :
( i) An apple is something which is red and round .
( Golden Delicious apples are apples , however , they are not red ( they are yellow ) .
Thus they are not included in the definition , however , they should be . )
( ii ) A book is pornographic if and only if it contains pictures of naked people .
( The books written by the Marquis de Sade do not contain pictures .
However , they are widely regarded as pornographic .
Thus , the definition is too narrow .
( iii ) Something is music if and only if it is played on a piano .
( A drum solo can not be played on a piano , yet it is still considered music . )
Proof : Identify the term being defined .
Identify the conditions in the definition .
Find an item which is an instance of the term but does not meet the conditions .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 182
Failure to Elucidate Definition :
The definition is harder to understand than the term being defined .
Examples :
( i) Someone is lascivious if and only if he is wanton .
( The term being defined is " lascivious " .
But the meaning of the term " wanton " is just as obscure as the term " lascivious " .
So this definition fails to elucidate . )
( ii ) An object is beautiful if and only if it is aesthetically successful .
( The term " aesthetically successful " is harder to understand than the term " beautiful " .
Proof : Identify the term being defined .
Identify the conditions in the definition .
Show that the conditions are no more clearly defined than the term being defined .
References : Cedarblom and Paulsen : 184
Circular Definition Definition :
The definition includes the term being defined as a part of the definition .
( A circular definition is a special case of a Failure to Elucidate . )
Examples :
( i) An animal is human if and only if it has human parents .
( The term being defined is " human " .
But in order to find a human , we would need to find human parents .
To find human parents we would already need to know what a human is .
( ii ) A book is pornographic if and only if it contains pornography .
( We would need to know what pornography is in order to tell whether a book is pornographic . )
Proof : Identify the term being defined .
Identify the conditions in the definition .
Show that at least one term used in the conditions is the same as the term being defined .

Worth a look for its historical value .
* Copi , Irving M. and Cohen , Carl .
Introduction to Logic .
Eighth Edition .
Macmillan , 1990 .
For many years , Copi was the standard introductory text , and this edition continues the trend .
Covers propositional logic , categorical syllogisms , and informal fallacies .
A new edition appears every few years , which is hell on used book stores .
Copi is the master of the circle - and - arrow argument diagrams ( which never really worked , in my view ) .
Better introductory texts have appeared in recent years .
* Gianelli , A.P. Meaningful Logic .
Bruce Publishing Company , 1962 .
This is a classical logic text with numbered paragraphs and a focus on the universal and the particular .
All this sounds bad but the author is an engaging and earnest writer .
This book is useless to somebody who wants to learn logic , but a treasure to someone who knows and loves the discipline .
* Gilbart , Helen W. Reading With Confidence .
Scott , Foresman and Company , 1988 .
This is the sort of stuff that is passing for ' critical thinking ' in education these days .
This very basic text begins by looking at ' controlling ideas ' , transitions , context , inference , bias and prejudice .
It 's a noble objective , but it 's fuzzy and in some places just wrong .
Not recommended .
* Haack , Susan .
Philosophy of Logics .
Cambridge University Press , 1978 .
This book is serious reading and should not be attempted without a good grounding in the field .
Covers theories of truth , paradoxes , classical and non-classical logics , problems in modal logic ( including relevance logic ) , and many - valued logic .
Fascinating .
* Huff , Darrell .
How to Lie With Statistics .
W.W. Norton , 1954 .
I have the 38th printing , which should be an indication of this slim book 's popularity .
A classic in the field and a must read for anybody who reads newspapers or magazines .
Although the examples are seriously dated , the material is not .
For some reason , many of the tricks
Huff discusses are not covered in more standard texts .
Recommended . * Hughes , G.H. , and Cresswell , M.J. An Introduction to Modal Logic .
Methuen and Co. Ltd. , 1968 .
For many years the standard introduction to modal logic , this book is a must read for anyone seriously interested in advanced topics .

It was my Bible in 1987 .
Recommended .
* Jason , Gary .
Introduction to Logic .
Jones and Bartlett , 1994 .
A standard introductory text , this book covers informal fallacies and propositional logic .
Instead of describing categorical logic , it instead treats the subject ( more accurately , in my view ) as a branch of set theory and the logic of properties and relations .
Mill 's Methods are relegated to an appendix ; now that hurts !
Jason uses squares and circles instead of the usual letters to stand for propositions in inference rules ; this is a tactic which worked well in my own classes .
* Jager , Ronald .
Essays in Logic From Aristotle to Russell .

Contains selections from Aristotle , John Stuart Mill , Lewis Carroll ( ! ) , John Dewey , Bertrand Russell , Henry Veatch and Gilbert Ryle .
This makes it eclectic , to say the least , but interesting reading .
* Jeffrey , Richard .
Formal Logic : Its Scope and Limits .
McGraw - Hill , 1981 , 1967 .
A beautiful book and an absolute must for any serious student of logic or computation .
Can be used as an introductory text , but this use is not recommended .
While it focuses entirely on deductive logic , its crisp definitions and theorems supplement a traditional ( truth table ) method of derivation along with truth trees .
Jeffry is particularly strong on completeness and decidability .
Recommended .
* Johnson , R.H. , and Blair , J.A. Logical Self - Defense .
McGraw - Hill Ryerson , 1983 , 1977 .
This book focuses almost entirely on informal fallacies and is intended for an audience that wants to read newspapers more critically .
A noble objective but its limited scope means that a study of logic is better served by other texts .
* Kahane , Howard .
Logic and Philosophy : A Modern Introduction .
Wadsworth , 1990 .
A standard introductory text covering propositional and syllogistic logic , induction and fallacies .
Part five is good : discussions of modal , deontic and epistemic logic along with an introduction to axiom systems .
* Kelly , David .
The Art of Reasoning .
W.W. Norton , 1988 .
A very nice blend of formal and informal argument forms .
Covers definition , propositional and predicate logic , and inductive reasoning .
Incorporates a number of effective graphical aids , especially in the discussion of definition ( which precedes the discussion of propositions , a welcome change from what has become standard form of late ) .
Recommended as a good first logic text .
* Mayfield , Marlys .
Thinking for Yourself : Developing Critical Thinking Skills Through Writing .
Wadsworth Publishing Company , 1987 .
A very informal text which relies more on contemporary teaching strategies ( such as ' discovery exercises ' and memory maps ) .
A strongly American political view of the world permeates this work .
Not recommended .
* Pospesel , Howard .
Introduction to Logic : Propositional Logic .
Second Edition .

An outstanding teaching book illustrated with contemporary ( for 1984 ) cartoons and lively examples .
Uses arrow to represent the conditional operator instead of the standard horseshoe .
Recommended .
* Purtill , Richard L. Logic for Philosophers .
Harper and Row , 1971 .
The book is dedicated to Rudolf Carnap , an insignia which should alert the reader to expect staunch formalism throughout .
Purtill does n't disappoint .
The book covers propositional , syllogistic , class , and modal logic .
* Putnam , Hilary .
Philosophy of Logic .
Harper , 1971 .
Heady , engaging , and Putnam at his expository best , this book is required reading for those interested in some of the issues beneath the surface of logic , and especially the realism - nominalism debate .
Not for beginners .
* Quine , Willard Van Orman .
Methods of Logic .
Fourth Edition .
Harvard University Press , 1950 , 1959 .
An authoritative text .
Quine focuses entirely on deductive forms : truth functional logic and quantification .
Quine 's unorthodox symbolism makes this book inappropriate for the novice .
Essential for students for Quine 's philosophy .
* Rescher , Nicholas .
Introduction to Logic .
St. Martin ’s Press , 1964 .
Rescher 's book forms the foundation for Copi's Introduction to Logic and hence covers syllogistic forms , informal fallacies , propositional logic and inductive logic .
A useful text for the novice , but Copi is more up to date .
Rescher himself is one of my favorite authors .
* Salmon , Merrilee .
Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking .
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , 1984 .
Quickly covers deductive forms , but the bulk of the book is devoted to inductive argument , conditionals , confirmation of hypotheses , and arguments based on relations .
Thus it has a lot of material not covered by other texts , but is not for the beginner .
* Salmon , Wesley .
Logic .
Third Edition .
Prentice - Hall , 1983 .
Part of the widely popular ( and vastly overpriced ) Foundations of Philosophy Series , this slim volume covers basic deduction , induction , and some issues in logic and language .
This is not a teaching text , as there are no exercises .
Actually , it 's hard to say why it was written , except perhaps to round out the series .
Wesley Salmon is authoritative ; this book is not .
* Schagrin , Morton L. The Language of Logic : A Programmed Text .
Random House , 1968 .
This is a good idea which did n't really work .
The reader works through a series of ' frames ' and goes to different frames depending on how they answer questions .
A lot like hypertext , only slower .
The book should never have been printed in Helvetica .
* Sellars , Roy Wood .
The Essentials of Logic .
Revised Edition .
The Riverside Press , 1925 .
This transitional text resembles eighteenth century works but attempts to come to grips with the formal and mathematical nature of logic newly discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .

A nice compact treatment of the major problems in inductive logic .
Includes a lengthy ( though dated ) treatment of the traditional problem of induction along with and Goodman 's new problem .
* Stephens , William N. Hypotheses and Evidence .
Thomas Y. Crowell , 1968 .
As the title indicates , this text focuses on induction , causality , hypotheses , theories and evidence .
Unfortunately , it came out before a lot of the recent and important work in the area and so is of historical interest only .
* Thomason , Richmond .
Symbolic Logic : An Introduction .
Collier - Macmillan , 1970 .
Required reading for any student of philosophy , mathematics or the harder sciences .
Reads more easily than The Logic Book and provides a thorough introduction to the semantics , in addition to the syntax , of standard argument forms .
Additionally , Thomason covers identity , set theory and mathematical induction .
Not for the beginner .
* Weston , Anthony .
A Rulebook for Arguments .
Hackett , 1987 .
This slim volume ( 93 pages ) serves as an excellent introduction for novices .
The text surveys commonly used argument forms : arguments by example , arguments by analogy , etc. and shows the reader how to use proper argument form in essays .
Recommended . * Yanal , Robert J. Basic Logic .
West Publishing Company , 1988 .
Exactly as the title suggests .
Uses a version of Copi 's circle - and - arrow diagrams ( but instead of using numbers , he uses phrases - a big improvement ) .
Covers arguments , deductive logic and inductive logic .

I always knew it was summertime when my old man took our American flag out of the closet and displayed it outside our house .
Other dads in the neighborhood would do the
same .
All down my neighborhood street , flags of red , white , and blue flapped in the humid Oklahoma air .
With summer right around the corner and all the patriotic holidays that come along with it , here ’s a brief rundown on the United States Flag Code so you ’ll know how to fly Old Glory with respect .
History of the Flag Code
The Flag Code was passed on June 14 , 1923 .
Before that date , there was no federal regulation on how to display the United States flag .
Both the American Legion and the VFW worked to promote flag etiquette before the passage of the Flag Code .
The Flag Code is found in several sections of the U.S. Code .
4 U.S.C. 1 pertains to the flag .
36 U.S.C. 3 covers patriotic customs and observances .
The code is merely a guideline .
It does not impose penalties for misuse of the American flag or for not following the guidelines .
There previously was a section in the Flag Code that contained criminal penalties for certain acts of desecration to the flag .
That section was struck down as unconstitutional in the Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson .
Congress then amended the section with the Flag Protection Act of 1989 .
The statute imposed a fine and / or one year of prison for knowingly mutilating or physically defiling an American flag .
This statute was also struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court decision , this time in U.S. v. Eichman .
You can read the case here .
Many will be surprised that Justice Anton Scalia , an extremely conservative Supreme Court Justice , sided with majority opinion on the unconstitutionality of the statute .
Anatomy of the United States Flag
The U.S. Flag consists of a blue rectangle in the canton bearing 50 white stars representing each state .
This is called the Union .
The Union is offset by 13 alternating red and white stripes representing the 13 original colonies .
There is n’t a legally defined symbolism of the flag and its colors .
It is said that George Washington said the following about the symbolisim of the flag :
We take the stars from Heaven , the red from our mother country , separating it by white stripes , thus showing that we have separated from her , and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty .
When to Fly the Flag
Which Days .
The flag should be displayed on all days .
However , the Flag Code sets out days that it is particularly appropriate to display the flag :
New Year ’s Day , January 1
Inauguration Day , January 20
Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday , third Monday in January
Lincoln ’s Birthday , February 12
Washington ’s Birthday , third Monday in February
Easter Sunday ( variable )
Mother ’s Day , second Sunday in May
Armed Forces Day , third Saturday in May
Memorial Day ( half - staff until noon ) , the last Monday in May
Flag Day , June 14
Independence Day , July 4
Labor Day , first Monday in September
Constitution Day , September 17
Columbus Day , second Monday in October
Navy Day , October 27
Veterans Day , November 11
Thanksgiving Day , fourth Thursday in November
Christmas Day , December 25
and such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the United States
the birthdays of states ( date of admission )
and on state holidays .
Time of day .
According to the Code , it ’s “ custom to display the flag outside only from sunrise to sunset .
However , when a patriotic effect is desired , the flag may be displayed twenty - four hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness . ”

How to properly display the flag
§ 7 of the Flag Code governs the position and manner of display of the United State flag .
Displaying the flag from a staff on a building .
This is how most American ’s display the flag from their homes .
When you display the flag from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from a window sill , balcony , or front of building , the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half staff .
4 U.S.C 7(h ) .
Displaying the flag over the middle of the street .
During patriotic holidays , many communities hang a flag over the middle of the street .
If this is done , the flag should be suspended vertically with the union facing north on an east to west street or the east in a north and south street .

Displaying the flag at half staff .
The United States flag is flown at half staff to pay respect to fallen public figures or soldiers .
When the flag is flown at half staff , it should be first hoisted to the peak of the staff for an instant and then lowered to the half - staff position .
The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day .
On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half - staff until noon only , then raised to the top of the staff .
The President or Governor of a state can order the flag to be flown at half staff in the event of the death of public officials , foreign dignitaries , or soldiers .
The flag shall be flown at half - staff 30 days from the death of the President or former President ; 10 days from the death of the Vice President the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States , or the Speaker of the House of Representatives ; from the day of death until interment of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , a Secretary of an executive or military department , a former Vice President , or the Governor of a State , territory , or possession ; and on the day of death and the following day for a Member of Congress .
4 U.S.C. 7 ( m ) .
Displaying a flag without a staff .
If you decide to display the flag without a staff , the flag should be displayed flat , whether indoors or out .
When displayed either horizontally or vertically from the wall , the union should be uppermost and to the flag ’s own right , that is , to the observer ’s left .
When displayed in a window it should be displayed in the same way .

Flag Etiquette
Conduct during hoisting , lowering or passing of flag .
One of my fondest memories is going to the annual Fourth of July parade in my hometown and watching people stand up from their lawn chairs with their right hand over their heart as the flag passed .
It always gave me chills and still does .
During a ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in review , all persons present except those in uniform should face the flag and stand at attention with right hand over the heart .
Those present in uniform should render the military salute .
When not in uniform , men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder , the hand being over the heart .
Aliens should stand at attention .
The salute to the flag in a moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag passes .
4 U.S.C. 9 .
Retiring a flag .
Contrary to popular belief , you do not have to retire a United States flag if it has touched the ground .
Just correct the situation immediately and if the flag has been dirtied , clean it by hand .

A flag need only be retired if it “ is in such a condition that is no longer a fitting emblem for display .
” 4 U.S.C. 8 ( k ) .
Basically this means if your flag is old and tattered , it ’s time to get a new one .
When a flag is retired , “ it should be destroyed in a dignified way , preferably by burning . ”

You can always take your old flag to your local VFW for help on disposing the flag appropriately .

How to Fold the Flag
Photo by airborne4christ
Learning how to fold the American flag was one of the first things I learned as a Cub Scout .
It ’s one of those things that left a lasting impression in my mind .
You would always see a military honor guard fold the flag with such precision and grace .
I felt pretty awesome folding the flag with the same respect they did .
1 . Fold the flag in half width - wise twice .
2 . Fold up a triangle , starting at the all - striped end and repeat until only the end of the union is exposed .
3 . Fold the remaining square into the triangle and tuck inside the folds .
A triangle of just the blue field of stars should be visible .

Why does the military wear a flag patch backwards on their arm ?
The field of stars is to be worn closest to your heart .
Moreover , the flag should look like it ’s advancing , not retreating .
So , if a patch is worn on your right sleeve , you should apply it backwards .

Here ’s one thing that should be added to the flag code : Only buy Made in America flags .
Several times
I ’ve been looking at an American flag , usually the chintzy plastic variety , which should n’t even exist , and have seen a tag saying “ Made in China . ”
It ’s enough to make Betsy Ross roll over in her grave .
Americans spend over 5.3 million dollars on imported flags each year , most of them made in China .
Perhaps even more disconcerting is that during 2001 , in the wave of patriotism that washed over America after 9/11 , American bought $ 52 million dollars in imported flags .
The flag should symbolize the blood , sweat , and tears of American men and women who brought this country into existence , not our indebtedness to China and the death of the American manufacturing sector .
So have a little pride , cough of a few more bucks , and buy an American flag made by Americans in the U S of A .
Q . You ’re expected to attend many meetings at your company , and most of them are a big waste of time .
The same people hog the floor with pointless , redundant comments , while others say nothing .
The discussion inevitably goes off topic , and you start to feel trapped .
It ’s excruciating .
Can anything be done ?
A. Yes , if the meeting leaders make a commitment to set ground rules and take an active role in guiding the discussion .
But before a meeting is even scheduled , it ’s important to know whether it should be held at all .
In general , companies probably hold about twice as many meetings as are necessary , said John E. Tropman , a professor of nonprofit management at the University of Michigan who has done research on meetings .
Less is better than more , because of “ the ineptitude of this social form , ” he said .
Too often , managers hold meetings in the vague , wishful hope that something will happen ; they may even use them as a way to avoid work , he said .
A result is a meeting that yields no decisions  which , in turn , leads to yet another useless meeting .
Fight Magazine 1st Anniversary Party at TAO ( Photos )
Being an Ultimate Fighting junkie , I was deeply disappointed that Fight magazine had their one year anniversary at TAO in Las Vegas and there was no invitation in my mailbox .
Several of my favorites did show up to help celebrate including Urijah Faber , who is ranked 6th in the Pound for Pound category and BJ Penn , who is ranked 3rd in Pound for Pound and 1st in the Lightweight division .
Check out Fight magazine website for the latest fight rankings , photos of the HOT fight girls , fight forums and latest interviews with some of the best fighters .
On August 9th Ultimate Fighting is coming to the Target Center in Minneapolis , MN .
Note to Fight magazine : by coincidence I will be in the area , so ... if you want to hook me up and seat me center stage just send me an email and it 'll be a done deal .

Editor ’s note :
The reaction resulting from this story is flying in so fast we ’ve moved it all to its own page .

——
Some Print on Demand ( POD ) publishers are privately screaming “ Monopoly ! ” while others are seething with rage over startling phone conversations they ’re having with Amazon / BookSurge representatives .
Why is n’t anybody talking about it openly ?
Because they ’re afraid – very , very afraid .
Amazon.com purchased BookSurge , a small POD publisher / printer back in 2005 .
Amazon also lists and sells titles for the largest POD printer , Lightning Source , which is owned by Ingram ( the large book distributor ) .
According to their website , Lightning Source serves more than 4,300 publisher clients and has more than 400,000 titles in their system .
You ’d think Amazon ’s purchase of BookSurge might have made things a bit uncomfortable between the two companies .
However , they continued to work together , getting books on demand to Amazon.com ’s loyal customers .
Things appeared to be cruising along just fine , but perhaps not anymore .
Reports have been trickling in from the POD underground that Amazon / BookSurge representatives have been approaching some Lightning Source customers , first by email introduction and then by phone ( nobody at BookSurge seems to want to put anything in writing ) .
When Lightning Source customers speak with the BookSurge representative , the reports say , they are basically told they can either have BookSurge start printing their books or the “ buy ” button on their Amazon.com book pages will be “ turned off . ”
The book information would remain on Amazon , and people could still order the book from resellers ( companies that list new and used books in Amazon ’s Marketplace section ) , but customers would not be able to buy the book from Amazon directly , nor qualify for the coveted “ free shipping ” that Amazon offers .
Do n’t believe it ?
I did n’t believe it either .
I am Angela Hoy , the co-owner of POD services company BookLocker.com and publisher of WritersWeekly.com .
I am well - known in the industry for my activism performed through WritersWeekly Whispers and Warnings .
Over the years , we have helped writers recover tens of thousands of dollars in fees from deadbeat editors and publishers , helped them negotiate better contract terms , assisted writers in obtaining payment after their copyrights have been violated , and even assisted police in collecting evidence to prosecute criminals who have preyed on writers .
I am also the author of 11 non-fiction books .
Still doubting the reports could really be true , I emailed an Amazon / BookSurge representative who ’s been trying to get us to talk to him by phone .
John Clifford of Amazon / BookSurge called me at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday , March 26 , 2008 .
My first comment was to tell him we heard a rumor that POD publishers who did n’t use BookSurge would have the “ buy ” button on their Amazon.com book pages turned off .
He said , “ What ?
Who told you that ?
That ’s not true ! ”
I told him I ’d heard some rumors from the “ POD underground . ”
He said he ’d previously tried to talk to my husband , Richard Hoy , the President and CEO of BookLocker .
I explained that we had a very bad experience with BookSurge in the past and that he was , naturally , hesitant to do business with them again .
( Google the words BookSurge complaint without any quotes to see other customers ’ comments about them as well . )
He claimed the people who worked for BookSurge back then are probably all gone ( but that did n’t explain the more recent complaints ) .
He made his sales pitch , talking about percentages and such , and said many POD publishers are resisting their attempts to convert to BookSurge .
Mr. Clifford also said BookSurge ’s aim was to help Amazon customers get their books faster .
What he did n’t say was that Lightning Source not only packages books for Amazon customers in boxes that feature an Amazon.com return address label , but also drop - ships those orders directly to Amazon customers at Amazon ’s request .
Hmm …
He stated several times that books not converted to BookSurge ’s system would be “ taken down . ”
Since that was n’t exactly what we ’d heard , I asked about books that perhaps were n’t selling well , that are n’t good candidates for converting to BookSurge ( books that would remain for sale through Lightning Source , but would never be converted to BookSurge due to the time / expense involved ) .
Contrary to what he stated at the very beginning of our conversation , Mr. Clifford finally admitted that books not converted to BookSurge would have the “ buy ” button turned off on Amazon.com , just as we ’d heard from several other POD publishers who had similar conversations with Amazon / BookSurge representatives .
Mr. Clifford said authors of those books could participate in the Amazon.com Advantage Program , meaning they would have to pay Amazon $ 29.95 per year PLUS 55 % of the list price of their book , as well as buy and then send those books to Amazon directly for them to warehouse and ship to customers .
I explained to him that we had more than 1500 books in print and that it would take quite awhile to convert all of those over to BookSurge ’s system .
He said as long as the relationship was “ moving forward ” that the “ buy ” button would remain active on our authors ’ books that had not yet been switched .
Another comment Mr. Clifford made was that their eventual desire is to have no books from other POD publishers available on Amazon.com .
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING ?!
I have to wonder if Jeff Bezos is even aware of what is going on within his organization .
Here is Amazon ’s Vision Statement , taken directly from their website :
“ Our vision is to be earth ’s most customer centric company ; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online . ”
What it does n’t say is , “ Our customers can buy any print on demand book they might want online …as long as we also get paid to print it . ”
Nobody likes being backed into a corner , and saying “ do this or else ” naturally breeds angry rejection and hostility .
If we did agree to sign the contract , pulling and transferring files to Amazon / Booksurge would take an enormous amount of time and money .
From the POD publishers we ’ve talked to , and from our own experience at BookLocker , we could all be looking at a dire and immediate threat of revenue cuts if we refuse to sign the Amazon / BookSurge contract .
Most importantly , there could be an outcry from and potential financial hardship on the authors , who are completely innocent in all of this .
In BookLocker ’s opinion , and the opinion of all the fellow Lightning Source customers we talked to , the Amazon / BookSurge proposal does not appear attractive at all ( yes , we obtained the contract and the file submission specifications ) .
Amazon / BookSurge would make money two ways on Amazon.com sales – first the fee for printing the books , and then 48 % of the list price of each sale through Amazon.com .
Lightning Source allows its customers to set their own discount rate for Amazon and other retail sales , and does not force POD publishers or authors to pay “ 48 % . ”
Furthermore , it could take the larger POD publishers months to submit their book files to Amazon / BookSurge , at a considerable cost and number of man-hours .
This makes the deal even less attractive .
Finally , while the initial list of books submitted by POD publishers could be submitted to Amazon / BookSurge for free , the contract states future books would cost $ 50 each to process .
The cost for individual authors to publish through BookSurge is considerably more , with an average publishing package cost of more than $ 1,000 .
Since Amazon / BookSurge does not offer Ingram distribution ( Ingram distribution is considered imperative in the industry for bookstore sales ) , any company that accepts the Amazon / BookSurge deal , who desires to keep offering Ingram distribution , may need to maintain two copies of the book files .
Since the Amazon / BookSurge current specs do n’t match the Lightning Source specs , future book files , both interior and cover , may need to be formatted separately .
So , they would have to pay double the setup fees and might have to do double the formatting work as well … or pay designers to do double the formatting work .
Likewise , self - published authors who believe they must have Ingram Distribution AND an active “ buy ” button on Amazon to be successful may need to pay double the setup fees ( to a POD publisher AND Amazon / BookSurge ) , and also may need to create two separate sets of formatted files .
In the event where two versions of a book might be available , Mr. Clifford said the Amazon / BookSurge version of the POD book would trump ( override ) the version offered by Lightning Source on Amazon.com .
AMAZON WAS BUILT BY BOOKS …. That Were Written By AUTHORS
When authors get wind of this , we believe they are going to be livid .
Authors are also readers .
They love books .
We suspect they buy from Amazon in droves .
I , myself , have been an Amazon junkie for years , not only heavily promoting Amazon.com in my non-fiction books for writers and on our very popular website , WritersWeekly.com , but also listing my own books for sale there , ordering other authors ’ books , DVDs and numerous other products as well .
I pulled up our Amazon customer account and looked at our receipts .
We ’ve spent $ 1508.81 at Amazon.com in the past six months .
Multiply that by the number of authors this will affect … authors who , like me , have a multitude of websites to choose from when doing their shopping online .
In addition , authors participate in the Amazon experience , via blogs on the website , by posting reviews about other books , and more , activities that help to continually make Amazon bigger and better .
Authors are a loyal bunch !
For years , they ’ve been faithfully sending their readers to Amazon.com , again and again , even when they earned lower royalties for doing so .
It ’s not inconceivable to think that this group , if shoved against a wall like this , wo n’t simply pledge their allegiance elsewhere .
Let ’s face it , BarnesandNoble.com offers free shipping on orders of $ 25 or more , too .
Authors can change the links to their book pages on their websites , in their ezines and press releases , and even in their email signatures to their book ’s page at BarnesandNoble.com .
Authors can spend their own money elsewhere as well ( as I plan to do ) .
I imagine BarnesandNoble.com will be very happy to process the extra book sales that could result from all of this .
Amazon.com might also upset countless companies that have Amazon Affiliate bookstores on their websites ( many authors have these , too ! ) .
If Amazon / BookSurge were to follow through with turning off the “ buy ” buttons for thousands of POD titles , customers following those links from other websites could be confused and annoyed .
After clicking on a link , they would find no easy way to purchase the book directly from Amazon , and no way to obtain free shipping on that book , even if they ’re willing to buy more products to meet the $ 25 free shipping threshold .
One would think Amazon must know the free shipping strategy works to upsell customers on additional products .
That ’s why they offer it .
Without it , these customers could have no incentive to buy more products because the product they surfed in to buy does not qualify .
One has to wonder if traditional publishers will be next ?
Will Amazon eventually require all books sold through Amazon.com to be printed by BookSurge ?
Let ’s all hope and pray this situation is one huge , misguided idea from some mid-level management person and not corporate policy being dictated from the office of Jeff Bezos .
What can you do ?
Let Amazon know what you think about this “ offer ” by Amazon / BookSurge .

~~PERSONAL POSTSCRIPT
TO AUTHORS FROM ANGELA ~~
There is no reason to panic .
Not having an active “ buy ” button on Amazon.com is not the end of the world .
After selling print books for eight years , it has been our experience that “ chance purchases ” of self - published books on Amazon.com are not the norm .
Authors slap books up on Amazon.com all the time , do n’t market them , and sell zero copies .
For most self - published authors , sales are almost always author - driven , meaning the bookstore link you use in YOUR marketing efforts is what ’s driving your sales , not just simply having your book listed on Amazon.com .
We know from experience that the customer is going to buy your book from where you tell them to buy your book .
If you want your customers to qualify for free shipping , you can send them to BarnesandNoble.com , and tell them their order might qualify for free shipping ( many people do n’t know BarnesandNoble.com offers free shipping ! ) .
THESE ARE THE ACTION ITEMS WE ARE GIVING TO OUR BOOKLOCKER .COM AUTHORS :
1. Remove all Amazon.com links from your marketing materials – website , ezine , blog , email signature , press releases , articles — everything .
2 . Change those links to your book ’s page on BarnesandNoble.com .
To obtain that link , search for your book ’s title at http://www.bn.com.
All Booklocker.com print books are on their website .
3 . If / when the booklocker.com “ buy ” buttons are turned off on Amazon.com and you feel your button absolutely must be on , please contact Angela to discuss how we can help you participate in their Advantage program .
4 . Do n’t forget to contact Amazon to tell them what you ’re doing in response to their horrible actions !
I am repeatedly amazed that politicians ( especially older ones , like McCain ) do n’t seem to get the fact that everything they say is now available on the Internet for instant review .
That must be why they keep denying things they said against solid evidence to the contrary .
For example , McCain ’s repeated statements that he does n’t know much about economics :
In December 2007 “ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should .
I ’ve got Greenspan ’s book . ”
In November 2005 to the Wall Street Journal “ I ’m going to be honest : I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues .
I still need to be educated . ”
He repeated the same quote a month later in an interview with the Boston Globe .
In 2000 , during his run for the presidency , the ( former maverick ) McCain rejected “ tax cuts for the rich ” and said he had previously been in favor of supply - side economics because “ he did n’t pay … attention to those issues in the past ” .
But now that he has clinched the Republican nomination , he has once again flip - flopped to become a born - again supply - sider , even though his ( new ) claims that cutting taxes for the rich stimulates the economy have been debunked .
Carly Fiorina , one of his advisors on the economy , even acknowledged on Fox News that McCain has said that he knows little about economics “ he did say it one time , no question , maybe twice . ”
Pretty clear , yes ?
So in an interview on Fox News last week , McCain was asked “ Was it a mistake for you to suggest that overall your attentiveness to the economy is subordinated by national security ? ”
His response was to claim that was a statement taken “ out of context ” .
And back in January , Tim Russert asked McCain about his “ I still need to be educated ” comment , McCain denied it , saying “ I do n’t know where you got that quote . ”
Regardless of what he has said , it is clear that McCain does n’t know much about economics .
He still claims that he can save $ 100 billion a year by eliminating earmarks and pork - barrel spending , a claim that seems to be based entirely in fantasy .
SuicideGirls vs Lithium Picnic Lawsuit Settled
So I guess this is just weird sex trial coverage week at BlueBlood .
net .
First Max Hardcore gets convicted , then Ira Isaacs gets a stay , and then R. Kelly got acquitted .
Now it appears that notoriously litigious , Hot Topic - esque , altporn , membership site SuicideGirls ( aka SG ) has settled their most recent lawsuit .
It is hard to keep track of all their legal scuffles , but this was the one against their former contractor fetish photographer Philip Warner and his collaborator altmodel Apnea .
The initial dispute between SuicideGirls and Apnea appeared to arise because she modeled with a girl named Katie for a forthcoming site , which had offered her and Katie disproportionately large sums of money for a simple nude photo shoot .
Even though this new site had not launched yet and most planned sites never do launch , SG was particularly bent out of shape about the Apnea and Katie photos because Katie had also reportedly worked as SG ’s accountant .
This presumably meant that she was privy to very proprietary information .
SG went so ballistic over this that they not only took away Apnea ’s complimentary site membership , but they put a stop payment on a check they had already written to her .
The dispute between comically psycho-competitive SuicideGirls and their staff photographer Philip Warner appeared to arise when Philip posted on the internet that he was going to be adding community features to his own web site , basically making it a lot more like SG .
According to AltPorn . net ’s exclusive interview with Apnea , SG handed Philip a new and more exclusionary contract one day after he announced his web site intentions .
He refused to sign the new more controlling contract , so one day later SG made a public break with him .
SG then apparently had the hubris to inform Philip that “ alternative images of beauty ( dyed hair , piercing and tattoos ) ” were their sort of trademark and therefor his work was a violation of his noncompete and he fired back publicly saying that the images
“ you describe reflect the same style that I photographed [ Apnea ] in prior to our participation and awareness of the suicidegirls.com site .
SG has no ownership of this broad genre , it is clearly in the public domain and has been around on web sites like BlueBlood since before SG was created . ”
Five weeks later , without bothering to reply to his publicly - posted letter , SG filed suit against Philip Warner .
Here is where it gets weird .
First of all , Philip did not stop working with SG when they put a stop payment on the check to Apnea , but , as soon as he had a problem with them , he started asking other people to donate to his legal defense .
As far as he was concerned , while Apnea ’s problem might not have been his problem , his problem was apparently supposed to be everyone else ’s problem .
The second weird thing was that Philip presented like SG was trying to take away his livelihood , yet the gossip sites claimed he actually made his living by owning and operating rental properties in Texas and court documents assert that SG , over all the years he worked for them , paid out a bit over ten grand total .
This works out to a little over $ 2,000 a year .
That is not exactly enough to live on .
The third weird thing is that the court documents for the initial complaint nowhere mention that Philip appeared to have been planning a competitive site targeted directly at SG ’s slice of the marketplace .
Instead they named Apnea ’s solo girl site in the suit as what they were concerned about competing with .
Yes , the Apneatic site domain was registered to Philip and he shot a significant portion of the content on it and he probably ran it in partnership with her .
But why mention her site , especially when Philip claims his contract specifically permitted him to shoot for solo girl sites , and not mention the planned multi- girl site which seemed to trigger the falling - out ?
Somewhere in here , SG also licensed a bunch of their own unretouched photos of Apnea to a number of adult internet companies with the condition that they were not permitted to use a name Apnea wished to be called .
Eventually SG apparently also named Apnea in their suit which was initially just vs. Philip .
Here is where it gets really weird .
For the past year and a half , Philip and Apnea have been aggressively campaigning for charity and donations from the creative community for their legal defense .
Photographers have been told they are not allowed to participate in art shows unless they promise to donate any proceeds from their own work to Philip ’s defense .
Models worked for free to make anti-SG legal defense posters .
Philip made T - shirts and prints promoting his lawsuit and asked people to buy them in support of his legal defense .
Site owners and other clients all felt like maybe they should pay Philip and Apnea slightly higher rates to help with their legal plight .
Every time Philip or Apnea sold an unwanted piece of photo equipment or an old dress on eBay , they reminded everyone that all this was to pay for their legal defense and that everyone who hates SuicideGirls should contribute to their legal defense fund .
I do not know exactly just how many people gave them money or exactly how much money they were given because , unlike what one would expect from a charity , there has never been any kind of public accounting of donations nor the expenses those funds covered .
Certainly , a lot of people championed Philip and Apnea ’s cause and tried to be as supportive as their personal situations permitted .
Here is where is gets really really weird .
Today , Philip Warner and Apnea issued a joint statement , apparently written by Philip but signed by both , which said in part ,
“ We want to make it clear that we 100 % have no hostilities towards SuicideGirls in anyway anymore , we all came to a really fair agreement over this dispute , and there were no bad people here , just mistakes and misunderstandings .
If you ’ve boycotted SG on our behalf , you helped us come to this agreement , so thank you but the battle is over , and we ’re all friends again . ”
They state that there will be new SG product authored by Philip and they include a link for anyone who wishes to join SuicideGirls .
The link is an affiliate link which they explain saying ,
“ To help offset our legal expenses , when you sign up with SuicideGirls , please use this affiliate code so that we can use the money to pay off our lawyers and focus on Apnea ’s modeling and my photography ! ”
Did they seriously keep beating the dead horse of their legal expenses , while asking people to join the very site they were fighting and telling everyone to boycott for its evil ways and lameness just one day ago ?
The very reason Philip and Apnea were able to get so much support for their legal defense was that a lot of people truly believe that SG is an evil company .
According to Apnea ’s MySpace , she is currently , in 2008 , twenty - two - years - old .
The first nude photo set featuring her posted to the SuicideGirls site in 2003 .
I think people should take responsibility for their actions , no matter what their age , but I do have some sympathy for a teenage girl who entered into business with a predatory corporation .
Philip ’s MySpace , on the other hand , puts his current age at thirty - nine - years - old .
He is a grown - ass man , and he knew what he was getting into with SG , and he still chose to lie down with dogs , and then ask everyone else to help with his flea problem .
He supported SG aggressively when many other people complained of all manner of mistreatment .
He asked for a hand - out when he had a problem , and now he is telling everyone it is all good because he is getting back in bed with SG .
I ca n’t find it in my heart to have the same sympathy for him that I might for Apnea .
They are still supporting SG , which is still an organization that is a blight on our scene .
I believe that SG head honcho Sean Suhl is pretty much personally responsible for most of what has gone horribly wrong with the counterculture in recent years .
He helped collect alt demographics for secretive data mining corporation Experian , and they sold that info to Hot Topic , so Hot Topic could effectively shut down all the independent punk rock stores which were the cornerstone cultural centers of so many local scenes .
And do n’t even get me started on how Sean Suhl ’s projects have made every effort to inhibit the creation of art , disempower men , and turn women into jokes .
Now , to be fair , despite the fact that I feel this way , I actually think SG had a totally legitimate complaint if they signed a photographer and a model to an exclusive agreement , promoted that photographer and model , made that photographer and model privy to a lot of proprietary information , and then the photographer and model both violated their contracts .
Then again , SG was unable to win a legal case against hacker Chad Grant , even when he admitted to hacking SG ’s server and having every intention of competing with SG in the marketplace in a way which he hoped would put them out of business .
The court transcripts from that trial are truly hilarious and maybe SG settled this case to avoid creating another laugh riot at their own expense .
Now Philip and Apnea are having their joint statement with its affiliate link spam posted to all sorts of sites which generally never allow that sort of blatant commercial promotion .
The responses so far indicate that SG may have laid off on a case they could have won , but they also managed to give Philip enough rope to hang himself .
Here are a few of the responses Philip and Apnea ’s incredibly sell - out and self - centered statement has received so far .
On MM , photographer Chris Keeling sums it up nicely , saying ,
“ wtf ?
I thought we had been trained over the last year or so to Hate SG ?
Now the OP is spamming the Forums to get us to go join SG to go see his earlier work with them ?
It makes me think this whole fundraising thing was just a carefully orchestrated piece of shit !
I ’m pissed off .
They are either vile despicable people or they are not .
Just because the OP can make money again does n’t make them okay now . ”
The beautiful blogger Baby Sinead adds ,
“ Seriously , I did n’t even send money or anything but I feel like a tool .
I guess everyone has this time where they choose to sell out or keep up the fight . ”
Photographer Carl J Speed II says in part ,
“ I ’ve been a staunch defender all over the internets and my social circles , spent a lot of time convincing people to stay away from SG ( members and perspective models alike ) , wore my Vive La Picnic shirt ( that I bought ) , and this just feels dirty .
Lying in bed with the bad guys now does n’t give any sense of justice about this scenario … I ’m still angry .
I do n’t care what arrangement was reached of “ what had to be said ” , SG are not “ okay ” , this was n’t just a fucking misunderstanding , and maybe I have no room to point a finger as I ’m not in the position , but going back to those that bent you over for the last two years , where ’s the principle ?
HOw could someone lay back in bed with the bad guys ? ”
Photographer Visions Of Excess posts ,
“ I was one of those folks who hosted an LP fundraiser – money that it seems could have been more well spent paying my rent .
The OP aside , I am reminded of the charge that SG is still selling its content to porn sites .
Now why would I want to support that ? ”
Shortly after this , because MM mods always hide SG spam threads if they get too negative about SG , the thread got locked down .
Over on LJ , there is some energetic conversation going on still where people like Baby Sinead are able to visibly post , “ Honestly if it was all a “ misunderstanding ” people should be refunded , ” without having her words immediately locked .
User bunnie_page writes ,
“ Realistically , I ’m thinking it ’s part of the settlement that they had to retract all of the bad things they said about “ Worst Website Ever ” … all of that shiftiness with them not able to say WHO was suing Apnea really makes it seem like SG was suffering from all of LP ’s support , and had a gag order ( which obviously did n’t help ) , and now their trying this .
If the agreement * was * actually fair I would think SG would ’ve ended up covering all of his legal bills .
I ’m sure there ’s more here that we will just never get to know .
But whatever , I still hate SG . ”
In Apnea ’s personal journal , mxa_photo writes ,
“ After all the crap you guys have claimed to have been through with this case it sure looks like you are now pimping out sign ups to SG ???
Congratulations on suckering everyone in with your superbly run publicity campaign and congratulations on your seemingly total lack of moral fibre . ”
My favorite LJ post about the settlement so far comes from user slutbunwalla , who wrote ,
“ Maybe it was just a long con and there was no real lawsuit to begin with !
They all drummed up a bunch of business and donations and support and sympathy but the whole time there was already an implicit agreement between everyone to keep the drama going !!!
Or maybe I just watch too much LOST . ”
The most tragic posts come from redchickpoet who writes ,
“ Me ( who could n’t afford it in the first place , but thought I was helping to support a worthy cause ) — –>
BIG FOOLISH IDIOT …
The funny thing is , me and my guy JUST got our “ Free Lithium Picnic ” shirts .
Well , at least I can sleep at night knowing we helped to pay for their new tattoos .
* kicks myself and becomes just a bit more cynical * ”
This last post breaks my heart because it gets to the core of why Sean Suhl ’s projects like SuicideGirls have been so damaging to the soul of counterculture .
Everything he touches seems to spew out a lot of rhetoric about things people want to believe in , yet everything he is involved in seems to end up being a disillusioning smoke and mirrors sham .
Once someone like redchickpoet is disillusioned like this , she may just walk away from the whole scene .
Heck , I ’ve been a part of this world since before I founded Blue Blood fifteen years ago .
And this sort of disillusioning nonsense gives me pause .
My father is an attorney who has never lost a single litigation , yet he still always says that the only people who win lawsuits are the lawyers .
I do n’t know who won the $ G vs LP lawsuit , but I know that all of us in the larger community are the ones who really paid the price .

New scientific evidence suggests that deep inside the planet Mercury , iron “ snow ” forms and falls toward the center of the planet , much like snowflakes form in Earth ’s atmosphere and fall to the ground .
The movement of this iron snow could be responsible for Mercury ’s mysterious magnetic field , say researchers from the University of Illinois and Case Western Reserve University .
In a paper published in the April issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters , the scientists describe laboratory measurements and models that mimic conditions believed to exist within Mercury ’s core .
“ Mercury ’s snowing core opens up new scenarios where convection may originate and generate global magnetic fields , ” said U. of I. geology professor Jie ( Jackie ) Li .
“ Our findings have direct implications for understanding the nature and evolution of Mercury ’s core , and those of other planets and moons . ”
Mercury is the innermost planet in our solar system and , other than Earth , the only terrestrial planet that possesses a global magnetic field .
Discovered in the 1970s by NASA ’s Mariner 10 spacecraft , Mercury ’s magnetic field is about 100 times weaker than Earth’s .
Most models cannot account for such a weak magnetic field .
Made mostly of iron , Mercury ’s core is also thought to contain sulfur , which lowers the melting point of iron and plays an important role in producing the planet ’s magnetic field .
“ Recent Earth - based radar measurements of Mercury ’s rotation revealed a slight rocking motion that implied the planet ’s core is at least partially molten , ” said Illinois graduate student Bin Chen , the paper ’s lead author .
“ But , in the absence of seismological data from the planet , we know very little about its core . ”
To better understand the physical state of Mercury ’s core , the researchers used a multi-anvil apparatus to study the melting behavior of an iron - sulfur mixture at high pressures and high temperatures .
In each experiment , an iron - sulfur sample was compressed to a specific pressure and heated to a specific temperature .
The sample was then quenched , cut in two , and analyzed with a scanning electron microscope and an electron probe microanalyzer .
“ Rapid quenching preserves the sample ’s texture , which reveals the separation of the solid and liquid phases , and the sulfur content in each phase , ” Chen said .
“ Based on our experimental results , we can infer what is going on in Mercury ’s core . ”
As the molten , iron - sulfur mixture in the outer core slowly cools , iron atoms condense into cubic “ flakes ” that fall toward the planet ’s center , Chen said .
As the iron snow sinks and the lighter , sulfur - rich liquid rises , convection currents are created that power the dynamo and produce the planet ’s weak magnetic field .
Mercury ’s core is most likely precipitating iron snow in two distinct zones , the researchers report .
This double - snow state may be unique among the terrestrial planets and terrestrial - like moons in our solar system .
“ Our findings provide a new context into which forthcoming observational data from NASA ’s MESSENGER spacecraft can be placed , ” Li said .
“ We can now connect the physical state of our innermost planet with the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets in general . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A man apparently jumped to his death on Friday from the 14th floor of the Disneyland Hotel at the world - famous amusement park in Southern California , police said .
The man , who was in town on business and not immediately identified by authorities , was killed in the 14 - story fall from his hotel room balcony .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
“ Right now it is certainly looking like a suicide , ” Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez told Reuters .
“ He was seen leaping off the balcony . ”
Martinez said the man , who was in Anaheim on business and appears to be in his 30s or 40s , also left evidence in the room that suggested it was a suicide .
“ He was sharing a room with another male associate and for some reason he went out on the balcony and all indications are that it was an intentional act , a suicide , ” Martinez said . “
The Disneyland Hotel has nearly 1,000 rooms in three towers overlooking the so - called “ the happiest place on earth ” .
The amusement park , which opened in 1955 , has become one of the top tourist attractions in the country .

Unlike many libertarians , I do n't blog about gun rights much .
Some think this odd , but in my mind this is like saying it is odd that a female blogger does n't blog much about abortion .
I have always thought it was pretty clear that the 2nd amendment protects an individual right to bear arms , but it 's just not a subject for which I have much passion * shrug *
However , I did find this hilarious .
Megan McArdle passes on the District of Columbia 's petulant response to the Heller decision :
Here 's what they 're proposing : * Allowing an exception for handgun ownership for self - defense use inside the home .
* If you want to keep a handgun in your home , the MPD will have to
perform ballistic testing on it before it can be legally registered .
*
There will be a limit to one handgun per person for the first 90 days after the legislation becomes law .
* Firearms in the home must be stored unloaded and disassembled , and
secured with either a trigger lock , gun safe , or similar device .
The
new law will allow an exception for a firearm while it is being used
against an intruder in the home .
* Residents who legally register handguns in the District will not
be required to have licenses to carry them inside their own homes .
OK , so I can have a handgun in the home solely for self - defense , but this self - defense weapon must be stored unloaded , disassembled , and locked .
The only time it can be unlocked and assembled and loaded is " while it is being used against an intruder " .
Jeez .
In the time it would take to unlock , assemble , and load the gun , I could probably build some McGyver device out of dental floss , a TV remote , and a couple of Thin Mint Girls Scout Cookies to just blow them up .
Postscript : I have never been that confident in my ability with a handgun .
TV portrayals notwithstanding , I find them very difficult to handle accurately , and they require a lot of practice which most casual owners do n't pursue .
In my case , I find this a more realistic home defense weapon .

[ The bulk of this is a re-post , because it seems that the issue is newly and especially relevant .
After last night ’s non-concession – in which Clinton revved up her crowd of supporters as they began to chant , “ Denver ! Denver !
Denver ! ” – and in which she conceded nothing to reality , it seems clear that Clinton wants something .
That something – according to reports from various news sources – is the vice presidency .
Others indicate that she just wants to be offered the vice presidency .
Either way , rather than graciously bowing out ( as I rather prematurely asked her to do in January when she had won two of the four contests ) , she is bitterly clinging to her candidacy : pretending to win in her defeat , avoiding Barack Obama ’s phone calls , and putting off the meeting that it is reported he requested .
There are better candidates out there for Obama to pick .
Hillary Clinton has undoubtedly run an historic and groundbreaking campaign – and has come into her own as a political figure in her own right .
She is a force to contend with .
But it is time for her to withdraw unconditionally and endorse Obama .
And she must let him choose his own Vice President – based on who would make the best ticket .
Clinton is not it .
So here , modified and expanded , are eight reasons why Hillary Clinton should not be chosen as Obama ’s vice presidential running mate :
As a bonus :
Let ’s get on to the main event already .
Drop out , Senator , and settle for becoming the next Secretary of Defense or a Supreme Court Justice .
The zeitgeist , the Force even , is with Obama in this American moment .
So , let ’s get on to November before Obama loses his opportunity to get in the requisite attacks on McCain and his dangerously misguided policies before the entire country goes on vacation for the summer .
This is a fight we can win , and one we must win :
America , this is our moment .
This is our time .
Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past .
Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face .
Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love .

Did Karzai play US ' like a fiddle ' to help enrich heroin trade ?
RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 25 , 2008
Print This Email This NYT : Is Afghanistan a Narco - State ?
In 2007 , a plan to effectively eradicate most of Afghanistan 's poppy fields took shape .
It involved offering monetary support for farmers who would switch their crops to produce , rewards for poppy - free villages such as schools and roads , a concentrated campaign of aerial poppy spraying , and US military security for the Afghan army 's ground - based eradication efforts .
Yet time and time again , claims Thomas Schweich writing for the New York Times , the Department of Defense , not wanting to take up responsibility for a drug war alongside a shooting war , and an Afghan government saturated in narco - corruption from top to bottom with a president who " played us like a fiddle , " have impeded the plan 's implementation .
Ultimately , some basic US efforts to encourage Afghan farmers to move away from opium only made it easier for them to produce and sell .
But Afghanistan 's booming opium production was not so much due to the US government 's unwitting facilitation of the trade , or its bungling efforts to stomp it out , as the trechary of the country 's leader , writes Schweich .
" Karzai appointed a convicted heroin dealer , Izzatulla Wasifi , to head his anticorruption commission , " the report claims .
" Karzai also appointed several corrupt local police chiefs .
There were numerous diplomatic reports that his brother Ahmed Wali , who was running half of Kandahar , was involved in the drug trade . "
In 2006 , after a number of dust - ups between the D.E.A. and the US military , Benjamin Freakley , a two - star general , shut down all counternarcotics operations in " a key heroin - tracking province . "
The general claimed them to be a distraction from his military operations ; and he was not alone in the sentiment .
British soldiers too , when a small , ground - based Afghan poppy eradication was underway , passed out leaflets explaining to the people that they were not involved in it .
Internal politics even led to US Defense Secretary Robert Gates testifying before Congress in 2007 that the DoD did not have a strategy for fighting the opium trade in Afghanistan .
Turns out , they do , but pressure from all sides has prevented US authorities from pursuing its ends .
" While it is true that Karzais Taliban enemies finance themselves from the drug trade , so do many of his supporters , " writes Schweich .
" At the same time , some of our NATO allies have resisted the anti-opium offensive , as has our own Defense Department , which tends to see counternarcotics as other peoples business to be settled once the war - fighting is over .
The trouble is that the fighting is unlikely to end as long as the Taliban can finance themselves through drugs  and as long as the Kabul government is dependent on opium to sustain its own hold on power . "
Excerpts from article : # Karzai was playing us like a fiddle : the U.S. would spend billions of dollars on infrastructure improvement ; the U.S. and its allies would fight the Taliban ; Karzai 's friends could get rich off the drug trade ; he could blame the West for his problems ; and in 2009 he would be elected to a new term .
... Back in January 2007 , Karzai appointed a convicted heroin dealer , Izzatulla Wasifi , to head his anticorruption commission .
Karzai also appointed several corrupt local police chiefs .
There were numerous diplomatic reports that his brother Ahmed Wali , who was running half of Kandahar , was involved in the drug trade .
( Said T. Jawad , Afghanistan 's ambassador to the United States , said Karzai has " taken the step of issuing a decree asking the government to be vigilant of any business dealing involving his family , and requesting that any suspicions be fully investigated . " )
Some governors of Helmand and other provinces - Pashtuns who had advocated aerial eradication - changed their positions after the " palace " spoke to them .
Karzai was lining up his Pashtun allies for re-election , and the drug war was going to have to wait .
" Maybe we taught him too much about politics , " Rice said to me after I briefed her on these developments .
Seven Ways to Save Energy by Saving Water
June 15th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
Though many states and localities are waking up to their water shortages and taking steps to plan for “ peak water ” , people generally continue to waste water and to ignore the energy - water link .
In 2004 the Natural Resources Defense Council did a study in conjunction with the Pacific Institute called “ Energy Down the Drain ” on how saving water saves energy .
We need to do more to spread the word .
Here are seven ways to save energy by saving water :
1 . Use local water .
Transporting water uses energy , so rainwater harvesting is a serious water - and - energy saver .
According to the NRDC / Pacific Institute study “ California ’s State Water Project ( SWP ) , which transports water from Northern California to Southern California is the state ’s largest single energy user , consuming 2 to 3 percent of all electricity .
It takes tremendous amounts of energy to pump the water 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains — the highest water lift of any water system in the world
2 . Use less heated water in homes and businesses .
Heating water uses a great deal of energy .
Small things magnified a million times over — like washing clothes with cold water or taking shorter showers — saves large amounts of energy .
3 . Use energy - saving appliances .
Energy Star appliances will decrease water and energy use .
4. Learn from Australia .
Why reinvent the wheel ?
Since 2006 , when the BBC reported Australia ’s biggest drought in 1,000 years , the situation has not improved .
In an island nation , this has a tendency to focus the mind , and water - and energy - saving inventions have been pouring forth from that country , while the government introduces policies that save energy and water almost daily .
5. Rethink your bathroom .
Toto , an innovative company from Japan ( another island nation concerned about water use ) offers an EcoPower hands - free faucet that recharges itself each time it is used .
6 . Rip out that lawn and replace it with a rain garden .
Watering grass , fertilizing it with petroleum - based fertilizers , and mowing it with a gas or electric mower ….. need I say more ?
7 . Eat more vegetables and grains ; cut down on the beef .
Animal farming takes more energy and water .
“ Beef production requires large volumes of water–as much as 100 times that required to produce equivalent amounts of protein energy from grains . ” ( Environmental Health Perspectives , 2002
And the cows are fed from corn that is farmed using energy - hogging fertilizers , insecticides , and fossil fuels .
If you think about it , it ’s impossible to separate our energy use from our water use .
If we can start thinking holistically about the systems we use in our daily lives — and get our governments to create policies that promote wise use of energy and water , we ’ll be more ready for the limits to resources that are only going to increase .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On the first day of what is to be a two - week economic tour around the country , Barack Obama said Monday that lawmakers should inject another $ 50 billion immediately into the sluggish U.S. economy .
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee cited the largest monthly increase in the unemployment rate in over 20 years , and record highs in oil prices , food prices and foreclosures .
" Such relief can't wait until the next president takes office .
...
That 's why I 've called for another round of fiscal stimulus , an immediate $ 50 billion to help those who 've been hit hardest by this economic downturn , " Obama told a crowd in Raleigh , N.C .
He said that he supports the expansion and extension of unemployment benefits , as well as a second round of tax rebate checks .
Last week , Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill said that the latest unemployment rate shows that Congress and the Bush administration need to do more to help workers and the unemployed .
And they called for a second round of fiscal stimulus .
An economic stimulus package that passed in early February featured tax rebates that are now being sent to more than 130 million Americans .
On Friday , the Treasury Department reported that so far it has sent out nearly 67 million stimulus payments worth approximately $ 57 billion .
Extending unemployment insurance benefits was one measure tossed out of that legislation , but it 's considered a leading contender if more stimulus is put in place .
One bill , expected to go to the House floor for consideration this week , calls for an additional 13 weeks of benefits to be added to what is typically a 26 - week cap on federal payments .
In addition , it calls for 13 weeks on top of that for workers in states with very high unemployment rates .
Obama did n't offer details about how much money could go toward rebates and how much would be used to pay for benefits extensions .
But the $ 50 billion in total stimulus that he 's calling for represents less than a third of the $ 170 billion earmarked for the first stimulus package , the bulk of which is being spent on rebates .
And the jury is still out on how successful those rebates will be stimulating the economy .
More economic proposals to come
Obama in his speech criticized his Republican rival , John McCain , for proposing to extend all of President Bush 's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
But Obama himself has taken a page from Bush 's playbook on taxes .
Obama has pledged to keep the tax cuts in place for everyone except those making roughly $ 250,000 and up .
He has also made proposals to cut taxes further for the middle class , some of which he reiterated in his speech : exempt seniors making less than $ 50,000 from having to pay income tax ; give a tax credit worth up to $ 500 per working person ( $ 1,000 per family ) to offset the Social Security tax on the first $ 8,100 of earnings ; and expand the earned income tax credit .
To boost retirement savings , he has also proposed a 50 % federal match on the first $ 1,000 of savings for families that earn under $ 75,000 .
Obama said that next week he will lay out his proposals for making the " workforce more competitive by reforming our education system . "
I recently started using Twitter and have become a big fan of the service .
I 've been appalled by the downtime the service has endured , but sympathetic because I assumed the growth in usage is so fast that much might be excused .
Then I read this TechCrunch post on the Twitter usage numbers and sympathy turned to bafflement - because I 'm intimately familiar with SMS Gupshup , a startup in India that boasts usage numbers much , much higher than Twitter 's , but has scaled without a glitch .
I 'll let the numbers speak for themselves :
Users : Twitter ( 1+ million ) , SMS GupShup ( 7 million )
Twitter ( 1+ million ) , SMS GupShup ( 7 million ) Messages per day : Twitter ( 3 million ) ; SMS GupShup ( 10 + million )
Actually , these numbers do n't even tell the whole story .
India is a land of few PCs and many mobile phones .
Thus , almost all GupShup messages are posted via mobile phones using SMS .
And almost every GupShup message is posted simultaneously to the website and to the mobile phones of followers via SMS .
That 's why they have the SMS in the name of the service .
Contrast with Twitter , where the majority of the posting and reading is done through the web .
Twitter has said in the past that sending messages via the SMS gateway is one of their most expensive operations , so the fact that only a small fraction of their users use the SMS option makes their task a lot easier than GupShup's .
So I sat down with Beerud Sheth , co-founder of Webaroo , the company behind GupShup ( the other founder Rakesh Mathur is my co-founder from a prior company , Junglee ) .
I wanted to understand why GupShup scaled without a hitch while Twitter is having fits .
Beerud tells me that GupShup runs on commodity Linux hardware and uses MySQL , the same as Twitter .
But the big difference is in the architecture : right from day 1 , they started with a three - tier architecture , with JBoss app servers sitting between the webservers and the database .
GupShup also uses an object architecture ( called the " objectpool " ) which allows each task to be componentized and run separately - this helps immensely with reliability ( can automatically handle machine failure ) and scalability ( can scale dynamically to handle increased load ) .
The objectpool model allows each module to be run as multiple parallel instances - each of them doing a part of the work .
They can be run on different machines , can be started / stopped independently , without affecting each other .
So the " receiver " , the " sender " , and the " ad server " all run as multiple instances .
As traffic scales , they can just add more hardware -- no re-architecting .
If one machine fails , the instance is restarted on a different machine .
In read / write applications , the database is often the bottleneck .
To avoid this problem , the GupShup database is sharded .
So , the tables are broken into parts .
For e.g. , users A - F in one instance , G - K in another etc .
The shards are periodically rebalanced as the database grows .
The JBoss middle - tier contains the logic that hides this detail from the webserver tier .
I 'm not familiar with the details of Twitter 's architecture , beyond knowing they use Ruby on Rails with MySQL .
It appears that the biggest difference between Twitter and GupShup is 3 - tier versus 2 - tier .
RoR is fantastic for turning out applications quickly , but the way Rails works , the out - of - the - box approach leads to a two - tier architecture ( webserver talking directly to database ) .
We all learned back in the 90's that this is an unscalable model , yet it is the model for most Rails applications .
No amount of caching can help a 2 - tier read / write application scale .
The middle - tier enables the database to be sharded , and that 's what gets you the scalability .
I believe Twitter has recently started using message queues as a middle - tier to accomplish the same thing , but they have n't partitioned the database yet -- which is the key step here .
I do n't intend this as a knock on RoR , rather on the way it is used by default .
At my company Kosmix we use an RoR frontend for a website that serves millions of page views every day ; we use a 3 - tier model where the bulk of the application logic resides in a middle - tier coded in C ++.
Three - tier is the way to go to build scalable web applications , regardless of the programming language (s ) you use .
Update : VentureBeat has a follow - up guest post by me , with some more details on SMS GupShup .
Also my theory on why SMS GupShup is growing faster than Twitter : Microblogging is a nice - to - have in places with high PC penetration , like the US , but a must - have in places with very low PC penetration , like India .
Disclosure : My fund Cambrian Ventures is an investor in Webaroo , the company behind SMS GupShup .
But these are my opinions as a database geek , not as an investor .
Protecting children during summer activities conjures up thoughts of bike helmets , knee pads , and sun block .
However , during the summer months , mowing the lawn can be as routine for some children as riding a bike and can be dangerous if proper safety precautions are not taken .
In fact , nearly 210,000 people -- approximately 16,200 of them children under age 19 -- were treated in doctors ' offices , clinics and emergency rooms for lawn mower - related injuries in 2007 , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports .
To help prevent injuries , the American Society for Reconstructive Microsurgery ( ASRM ) , the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS ) , the American Society of Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) have teamed up to educate parents , adults and children about the importance of lawn mower safety during National Safety Month , June 2008 .
" Parents need to understand that lawnmowers can cause terrible devastating injuries to children 's hands , feet or faces , which can impact the rest of their lives , " said ASRM President Neil Jones , MD .
" The tragedy is that most of these injuries are totally preventable by following some simple precautions . "
The ASRM , AAOS , ASPS and AAP offer the following tips to help prevent lawn mower - related injuries :
Children should be at least 12 years old before they operate any lawn mower , and at least 16 years old for a ride - on mower .
Children should never be passengers on ride - on mowers .
Always wear sturdy shoes while mowing -- not sandals .
Young children should be at a safe distance from the area you are mowing .
Before mowing , pick up stones , toys and debris from the lawn to prevent injuries from flying objects .
Always wear eye and hearing protection .
Use a mower with a control that stops it from moving forward if the handle is released .
Never pull backward or mow in reverse unless absolutely necessary -- carefully look for others behind you when you do .
Start and refuel mowers outdoors -- not in a garage .
Refuel with the motor turned off and cool .
Blade settings should be set by an adult only .
Wait for blades to stop completely before removing the grass catcher , unclogging the discharge chute , or crossing gravel roads .
" Serious orthopaedic trauma can be sustained while operating a lawn mower , " said AAOS President Tony Rankin , MD .
" However , by following a few simple safety tips , devastating injuries may be prevented . "
Many lawn mower - related injuries require a team of physicians from various specialties to properly repair them .
Often , patients must endure painful reconstructive operations to restore form and function .
" Many children who sustain lawn mower injuries must undergo reconstructive surgery for months , sometimes years , after the initial accident , " said ASPS President Richard D'Amico , MD .
" The look on parents ' faces can be truly heart wrenching .
We are the physicians called to treat these devastating injuries , but would do anything to prevent them in the first place . "
" Parents want to protect their children from accidents and injuries .
But every summer we see children and teens using lawnmowers in an unsafe manner , " said AAP President Renee Jenkins , MD .
" It is our job as pediatricians to help get information to parents about how to prevent injuries that are common during summer months , and that includes injuries from lawnmowers . "
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , chairman , House Oversight and Government Reform Committee AP file photo WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The U.S. ambassador to Albania allegedly approved removing evidence of the illegal Chinese origins of ammunition that a United States defense contractor was shipping from Albania to Afghanistan , a senior House Democrat said Monday .
In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , said the State Department then attempted to conceal that information involving John L. Withers II , U.S. ambassador to Albania , from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Waxman chairs the committee .
Waxman 's allegation comes three days after the man who heads the contracting company , a - 22 - year - old Miami Beach man named Efraim Diveroli , and three others were charged in federal court with providing the prohibited ammunition to be used by Afghan army and police forces .
Diveroli's company , AEY Inc. , was paid more than $ 10 million through a U.S. government contract for 35 shipments of ammunition that prosecutors say was manufactured in China .
Prosecutors contend AEY Inc. removed markings from containers to hide the fact they were manufactured in China .
Diveroli certified that the ammunition was manufactured in Albania and submitted an invoice for it , they said . , although the contract barred delivery of ammunition acquired , directly or indirectly , from a Chinese company .
In his 10 - page letter to Rice , Waxman says Withers , the U.S. ambassador to Albania , met with Albanian Defense Minister Fatmir Mediu in November 2007 to discuss how to respond to inquiries from The New York Times .
The newspaper was investigating AEY Inc. and one of its reporters wanted to visit a site in Albania where AEY was taking Chinese ammunition from its original packaging .
Army Maj .
Larry Harrison , chief of the office of defense cooperation at the embassy , attended the meeting , according to an interview the officer had with committee staff earlier this month .
Mediu , who has since resigned his position , was concerned a story about AEY would reveal allegations of corruption against him .
The meeting lasted well into the night .
Mediu ordered the Chinese markings be removed before the visit .
According to Harrison , Withers agreed " that this would alleviate the suspicion of wrongdoing . "
Harrison told the committee he was " very uncomfortable " with the discussions because there was an ongoing criminal investigation of AEY .
He recommended the reporter not be allowed to see the site .
That advice was not accepted , Waxman said .
There was no immediate comment from the State Department on Waxman 's letter .
In late March , after The New York Times published its article on AEY Inc. , Waxman 's staff asked the State Department for a wide range of documents about the company , its transactions , and any interactions it had with U.S. Embassy officials in Albania .
In the department 's response there was no description of the November 2007 meeting .
According to Waxman 's letter , Harrison had urged U.S. embassy officials to tell the committee about the meeting .
He was overruled , however .
Waxman wants to interview Withers and other U.S. officials at the embassy in Albania .

Marks & Spencer has defended a policy of charging extra on some of its bras that are bigger than a size DD .
The High Street retailer said that the added cost - typically £ 2 - was " standard industry practice " .
M&S added it found most customers " were happy to pay a small premium for the specialist work " needed to make larger sizes of their bras .
But the policy has drawn protests with 900 people joining a Busts 4 Justice protest group on the Facebook website .
Its founders argue it is unfair that smaller bras are cheaper , because this logic does not apply to other clothes .
' Unfair tax ' Beckie Williams , 25 , from Brighton , said she set up the social networking site group after an " unsatisfactory " correspondence with the retailer .
She said M&S replied to her letter claiming the extra material needed lay behind the higher price at the tills .
If you do n't charge a size 20 woman more for a pair of trousers , then why should you pay more for an E cup bra ?
Beckie Williams
" That 's fair enough , " Ms Williams told BBC Radio Five Live .
" But they do n't apply the same policy to other clothes that use more material and more resources to make as well .
" I just think it should be one policy for all items of clothing . "
' Comprehensive collection '
The M&S website advertises the Ceriso Polka Dot Padded Bra for £ 12 , rising to £ 14 for the version for DD to G sizes .
There are similar differences in price for other ranges , though many of the store 's more basic designs cost the same , no matter the size .
Please turn on JavaScript .

M&S said it offered " the most comprehensive DD + collection and one of the most competitively priced on the High Street " and offered the same choice of colour , styles and shapes for all customers " no matter what size they take " .
It also said the majority of its customers had told it they were happy to pay a small premium for the specialist work on larger size bras .
" Our bras are much less expensive than many other specialist larger cup size lingerie retailers , where they could cost around £ 60 or more , " the firm added .
' Never benefited '
Ms Williams said that £ 2 was not a huge sum to pay but that it was still " an unfair tax " .
" This is not something that we have chosen , " she said .
" And I have been a size 8 all my adult life , but have never benefited from smaller priced pants .
" If you do n't charge a size 20 woman more for a pair of trousers , then why should you pay more for an E cup bra ? "
Most of the those posting comments on the Busts 4 Justice site are supportive of the women 's efforts .

The Androgynous Pharaoh ?
Akhenaten had feminine physique , doctor claims Associated Press
Published : Friday May 2 , 2008
|
Print This Email This By ALEX DOMINGUEZ BALTIMORE ( AP ) 
Akhenaten was n't the most manly pharaoh , even though he fathered at least a half - dozen children .
In fact , his form was quite feminine .
And he was a bit of an egghead .
So concludes a Yale University physician who analyzed images of Akhenaten for an annual conference Friday at the University of Maryland School of Medicine on the deaths of historic figures .
The female form was due to a genetic mutation that caused the pharaoh 's body to convert more male hormones to female hormones than needed , Dr. Irwin Braverman believes .
And Akhenaten 's head was misshapen because of a condition in which skull bones fuse at an early age .
The pharaoh had " an androgynous appearance .
He had a female physique with wide hips and breasts , but he was male and he was fertile and he had six daughters , " Braverman said .
" But nevertheless , he looked like he had a female physique . "
Braverman , who sizes up the health of individuals based on portraits , teaches a class at Yale 's medical school that uses paintings from the university 's Center for British
Art to teach observation skills to first - year students .
For his study of Akhenaten , he used statues and carvings .
Akhenaten ( ah - keh - NAH - ten ) , best known for introducing a revolutionary form of monotheism to ancient Egypt , reigned in the mid-1300s B.C.
He was married to Nefertiti , and Tutankhamun , also known as King Tut , may have been his son or half brother .
Egyptologist and archaeologist Donald B. Redford said he supports Braverman 's belief that Akhenaten had Marfan syndrome , a genetic disorder marked by lengthened features , including fingers and the face .
Visiting clinics that treat those with the condition has strengthened that conviction , " but this is very subjective , I must admit , " said Redford , a professor of classic and ancient Mediterranean studies at Penn State University .
Others have theorized Akhenaten and his lineage had Froehlich 's Syndrome , which causes feminine fat distribution but also sterility .
That does n't fit Akhenaten , who had at least six daughters , Braverman said .
Klinefelter Syndrome , a genetic condition that can also cause gynecomastia , or male breast enlargement , has also been suggested , but Braverman said he suspects familial gynecomastia , a hereditary condition that leads to the overproduction of estrogen .
The Yale doctor said determining whether he is right can easily be done if Egyptologists can confirm which mummy is Akhenaten 's and if Egyptian government officials agree to DNA analysis .
Braverman hopes his theory will lead them to do just that .
" I 'm hoping that after we have this conference and I bring this up , maybe the Egyptologists who work on these things all the time , maybe they will be stimulated to look , " he said .
Previous conferences have examined the deaths of Edgar Allan Poe , Alexander the Great , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , Florence Nightingale and others .
John McCain has been purging lobbyists from his campaign trying to reclaim the mantle of political reformer , but there ’s one lobbyist whose role as a key economic adviser makes him almost untouchable despite ties to the sub - prime debacle , links to the Enron disaster and alleged evasion of ethics rules .
Former Sen. Phil Gramm , who was listed as a lobbyist for banking giant UBS as recently as December 2007 , has emerged as what Fortune magazine calls “ McCain ’s econ brain , ” filling McCain ’s acknowledged void on economic expertise ( “ I do n’t know as much about the economy as I should ” ) .
Recognized as one of McCain ’s closest friends in politics , Gramm began advising McCain in 2005 when the Arizona senator indicated he planned to run for President .
Gramm , a Texas Republican , also was credited with helping salvage McCain ’s campaign from disarray in 2007 .
More recently , McCain reportedly turned to Gramm for help in fashioning a March 26 , 2008 , policy speech on the mortgage crisis — a plan that critics faulted for providing only modest help for families facing foreclosures .
Now , however , Gramm ’s work for the Swiss - based investment bank UBS is coming under scrutiny as contradicting McCain ’s policy that bars lobbyists from his campaign .
Gramm started work at UBS as a vice chairman in January 2003 , immediately after leaving Congress .
A month earlier , he had shifted $ 2 million in campaign contributions from the Friends of Phil Gramm Political Action Committee to a UBS PAC , a move that let the bank increase its visibility with lawmakers .
“ I think [ UBS ] understands the importance of having access to lawmakers , and the presence of Gramm and the PAC could accomplish this goal , ” commented John Samples , director of the libertarian Cato Institute ’s Center for Representative Government , in late 2002 .
“ While the amount given by Gramm to start the PAC is relatively small when compared to other PACs , it ’s important seed money for UBS , ” Samples wrote in an article for Wall Street Letter on Dec. 9 , 2002 .
The money transfer was seen as both benefiting Gramm ’s new boss and advancing his anti-regulatory agenda as he moved to the private sector .
“ Much like its competitors in the brokerage industry , [ UBS ] is most interested in preventing Congress from passing legislation that would restrict the industry , ” an unnamed lobbyist told Wall Street Letter .
“ The firms want to make sure they do n’t get hit with another version of Sarbanes - Oxley , ” the tougher corporate disclosure law passed after the Enron collapse .
In 2002 , Gramm , whose wife Wendy served on Enron ’s board of directors , had opposed Sarbanes - Oxley , which was designed to hold executives accountable for inaccuracies in financial reports like those that hid Enron ’s mounting debt .
The Wall Street Letter also quoted a former Securities and Exchange Commission official as saying that UBS ’s goal in tapping Gramm was “ to establish a sustained , long - term effort to cultivate influence in the nation ’s capital by contributing money to candidates on a consistent basis . ”
This former SEC official , who also had turned to lobbying , added : “ You ca n’t be in the game of political influence for the short term .
This is a good start for ” UBS , relying on Gramm , a long - time fixture of Washington politics .
Texas Financial Scheme
In his work at UBS , Gramm also made use of his deep roots in Texas politics
In mid-2003 , Gramm began floating a UBS - backed idea of raising money for the $ 95 billion Texas Teacher Retirement System through the purchase of retirees ’ life insurance policies and the sale of billions of dollars in bonds .
Gramm met with Texas Gov. Rick Perry , Insurance Commissioner Jose Montemayor and state pension officials to discuss the proposal , which Gramm claimed could add as much as $ 500 million to teachers ’ pension funds risk free , according to documents .
Texas Democrats derided the UBS proposal after a review determined that UBS stood to profit far more than the Teachers Retirement System if the plan were implemented .
Furthermore , Democrats found that Gramm ’s PAC had donated $ 612,000 to Gov. Perry during the 2002 election cycle .
The Texas controversy expanded later when it was learned that a Teachers Retirement System trustee had retired from UBS in January 2004 , the same month Gramm began an aggressive drive to get Perry to back the proposal .
Kelly Fero , a Democratic Party strategist , told the Fort Worth Star Telegram that “ the conflict for Perry is that he ’s trying to steer retired teacher benefits … to his political pal Phil Gramm , who gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars in ’ 02 , and he has appointed an employee of UBS to the TRS board to help make this whole scam possible . ”
Democratic Chairman Charles Soechting added , “ The plan was a “ huge , get - rich - quick scheme on the part of Phil Gramm and his buddies ” in the investment and insurance industries , according to a Jan. 11 , 2004 , story in the Houston Chronicle .
Democrats soon discovered that Gramm had n’t registered as a lobbyist in Texas as would be required by state law before he could seek changes in policies .
The Texas Democratic Party filed a complaint against Gramm with Travis County prosecutors and the state ethics commission .
It is unclear what happened with the ethics complaints .
Neither the Travis County prosecutors nor the Texas Ethics Commission would comment on the outcome of their inquiries .
A review of public records on the Web sites of both agencies failed to turn up a final ruling on the probe .
Representatives for McCain and Gramm did not return repeated calls for comment .
A spokesman for UBS declined to discuss the matter .
When asked by reporters about Gramm ’s mixed role as a paid UBS lobbyist and an unpaid campaign adviser , McCain has staunchly defended his friend ’s ethics .
Sub - Prime Complaints
On another front , UBS is currently under investigation by William Galvin , Massachusetts ’ secretary of the commonwealth .
Galvin subpoenaed UBS and Bear Stearns after one of its analysts issued a research report that upgraded the stock of New Century Financial , a company that provides sub - prime mortgages to low - income homebuyers , from “ underperform ” to “ peer- perform . ”
The stock spiked on the news .
But less than two months later New Century filed for bankruptcy protection due in large part to the massive number of borrowers who were defaulting on their loans .
It turned out that UBS and Bear Stearns , which recently was spared bankruptcy by a federal bailout and an arranged sale to JPMorgan Chase , financed New Century ’s mortgage operations .
Gavin demanded that UBS and Bear Stearns turn over their research documents regarding New Century .
Galvin alleged that Bear Stearns and UBS violated a 2003 settlement barring self - interested stock research , an agreement that followed the Nasdaq crash of 2000 .
Wall Street firms also paid hefty fines after regulators accused analysts of writing biased research reports to win lucrative investment deals from companies the analysts covered .
As part of the global settlement , firms promised to keep their sell - side operations away from the investment banking side .
“ Recent revelations that research analysts issued positive reports on mortgage lenders … even as those companies faced more and more defaults suggests that the commitment of 2003 has not been met , ” Galvin said in a prepared statement .
Gramm ’s Baggage
There ’s still more baggage that comes with Gramm ’s connection to the McCain campaign , especially as it tries to reestablish McCain ’s reputation as a maverick opposed to the corrupt ways of Washington .
As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in 1999 , Gramm pushed through legislation undoing the Depression - era Glass - Steagall
Act by eliminating the wall between heavily regulated commercial banks and lightly regulated investment banks .
Some economists blame this deregulation for contributing to the rapid growth in sub - prime mortgage lending , its securitization into investment bundles and thus the recent crisis in the mortgage markets that has pushed the U.S. economy to the brink of a major recession .
In 2000 , Gramm shepherded through another anti-regulatory law that lightened up government oversight of energy - commodity trading .
Houston - based Enron and other energy traders exploited the changes in a scheme to drive up California energy prices and gouge consumers out of an estimated $ 40 billion .
Nevertheless , McCain has made clear he wo n’t throw his old friend over the side .
There ’s even talk that Gramm could expect an appointment as Treasury Secretary in a McCain administration .
Plus , there are positive political aspects .
Gramm ’s anti-regulatory and pro-business record has bolstered McCain ’s standing with economic conservatives , an important Republican constituency .
So , despite Gramm ’s troublesome connections to UBS lobbying , the sub - prime mess and the Enron scandal , McCain ’s “ econ brain ” appears to remain firmly in place .
The United States maintains secret prisons on ships in the ocean in order to detain people outside the reach or even the knowledge of any system of law , the better to torture the ever - living cheney out of them .
Over at the Black Commentator , Glen Ford ( now at the Black Agenda Report ) has been calling the Bush Cheney gang pirates for years .
And the point is not just that they 're criminals , but that they are outlaws , killers , and thieves who operate outside any national allegiance or system of laws or morality .
The torture ships are in the news of late , at least in England , thanks to the work of an attorney and author named Clive Stafford Smith and his organization : Reprieve ( http://reprieve.org.uk ) .
A report just released by Reprieve has resulted in news reports in The Guardian , Associated Press , and Reuters .
An explanation of the piratethink that produced the prison ships can be found in Smith 's wonderful book , released last year , called " Eight O'Clock Ferry to the Windward Side : Seeking Justice at Guantanamo Bay . "
The book focuses on prisoners detained and tortured at Guantanamo , many of whom Smith has served as counsel for , but also touches on extraordinary rendition and secret prisons outside the reach of the U.S. military .
( The book is more than worth buying if only to read the chapter called " Conmission " in which innocent Guantanamo prisoner Binyam Mohamed is hauled before a kangaroo court military commission , serves as his own lead attorney , and completely out - maneuvers , mocks , and humiliates the prosecutors . )
The name Clarendon means little more to me than a section of Arlington , Va. , not far from a large building owned by CACI , a private mercenary ( pirate for hire ) torture company .
But Smith gives the name more meaning :
" Edward Hyde , the first Earl of Clarendon , had been a favourite of King Charles II and had engineered the marriage of his daughter to Charles ' son James .
This meant that he would become the grandfather of two queens of England , but it did not prevent his fall from favour .
He faced articles of impeachment [ remember those ? ] in 1672 .
The charges against him included the allegation that he had been the architect of Britain 's system of offshore island gulags around the country : ' That he hath advised and procured divers of his Majesty 's Subjects to be imprisoned , against Law , in remote Islands , Garrisons , and other Places ; thereby , to prevent them from the Benefit of the Law , and to introduce Precedents [ remember how those work ? ] for imprisoning any other of his Majesty 's Subjects in like Manner . '
" The idea had been to lock people up on an island off the coast of Britain and deny them access to courts .
Now facing an appearance in the dock himself , Clarendon chose not to wait until he was in jail and rely on a writ of habeas corpus [ remember those ? ] to challenge the legality of his own detention : he fled the country before he could be convicted and spent the rest of his life in exile in France .
The excesses alleged against Clarendon prompted the passage of the seminal Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 . "
The U.S. recreation of the Clarendon plan began with Guantanamo and US Air Force bases in Germany , both locations being technically not U.S. soil but completely under U.S. control .
But the German media might someday do its job , and both of these locations suffered from working with the U.S. military .
Soldiers might someday complete their terms of service , return home , and tell tales .
So , the pirates turned to Middle Eastern dictatorships , but secrets leaked , and the public there was overwhelmingly in sympathy with the prisoners .
Thailand offered an alternative , until the Thais refused to allow it .
So the pirates tried using old Soviet prisons in Poland and Romania until news leaked there and the pressure grew too great to stay .
What to do ?
Where to go ?
The pirates turned to their partner in crime , Great Britain , and its island base out in the middle of the Indian Ocean called Diego Garcia ( actually an island with inhabitants whom the British had forced to leave their homes in 1973 ) .
Perfect !
" Yet , " writes Smith , " the prisoners could not be held physically on British territory , because it would be politically embarrassing and there might be unpleasantness to face in the European Court of Human Rights .
The US might , rather , find inspiration from another archaic practice of penology : the hulk , or prison ship . "
The ship could not , however , belong to the U.S. Navy , because that would make it U.S. territory .
It would have to fly some other flag .
And it would have to be small enough to be run by the torturers , thus avoiding the loose lips of members of the military .
" Using a ship would provide Blair with deniability - ' There are no prisoners being held on British sovereign territory , ' the British government could bluster with technical accuracy .
It would provide deniability to the US also .
' There are no secret prisons on US territory , ' Bush could insist equally disarmingly . ' "
While few Americans know anything about this gulag flotilla , it 's a safe bet that our designated presidential candidates have heard about it .
When asked about other known crimes of Bush and Cheney , Senator Barack Obama has said that he can't see any crimes now , but he 'll be glad to look into it after we elect him .
So , it 's a safe bet that if he becomes president Obama will create a task force to advise him on whether it 's illegal or abusive in any way to secretly kidnap random innocent people , allow their families to think they 're dead , hide them in the hull of what can technically only be called a pirate ship , beat them , hang them by their wrists , starve them , electroshock them , hold their heads underwater , and keep them chained hands - and - feet like something worse than wild animals .
Depending on what conclusions Obama 's subordinates draw , it seems an even bet he 'll launch a more in - depth study to fully investigate the question in a discrete and respectful manner .
McCain is a different story , at least in terms of rhetoric .
When asked how he came to switch from being an opponent and supposed victim of torture denouncing it as both evil and useless , to a cheerleader for its blatantly illegal use and its justification by dictatorial " signing statement " , Senator John McCain . . .
Actually , we would have to have a public communications system for McCain to ever have been asked such an impolite question , but I feel safe in asserting that HAD he been asked that question , he would have replied by threatening to torture the questioner , with a wink and a nervous grin , followed by a slurred and semi-coherent refusal ever to surrender to " extremists . "
If I were a betting man , my money would be on McCain 's presidential campaign quite soon offering to name torture ships in honor of major campaign donors .
A pirate - themed ball at the Republican National Convention is not unlikely .

Medical staff help a boy injured in Sunday 's attack A US air strike in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday killed 47 civilians , 39 of them women and children , an Afghan government investigating team says .
Reports at the time said that 20 people were killed in the airstrike in Nangarhar province .
The US military said they were militants .
But local people said the dead were wedding party guests .
Correspondents say the issue of civilian casualties is hugely sensitive in Afghanistan .
President Hamid Karzai has said that no civilian casualty is acceptable .
Demand for trial Mr Karzai set up a nine - man commission to look into Sunday 's incident .
The commission is headed by Senate deputy speaker , Burhanullah Shinwari whose constituency is in Nangarhar province .
He told the BBC : '' Our investigation found out that 47 civilians ( were killed ) by the American bombing and nine others injured .
Concern over Afghan civilian deaths " There are 39 women and children " among those killed , he said .
The eight other people who died were " between the ages of 14 and 18 " .
A spokeswoman for the US coalition , Lt Rumi Nielson - Green told the AFP news agency that the force was also investigating the incident and regretted any loss of civilian life .
" We never target non-combatants .
We do go to great length to avoid civilian casualties , " she said .
At the time the US said that those killed were militants involved in previous mortar attacks on a Nato base .
The incident happened in the remote district of Deh Bala , close to the Afghan border .
Mirwais Yasini , deputy speaker for the lower house of parliament , also has his constituency in Nangarhar .
'' We are very sad about the killings in Deh Bala .
People should be compensated , " he told the BBC .
" These operations widen the gap between the people and the government . "
He said that those who passed on intelligence to the US military ahead of the air strike should be tried , " as well as those who carried out the bombing " .
Mr Yasini demanded that " all operations should be conducted in full co-operation with our security forces in the future " .
' Ashamed ' Correspondents say most civilian deaths in Afghanistan are caused by Taleban fighters and other militants opposed to President Karzai and US and Nato - led forces .
On Monday a suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul killed 41 people , most of them civilians .
However , foreign troops have also often killed civilians , leading to an erosion of support for their presence in Afghanistan .
Last year a US army spokesman said he was " deeply ashamed " after US marines killed 19 civilians near Jalalabad in Nangarhar province .
Only a few months earlier , a Nato spokesman said that civilian casualties were the main issue for the Nato - led force to resolve .
" I believe the single thing that we have done wrong and we are striving extremely hard to improve on is killing innocent civilians , " Brig Richard Nugee said .
President Karzai has been scathing in his criticism over the deaths of Afghan civilians , even summoning foreign commanders in May , 2007 to tell them " that the patience of the Afghan people is wearing thin with the continued killing of innocent civilians " .
Two days ago , the Red Cross said that at least 250 Afghan civilians had been killed or wounded in insurgent attacks or military action in the previous six days .
It called on all parties to the conflict to avoid civilian casualties .

What are these ?
The pet store was selling them for 5 ¢ a piece .
I thought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand each .
I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth .
I bought 200 .
I like monkeys .
I took my 200 monkeys home .
I have a big car .
I let one drive .
His name was Sigmund .
He was retarded .
In fact , none of them were really bright .
They kept punching themselves in their genitals .
I laughed .
Then they punched my genitals .
I stopped laughing .
I herded them into my room .
They did n't adapt very well to their new environment .
They would screech , hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall .
Although humorous at first , the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour .
Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive : they all died .
No apparent reason .
They all just sorta ' dropped dead .
Kinda ' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later .
Damn cheap monkeys .
I did n't know what to do .
There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room , on the bed , in the dresser , hanging from my bookcase .
It looked like I had 200 throw rugs .
I tried to flush one down the toilet .
It did n't work .
It got stuck .
Then I had one dead , wet monkey and 199 dead , dry monkeys .
I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals .
That worked for a while , that is until they began to decompose .
It started to smell real bad .
I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I did n't want to call the plumber .
I was embarrassed .
I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them .
Unfortunately there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change them every 30 seconds .
I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it did n't all go bad .
I tried burning them .
Little did I know my bed was flammable .
I had to extinguish the fire .
Then I had one dead , wet monkey in my toilet , two dead , frozen monkeys in my freezer , and 197 dead , charred monkeys in a pile on my bed .
The odor was n't improving .
I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use the bathroom .
I severely beat one of my monkeys .
I felt better .
I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city was n't allowed to dispose of charred primates .
I told him that I had a wet one .
He could n't take that one either .
I did n't bother asking about the frozen ones .
I finally arrived at a solution .
I gave them out as Christmas gifts .
My friends did n't know quite what to say .
They pretended that they like them but I could tell they were lying .
Ingrates .
So I punched them in the genitals .
I like monkeys
Earlier today , someone asserted that well over half ( or more than $ 2 ) of America 's $ 4.10 gallon of gas is due to the war .
Another person asked " Is that right ? "
And , after pulling out some hair from my head , my response was both short and then long .
This is a guest post by A Siegel , who blogs on a range of energy issues at Get Energy Smart !
NOW !!!
and works with TOD European Editor Jerome a Paris on Energize America , a blog - driven effort to develop innovative and holistic energy policy options in the face of peak oil and global warming .
And , the long :
This is really a tough analytical ( ANALyst ) question , without a pure answer .
How much did invading Iraq add to the price of gasoline ?
It really depends on who the hell you ask , what assumptions are , etc ..
1 . For most , the two prime drivers are mounting demand combined with constrained supply ( Peak Oil hits ) .
2 . There is , from what I can tell , an over exaggeration of the role of speculation ; this is profiting off oil prices not driving them .
3 . There is , however , a major risk factor in the market due to tensions in the Persian Gulf / etc .
( The war , threats to Iran , etc ... )
4. Without Operation Iraqi Freedom and with better relationships with Iran , would there be global investments in Iraq / Iran such that they would be producing more oil for the world market ?
5 . To what extent is the Iraq War responsible for the devaluation of the dollar over the past five years and the role this has on oil prices ?
6 . And , this question does n't deal with the most interesting question :
What is the true total cost of a gallon of gasoline ?
Because , when we add in security , infrastructure , health , pollution , and other costs , many analysts put the " price " of a gallon of gasoline well above $ 10 ( and even > $ 15 ) per gallon .
But ' the true cost of gasoline ' was n't the question and conversation .
Let 's look around at some of the discussion of the issues related to the Iraq War and gasoline prices .
From EIA 's gasoline price primer :
Crude oil supply and prices – Crude oil prices are determined by worldwide supply and demand .
Events in crude oil markets that caused spikes in crude oil prices were a major factor in all but one of the five major run-ups in gasoline prices between 1992 and 1997 , according to the National Petroleum Council 's study " U.S. Petroleum Supply - Inventory Dynamics . "
Rapid gasoline price increases occurred in response to crude oil shortages caused by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 , the Iranian revolution in 1978 , the Iran / Iraq war in 1980 , and the Persian Gulf conflict in 1990 .
The cost of crude oil has been the main contributor to recent increases in gasoline prices .
World crude oil prices reached record levels in 2007 due mainly to high worldwide oil demand relative to supply .
Other factors contributing to higher crude oil prices include political events and conflicts in some major oil producing regions , as well as other factors such as the declining value of the U.S. dollar ( the currency at which crude oil is traded globally ) .
Okay , for EIA , the prime cause : supply / demand curves , but note " political events and conflicts " .
Chris at Daily Liberty Research did a nice post on driving factors of oil prices with an interesting collection of articles , including the late June reporting that " OPEC President Chakib Khelil predicted that the price of oil will climb to $ 170 a barrel before the end of the year , citing the dollar 's decline and political conflicts … "
Chris comes to this key conclusion
the main reasons for high gas prices are the weak dollar / inflation ( aka the Federal Reserve ) , the current wars we are in , and the likelihood of the U.S. starting more wars in the near future .
National Security Network took a look at the issue as well , with a focus on the risk premium .
They comment that " some experts estimate " a risk premium of $ 30 to $ 40 barrel due to tensions with Iran /etc .
That is what my ' off the top of the head ' figure would have been for risk premium .
But , guess what : even the best analysts , when pushed away from reporters , seem call this a guess , a swag or , at best , an " educated " or " informed " estimate .
And , of course , the risk premium does n't address the question of whether there would be more oil produced absent the US invasion and occupation of Iraq and sanctions against Iran .
Nor does it address the question of how much of dollar 's fall is due to conflict in Iraq and tension with Iran .
Back to a swag :
These , however , do n't clearly answer the questions .
Is the Iraq war premium $ 3 ? $ 2.30 ? $ 2 ? A buck ?
Twenty cents ?
Or , is there no premium at all ?
I find a $ 3 per gallon assertion absurd , just as I would find it absurd to assert that there is no premium at all .
But , in terms of defensible analysis , in scratching my head , I return to the short answer :
Two dollars a gallon is , perhaps , as good a swag as anyone 's . ... I think .
But that is why this post is here .
To spark a conversation .
To be honest , I do n't know the answers to these questions .
I wonder whether anyone really does .
Which is one of the reasons why I 'm writing this .
I do n't know .
I am not expert on gasoline prices and all the factors that coalesce to drive prices that are paid at the pump .
Many here , however , are ...
Are the questions asked above the right ones ?
Are there major factors missing ?
And , what might the answers be ?

Scarlett Johansson 's offer of a dream date with her has fetched nearly £ 20,000 at auction .
The chance to spend a night with the 23 - year - old Hollywood beauty sparked a bidding frenzy among eager suitors on eBay .
Bidding began at just 50 p but soared upwards with 170 offers made in all .
The highest bid was £ 19,680 and the lucky winner , who is from the UK , will now join the sexy blonde at the premiere of her film He 's Just Not That Into You in Los Angeles or New York next July .
Scroll down for more ...
He will be ferried to the glittering event in a chauffeur - driven limousine and will join the star on the red carpet .
He can take a friend along - but might prefer to keep Scarlett all to himself .
After the screening , Bafta winner Scarlett will hand her date a personal handwritten note .
But he may have his work cut out wooing her as she is rumoured to be about to marry actor Ryan Reynolds , 31 .
All proceeds from the auction are going to Oxfam .
Scarlett has been involved with the charity since 2005 and travelled to Sri Lanka and India last year to meet families affected by the Tsunami .
Her latest role sees her playing the mistress of Henry VIII alongside Eric Bana in The Other Boleyn Girl .
Film production company Crystal Sky Pictures has secured a $ 200 million theatrical slate financing deal with Grosvenor Park , according to a report by Hollywood trade magazine Variety .
The deal covers five features , including movie adaptations for Konami's video game series Castlevania and Namco 's Pac - Man .
A co-production with Universal 's Rogue Pictures , the Castlevania film adaptation will feature a script penned by Resident Evil director Paul Anderson .
The movie will be directed by Sylvain White , whose previous work includes Stomp the Yard and I 'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer .
Other titles included with the Grosvenor Park - funded slate are an adaptation of Richard Branson memoir Losing My Virginity and a sequel to John Woo 's Hard Boiled .
Crystal
Sky hopes to expand its development capabilities with the new funding .
Said Crystal Sky Pictures CEO and president Steve Paul : " This financing is helping us in our expansion plans to greenlight films more quickly .
We 're now one of the few companies to have a big budget with which to develop our slate . "
June 12 , 2008  -- Rep. Ron Paul 's presidential campaign , a pugnacious , ideological crusade against big government and interventionist leanings in the Republican party , will officially end Thursday at a rally outside the Texas GOP 's convention , ABC News has learned .
Paul told supporters back in March , in a video posted on his Web site , that he was " winding down " his campaign and planning a new phase to what he and fans call their " revolution . "
The new phase of the revolution officially begins with a speech tonight in Houston and a Web video to be posted on his site , officially ending Paul 's presidential campaign and freeing up the more than $ 4.7 million in campaign cash for investment in a new advocacy group , The Campaign for Liberty .
The new entity will be used to push a slate of libertarian - minded Republican candidates for public office in local districts nationwide , according to a description provided to ABC News by the Paul campaign .
Paul also recently published a new book on his political philosophy , The Revolution : A Manifesto .
The Texas congressman 's campaign to win the Republican nomination raised about $ 33 million in nine months , and he and his organizers hope to reignite that grassroots support for the new organization .
They 're setting a goal of raising $ 35 million over the next year .
Despite the dedication and moxie of Paul 's supporters , maintaining that level of interest without the vehicle of Paul 's presidential campaign could be difficult , especially given the frenetic , laissez faire interaction between Paul and his supporters through the presidential campaign .
The congressman in many ways served as a figurehead , while independent actors drawn to his message did most of the organizing .
The Liberty Campaign is meant as a means for harnessing some of that energy and maintaining interest on a more micro level , by recruiting like - minded people to seek political office .
Paul , who is a medical doctor , is not ending his political career but will seek reelection to his congressional seat in Texas .
The Paul campaign itself was defined by a dedicated army of supporters , who organized independently of Paul , worked to explode " money bombs " to sustain his campaign coffers , rallied in the streets of primary states and even skirted campaign finance law to float a Ron Paul '08 blimp around much of the Eastern seabord earlier this year .
Not Getting on the McCain Bandwagon
For all the dash and creativity of Paul 's supporters , his campaign never translated into large percentages of the primary vote .
Paul has repeatedly denied calls from supporters that he run for president as an independent this year .
He argues that the American political system is weighted in favor of the two main political parties .
But while he is organizing his revolution within the Republican party , do n't look for Paul to jump on the campaign trail with McCain .
" Although it is not his intention to hurt McCain , " said Paul 's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton , " he is very unlikely to endorse . "
At the height of his campaign popularity , amid the early primaries and when he was raising more campaign money than any of the other Republicans , Paul made his mark at Republican debates , often sparring with McCain and former New York Governor Rudy Giuliani over foreign policy .
Paul was alone among Republican candidates calling for an end to the Iraq war and for American troops to be brought home from long - term international postings around the world .
McCain , perhaps the strongest backer of the Iraq war in Congress , has the polar opposite view .
In an interview Wednesday on NBC's Today show , McCain told Matt Lauer it does not matter when American troops return en masse from Iraq as long as the number of American casualties drops .
Revolution Moves to Minnesota
The " Revolution " has a way to go before it turns the Republican party .
First , it will have to get in the door .
McCain , after all , is the Republican nominee .
And he 'll be speaking center - stage at the national convention in Minneapolis .
Organizers have not yet said whether Paul will get the opportunity to address the convention at all .
And Paul is not holding his breath .
So the first official event sponsored by Paul 's new Liberty Campaign will take place in Minneapolis , but decidedly outside the walls of the Republican National Convention in September .
Paul has rented Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota , which hold 11,000 seats , for September 2 , smack in the middle of the Republican convention , which takes place at the Xcel Center .
He is also encouraging the delegates he won in the Republican primary — fewer than 50 — as well as Paul - leaning delegates committed to other candidates , to make their presence known at the Republican convention .
" Dr. Paul is still strongly encouraging them to take part in the GOP convention to influence the platform and represent the limited government wing of the Republican party , " said Benton .
Michael Nystrom is such a delegate from Massachusetts .
An independent web developer , Nystrom also runs the Web site www.dailypaul.com and was elected as an alternate Republican delegate .
And he 's not alone .
Nystrom speculates that close to half the delegates and alternates actually traveling from Massachusetts to the Republican convention are actually Paul supporters .
And they plan to make their voices heard , even if the party wo n't allow Paul 's to be .
" The main thing is that we can talk to other delegates and other alternate delegates and try to jawbone them about Ron Paul 's message and the message of traditional Republican values , " Nystrom said from his home in Massachusetts today .
And if the other delegates at the convention wo n't talk to him , Nystrom said he 'll have a Ron Paul sign and Ron Paul stickers for all to see , unless party officials try to take those away at the door .
Then , he says , he 'll have to sneak them inside .
Nystrom and the other Paul - leaning Massachusetts delegates have had meetings to plot convention strategy and Nystrom said similar meetings are going on nationwide .
Technically pledged to support former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , Nystrom said he was elected as a delegate by speaking out at a party delegate meeting .
Nystrom did not mention Paul 's name , " but I did mention his ideals , and I was elected . "
He said this shows that Paul 's ideals have resonance with Republican voters .
" They are traditional Republican values , just not the values of the current Republican regime . "
Nystrom said .
" A lot of people feel alienated by this country , by this false left - right dichotomy , " he said .
" We do n't know about the political process in this country and its sad , I think , because the political process has been taken over by professionals , " Nystrom said .
" Everyone in the family stores stuff there , and I had no idea what some of the stuff is or was — I was surprised that it was there .
I assumed I must have put it there by accident , but when the story broke , [ my son ]
Yale called and said he 's pretty sure he uploaded a bunch of it .
I had no idea , but that sounds right , because I sure do n't remember putting some of that stuff there .

You used to think that I was nice
But now you tell all your friends
that I 'm the Antichrist .
posted porn online , the L.A. Times announced yesterday .
But today internet bloggers discovered which porn it was !
" And now , for the more disturbing and / or pornographic images , " announced conservative blogger Patterico , who claimed he'd spoken to the Times ' source for two hours , and ultimately convinced him to deliver the images he 'd downloaded from the judge 's site .
He 's identified the naked women painted like cows ( cropped above ) , the man performing fellatio on himself , and the women exposing their genitalia in front of the " Bush for President " sign .
( " That is a funny joke , " Kozinski admitted to the L.A. Times ... )
And the " slide show striptease featuring a transsexual " appears to be just a PowerPoint quiz jokingly challenging the viewer to guess real women from the pre-op transsexuals .
Some of the photos from the PowerPoint were clearly X - rated , but the blogger posting the contents of Kozinski 's directory ultimately was sympathetic .
" I could be wrong , but I think that on the whole , most people will say that the actual images are slightly less offensive than one would expect from a text description , " he blogged today .
And for some fans online , Kosinski is on his way to becoming their favorite judge .
At Fark , one poster remembered the time judge Kozinski contacted a supposedly female blogger at " Underneath Their Robes , " nominating himself for their " Judicial Hottie " contest .
( " I have it on very good authority that discerning females and gay men find graying , pudgy , middle - aged men with an accent close to Gov. Schwarzenegger 's almost totally irresistible . " )
He proudly submitted video footage of his appearance on " The Dating Game " in 1968 .
( When selected , he grabs the female contestant 's face and surprises her by planting a very long kiss . )
" I had my own photo - spread in George Magazine , with lots of sexy pictures of me jumping , " Judge Kozinski added .
" This was a few years back , but I 've only gotten cuter with age .
" The blog " Underneath Their Robes " was actually written by David Lat , who later became a blogger at Wonkette .
" I was surprised , needless to say , " Lat emailed us today about the news of the Kozinski porn stash .
" But one thing I 'd emphasize is that that this material was not easily accessible — you needed to know what subdirectory to enter in order to access items .
" So I 'm not as scandalized as it seems other folks are .
This was never material that he meant for the public to see .
" And the judge himself had another explanation , which appeared today on the blog " Above the Law "
It 's worth remembering that Kozinski has always been an unashamed advocate for freedom of speech — and he has a sense of humor .
( When Mattel sued over the song Barbie Girl , Judge Kozinski wrote in his legal opinion that " The parties are advised to chill . " )
When confronted about the dirty images by the L.A.
Times , he argued that at least some of the pictures were funny .
Some might be offensive , he conceded , but he did n't think any matched the legal definition of obscene .
" Is it prurient ?
I do n't know what to tell you , " he told the newspaper .
" I think it 's odd and interesting .
It 's part of life .
" The blogger at Patterico says the images the Times discussed had been online since December , according to his source .
And one commenter at Slashdot found a cached screenshot of Kozinski 's directory , with file dates as far back as 2004 .
But the screenshot revealed the directory held mostly the kind of viral videos one would usually find on Digg .
Yes , some of the file names were a little racy — like fart.exe , orgasm.wav , and esheep.exe .
But the Kozinski directory also held a copy of Monty Python 's innocuous Lumberjack song — along with two songs by Weird Al YankovicWonkette ultimately called it " the sort of naughtiness you ’d find in the dirty birthday cards section at Spencer Gifts , " describing Kozinski 's directory as " the very worst excuse for hosting a porn stash since Mark Penn told his mom ' I 'm keeping that stack of Juggs for a friend ? '
" Ironically , one of the Yankovic songs in his directory gave a title beginning with the words " You Don't ... " presumably the song parody " You Don't Love Me Any More . "
( " I guess I lost a little bit of self - esteem , " Weird Al sings , " that time that you made it with the whole hockey team . " )
It 's an odd bit of synchronicity , since the judge now faces a media firestorm — and ironically , his curiosity about free speech may ultimately make it harder for him to rule in defense of it .
Though Judge Kozinski has had a stellar career , it may be Weird Al who 's ultimately provided its epitaph .
Is a laptop searchable in the same way as a piece of luggage ?
The Department of Homeland Security believes it is .
For the past 18 months , immigration officials at border entries have been searching and seizing some citizens ’ laptops , cellphones , and BlackBerry devices when they return from international trips .
In some cases , the officers go through the files while the traveler is standing there .
In others , they take the device for several hours and download the hard drive ’s content .
After that , it ’s unclear what happens to the data .
The Department of Homeland Security contends these searches and seizures of electronic files are vital to detecting terrorists and child pornographers .
It also says it has the constitutional authority to do them without a warrant or probable cause .
But many people in the business community disagree , saying DHS is overstepping the Fourth Amendment bounds of permissible routine searches .
Some are fighting for Congress to put limits on what can be searched and seized and what happens to the information that ’s taken .
The civil rights community says the laptop seizures are simply unconstitutional .
They want DHS to stop the practice unless there ’s at least reasonable suspicion .
Legal scholars say the issue raises the compelling and sometimes clashing interests of privacy rights and the need to protect the US from terrorists and child pornographers .
The courts have long held that routine searches at the border are permissible , simply because they take place at the border .
Opponents of the current policy say a laptop search is far from “ routine . ”
“ A laptop can hold [ the equivalent of ] a major university ’s library :
It can contain your full life , ” says Peter Swire , a professor of law at Ohio State University in Columbus .
“ The government ’s never gotten to search your entire life , so this is unprecedented in scale what the government can get . ”
In recent court challenges , lower courts have ruled that laptop searches at the border are reasonable , just like searches of a person ’s baggage or other physical property .
But the courts have drawn the line at personal , invasive searches , ruling that things like “ strip searches , body - cavity searches , and involuntary X - ray searches ” are nonroutine , according to Nathan Sales , a professor of law at George Mason University in Arlington , Va. , who recently testified before Congress .
Thus , they require reasonable suspicion , probable cause , or a warrant .
Advocates of the current practice say that the contents of a laptop are like the contents of a suitcase , and as such , customs officials have every right to go through them .
They also argue that requiring probable cause for laptop searches would create huge delays at the border and give criminals and terrorists an easy way to bring dangerous things into the country .
“ The idea that we would create some kind of sanctuary for criminals and terrorists to carry things across the border to me is absolutely ludicrous , ” says James Jay Carafano , a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
“ It ’s also unrealistic to require probable cause when you think about the millions of people a day who come in and go out of the country . ”
People who ’ve had their laptops and other electronic devices searched and seized believe that it ’s reasonable and constitutional to expect a higher level of suspicion before customs officials take their laptop .
Amir Khan , an information technology consultant from the San Francisco area , has had his laptop searched twice on returning to the US from business abroad .
Once , a customs official took it away for more than two hours .
“ I do n’t know what he did with it .
He could have planted malicious software or copied files , ” Mr. Khan says .
“ It was very intrusive and I think unreasonable .
The Fourth Amendment makes it clear you ca n’t just stop anybody in the street and start searching them and their things . ”
Many people , particularly in the business community , also say that a laptop is more like a virtual office than a piece of baggage .
In addition , they believe the government should be required to tell people what it does with the information it copies .
“ Right now , [ DHS ] seems to believe that it can hold anything it wants from your laptop , BlackBerry , or cellphone indefinitely , ” says Susan Gurley , executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives in Alexandria , Va .
“ There are no limits on what they can do with it or whether they can share it with any third party . ”
Ms. Gurley and others in the business community would like DHS to be required to come up with a set of rules that determine what can be done with the information and how long it can be held .
Civil rights advocates would like to see Congress go even further and determine that a search of an electronic device is invasive and requires probable cause .
“ We treat our laptops , BlackBerrys , and cellphones as an extension of our brains .
They can contain our most intimate thoughts , ” says Tim Sparapani , senior legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union .
As for creating a “ sanctuary ” for terrorists to bring in lethal plans , Mr. Sparapani counters : “ Any terrorist worth his or her salt would send that stuff in an encrypted file from a remote location to a remote server somewhere in the United States . ”
In an e-mail , DHS says its officers “ have the responsibility to check items such as laptops and other personal electronic devices to ensure that any item brought into the country complies with applicable law and is not a threat to the American public . ”
John A . Wheeler , a visionary physicist and teacher who helped invent the theory of nuclear fission , gave black holes their name and argued about the nature of reality with Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr , died Sunday morning at his home in Hightstown , N.J. He was 96 .
The cause was pneumonia , said his daughter Alison Wheeler Lahnston .
Dr. Wheeler was a young , impressionable professor in 1939 when Bohr , the Danish physicist and his mentor , arrived in the United States aboard a ship from Denmark and confided to him that German scientists had succeeded in splitting uranium atoms .
Within a few weeks , he and Bohr had sketched out a theory of how nuclear fission worked .
Bohr had intended to spend the time arguing with Einstein about quantum theory , but “ he spent more time talking to me than to Einstein , ” Dr. Wheeler later recalled .
As a professor at Princeton and then at the University of Texas in Austin , Dr. Wheeler set the agenda for generations of theoretical physicists , using metaphor as effectively as calculus to capture the imaginations of his students and colleagues and to pose questions that would send them , minds blazing , to the barricades to confront nature .
Max Tegmark , a cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said of Dr. Wheeler , “ For me , he was the last Titan , the only physics superhero still standing . ”
Last tuesday I attended the “ RubyEnRails2008 dag ”  , which is the Dutch RubyAndRails conference .
It was the third time this conference was organized and this year it was located at the Hoge school in Amsterdam .
The line up was really impressive .
A number of the Ruby Rockstars gave presentations and at the end of the day David Heinemeier Hansson joined from Chicago for a Q&A session
EaRing
The day started with a talk from Zed A. Shaw .
He is the creator of Mongrel and became really famous with his rant against the Rails community .
His presentation was very entertaining but not so much about Ruby than about how great a programmer he is ( which he is btw . ) .
The project he presented was the Meta - Literal Machine which makes learning ASM fun …
It was written in 2 weeks and has support for some great features like : fully dynamic functions , access to . so files , dynamic constants ( ! ) and it has even better error messages than Ruby interpreters .
He used a Fibonacci number calculation program to show how fast the Meta - Literal Machine was .
Calculating 96 Fibonacci numbers 5.000.000 times took on his laptop about 1.2 sec .
There was some ranting against the idea to scale up application speed by parallelization .
The arguments he used were quite solid and based on an extensive analysis with Amdahl ’s law .
So , to make programs run faster , do n’t bet on parallelization but write faster programs …
The worst Rails code you ’ve ever seen
This talk , by Obie Fernandez , was about bad coding practices in Rails projects .
Obie Fernandez is a well known figure in the Ruby community and is the author of the book ‘ The Rails Way ’ .
In his talk he explained that worst ( from the talk title ) does n’t mean stupid , but means programming a Rails application not in the Rails way .
He gave some pointers on how to code the Rails way .
One of the most important things to do is to learn Ruby .
An other excellent advice he gave was that it is very useful to pair program with more experienced programmers .
And never forget good OO principles when writing Rails code .
Phusion Passenger™ ( aka mod_rails )
A better way of deploying Rails applications on apache was presented by Ninh Bui & Hongli Lai .
The apache module for running Rails apps was very outdated , not any more !
The guys from Phusion created a great product for deploying Rails apps on Apache using Phusion Passenger and their Ruby Enterprise Edition .
They announced version 2 of Passenger which includes many improvements like : fair load balancing ( as opposite to a round robin strategy ) , parallel file upload ( freeing up the Rails instance to handle new incoming requests ) and a big reduction of the VM size .
The architecture allows for running not only Rails , but also Merb , Camping , … and even Django apps using there Rack and WSGI support .
The benchmarks they presented were very impressive .
Comparing different deployment strategies ( not JRuby on Glassfish ) , the Apache plus Passenger setup wins hands down with respect to speed and memory consumption .
I would have liked to see a deployment setup with JRuby on Glassfish in the benchmark though .
JRuby
A talk not to miss was given by Charles Olivier Nutter about running Ruby on the Java VM .
The JRuby project is production ready for some time now , and on average apps run even faster on the JVM than when running on the standard Ruby Interpreter ( MSI ) .
He mentioned that Java for some people was surrounded with negativity due to emotional arguments ( I do n’t like the languages ) and sometimes the arrogant attitude of the Java vendors ( “ the answer is Java .
What was the question ? ”  ) .
He continued by praising the JVM and showed some really impressive demos of ruby programs running on the JVM and leveraging the very rich collection of Java libraries ( e.g. processing.org / and www.the-shoebox.org/apps/44).
He then continued on showing how to run Rails apps on the JVM .
The ease of deployment is really impressive .
One can use any Java app server to run a Rails app as a WAR file build with the Warbler tool .
Besides that , there is even an easier way provided by the guys from Glassfish using the Glassfish gem :
> gem install glassfish
> cd $ your_rails_project_dir
> glassfish_rails
And its done !
A number of companies already use JRuby in there production environment : Oracle , Sun , Thoughtworks ( Mingle ) , …
Q&A with David Heinemeier Hansson
David Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of Ruby on Rails .
There was a live video connection with him in Chicago giving us the possibility to ask questions .
A lot of the questions were more about the business side of 37signals ( his company ) than actually on Rails and its future , but it was kinda nice to see him “ live ”  🙂
I give you some random notes I wrote up during this Q&A :
Rails is not equal to mainstream .
The mainstream should bend to Rails .
No 5 year plan : Goal numbers are bull …
Flame wars are not leading to much 😉
Localization should not be part of Rails ( everybody has its own idea about what localization means )
37signals has 10 TB of data on Amazon S3
Scalability ?
the twitter rant is very loud , lots of noise
twitter might not be a good fit for rails ( not really a traditional web app )
Yellow Pages performs very well on Rails
In the end a very fun and inspiring day at RubyEnRails 2008 !
Joe Simpson Loves Pete Wentz and Tony Romo ' To Death '

I love Pete to death ... He has a patient spirit and a kind heart ... I 'm honored to have Pete as my son - in - law . "
US Weekly recently bashedfor being a controlling father to Ashlee and .
The mag is now posting an interview that Joe recently did with Extra on how he's not what everyone is making him out to be :
As for his youngest daughter Ashlee who just married , Joe added : Sounds like Joe is doing quite a bit of " loving to death . "
As for being worked to the bone , I added some pictures of Joe reaping the benefits of being the slave master to his two daughters .
Poor guy !
I hope those girls enter him in some kind of " father of the year " contest in time for Father 's Day .

Global warming will be " put on hold " over the next decade because of natural climate variations , scientists claim .
A study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution .
The findings suggest the official models used to predict short - term global warming patterns are too crude .
Scroll down for more ...
But scientists say rising carbon dioxide levels caused by man will send temperatures up again after the natural trends peak and will continue to rise in following decades .
UN experts have said global temperatures are expected to increase by 0.3 c over the next decade .
But the study by Dr Noel Keenlyside , of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Germany , predicts the temperature of the North Atlantic around Europe and North America may cool slightly .
Temperatures in the North Atlantic are influenced by a giant ' conveyor belt ' of warm water from the south called the meridional overturning circulation .
This weakens and grows stronger every 80 years or so .
When the circulation is strong , temperatures are warmer .
A new model of this pattern suggests it will weaken over the next ten years leading to cooler temperatures .
Writing in the journal Nature today , the scientists said : " Our results suggest global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade . "
Dr Richard Wood of the Met Office Hadley Centre , said : ' Such a cooling could temporarily offset the longerterm warming from increasing levels of greenhouse gases .
" That emphasises the need to consider climate variability and climate change together when making predictions over timescales of decades . "
The Met Office believes 2008 will be slightly cooler than last year .
But the last ten years remain the warmest decade in recent human history .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve on Sunday outlined a comprehensive government plan to prop up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the two mortgage finance giants that play a crucial role in the U.S. economy .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the Bush administration plans to ask Congress to enact legislation to temporarily increase the line of credit that the companies have with the Treasury .
It would also allow the Treasury to buy stock in the companies .
Paulson also said the Federal Reserve should be given a greater role supervising the finances of Fannie and Freddie .
In addition , the Federal Reserve announced Sunday that the mortgage finance companies can turn to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for funds .
The move gives Fannie and Freddie the same access to the funds as commercial banks and Wall Street firms .
The agency granted investment banks such access earlier this year in the wake of a similar crisis of confidence when investors lost faith in Bear Stearns .
The decision by the government to step in comes at a tumultuous time for the two shareholder - owned companies , which own or back $ 5 trillion in home mortgages and are counted on to play a central role in the recovery of the battered housing market .
At issue is the companies ' financial condition and whether their balance sheets are strong enough to continue their business of buying and guaranteeing home mortgages .
The plan by the Treasury and the Fed would provide Fannie and Freddie with needed capital .
Beyond that , even the promise of government support could be sufficient to calm investors .
Last week , investor concern sent shares of Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) plummeting .
The selloff left shares of both firms down more than 45 % for the week and about 75 % for the year .
" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in our housing finance system and must continue to do so in their current form as shareholder - owned companies , " Paulson said .
" Their support for the housing market is particularly important as we work through the current housing correction , " he added .
Provide crucial finance to housing markets
Fannie and Freddie provide a crucial source of funding for banks and other home lenders , especially since a credit market crisis last summer left them the only major players in packaging pools of mortgage loans into securities for sale to investors .
If they were unable to do so , it would raise the cost and restrict the availability of mortgage loans , causing more problems for already battered housing prices and sales .
That in turn would be another significant problem for the overall U.S. economy , as well as global credit markets .
While investors have had doubts about Fannie and Freddie for years , the government is stepping in now because of the current heightened panic atmosphere on Wall Street .
" The market has its sights set on Fannie and Freddie , " said Richard Yamarone , chief economist at Argus Research in New York .
" With them in the target zone , the Fed and Treasury felt they had to act .
[ The agencies ' ] plan is being conducted to contain investors ' fears from spreading to the rest of the market . "
Sunday 's announcement comes ahead of Monday 's opening of the stock markets and a scheduled $ 3 billion debt sale by Freddie Mac .
" Now that you know you have the government 's backing of these entities , that should go a long way to pacifying investor fears , " Yamarone said .
The White House issued a statement Sunday evening urging Congress to act quicky - something that both Republican and Democrat leaders vowed to do .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , praised Paulson 's plan .
" While Fannie and Freddie still have solid fundamentals , it will be reassuring to investors , bondholders and mortgage - holders that the federal government will be behind these agencies should it be needed , " he said .
" The Treasury 's plan is surgical and carefully thought out and will maximize confidence in Fannie and Freddie while minimizing potential costs to U.S. taxpayers . "
In fact , the extent of their troubles is in debate .
Several analysts and a former Federal Reserve governor have said last week that the two companies desperately need to raise money .
Others , including Fannie and Freddie , their regulators , some Wall Street analysts , and Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , have defended the strength of the two companies .
" What 's important are facts - and the facts are that Fannie and Freddie are in sound situation , " Dodd said on CNN's Late Edition on Sunday before the announcements by Treasury and the Fed .
" They have more than adequate capital .
They 're in good shape . "
Access to capital
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , in statements Sunday , reiterated their financial strength .
" We continue to hold more than adequate capital reserves and maintain access to liquidity from the capital markets , " the Fannie statement said .
A Freddie statement pointed to the upcoming release of its quarterly results .
" We expect the results will also show that we have a much greater surplus above the statutory minimum capital requirement .
The company 's capital and liquidity resources will enable it to continue to serve its public mission as it has always done . "
While they now have access to the Fed funds , the companies likely wo n't need to use the privilege at this time , said Art Hogan , chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York .
But the move will give investors additional confidence that Freddie and Fannie can tap the pool of liquidity backed by the federal government .
Further , unlike the Fed 's decision to let investment banks trade mortgage - backed securities for federal funds , the government is not taking on a lot of risk by letting Fannie and Freddie step up to the window .
" They have a very conservative pool of loans , " Hogan said .
" You know what you 've got here .
It 's pretty bread - and - butter . "

Joe Pavelski and Corey Perry are the veteran forwards in their mid-30s who spent their entire careers with their original teams before signing with Dallas in free agency last summer just for this chance .
Instead of a title for the aged after the best efforts of those grizzled guys to get the Stars this far , their season ended with a 2 - 0 loss to Tampa Bay in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final in Edmonton on Monday night .

Overview
Five years after the start of the war in Iraq , the image of the United States abroad remains far less positive than it was before the war and at the beginning of the century .
However , the latest survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project finds some encouraging signs for America ’s global image for the first time this decade .
Favorable views of the United States have increased modestly since 2007 in 10 of 21 countries where comparative data are available .
Perhaps more importantly , the polling finds many people around the world paying close attention to the U.S. presidential election .
Moreover – except in countries that are extremely anti-American – those who are paying attention generally believe the next president may well change U.S. foreign policy for the better .
In nearly every country surveyed , greater numbers express confidence in presidential candidate Barack Obama than in John McCain .
However , the survey of more than 24,000 people in 24 countries , conducted March 17 to April 21 , finds another change in global opinion that could present a formidable challenge to the United States in the future .
Around the world , people have a new concern : slumping economic conditions .
And they have a familiar complaint – most think the U.S. is having a considerable influence on their economy , and it is largely seen as a negative one .
Majorities in 18 of the 24 countries surveyed describe current economic conditions in their country as bad .
Assessments have worsened over the past year among countries surveyed in both this year and 2007 .
The median percentage rating their national economy as bad rose from 50 % in 2007 to 61 % in the current poll .
The proportion of respondents expressing a positive view of their nation ’s economy has declined in 14 of the 22 countries since last year .
The publics of two emerging Asian superpowers – China and India – remain upbeat about national economic conditions , though Indians are less positive than they were a year ago .
In contrast , some of the most negative evaluations of economic conditions come from citizens of advanced Western countries .
Positive views of the economy have declined sharply over the past year in Great Britain , the United States and Spain .
France , where most people were already quite negative about the economy , registered a further decline ; in the current survey , just 19 % of the French view the national economy as good , down from 30 % in 2007 .
While American and Chinese publics are at opposite poles with the respect to opinions about their national economies , the new Global Attitudes survey finds growing symmetry in the way that the United States and China are viewed by people all around the world .
Overall , favorable ratings of the two countries are fairly comparable as China ’s image has slipped a bit and the U.S. image , if anything , has improved slightly .
Both the United States and China are widely viewed as taking a unilateralist approach in their relations with other nations , while at the same time both are seen as having considerable influence on other countries .
And as global warming is of increasing importance to the citizens of the world , both the U.S , and China are criticized for the way they deal with environmental problems .
Blaming the United States
Large majorities in countries ranging from economically advanced Great Britain and Germany to developing nations such as Egypt and Indonesia say that what happens in the American economy affects economic conditions in their own countries .
With only a few exceptions , the American economy is now seen as having a negative impact on national economies , both large and small , in all parts of the world .
The view that the American economy is hurting their national economies is most prevalent among the publics of Western Europe .
About seven - in - ten in Great Britain , Germany ( 72 % each ) and France ( 70 % ) say that the U.S. economy is having a negative impact on economic conditions in their country .
India and Nigeria are the only nations surveyed where more than a third of respondents express a positive view of America ’s economic influence .
U.S. Favorability Edges Up
Despite these economic concerns , there is little evidence that the overall image of the United States has slipped further as a consequence .
In fact , positive views of the United States have risen sharply in Tanzania ( by 19 points ) and South Korea ( 12 points ) , and by smaller but significant margins in Indonesia , China , India and Poland .
Overall , opinions of the United States are most positive in South Korea , Poland , India and in the three African countries surveyed this year – Tanzania , Nigeria and South Africa .
However , positive opinions of the United States have declined by 11 points in Japan – a traditional U.S. ally – and in neighboring Mexico ( by nine points ) .
The image of the United States also remains overwhelmingly negative in most of the predominantly Muslim countries surveyed , though no more so than in recent years .
Fewer than a quarter of respondents express positive opinions of the United States in Egypt ( 22 % ) , Jordan ( 19 % ) , Pakistan ( 19 % ) and Turkey ( 12 % ) .
Large majorities in Turkey and Pakistan say they think of the United States as “ more of an enemy ” rather than as “ more of a friend ” ( 70 % in Turkey ; 60 % in Pakistan ) .
In Lebanon , 80 % of Shia Muslims consider the United States to be more of an enemy .
As in recent years , favorable views of the United States remain fairly low among the publics of a number of its traditional Western European allies .
Solid majorities continue to express unfavorable opinions of the U.S. in France , Germany and Spain .
Great Britain is the only country – of four Western European nations surveyed – where a majority ( 53 % ) expresses a positive view of the U.S .
Next American President
The survey also finds a widespread belief that U.S. foreign policy “ will change for the better ” after the inauguration of a new American president next year .
Among people who have been following the election , large majorities in France ( 68 % ) , Spain ( 67 % ) and Germany ( 64 % ) say that they believe that U.S. foreign policy will improve after the election .
This sentiment is also common in the African countries included in the survey – Nigeria ( 67 % ) , South Africa ( 66 % ) and Tanzania ( 65 % ) .
Yet this belief is far from universal .
In Jordan and Egypt , more people who are following the election say they expect new leadership to change U.S. foreign policy for the worse than say they expect a change for the better .
Two - thirds of the Japanese ( 67 % ) who are following the election say it will not bring about much change in U.S. foreign policy .
That is the plurality opinion in Russia and Turkey as well .
There is considerable interest in the presidential campaign in the surveyed countries .
A large majority of Japanese say they are following the election very closely ( 24 % ) or somewhat closely ( 59 % ) .
As a point of comparison , a third of Americans are following the election very closely , with another 47 % saying they are tracking the campaign somewhat closely .
At least half or more of respondents in such countries as Germany , Australia , Great Britain and Jordan are closely following the election .
There is less interest in the election in many other countries , including France , where 40 % are focusing on the campaign , Mexico ( 33 % ) and Spain ( 25 % ) .
People around the world who have been paying attention to the American election express more confidence in Barack Obama than in John McCain to do the right thing regarding world affairs .
McCain is rated lower than Obama in every country surveyed , except for the United States where his rating matches Obama ’s , as well as in Jordan and Pakistan where few people have confidence in either candidate .
Obama ’s advantage over McCain is overwhelming in the Western European countries surveyed : Fully 84 % of the French who have been following the election say they have confidence in Obama to do the right thing regarding world affairs , compared with 33 % who say that about McCain .
The differences in ratings for Obama and McCain are about as large in Spain and Germany , and are only somewhat narrower in Great Britain .
China Under the Microscope
With global attention focused on China in anticipation of the Beijing Olympics , people around the world express considerable concern about Chinese policies and the impact that China is having on their own countries and lives .
China is faulted for a unilateral approach in its dealings with other countries and for not respecting human rights at home .
And it is increasingly seen as hurting the global environment at a time when concerns about global warming run very high and have increased in many countries .
The verdict is more mixed with regard to China ’s growing economic power and the impact it is having on the well being of other nations .
China is a consistent worry to the publics of most Western nations , as well as to the South Koreans , but the publics of other Asian nations , including the Japanese , Indonesians and Pakistanis generally see increasing Chinese economic power as a good thing .
And the publics of African nations , in particular Nigeria and Tanzania , are most likely to look favorably upon China ’s burgeoning economic impact and influence .
Overall the current survey , which was conducted at a time when China was coming under harsh criticism for its crackdown on political dissent in Tibet , once again finds favorable ratings of China slipping in many countries .
Positive views fell significantly in nine of 21 countries in which polls were taken in 2007 , as well as in the current survey .
Opinions of China tumbled the most in France ( 47 % to 28 % ) and in Japan ( 29 % to 14 % ) .
Favorable ratings of China are highest in Nigeria , Pakistan , Tanzania and Russia .
Despite growing anti-Chinese sentiment , people in most countries surveyed approve of the decision to hold the Olympics in Beijing .
In 14 of 23 countries , clear majorities favor the idea .
Dissenters are most prevalent in Japan ( 55 % ) , France ( 55 % ) , Germany ( 47 % ) and the U.S. ( 43 % ) .
Advocates of the Olympics decision are most often found in neighboring Asian nations India , Indonesia , Pakistan and South Korea .
But many people in African and Latin American nations that have strong economic ties to China , including Nigeria ( 79 % ) , Argentina ( 72 % ) , Mexico ( 67 % ) and Brazil ( 76 % ) , are also overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the decision .
The new survey finds that global views of China and the U.S. are parallel in many respects .
First , there is parity in the worldwide images of the two nations .
The survey found the publics of nine countries holding a more favorable view of the U.S. than China , which was matched by 10 countries where there is a more favorable view of China .
( In three countries , publics had an equally favorable view of the U.S. and China . )
In Asia , the U.S. is much better rated than China by the Indians and the South Koreans .
But , the Chinese image far outshines the U.S. image among Indonesians , Pakistanis and Russians .
In Western Europe , the British , French , and Germans rate both the U.S. and the American people more positively than they do China and the Chinese people .
As with the United States , people around the world are critical of China for not taking into account the interests of other countries in the formulation of international policies .
Criticisms of Chinese unilateralism are particularly prevalent in neighboring Japan and South Korea .
Also paralleling opinion of the United States , many people around the world think that China has a direct bearing on how things are going in their country .
This view is especially prevalent among Asian publics , as well as those of leading Western powers : Fully 86 % of Japanese respondents think that China has a significant amount of influence on the way things are going in their country , a view shared by 76 % of the American public .
Somewhat smaller majorities in France , Germany and Great Britain concur .
However , large majorities of the publics of two of the three African nations included in the survey are also of the view that China has an impact on their respective countries – 70 % of Nigerians and 63 % of South Africans believe that China has a bearing on the course of their nations .
But , for the most part , African publics , unlike most people in other parts of the world , think that China ’s influence is positive .
For example , 85 % of Nigerians who think China is having an influence on their country believe its impact is a good one , while only 22 % of the British hold the same view .
Human Rights Concerns
One continuing advantage for the U.S. over China is that large majorities of people in most countries are critical of China for not respecting the personal freedoms of its people .
By contrast , for the most part , the U.S. is seen as mindful of the rights of its citizens .
Overwhelming numbers of people in Western countries are critical of China in this regard , rating it as negatively as Iran in terms of respect for human rights .
Only in Nigeria , Pakistan , Tanzania and Indonesia do most people think well of China ’s concern for personal freedoms .
Closer to the lives of people all around the world , respondents in most countries say they think that products made in China are less safe than products made in other countries .
Majorities of respondents in 18 of 24 countries expressed concerns about Chinese exports .
Yet , for all the criticisms of China with respect to how it operates both at home and abroad , there is little public alarm .
China is not seen as an enemy by the vast majority of people in the countries surveyed .
Even in Japan where views about China are highly unfavorable , only 23 % of respondents describe China as an enemy .
Indeed , China is more often thought of as a partner in Africa – majorities in Nigeria ( 78 % ) , Tanzania ( 74 % ) and South Africa ( 53 % ) express this view .
Additional Findings
Just a day after he raked the rotten leaves and plants over his garden the 47 - year old man was admitted to hospital complaining of chest pains and a shortness of breath .
Less than four days later he was dead .
After around 38 hours , passenger vessels resumed services in Bangladesh on Saturday 12 June as water transport workers partially called off their countrywide wildcat strike demanding higher wages .
The workers stopped working at midnight Thursday , calling for increased wages in keeping with the current prices of essentials and cost of living .
Alamgir Kabir , deputy director and port and transportation officer of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority ( BIWTA ) explained : " The water transport workers went on strike convened by BWTWF since midnight Thursday demanding better wages . "
However , Shah Alam , vice president of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers Federation ( BWTWF ) , said on Friday : " Water transport workers are observing the spontaneous strike , but the federation had no prior knowledge of the movement . "
Alam said prices of essentials have doubled and tripled in recent years but the water transport workers have not seen any commensurable pay rises , still surviving on a meagre monthly wage of Tk 1,900 .
Reports said that there had been no movement at any quays in Sadarghat , Dhaka , Chandpur , Barisal , Bhola , Barguna or Patuakhali from midnight Thursday until Saturday .
As meetings with BIWTA and vessel owners began on Friday , the striking workers decided to allow launches and other passenger carriers to run while keeping the freight vessels still off the routes .
In line with the decision , launches and steamers got back to operation at 3:00 pm .
The announcement of partial adjournment came on assurance from the owners of a pay hike soon , said sources in Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority ( BIWTA ) .
Talking to The Daily Star [ Bangladesh - libcom ] , Abdur Razzaq , a leader of BWTWF , said , “ We have suspended the strike for passenger vessels only , considering the sufferings of passengers . ”
Goods - carrying vessels did not yet resume services as there could not be a consensus on the interim hike for their masters and drivers , leaders of vessel labourers and owners said .
Meeting the labourer leaders , the inland water transport authorities yesterday said the government has already formed a committee to formulate a new pay structure for the workers , which would come into force next January .
The report will be submitted within the next 15 days and its recommendations will take effect from July 1 , said a BIWTA press release .
Launch labourers association leaders said they hope the committee will take into account the price spiral of essentials while drawing up the pay scale .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
One coffee drinker ’s bad news is another coffee drinker ’s good news , it seems .
The Starbucks sign is seen outside one of its stores in New York July 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
Financial woes at Starbucks Corp. , which is planning to close 600 underperforming U.S. stores , is evoking glee and little sympathy from aficionados who say they resent the coffee shop giant and favor small independent cafes .
“ I ’m so happy .
I ’m so not a Starbucks person , ” said Melinda Vigliotti , sipping iced coffee at the Irving Farm Coffee House in New York .
“ I believe in supporting small businesses .
Starbucks , bye - bye . ”
“ Amen , ” chimed in Keith DiLauro , a local caterer .
“ They went too big , too fast . ”
Seattle - based Starbucks burst onto the national scene in the 1990s and grew to more than 6,000 locations around the world .
But with cups of coffee that can cost several dollars , it faces a slowing economy and slowed consumer spending .
“ Starbucks has really created a coffee culture , raising awareness of good coffee , which is good for independents , ” said Carol Watson , owner of the Milk and Honey coffee shop in Chicago .
“ But on the other hand , they ’re on practically every corner , and that makes it tough on the little guy too . ”
In Birmingham , Alabama , retiree Peggy Bonfield , drinking coffee at the Crestwood Coffee Shop , said : “ When a Starbucks closes , it makes room for a local business to start .
“ I consider that good news , ” she said .
The schadenfreude of coffee drinkers drawing satisfaction from another ’s misfortune is part of the popular culture that enjoys the downfall of companies or celebrities , said Jim Carroll , a Canadian - based trends and innovation expert .
“ There are a lot of people out there who take delight in seeing an icon torn down by the masses , ” he said .
Starbucks fell victim to a rapid change in attitude , fueled by Internet bloggers complaining endlessly about everything from layoffs to its breakfast sandwiches , he said .
“ Starbucks was a cool brand , and then all of a sudden it ’s not a cool brand , ” he said .
“ There ’s this new global consciousness that is out there that can suddenly shift . ”
CAFE CULTURE
Indeed , said Pye Parson , who hails from Seattle and works at Birmingham ’s Crestwood , “ Once it went corporate , it was n’t Starbucks anymore . ”
New York Web designer Zachary Thacher , who favors Greenwich Village ’s cafes , said he avoids Starbucks .
“ They ’ve commoditized cafe culture , which is why I do n’t go , ” he said .
The environmental movement toward buying and appreciating locally grown products has helped neighborhood cafes and hurt the myriad look - a- like Starbucks stores , said Judy Ramberg , a consumer strategist at Iconoculture , a Minneapolis - based trend research company .
The company that began as innovative is now known for consistency and convenience , she said .
“ To me , that ’s a huge step down , ” she said .
“ You ’ve built your franchise on people who are coming in because they know exactly what they want . ”
Precisely , said Justin Sergi , explaining why he preferred Lux , a cafe in Phoenix serving lattes with a fern - like pattern teased from steamed milk in ceramic cups , over Starbucks .
“ The people that work there are very pleasant , but the stores are devoid of any kind of real charm or personality , ” he said .
“ They push a button , and a machine does everything from grinding the beans to brewing the drink . ”
It ’s not as though Starbucks does n’t have defenders ,
“ It ’s convenient , ” said Anthony Castro , sitting in a Starbucks near his job at New York ’s Museum of Modern Art.
“ I know what to expect . ”
In Birmingham , Crestwood regular Gary Adkins said he felt Starbucks gave employees good salaries and benefits .
But now Starbucks ’ plans call for cutting up to 12,000 full - and part - time positions .
Not everyone felt strongly .
“ It ’s just coffee , ” said Marc Poulin , a systems administrator at Zibetto Espresso Bar in New York .
“ If I was an investor , I ’d care . ”
Earlier this week , a Fox TV affiliate reported on a series of ads for Take - Two Interactive 's Grand Theft Auto IV being pulled from buildings and buses belonging to the Chicago Transit Authority .
Like a delay on the Brown Line , details are only now starting to trickle out about the deal .
A CTA representative confirmed the aborted ad campaign for GameSpot , explaining that the reason for pulling it actually has more to do with the last installment of the Rockstar - developed gaming franchise , Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
In 2004 , the CTA received a number of complaints about a series of ads promoting the Take - Two Interactive hit , but the furor hit as the campaign was ending , so the spots -- reportedly worth $ 90,000 to the agency -- were n't pulled .
Since that time , the CTA has found a new company to handle its advertising , one that was unaware of the previous flap .
That company agreed to a six - week campaign featuring 385 ads for Grand Theft Auto IV , one that had barely begun before the transit authority decided to yank it .
The CTA representative said the ads were removed specifically because of the 2004 complaints surrounding the San Andreas ad campaign , not because people were complaining about the Grand Theft Auto IV spots .
The ad company was set to receive $ 316,000 for the ads , but how much the move will cost the CTA is a little murkier .
Under the terms of the deal , the ad company has guaranteed the CTA $ 22.5 million this year , or 65 percent of its net receipts , whichever is greater .
So if the ad company has a banner year , pulling the GTAIV ads could cost the CTA as much as $ 205,400 .
On the other hand , if ad sales fall short of that threshold , the pulled ads wo n't cost the CTA a dime because of the guaranteed payout .
The CTA does not accept ads for alcohol or tobacco products , but it will allow campaigns promoting R- rated films .
" CTA guidelines require ads to be truthful , and not directed at inciting imminent lawless action , " the CTA representative explained .
" They can not be legally obscene or portraying graphic violence . "
The representative also dismissed concerns of the pulled advertising campaign opening it up to a lawsuit from Take - Two Interactive and Rockstar Games claiming violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech .
According to the rep , " The CTA has the right to regulate and establish guidelines for advertising on its properties . "

How to Create the Best Instagram Bio for Your Business
One of the many ways that technology has revolutionized the way the world works is in the area of communication .
Gone are the days when communication happened in person or through a pen and paper .
Nowadays , pretty much everyone who has access to Internet connectivity ( i.e. the majority of the world ) uses social media to communicate .
What does this mean for you ?
It ’s simple : your customers are on social media , and you need to have solid social media profiles so you can reach out to them .
Building an appropriate Instagram bio is one of the most important parts of building your profile on the Instagram platform .
Your bio can be the deciding factor when a would - be customer is about to follow you .
In this article , we ’ll teach you how to create an Instagram bio for business .
Think About the Purpose of the Bio
The foundational thing to think about is the purpose of the bio .
What do you want the Instagram bio to accomplish for your business ?
As a general rule , your company will want your Instagram bio to do three things .
First , the bio should explain your company ’s mission .
It should be able to communicate what your business does so that your prospects can decide whether or not they are interested in your page .
Second , it should help establish your brand by being memorable .
If it ’s not memorable , then it wo n’t engage your audience and stick in their minds .
Last but certainly not least , it should n’t be the endpoint of the prospect ’s interaction with your brand .
Instead , it should be a gateway that calls your prospect to action so that they can enter your sales funnel .
We ’ll look at how to implement each of these three purposes in your bio .
Explain Your Mission
When you explain your mission in the bio , you should seek to be as succinct as possible .
No one takes the time to read long Instagram bios .
The ideal Instagram bio length is thus no more than two lines .
Make sure that you communicate the value of doing business with your brand .
Be Memorable
The wordplay that you choose for your bio has a lot to do with its memorability .
By using well - selected , passionate words that really explain your mission , you ’ll be able to stick in your readers ’ minds .
Provide a Call to Action
Last but not least , your call to action should generally be the link that you put in your Instagram bio .
Provide a link to your Linktree page , where prospects can access all the important information that you want them to about your brand .
An Instagram Bio Does n’t Have to Be Hard
Social media may seem like a complicated beast .
But when you boil it down , it ’s actually pretty straightforward .
Just remember always to ask yourself what the purpose of this social media content is , whether it ’s a new tweet or a business Instagram bio , and make sure that you hit all of the purposes that you need to .

On April 7 , two indigenous Triqui women who worked at the community radio station ( The Voice that Breaks the Silence ) , in the autonomous municipality of San Juan Copala ( Mixteca region ) , were shot and murdered while on their way to Oaxaca City to participate in the State Forum for the Defense of the Rights of the Peoples of Oaxaca .
Three other people were injured .
According to the state attorney general , the victims are Teresa Bautista Merino ( 24 years old ) and Felícitas Martínez Sánchez ( 20 years old ) .
Francisco Vásquez Martínez ( 30 years old ) , his wife Cristina Martínez Flores ( 22 years old ) , and their son Jaciel Vásquez Martínez ( three years old ) were also injured in the attack .
According to prelimary reports , the women had left the station , which is part of the Network of Indigenous Community Radio Stations of the Southeast ( Red de Radios Comunitarias Indígenas del Sureste ) , around 1 p.m .
They were traveling in a truck on their way to Oaxaca City , but were ambushed on the outskirts of the community of Llano Juarez .
The two community radio activists were supposed to coordinate the working group for Community and Alternative Communication : Community Radio , Video , Press , and Internet , at the State Forum for the Defense of the Rights of the People of Oaxaca , which was to begin on April 9 in the auditorium of the teachers union in Oaxaca .
The Center for Community Support Working Together ( CACTUS ) released a statement denouncing the murders and demanding that the state authorities investigate and punish those responsible for the crime .
The state attorney general said that twenty 7.62 caliber bullet shells were found at the site of the murders , along with other arms including an AK - 47 .
International supporters have been asked to contact their local embassies and consulates and organize demonstrations condemning the paramilitary repression of indigenous women and community media projects .
Incredible : what more 's there to say ?

A teenager from New Zealand who was accused of stealing millions of pounds has been let off without a conviction , despite pleading guilty to hacking into computers around the world .
18 - year - old Owen Thor Walker , known online as " AKILL " , was ordered to pay just £ 5,500 in costs and damages after a high court hearing in Hamilton , New Zealand , and could even end up working with local police to help them understand online crime .
Lawyers in the case told Associated Press that officers were interested in using Walker 's skills for positive purposes , and although Detective Inspector Peter Devoy said that " there is no offer on the table " , he admitted that the " option is being kept open " .
Walker was arrested in November last year after an investigation involving the New Zealand police , FBI , US Secret Service and Dutch police , and was initially accused of leading a computer hacking ring that had stolen more than £ 12 m from victims around the world .
After a high court hearing , however , police said Walker was in fact employed by the group to write software which they then used to access people 's bank accounts .
According to police , Walker did not directly take money from people 's bank accounts , but the software he wrote was used by other criminals .
Walker pleaded guilty to charges of accessing a computer for dishonest purposes , accessing computer systems without authorisation , interfering with computer systems and possessing software with the intent to commit crime , but Justice Judith Potter dismissed the charges and ordered him to pay damages and costs of $ 14,000 New Zealand dollars ( £ 5,500 ) .
The case was part of a wider crackdown on the group , which has seen eight people around the world charged or convicted since last year .
Arrest warrants have been issued for 13 others .
The group , said police , had built a massive network of more than a million zombie computers – known as a " botnet " – allowing them to steal credit card information , manipulate stock trades and crash the systems of large companies .
NASA has confirmed that a developing natural climate pattern will likely result in much colder temperatures .
Of course , the climate alarmists ' favorite dubious data source was also quick to point out that such natural phenomena should not confuse the issue of manmade greenhouse gas induced global warming .
According to NASA 's Earth Observatory , where you 'll also find satellite images and detailed explanations of the event :
" A cool - water anomaly known as La Niña occupied the tropical Pacific Ocean throughout 2007 and early 2008 .
In April 2008 , scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that while the La Niña was weakening , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation - a larger - scale , slower - cycling ocean pattern - had shifted to its cool phase . "
This shift in the PDO , which could last for 20 or 30 years , " can have significant implications for global climate , affecting Pacific and Atlantic hurricane activity , droughts and flooding around the Pacific basin , the productivity of marine ecosystems and global land temperature patterns . "
And the greatest impact here in the states will likely be on west coast residents , particularly growers .
Warns meteorologist Anthony Watts : [ emphasis in original ]
" Look out California agriculture .
The wine industry , fruits and nut growers will be hit with a shorter growing season and more threats of frost , among other things . "
Watts cites two recent reports of frost - induced crop devastation -- an apple orchard in Paradise and wine grapes in Nevada County .
He also offers a brief history of last century 's PDO phase shifts , and warns that California 's agriculture , which experienced " unprecedented growth " during the past warm phase , may now be in serious trouble as things cool down :

Recently lower global temps , likely caused by the late start of Solar Cycle 24 , already have some greenhouse gassers nervous - particularly amid speculation of a possible impending " little ice age . "
But surely a 30 year protracted naturally - explainable cooling period concurrent with rising atmospheric CO 2 levels would forever cool the public 's receptiveness to AGW alarmism .
No problem -- our ever panicking friends at NASA have that angle covered , too :
" Natural , large - scale climate patterns like the PDO and El Niño - La Niña are superimposed on global warming caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and landscape changes like deforestation .
According to Josh Willis , JPL oceanographer and climate scientist , ‘ These natural climate phenomena can sometimes hide global warming caused by human activities .
Or they can have the opposite effect of accentuating it . ' "

So I heard you just launched your user - generated content site , knol .
The first thing I did was type “ google knol ” into the search bar in my browser .
I first checked out the organic results , but I did n’t see you there .
“ Hhhmmmm ” , I said to myself , “ this is strange ” .
So then I looked at the sponsored ( PPC ) results .
“ Ah , there you are … what a perfect opportunity , maybe they need ( me ) an SEO consultant ! ” , I then said to myself .
Ok , so here ’s my pitch …
# 1 – You really need to get some inbound links .
I check out your site using HubSpot 's Toilet Clogs .
Usually , when we put images on a webpage we specify this attribute for the image , ALT , better known as Image Alt( alternative )
Text .
This “ Alt ” text , is great for accessibility and also helps search engines ( like Google ) figure out what the image is about .
It ’s always a good idea to fill these out .
# 4 – If you ’re up for some more advanced SEO techniques ...
Here ’s one I learned from your SEO guy ( Matt Cutts ) about the nofollow attribute when placed on links .
You see , it ’s really powerful if you use it properly … it gives you the ability to channel authority ( or PageRank , this thing created by Google ) around your site .
For example , your homepage is usually your most powerful page .
Therefore , if I were you , I might take some of the insignificant links on your homepage and add the nofollow attribute to them … the Sign - In , Write a Knol , Terms of Service , Privacy Policy , etc. links are all great examples of links where you could add the nofollow attribute so that you would save some of your authority for the more important links on the homepage .
Just an idea .
Something we can look into once we take care of some of the other issues .
Besides some of these trivial on - page SEO issues I see with your site , I am a bit concerned about the content .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , I ’m sure this information is very valuable , but I definitely was n’t expecting to learn about some of this stuff on your homepage : Genital Warts , Nasal Fractures , Vertigo , Hepatitis C , Toilet clogs , GONORRHEA … as opposed to what I see on Wikipedia ’s homepage : New Zealand , NCAA college football , Czechoslovak Republic .
Maybe the logic you use to display content on the homepage is off or something , who knows .
If you ’d like to learn more about how you can leverage inbound marketing to get found online ( in search engines like Google ) , we have a series of great help articles , training videos , and also inbound marketing software that can help you get up to speed on these types of modern marketing techniques .
For new customers we also suggest that you sign - up for 4 hours of consulting with one of our internet marketing consultants .
These guys are really good , and can tell you a lot about SEO , blogging , social media strategies , etc .
Pretty much everything you would need so that you can get found on popular search engines ( like Google ) without having to pay for that # 1 listing ;)
As always , I ’m happy to help , there is some more info on your WebsiteGrader.com report .
Please feel free to ask any questions .
Cheers ,
Todd Garland

Greenhouse gases over the tropical Atlantic are disappearing faster than expected , according to the first comprehensive measurements taken in the region .
British scientists working at the Cape Verde Observatory on the volcanic island of São Vicente believe chemicals produced by sea spray and tiny marine organisms are speeding up natural processes that destroy the gases .
Detailed measurements taken over a year revealed that levels of one greenhouse gas were substantially lower than climate models predicted .
The observatory , which was recently set up by British , German and Cape Verdean scientists , has given researchers an unprecedented ability to study climate change in one of the most remote regions in the world .
In the tropics , intense UV rays in sunlight trigger reactions that effectively scrub greenhouse gases from the air .
Without this natural cleaning process , atmospheric levels of the gases and other pollutants would be substantially higher than they are .
One of the most important cleaning reactions destroys ozone , which contributes to global warming at lower altitudes .
A byproduct of the reaction , called hydroxyl , cleans the air even more by breaking down methane , the third most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere .
The study , led by scientists at Leeds and York Universities , revealed ozone levels over the tropical Atlantic were 50 % lower than expected .
Ozone is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels , and is carried down to the tropics from the UK and Europe on trade winds .
As the air crosses the ocean , the harsh sunlight reduces ozone levels from around 50 parts per billion ( ppb ) to 10 ppb , the scientists report in the journal Nature .
To check their readings , the team used a research plane to measure ozone levels at different altitudes over the ocean .
Their readings confirmed a major loss of ozone in the remote region .
" At the moment this is a good news story , more ozone and methane being destroyed than we previously thought .
But the tropical Atlantic cannot be taken for granted as a permanent sink for ozone , " said Alastair Lewis , who led the study at the national centre for atmospheric science in York .
" It may mean that there are sources of methane and ozone that we are n't aware of that the atmosphere has been working away on without us realising it .
Or perhaps we 've been overestimating how quickly ozone is removed in other parts of the world , " Lewis added .
Instruments at the observatory later pointed to an explanation for the rapid destruction of ozone over the ocean .
The sensors picked up bromine and iodine oxide , which are produced by sea spray and plankton , and join forces to attack ozone .
Lewis said the discovery should give renewed impetus to programmes that aim to reduce atmospheric methane and low - level ozone .
" It 's an incentive to get on with cutting our emissions of these gases , because if we do , the atmosphere will scrub them away quicker and we will get the benefits sooner .
Carbon dioxide lasts for hundreds of years , while methane lasts only a year or two in the tropics , " said Lewis .
Climate scientists will use the findings to fine - tune computer models that attempt to predict future warming .
" We now have to get to grips with why this was n't spotted earlier and ultimately put this into our models so we can improve their accuracy , " said Lewis .
BOGOTA , Colombia ( CNN ) --
Government agents posing as rebels tricked a gang of armed desperados into handing over 15 hostages during a rendezvous deep in Colombia 's unforgiving jungle .
The Colombian government 's bloodless rescue of the hostages Wednesday was the product of a perfectly executed ruse that depended on old - school spy games rather than high - tech gadgetry .
Agents spent months worming their way into the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , an insurgent force that has waged war on the Colombian state for 40 years , Gen. Freddy Padilla de Leon told CNN .
The agents gained the rebels ' trust and rose to the top of FARC 's leadership council as well as a team assigned to guard the hostages .
When the time was ripe , the moles used the authority they 'd gained within the group to order the 15 hostages moved from three separate locations to one central area , and the game was on .
Watch how the operation went down »
" We convinced the FARC that they were talking to those of their own , " said Gen. Mario Montoya of the Colombian army .
" It was all human intelligence . "

Once the hostages -- including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and three American contractors -- were gathered , the agents ordered a 90 - mile march through the steamy jungle , Montoya said .
Such relocations were not unusual for the hostages or the rebels , who constantly move about to avoid detection by the Colombian military .
Watch what the FARC is all about »
Little did the rebels know that the military was about to pull off a bait - and - switch that would leave them standing in a jungle clearing , not realizing they 'd just been hustled out of their most valuable assets .
See former hostages , officials exult »
The agents told their FARC comrades that an " international mission " -- such as the Red Cross or a U.N. delegation -- was coming to visit the hostages , Montoya said .
At the appointed hour , an unmarked white helicopter set down in the jungle along the trekkers ' path .
Colombian security forces posing as FARC rebels jumped out , some wearing shirts emblazoned with the likeness of revolutionary icon Che Guevara .
Background on FARC »
The helicopter crew told the 60 or so real rebels that the chopper was going to ferry the hostages to the meeting with the " international mission , " Montoya said .
During their 22 minutes on the jungle floor , the government pilot and co-pilot spoke in code with their colleagues , authorities said , using phrases such as " Generators OK " that carried a secret meaning to the security forces .
All 15 hostages were handcuffed and placed aboard the helicopter , along with two of their guards , leaving the rest of the FARC detachment on the ground .
Once the chopper was up and safely away from the landing zone , the fake rebels persuaded the real ones aboard to hand them their weapons .
Moments later , both rebels were on the floor of the aircraft , cuffed and blindfolded by their erstwhile comrades , Betancourt said .

A crew member turned and spoke to the hostages .
" We are the national military , " he said , Betancourt recalled .
" You are free . "

There have been voices raised that we are running out of IP v4 addresses for some time now .
So who has taken them ?
After discussing this at a coffee break here at Pingdom , we were curious .
Are there are any “ big spenders ” who have allocated a huge share of the IP space for themselves ?
Yes there are .
When looking at the assigned IP blocks at IANA ( Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ) , what becomes immediately clear is that the US Department of Defense has a significant number of large IP blocks .
We only looked at /8 IP blocks , the largest blocks you can get , and there are 12 of them assigned to the US DoD and related organizations .
Each / 8 block holds 16,777,214 IP addresses , so the DoD have in effect allocated more than 200 million IP addresses .
That should hold them for a while .
The closest any other corporation comes to this are Level 3 Communications and Hewlett - Packard , with two /8 blocks each .
The DoD -owned IP blocks together with the 26 corporations and universities who have their own / 8 blocks hold more than 671 million IP addresses .
These were all early land grabs , most of them made between 1991 and 1995 .
Some notables among the companies with one /8 IP block are Apple ( but no Microsoft in sight ) , IBM , Halliburton and the Ford Motor Company .
Companies and organizations with IP v4 / 8 blocks from IANA Owner Blocks ~IP addresses US Military ( Department of Defense etc. ) 12 201 million Level 3 Communications , Inc. 2 33 million Hewlett - Packard 2 33 million AT&T Bell Laboratories ( Alcatel - Lucent ) 1 16 million AT&T Global Network Services 1 16 million Bell - Northern Research ( Nortel Networks ) 1 16 million Amateur Radio Digital Communications 1 16 million Apple Computer Inc. 1 16 million Cap Debis CCS ( Mercedes - Benz ) 1 16 million Computer Sciences Corporation 1 16 million Deparment of Social Security of UK 1 16 million E.I. duPont de Nemours and Co. , Inc. 1 16 million Eli Lily and Company 1 16 million Ford Motor Company 1 16 million General Electric Company 1 16 million Halliburton Company 1 16 million IBM 1 16 million Interop Show Network 1 16 million Merck and Co. , Inc. 1 16 million MERIT Computer Network 1 16 million Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1 16 million Performance Systems International ( Cogent ) 1 16 million Prudential Equity Group , LLC 1 16 million Société Internationale De Telecommunications Aeronautiques 1 16 million U.S. Postal Service 1 16 million UK Ministry of Defence 1 16 million Xerox Corporation 1 16 million 40 671 million
The table does n’t include the blocks allocated for RIRs and other special purposes .
One thing that strikes you is the low number of ISPs on this list .
This is most likely due to their late appearance on the internet when it was harder to reserve big IP blocks , forcing them to settle for smaller blocks .
That the US Department of Defense has such a huge amount of the IP v4 address space is partly due to historical reasons :
They developed the internet in the first place ( ARPANET ) and have a strong vested interest in the evolution of the internet .
Of course , IPv6 is on its way which will end this discussion for good ( or at least for a looong time ) , but with a bit of rearranging IP v4 could probably last us for quite a while yet .
A small note :
We only looked at IANA ’s own numbers .
We did n’t look at the Regional Internet Registries such as ARIN or RIPE , partly to limit the scope of the research and partly because we were only interested in the huge /8 IP blocks .
There are only 256 / 8 blocks , and many of these are reserved for special purposes .
Mr Mosley expressed delight at the High Court judgement World motorsport boss Max Mosley has won a legal action against a Sunday newspaper over claims an orgy he took part in had Nazi overtones .
The High Court ruled the News of the World did breach Mr Mosley 's privacy , awarding him £ 60,000 in damages .
Mr Justice Eady said he could expect privacy for consensual " sexual activities ( albeit unconventional ) " .
Mr Mosley admitted a sado - masochistic sex session with five prostitutes , but denied that it had a Nazi theme .
His father was the 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley .
The paper 's story was based on a secret video from one of the women who took part in the sex session at a London flat in March .
At the High Court , Mr Justice Eady said there was " no evidence that the gathering on 28 March 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes .
Nor was it in fact .

" I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust . "
The " bondage , beating and domination " that did take place was " typical of S&M behaviour " , he said .
" But there was no public interest or other justification for the clandestine recording , for the publication of the resulting information and still photographs , or for the placing of the video extracts on the News of the World website - all of this on a massive scale . "
However , the judge did not make the unprecedented award of punitive - rather than compensatory - damages that had been sought by Mr Mosley .
He said : " It is perhaps worth adding that there is nothing ' landmark ' about this decision .
" It is simply the application to rather unusual facts of recently developed but established principles . "
The newspaper faces an additional bill of around £ 850,000 after the judge ordered it to pay Mr Mosley 's legal fees , estimated at £ 450,000 , on top of its own costs of £ 400,000 .
' No - one 's business ' Outside the High Court , Mr Mosley said he was " delighted with that judgement , which is devastating for the News of the World " .
" It demonstrates that their Nazi lie was completely invented and had no justification , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It also shows that that they had no right to go into private premises and take pictures and film of adults engaged in activities which are no - one 's business but those of the people concerned . "
The 68 - year - old says his life has been devastated by the News of the World story and the posting of the video footage on its website .
He told the court that the publicity had been " totally devastating " for his wife of 48 years , and he could think of " nothing more undignified or humiliating " for his two sons to experience .
News of the World editor Colin Myler said the paper was pleased at the lack of punitive damages , but added that " our press is less free today after another judgement based on privacy laws emanating from Europe " .
The News of the World believes its story was " legitimate and lawful "
As the head of the richest sport in the world , with almost 125 million members , Mr Mosley " had an obligation to honour the standards which its vast membership had every right to expect of him " , Mr Myler said .
" Taking part in depraved and brutal S&M orgies on a regular basis does not , in our opinion , constitute the fit and proper behaviour to be expected of someone in his hugely influential position . "
Mr Myler maintained that the paper believed its reports were " legitimate and lawful and , moreover , that publication was justified by the public interest in exposing Mr Mosley 's serious impropriety " .
Legal analyst Joshua Rozenberg said the court ruling was a " warning " to journalists .

Send us your comments " I suppose that newspaper editors might have calculated that if they are revealing facts which are truly embarrassing then the people whose privacy is invaded simply wo n't go to court and challenge it - but here is proof that somebody did , has and has won . "
He added : " But the judge said it 's not going to have a chilling effect on freedom of expression because of the fact that the damages are moderate . "
However , media lawyer Mark Stephens said : " One has to be concerned that an award of £ 60,000 is going to chill investigative journalism because if you get your decision on public interest wrong you are going to pay a hefty price . "
Mr Mosley is president of the International Automobile Federation ( FIA ) , the governing body for sports such as Formula 1 .
Despite his court victory , former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan called on Mr Mosley to resign .
" I think a slur is there against him , because I think people do n't forget that easy , " Mr Jordan said .
" If it was me , I would now , having won this case , say , 'look , I 've achieved what I wanted to achieve ... I 'm out of here ' . "
Paul Stoddart , the former boss of F1 team Minardi , said the sport was left " without credibility " while Max Mosley remained in charge .
" Various heads of state that go to Grands Prix do n't want to be seen with him , " Mr Stoddart told BBC Radio 5 Live .

Online criticism of politicians is not tolerated in Singapore , writes David Jardine
Singapore , long known for what is sometimes described as ‘ soft authoritarianism ’ is a dangerous place in which to post dissident blogs .
The latest person to discover this is Gopalan Nair , a US citizen of Singaporean origin .
Nair , in his Singaporean days a lawyer and activist for the opposition Workers ’
Party , is the latest to fall foul of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew ’s penchant for suing his critics in an effort to both bankrupt them and silence them .
Now an immigration lawyer in California , Nair claims on his blog Singapore Dissident that he was ‘ harassed and persecuted by Lee ’ and this was his reason for taking up citizenship in the USA .
He returned to the fray recently when he accused ex-PM Lee and the current PM , Lee ’s son , of ‘ abusing the legal system for their political ends through their lawyer Davinder Singh ’ .
In addition he accused Judge Belinda Ang of ‘ prostituting herself ’ in serving the aims of Lee Senior and Lee Junior .
The case she was handling involved two Singapore opposition activists , Chee Soon Juan and Chee Siok Chin of the Singapore Democratic Party .
Nair , whose passport was confiscated , is facing charges under the Sedition Act of ‘ abusing , threatening and insulting a public servant ’ , which immediately raises questions of a legal nature : can foreign nationals be charged with sedition ?
Lee Kuan
Yew has a long track record of pursuing opponents through the courts .
Most famously he sued Workers ’ Party leader Joshua Jeyaretnam in a trial that was notoriously televised .
Given that no Singapore court has ever found against Lee , the verdict was a foregone conclusion .
Critics rightly dismissed this as a ‘ show trial ’ .
As one dissident site , Singapore Window put it : ‘ To say judges jump whenever Lee Kuan Yew sues is only half the picture .
[ They ] allow Lee to deliver lengthy political punditry from the witness box . ’
In 2006 , for example , the Far Eastern Economic Review was banned and faced a defamation suit for an interview it ran with Chee Soon Juan .
The Financial Times , rather than face such legal action , apologised to PM Lee Hsien Loong and the Minister Mentor .
Unsurprisingly in this climate , many dissident Singapore bloggers refuse to reveal their identities and carry on guerrilla blogging campaigns .
Amongst the notable sites is Sheep City , whose title is a clear indication of the belief that the Singaporean state requires conformity at all costs .

Guess what ?
We still need you to submit good articles about software you like !
Suppose , you have three hard drives - sized 80 , 40 and 60 GB .
And 150 GB of music files , which you need to store on these drives .
How would you do it ?
The two solutions I knew of , were :
either to simply have three separate « Music » folders - one per each drive ;
or create some sort of RAID , joining all the drives into an array .
However , the first method is quite tiresome , as one needs to decide how to split the data between the drives and keep track of what is stored where .
For example , I might decide to store all « Classical » music on the first disk , and « Rock » music on the second .
Then , suddenly , the first drive fills up and the second one still has plenty of space .
Now I need to move the files between the disks , or jump around with symlinks .
The RAID method , while solving this problem , always incurs significant loss of either storage reliability or usable disk space .
But recently , I found a better solution to this problem and similar ones : mhddfs .
It is a FUSE filesystem module which allows to combine several smaller filesystems into one big « virtual » one , which will contain all the files from all its members , and all their free space .
Even better , unlike other similar modules ( unionfs ? ) , this one does not limit the ability to add new files on the combined filesystem and intelligently manages , where those files will be placed .
The package is called « mhddfs » and is currently present in Debian Testing and Unstable .
It does not seem to be available in Ubuntu at the moment .
Let 's say the three hard drives you have are mounted at / mnt/ hdd1 / mnt/hdd2 and / mnt/hdd3 .
Then , you might have something akin to the following :
$ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on ...
/ dev/sda1 80G 50G 30G 63 % /mnt/hdd1 /dev/sdb1 40G 35G 5G 88 % /mnt/hdd2 /dev/sdc1 60G 10G 50G 17 % /mnt/hdd3
After you have installed the mhddfs package using your favourite package manager , you can create a new mount point , let 's call it / mnt / virtual , which will join all these drives together for you .
The beauty of FUSE means you do n't really have to be root for this ( can be just a member of the fuse group ) , but for the sake of examples ' simplicity , let 's suppose we are logged in as root here .
# mkdir /mnt/virtual # mhddfs /mnt/hdd1,/mnt/hdd2,/mnt/hdd3 /mnt/ virtual -o allow_other option : allow_other ( 1 ) mhddfs : directory ' / mnt/hdd1 ' added to list mhddfs : directory ' / mnt/hdd2 ' added to list mhddfs : directory ' / mnt/hdd3 ' added to list mhddfs : move size limit 4294967296 bytes mhddfs : mount point '/ mnt/virtual '
The « -o allow_other » option here means that the resulting filesystem should be visible to all users , not just to the one who created it .
The result will look like this :
$ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on ...
/ dev/sda1 80G 50G 30G 63 % /mnt/hdd1 /dev/sdb1 40G 35G 5G 88 % /mnt/hdd2 /dev/sdc1 60G 10G 50G 17 % /mnt/hdd3 mhddfs 180G 95G 85G 53 % /mnt/virtual
As you can see , the new filesystem has been created .
It joined the total size of all drives together ( 180G ) , added together the space used by all files there ( 95G ) and summed up the free space ( 85G ) .
If you look at files in / mnt / virtual , you 'll notice that it has files from all three drives , with all three directory structures « overlayed » onto each other .
But what if you try to add new files somewhere inside that / mnt / virtual ?
Well , that is quite tricky issue , and I must say the author of mhddfs solved it very well .
When you create a new file in the virtual filesystem , mhddfs will look at the free space , which remains on each of the drives .
If the first drive has enough free space , the file will be created on that first drive .
Otherwise , if that drive is low on space ( has less than specified by « mlimit » option of mhddfs , which defaults to 4 GB ) , the second drive will be used instead .
If that drive is low on space too , the third drive will be used .
If each drive individually has less than mlimit free space , the drive with the most free space will be chosen for new files .
It 's even more than that ; if a certain drive runs out of free space in the middle of a write ( suppose , you tried to create a very large file on it ) , the write process will not fail ; mhddfs will simply transfer the already written data to another drive ( which has more space available ) and continue the write there .
All this completely transparently for to the application which writes the file ( it will not even know that anything happened ) .
Now you can simply work with files in / mnt / virtual , not caring about what is being read from which disk , etc .
Also , the convenience of having large « contiguous » free space means you can simply drop any new files into that folder and ( as long as there 's space on at least one member of the virtual FS ) not care about which file gets stored where .
If you decide to make that mount point creating automatically for you on each boot , you can add the following line to /etc / fstab :
mhddfs#/mnt/hdd1,/mnt/hdd2,/mnt/hdd3 /mnt/ virtual fuse defaults , allow_other 0 0
For more details , see man mhddfs .
Use gravity to win in this challenging game .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
First there were the thought police , then the surveillance society , now Britons fear the carbon cops are coming to ensure compliance with climate change legislation , a survey showed on Wednesday .
And with warnings of global catastrophe ringing in their ears some people fear that failure to cut personal carbon emissions will eventually result in enforced carbon behaviour re-education , the Energy Saving Trust said .
It said 41 percent of Britons think the country will need its own Carbon Police Force by mid-century and one quarter believe repeat offenders will have to go into carbon rehab and take carbon addiction classes .
“ The UK ’s perception is that by 2050 we could have the sort of draconian infringements on our civil liberties that have been highlighted in our research .
This need not be the case , ” said EST chief Philip Sellwood said .
“ The carbon emissions we all produce from our homes and travel amount to over 40 per cent of the UK ’s total emissions so we all have a part to play . ”
The survey coincides with the EST ’s “ Emission Impossible , a vision for a low carbon lifestyle by 2050 . ”
EST , set up to help people to kick their carbon habit , wants more home power generation , smart meters in homes to help cut power consumption , less water wastage , more reuse and recycling and more emphasis on efficient appliances .
“ Our report outlines the Energy Saving Trust ’s vision for achieving a low - carbon lifestyle by 2050 where we meet our 80 per cent reduction targets without adopting austere lifestyles or making unpleasant personal sacrifices , ” Sellwood said .
Feeling A Lot Like Victory -- Over Aspartame
It 's Beginning To Feel A Lot Like Victory -- Over Aspartame
Think Before You Drink is the life - saving theme of Phoenix Organics anti-aspartame campaign .
They 're backing their words with 20,000 free bottles of Cola labeled with the truth about this poisonous sweetener , the ingredient in Diet Coke and thousands of foods and beverages .
Bully !
What a heroic and signal stand !
Welcome to the Bandwagon !
Back in the old days , the AA Wagon had lots of passengers .
The US National Soft Drink Assn. protested against the approval of Aspartame / NutraSweet / Equal /951 for use
In soft drinks .
This group represents 95 % of American soda pop produces .
Their many objections , in the Senate Congressional Record , 5/7/85 , included these declarations :
" Aspartame is inherently , markedly and uniquely unstable . "
" Searle has not demonstrated to a reasonable certainty that APM and its degradation products are safe . "
" The inability to account for as much as 39 % of APMs decomposition products is significant . "
" Searle Has Not Demonstrated to a Reasonable Certainty That The Use of APM Will Not Adversely Affect Human Health as a Result of the Changes Such Use is Likely to Cause in Brain Chemistry . "
Something they did n't mention : the damned stuff is ADDICTIVE !
APMs decomposition products , identified by better chemists , include formaldehyde , methyl alcohol , diketopiperazine , formic acid and a list of other killers .
Products with this poison are n't for dieting , just for dying !
Phoenix Organics is right : Think Before You Drink .
If it says diet , do n't buy it .
Despite the damning evidence and objections of renowned scientists including the FDA 's own experts , the toxin was approved when Don Rumsfeld , CEO of APM 's maker , became America 's Secretary of Defense .
The soda pop producers found its cheaper than sugar and addicitifies like heroin , cocaine and nicotine ; the cash registers began ringing like the London Bells and they all fell off the Anti Aspartame Bandwagon right in front of the bank .
We 're closing their accounts .
In 2006 Holland Sweetener , Europe 's largest producer , closed their doors .
Merisant , the current US corporate culprit now loses $ 50,000,000 / year , owes more than they 're worth .
Care for a case of Diet Slop anyone ?
The Anti Aspartame Bandwagon is filling up fast !
Alison
White of the NZ Safe Food Campaign advocates " no aspartame " stickers on safe food products .
In NZ aspartame is indicated by the number 951 and few have a clue .
Consumers have a right to know which products destroy their health and which are safe .
It 's important to add to this to keep records of all those afflicted in New Zealand .
They can subscribe to the Aspartame Information List on www.mpwhi.com and we can forward the cases to the NZ team , but this list also helps them in support and education .
Some have a serious problem in getting off the poison because of the addiction .
For those who want to sign the petition for ban in NZ or need resources they can contact Alison White at the Safe Food Campaign , www.safefood.org.nz
She has the medical texts , the aspartame documentary " Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World " , Dr. Russell Blaylock 's new CD , " The Truth About Aspartame " and other material .
The battle to protect New Zealand against this addictive carcinogenic neurotoxin is against the New Zealand Food Safety Authority which really should be called the Aspartame Manufacturers ' Propaganda Front Group .
( Replace " Front Group " with any words you wish to substitute . "
This summer NZ's Soil & Health & the Safe Food Campaign brought me from America for a 3 - week lecture tour .
I came with peer - reviewed documents by medical experts , scientists , government documents and every sort of evidence that would convince intelligent people we 're dealing with a deadly ignored global plague .
Dr. H. J. Roberts 1000 page medical text is aptly titled : " Aspartame Disease : An Ignored Epidemic " !
Standing at the door with a goldmine of evidence brought 10,000 miles to protect Kiwi's , I was denied entry to the Food Safety Authority meeting .
They knew I had been working with world experts on aspartame for years releasing to the public their irrefutable evidence on the toxicity of aspartame .
They did n't want to see it .
To prove the point , Ralph Walton , MD who has done a study on aspartame and is a psychiatrist and aspartame expert was even refused comment by tele - conference .
I came to New Zealand when Abby Cormack almost died from aspartame and was about to be diagnosed as bipolar .
Her symptoms vanished when she quit this poison .
Dr. Walton is very interested in bipolar and aspartame and has since written this report :
http://www.mpwhi.com/aspartame_and_psychiatric_disorders.htm
He reviewed Abby 's case and exposed aspartame at the time she made world news .
Another expert , Dr. Woodrow Monte , actually lives in Wellington and was denied the right to appear at a meeting .
See his peer reviewed journal article : Aspartame : Methanol & Public Health : www.mpwhi.com/aspartame_methanol_and_public_health.pdf
Refusing experts , ignoring research , banning evidence , rejecting federal documents proves NZFSA cares not for Kiwi's , only for corporations .
What is the blood price for such treachery ?
Horror stories like Abby 's arrive like an endless avalanche .
Mission Possible World Health International has operations in 30 nations collecting them .
In New Zealand one man said , " heard Abby on TV , had the same symptoms , stopped using it and got well " .
The NZFSA not only did n't want to hear them but as word got out because of the publicity this puppet and protector constantly published releases to stumble people from listening even though Kiwis were getting well by abstaining .
Chris Wheeler , NZ arm of Mission Possible , wrote a definitive expose and discussed what went on in NZ in " Dying For A Diet Coke " : http://www.rense.com/general78/dying.htm
NZFSA 's propaganda has been repeatedly rebutted with facts : http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0708/S00086.htm
Yet they strive to brainwash the public into believing lies .
Information listing 17 new studies showing aspartame toxicity were completely ignored .
The Safe Food Campaign of New Zealand and Soil & Health are committed to getting Diet Coke out of schools and this has to be done .
Reports from world experts on how aspartame destroys the brains of our children have been compiled in this " Report For Schools " http://www.mpwhi.com/report_on_aspartame_and_children.htm
This is an effort to prevent children from suffering from such established aspartame symptoms as psychiatric and behavioral problems , reduced IQ , memory loss , disorientation , difficulty thinking and concentrating , visual blurring or even monocular blindness , drug interaction , and other disabilities including death .
Counties around the world are making strong efforts at banning aspartame .
Even large chains in the UK such as ASDA / Walmart , Marks & Spencer , Tesco , etc. are withdrawing it in their products ; 47 members of the UK Parliament there have asked for a ban .
Calls for help from many countries show the people are fedup and want it off the planet .
Robin Goodwin , Mission Possible Falklands got tired of waiting for a ban and simply wrote all citizens there so their health could be protected and aspartame products could rot on the shelves .
It worked .
The continued courage of manufacturers of integrity and activists in New Zealand read victory .
Will NZ be first to ban this carcinogenic neurotoxin ?
They have exposed NZFSA who now must listen and protect the people instead of the manufacturers .
A petition for ban of aspartame based on an imminent health hazard was sent to America 's Food and Drug Admin in October .
Physicians are being asked to continue to set up Aspartame Detox Centers .
The Trocho Study shows the formaldehyde converted from the free methyl alcohol in aspartame embalms living tissue and damages DNA .
http://www.mpwhi.com/formaldehyde_from_aspartame.pdf
NZFSA seems concerned about formaldehyde in products from China , might they be more concerned that Kiwi's are being embalmed with it because of the product they protect .

Although this has been reported ( see links below ) and even referenced by Mike Huckabee during his presidential campaign race , ( watch video below ) it is not true , .
Thanks very much to Dennis for the correction .

The trackworkers who toil in the city ’s subway tunnels call their workplace “ the hole . ”
It ’s a dank and dark and unsettling place .
Bloated rats float in puddles of muck .
The stench of garbage and urine and exhaust permeates the air .
It ’s either eerily silent or filled with the brain - rattling noise of trains blasting their horns as they barrel by .
There ’s so much steel dust swirling around that when you blow your nose your snot is black .
On summer days , the temperature regularly exceeds 100 degrees ; in the winter , it ’s below freezing .
Lost pets and homeless drug addicts occasionally stagger by , and every so often the cops chase a perp onto the tracks .
Other than that , the only inhabitants are the workers and the rats and the ghosts of all the people who have died down here .
Last year , 58 people lost their lives on the city ’s subway tracks — an average of more than one a week .
Most were “ jumpers , ” people who decided to commit suicide - by - train .
Other typical scenarios include intoxicated passengers who topple onto the rails , homeless people living underground , riders who slip while urinating between cars , teenagers who try to “ surf ” on top of the train , and commuters who accidentally fall ( or , very rarely , are pushed ) off the platform just as the subway pulls in .
Nine more people perished in the first three months of this year , and then , in early April , two men died within two days of each other :
The E train ran over a 21 - year - old who ’d stumbled onto the tracks , and a C train hit a 67 - year - old after he wandered into a tunnel .
But for the community of transit workers , the worst tragedy of all is when one of their own is killed , when someone starts his shift like everyone else , wearing an orange vest and a helmet , and ends it inside a body bag .
Repairing and maintaining the city ’s 660 miles of subway tracks — while avoiding the third rail and dodging 400 - ton trains — is not an easy task .
There have been at least 230 employee fatalities since 1946 .
In the last decade alone , ten subway workers have been killed .
Thomas DeStefano and Samuel McPhaul were electrocuted by the third rail .
The A train slammed into Christopher Bonaparte ; a 3 train killed Joy Antony while he was testing a signal light north of 96th Street ; an E train came around a curve and plowed into Kurien Baby , who was trying to put a warning light in a tunnel near Canal Street .
In 2004 , Harold Dozier was retrieving flags that had been set up to warn motormen about workers on the tracks when the B train slammed into him .
After a subway worker dies on the job , there is typically an investigation and , invariably , talk of new rules and policies .
And yet the deaths continue , with one or two names added almost every year to the plaque hanging in the lobby of the Transport Workers Union building honoring “ our fallen brothers and sisters . ”
The name of each deceased worker ricochets through the ranks for years afterward , the story of his accident told and retold , each fatality becoming a cautionary tale for those left behind .
When Marvin Franklin and Mike Williams headed to the hole on Sunday , April 29 , 2007 , the trackworker on everyone ’s mind was Daniel Boggs .
Five days earlier , Boggs had been hit by a 3 train near Columbus Circle at 11:20 p.m. , twenty minutes after the track had been scheduled to shut down .
In the car on the way to work , Marvin and Mike talked about what had happened .
“ The bottom line is , you gotta pay attention , ” Mike said .
“ But you ca n’t out - plan death .
When it ’s your time to go , it ’s time to go .
You might not like the way you go , but it is what it is .
You ’re going to have to die one day . ”
Marvin and Mike had both had their own close calls .
Marvin had spied a train coming around a curve and jumped up onto a catwalk just in time .
Mike had been picking up debris on a track that was supposed to be closed .
“ I had my back turned , ” he says .
“ I went to go pick up whatever I was going to pick up , and when I looked , I see the light . ”
He jumped off the track and onto the next one , saving his own life .
In a way , it ’s surprising there are n’t more fatal accidents , considering the number of close calls subway workers report .
Last year , a survey found that 49 percent had experienced a “ near miss where they thought they came close to being seriously injured or killed ” ; 19 percent said they had experienced such an incident at least three times .

Shortly before 3 p.m. , Marvin and Mike ducked inside a grate that had been propped open at the corner of Livingston and Smith Streets in Brooklyn , then descended a steep set of stairs to the A and C lines .
They had both joined the Transit Authority in the eighties , and for most of their careers they had worked on the same track gang in Queens , doing maintenance on the graveyard shift , 11 p.m. to 7 a.m .
There are about 1,800 trackworkers in the city .
A gang usually consists of six or seven or eight men ( and very rarely a woman ) , and they stick together — sometimes for years .
Mike and Marvin were like family .
They knew each other ’s wives and kids ; their houses were a few blocks from each other in St. Albans .
They had both volunteered to work overtime this Sunday , which is how they ’d wound up in Brooklyn , on a stretch of unfamiliar track between Jay Street and Hoyt - Schermerhorn .
They were assigned to a six - man gang assembled just for today that included their friend Jeffrey Hill .
Compared with the other two , Jeff was practically brand - new — he ’d been working on the tracks for just sixteen months .
He was also the smallest of the three .
But he was reliable .
Underground , it does n’t take long to figure out which of your co-workers you can trust to help keep you safe — and which ones are absentminded or reckless or a little too fond of the bottle .
Every night , track inspectors walk the city ’s subway tracks , five miles at a time , searching for defects , for broken rails or worn - out plates or debris that could activate the emergency brake or anything else that might cause an accident .
Trackworkers are then dispatched to the trouble spots .
The work itself can be exhausting .
Every tool is heavy — the jack , claw bar , sledgehammer , pinch bar , even the wrench — and the large rubber mats workers use to cover the third rail weigh about 115 pounds .
But the most grueling task of all is to install a new piece of track , known as “ humping rail . ”
Each piece of rail is 39 feet long , weighs 1,300 pounds , and requires at least sixteen men to carry it .
Marvin ’s body had started to show the strain of so many years spent doing manual labor , and these days he worked primarily with inspectors .
But when he worked with a maintenance gang on an overtime shift , like today , he often became its unofficial leader .
He was 55 years old , with 22 years on the job .
That experience — combined with his six - foot - two , 230 - pound build and his shoulder - length dreadlocks — gave him an air of authority .
“ Every track is live , ” he would say , meaning you should never assume a track has been taken out of service .
Today ’s assignment was to clean up scrap debris along the A and C lines .
The men were told these tracks were shut down , which would make the job much simpler .
First , though , somebody had to fetch a dolly to transport the debris .
Marvin and Jeff headed off to the Hoyt - Schermerhorn station to get it .
As they trudged through the tunnel , taking care to avoid the third rail , they talked about art .
Jeff had studied painting at Pratt ; Marvin attended classes at the Art Students League in Manhattan every morning after he got off work .
For two decades , Marvin had been drawing homeless people he encountered in subway stations .
Sometimes he ’d bring a bag of sandwiches to hand out in exchange for the chance to sketch them .
He did n’t give many details , but he ’d confided to Mike that years ago he had once been homeless , too .
That day , Jeff and Marvin discussed their favorite mediums .
Marvin said he preferred to work with watercolors .
“ If you show me how to do watercolors , ” Jeff said , “ I ’ll show you how to do oils . ”
Seven hundred feet later , they arrived at Hoyt - Schermerhorn .
The dolly they had to retrieve was on the platform across the tracks of the G line , which was still running .
Jeff and Marvin left the A and C tracks , stepped down the ladder to the G line , looked both ways , then walked across the rails .
Getting out of the way of an oncoming train is known , in the parlance of trackworkers , as “ clearing up . ”
Finding a place to clear up fast can be tricky , and there are numerous candy - striped signs marking those areas where you ca n’t clear up because there ’s not enough room — a niche in a tunnel wall , for instance , that might look like a good place to avoid a train but in fact is too shallow for a person to fit into .
Where you clear up depends on where you ’re working , but often the best spot is in the middle of two sets of tracks , between two columns , a live track on either side of you .
In a worst - case scenario , you could pretend you ’re Wesley Autrey and lay down in the trough between the rails , but no one really recommends that .
It only works if the trough is deep enough , it ’s not full of trash , and the train is n’t dragging any debris beneath it .

Inside a former public school near Avenue U in Brooklyn , NYC Transit conducts safety classes for anyone who might need to go on the tracks — transit employees , contractors , Verizon workers , cops .
In the back of Room 206 , a bulletin board is covered with newspaper stories : TRAIN KILLS TA WORKER ON TRACKS , TRANSIT WORKER KILLED BY THIRD RAIL , SUBWAY WORKER FATALLY HIT .
The instructor peppers his morning lecture with one horror story after another :
A worker tried to clear up on a pile of debris and fell onto the third rail ; another was hit by a train , the wheels ran over his shoulder , and he bled to death before reaching the hospital .
The teacher holds up a shredded jumpsuit and says it belonged to a subway worker who was electrocuted .
Staying out of harm ’s way is more difficult than you might think .
Trackworkers used to be able to feel the vibrations of an oncoming train on the rails , but now that ’s much harder to do , in part because the rails are welded together instead of bolted .
With generators running , it ’s not always easy to hear a train approaching , either .
Sometimes two trains will pass at the same time , and if you ’re not paying close attention , you might step out of the way of one and into the path of another .
Trackworkers most fear the narrow tunnels that run beneath the East River , which they refer to as “ tubes . ”
One of the most narrow is the Steinway tube , completed in 1907 and originally intended for trolleys ; now the 7 train runs there , from Grand Central to Long Island City .
The tube is so narrow that if you ’re standing on the bench wall next to the track when a train comes , it ’s best to turn sideways and crouch down on your hands and knees .
If you do n’t , if you instead try to press your back against the tunnel ’s curved wall , your head may be right in the path of the train .
The train stopped abruptly , with only two cars in the station , a sign that something was very wrong .
“ Man under ! ”
It was Marvin ’s voice calling from under the train .
In the afternoon , the safety class ventures onto the tracks , and one day not long ago I followed along , walking to the end of a subway platform and climbing down a short ladder .
I clutched my flashlight and struggled to get my bearings .
My safety goggles kept fogging up , and there was no shortage of items that could cause you to trip — rails , ties , coffee cups , cigarette packs , Red Bull cans .
I tried to keep as far from the third rail as possible , and I strained to hear every sound .
A subway worker — playing the role of the “ flagman ” — was positioned further down the tracks with a light to warn oncoming trains of our presence .
When he blew his whistle , we all stepped into the area between the two sets of tracks , bracing ourselves with one hand on a column ; this way , we ’d been taught , we would be less likely to lean too far forward and get clipped .
This situation bore only a minimal resemblance to the day - to - day reality of trackworkers ’ lives , of course .
There was plenty of room to clear up and none of the unpredictability that characterizes work carried out on live tracks .
Still , as the first train came roaring past us , I felt terrified — and tiny .
Down in the hole , the subway looks much more intimidating than it does from the platform ; my shoulders barely reached the base of its doors .
It seemed to take forever for all the subway cars to go by .
All I could see was a blur of steel , my orange vest reflected in the side of the cars , and the enormous wheels passing a few inches in front of my body .
The G is a short train , with just four cars , each weighing about 86,400 pounds .
It was making its usual stops that Sunday as Marvin and Jeff moved the dolly across the tracks at Hoyt - Schermerhorn .
Neither they nor Mike knew Lloyd London , the foreman who was supervising them .
If the foreman had been following procedure , he would have made sure there were lanterns set up deep inside the tunnel to warn approaching motormen about the presence of men on the rails .
But the workers were n’t planning to be in this area for long , and the lanterns were never set .
Instead , the foreman positioned himself between the north - and southbound rails , pointing his flashlight into the tunnel .
In this way , he assumed the role of flagman ; motormen who saw his light would know they should brake to the required speed of ten miles per hour .
The dolly they were going to get weighs 175 pounds and is almost 64 inches wide .
The easiest way to move it is in two pieces .
By 4 p.m. , an hour into their shift , Marvin and Jeff had retrieved half the dolly and were carrying it across the tracks .
To help out , Mike climbed down the stairs and headed over to fetch the other half .
The foreman noticed Mike was trying to move the metal cart by himself and turned to help him .
Photo : Thomas Dworzak / Magnum for New York Magazine
“ No , no , ” Mike said .
“ Send one of the other guys . ”
A flagman is never supposed to get distracted , never supposed to do more than just that one task .
The foreman , however , was insistent .
“ We got this , ” he said , abandoning his flagging post and walking over to help Mike .
On the other side of the tracks , nineteen feet inside the subway tunnel , Marvin and Jeff hoisted their half of the dolly onto the catwalk extending from the end of the platform .
As they were lifting it , Jeff noticed a light above Marvin ’s head .
He assumed it was the foreman flagging for them .
Or maybe it was another worker .
A second or two later , he realized it was too high and too bright to be a flashlight .
Across the way , on the southbound track , Mike and the foreman heard a train brake .
Kooooooosh .
It stopped abruptly , with only two cars in the station , a telltale sign that something was very wrong .
“ Man under ! ”
It was Marvin ’s voice .
Mike dashed in front of the first subway car and catapulted himself onto the platform .
That ’s when he saw a single black work boot resting on the platform , a few inches from the edge .
There was no doubt the boot belonged to Marvin ; the standard worker ’s boot did n’t fit him right , Mike knew , so Marvin had gotten a special one .
To his left , Mike could see Jeff hunched forward , clinging to a railing just past the end of the platform , his torso crushed inside the tiny sliver of space between the train and the concrete .
Only the outline of his vest was visible in the shadow of the tunnel .
He was silent , unmoving .
Mike did n’t know if he was dead or alive .
Then Mike saw Marvin .
He was lying in the trough between the rails , wedged underneath the second car of the train .
Marvin looked as though he were sleeping , with his head resting against his hands and his eyes closed .
He had been calling “ man under ” for himself .
These days , visitors to the Transport Workers Union can ride the elevator to the sixth floor and see Marvin Franklin ’s name engraved on a plaque in the lobby , the last name added to this solemn list .
After his death , New York City Transit convened a board of inquiry to investigate precisely what went wrong .
Mostly , they blamed Lloyd London , the foreman , though he claimed he never acted as a flagman and that he had n’t ordered the men to carry the dolly across live tracks .
( London was later demoted to subway cleaner . )
But the board ’s 33 - page report also spread the blame around a bit , noting that Jeff and Marvin “ could have carried the equipment up an available platform staircase to the opposite platform and avoided entering the tracks altogether . ”
Asked what percent of trackworkers would take this more onerous route , carrying a heavy piece of equipment up a set of stairs , over a mezzanine , and back down — instead of across live tracks —
Roger Toussaint , the former trackworker who now heads the union , says , “ Ten out of ten people will not do that . ”
In truth , the accident and the inquiry were an indictment of the entire system .
What is written in the employee rule book does not reflect what goes on hour - by - hour down on the tracks .
Last week marked the first anniversary of the accident , and for everyone involved it was a tough year .
Everton Marcus , the motorman who was driving the G train , was found to have done nothing wrong :
He had entered the station at about 21 miles per hour , two miles less than the speed limit .
Since the accident , he has been unable to return to work .
In fact , he has not even been able to ride the subway .
He sees a psychiatrist and a psychologist , takes psychiatric medications , and attends group - therapy sessions for motormen and conductors who were involved in “ 12 - 9 s ” — transit code for instances in which a train hits somebody .
“ If I have a moment to myself , I think about the flashbacks , ” he says .
“ Driving the train and then coming around the curve and the screaming .
Just to see someone on the tracks like that … ”
Jeff is still recovering from the accident as well .
The G train broke two of his ribs , ripped open his right arm , and injured his shoulder , leg , neck , and back .
It ’s amazing that he survived at all .
If not for his last - minute decision to grab the railing , he too would have been dragged under .
These days , his gait is slow and labored , and stairs are especially difficult .
He only recently stopped using a cane .
But in some ways healing his mind has proved more difficult .
He , too , has flashbacks : the moment when he saw two headlights coming at him , when the train snatched Marvin ’s body , when he felt the lip of the subway ’s doors smash into him again and again .
When he rides the subway and hears the screech of the brakes , he can feel his heartbeat accelerate .

Last year , the Transport Workers Union organized an exhibit of Marvin ’s art — watercolors and etchings of friends and strangers riding the train , and of homeless men asleep on a station bench or curled up in a subway car .
“ He had beautiful work , ” Jeff says .
“ I just saw a whole different side of him .
I saw his sensitivity .
And I felt more connected to him . ”
For the first few months after Marvin ’s death , Mike regularly visited the site of the accident .
It was hard to stay away .
He saw a psychologist every Tuesday , and afterward he ’d have to take his paperwork to an NYC Transit office in the Hoyt - Schermerhorn station .
Some weeks ,
Mike would drop off the paperwork and quickly leave ; other times , he descended the stairs to the G train .
Leaning against the wall at the end of the platform , he would survey the place where his friend had died .
Workers had poured sand on the track bed to soak up the blood , and over the months Mike watched the sand disappear .
Some days , he peered down into the pitch - black tunnel , waiting for a train to come , trying to figure out how deep the track ’s curve was and how much warning the motorman would have had .
One time Mike spotted a dreadlock on the track — he knew it was Marvin ’s — and on the next visit he retrieved it , then sealed it in a plastic bag and put it on his bedroom dresser .
Last fall , he noticed that someone had written in chalk on the column wall separating the two tracks : MF RIP .
Asked why he kept going back , Mike says , “ I ca n’t really put that into words .
It just makes me remember him a little bit more . ”
Nearly seven months after Marvin died , Mike returned to work .
Another employee might have asked for a transfer to a different position — something less dangerous , anywhere but on the tracks — but Mike did not .
“ I do n’t think I could do anything else , ” he says .
What about becoming a station agent ?
“ You ’re just sitting down most of the time . ”
What about a motorman ?
“ You ’re just pushing a thing ; you ’re not doing work like trackworkers do work .
We do work .
Hard - labor work . ”
The first nights back were the toughest , in part because he was assigned to work on the G line .
“ I was in a daze , ” he says .
“ Every time a train was going by , I was looking at those wheels . ”
But eventually he started feeling at home again in the tunnels .
He liked the camaraderie of the track gang , the feeling of fatigue that accompanied the end of every shift , the sense of pride he got from knowing that he was doing an important job .
And so he keeps going back .
Five nights a week , just before ten , he puts on his helmet and his orange vest , and he goes down to work in the hole .
The X - 33 is one example of past programs the sought to be “ the solution ” to low - cost space access .
( credit : NASA ) The Vision for Space Exploration and the retirement of the Baby Boomers ( part 3 ) Build an industry , not a program
In part 1 of this series , we made the case that the current plan to achieve the Vision for Space Exploration may well be unsustainable and unaffordable in the face of huge financial pressures created by the coming retirement of the baby boomers .
In part 2 of this series , we suggested a Plan B strategy for achieving the goals of the VSE , which is credible even if NASA ’s budget is significantly cut in the coming decade .
We specifically stated :
We know of one strategic direction — the pursuit of Cheap & Reliable Access to Space ( CRATS ) — that will allow us to effectively sell and continue executing the VSE , and to continue pursuing everything else , in an era of declining budgets .
CRATS makes our entire national space agenda , including the VSE , both politically supportable and economically sustainable .
CRATS clearly and directly addresses all three of the fundamental objectives as repeatedly stated by presidential science advisor Dr. John Marburger — as it provides major benefits in “ national security ” , “ economics ” , and “ science ” .
CRATS is the key to incorporating the Solar System into our economic sphere .
Now , in part 3 of this essay , we make specific recommendations on “ how ” our nation should proceed to achieve cheap and reliable access to space ( CRATS ) .
We will historically demonstrate that neither a big government program approach nor laissez - faire approach is to be recommended .
We recommend that our nation adopt a public - private partnership mindset : “ Build an Industry , Not a Program ” .
Since the federal government organizes most of its activities and projects in the form of “ programs ” , what do we mean by “ Not a Program ” ?
It means , we recommend against : Setting up yet another big central - government program with the job to design , build , or operate “ The Solution . ”
Solution . ”
Any programmatic or technical approach that proposes to pick “ The Solution ” , or anything that even infers that it is the solution , such as “ the national space transportation system ” or “ the national aerospace plane ” .
Solution ” , or anything that even infers that it is solution , such as “ the space transportation system ” or “ the aerospace plane ” .
Providing the majority of the Government ’s money to any one company , or any one program .
However , at the same time , we also recommend against a laissez - faire approach to achieving CRATS .
The pure free market development of CRATS has been stymied by a combination of several factors : classic market failure — inelasticity of demand ,
uncertainty of demand for new markets created by CRATS ,
the high risk of investing in unproven technology and unproven systems , and
the large amounts of private investment required for any one serious attempt to build an RLV .
We are convinced that CRATS will eventually emerge from pure market forces , if left alone .
However our nation cannot afford to wait for that long .
CRATS is critical to the security of our nation .
We ca n’t wait any longer .
The problem with the “ Big Program ” mindset History demonstrates that the “ Big Government Program ” mindset almost always leads to a strategy of “ Pick the Solution ” , which often leads to failure .
This does not necessarily mean that the next attempt for central - government - led reusable launch vehicle ( RLV ) program will fail , but we are now 0 - for - 3 .
We are 0 - for - 4 if you count the National Aerospace Initiative in 2002 – 04 .
History demonstrates that the “ Big Government Program ” mindset almost always leads to a strategy of “ Pick the Solution ” , which often leads to failure .
In the 1970s , NASA set out to design and build a “ National Space Transportation System ” , also known as the Space Shuttle .
NASA told the White House Office of Management and Budget in 1971 that the Shuttle would fly 50 times per year at a cost of $ 10.5 million a flight and deliver 29,500 kilograms ( 65,000 pounds ) per launch .
This equates to an estimate of $ 162 / pound ( FY1971 ) or $ 650 / pound ( 2008 dollars ) 1 .
America spent $ 30 billion ( 2008 dollars ) to develop the Shuttle , and it failed to produce anything close to the costs that were promised .
In fact , it is over an order of magnitude higher in cost , as well as an order of magnitude less reliable , than was promised .
In the 1984 , this nation initiated a second major effort to achieve CRATS , which started out as a classified DARPA project called “ Copper Canyon . ”
The project became the X - 30 National Aerospace Plane Program ( NASP ) after a State of the Union speech by President Reagan in February 1986 proposed an Orient Express .
NASP was extremely technically challenging , requiring breakthroughs in at least six distinct technologies .
In a December 3 , 1992 report to Congress , the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) reported that the NASP program cost had grown by more than a factor of four from the original 1986 estimate of $ 3.3 billion in 1992 dollars ( $ 4.8 billion , 2008 dollars ) to as much as $ 14.6 billion ( $ 21.3 billion , 2008 dollars ) .
After 10 years of activity , the NASP X - 30 program was cancelled in 1994 .
We did not wait long after NASP to start the next effort to achieve CRATS — almost certainly because of the public support and excitement generated by the DC - X program .
In January 1995 , NASA announced the X - 33 program with lots of public support .
However , NASA chose by far the most technically risky of the three leading concepts , rather than the most likely to succeed at demonstrating an operational RLV capability .
This was a mistake as neither NASA nor Lockheed Martin were willing to pay for cost overruns created by the ensuing X - 33 technical problems .
In an August 1999 report to Congress , the GAO estimated that the total cost to the US taxpayers for the X - 33 was $ 1.23 billion ( $ 1.5 billion in 2008 dollars ) .
The X - 33 RLV program was shut down in 2001 .
Seven years later , we have not yet ( officially ) tried again .
This is not because advocates of RLVs have stopped trying .
From 2002 – 04 , starting right after the X - 33 was cancelled , NASA and the DoD combined forces in the form of the National Aerospace Initiative ( NAI ) .
Most of the NAI history is not public , so we talked to several sources in the initiative .
One source reports that the NAI tried to meet all the launch requirements of both the DoD and NASA , thereby repeating part of the history of the Shuttle , and the total cost estimates approached $ 50 billion .
This source reports that the NAI collapsed from the sticker shock .
A second source had a slightly different but consistent perspective , stating that the cost of the NAI was so large it forced an either / or choice between the NAI and the VSE , and the NAI collapsed after the President picked the VSE .
It is not what you know that will get you .
It is not even what you know that you do n’t know .
It is what you do n’t know that you do n’t know .
The reason that the Shuttle , NASP , X - 33 , and the NAI failed to achieve the goal of CRATS is not because the people managing these programs were not smart — they are very smart .
In many cases , they were chosen because they were among the smartest people we knew on the subject of space transportation .
They knew a lot about space transportation .
They were among the “ best and brightest ” people on this subject that we knew .
We assert that the fundamental reason for the repeated failure of these programs has to do with the limits of knowledge , and the blind spots that we all have .
The smart person ’s disease : the unknown unknowns
It is not what you know that will get you .
It is not even what you know that you do n’t know .
It is what you do n’t know that you do n’t know .
This is a mental blindspot created by the fundamental nature of knowledge .
We focus on what we know .
We look at facts based on our previous experience .
We create mental models based on what we know .
The curse is that the smarter you are , and the more you know , the more likely you will become confident , and then arrogant , about what you know .
When you become confident about your knowledge , the blind spot increases in size .
When you become arrogant , you stop listening , and the bigger your blind spot becomes .
In reality , there is not much difference , if any , between confidence and arrogance .
In The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable , Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes : “ Let us examine what I call epistemic arrogance , literally , our hubris concerning the limits of knowledge .
Episteme is a Greek word that refers to knowledge ; giving a Greek name to an abstract concept makes it sound important .
True , our knowledge does grow , but it is threatened by greater increases in confidence , which make our increase in knowledge at the same time an increase in confusion , ignorance , and conceit . ”
Smart , highly educated , and accomplished people often start thinking they are smarter than almost everybody else .
We often focus on what we know that others do not know .
The authors of this essay are not immune — we too are often blinded by our arrogance .
This arrogance is a disease — it creates blinds spots , which stops each and every one of us from thinking .
These blind spots help explain some of the history of attempts to achieve cheap and reliable access to space .
We have now had three major program failures in a row .
In each case , the lead government agency picked what it thought was “ The Solution ” .
After each failure , they figured out the specific problem with the latest attempt , decided what the right solution to that specific problem was , and then picked somebody they knew was “ best and brightest ” to try again .
Do you see the blind spots ?
Everybody agrees that achieving CRATS is critical for the nation .
Everybody agrees that we should marshal the efforts of the best and brightest people in the nation to tackle this challenge .
One problem is that we do n’t know who the best and brightest people really are .
A second problem is that we really can’t know what is the best solution when we develop a plan to attack the problem .
A third problem is that we get too specific with lessons learned .
The problem with specific lessons learned Many very smart people have studied the failures of the Shuttle , NASP , and X - 33 to provide lessons learned for the next attempt to organize a government program to build RLVs .
Many papers , and even a few books , have discussed this subject .
The managers of NASP learned from the failures of the Shuttle , and the managers of the X - 33 program learned from the failures of both the Shuttle and NASP .
We do not argue with the precise technical lessons learned each new generation of engineers learned from the previous failure .
However , we do suggest that they have a tendency to focus on the wrong lesson .
In The Black Swan , Taleb writes : Learning to Learn Another related human impediment comes from excessive focus on what we do know : we tend to learn the precise , not the general .
What did people learn from the 9/11 episode ?
Did they learn that some events , owing to their dynamics , stand largely outside the realm of the predictable ?
No .
Did they learn the built - in defect of conventional wisdom ?
No .
What did they figure out ?
They learned precise rules for avoiding Islamic prototerrorists and tall buildings …
The story of the Maginot Line shows how we are conditioned to be specific .
The French , after the Great War , built a wall along the previous German invasion route to prevent reinvasion —
Hitler just ( almost ) effortlessly went around it .
The French had been excellent students of history ; they just learned with too much precision .
We do not spontaneously learn that we do n’t learn that we do n’t learn .
The problem with the laissez - faire mindset
Those who promote a pure laissez - faire approach have just as much epistemic arrogance as those who promote yet another big government program .
Both sides tend to ignore the hard empirical data that is inconsistent with their views .
We do not argue with the precise technical lessons learned each new generation of engineers learned from the previous failure .
However , we do suggest that they have a tendency to focus on the wrong lesson .
The empirical data is clear : the laissez - faire “ just leave us alone ” approach has not succeeded at producing CRATS either .
A series of companies , with names like Earth / Space , Inc. , Pacific American , Kistler , Pioneer Rocketplane , Kelly Space & Technology , Rotary Rocket , and many others have tried to privately finance totally reusable launch vehicles over the last three decades .
Many of these companies have had brilliant concepts , led by brilliant engineers , but the size of the investment required to complete their system has proven to be beyond any of their reach .

I ’ve covered the fate of the Arctic sea-ice for almost a year now , watching as report after report came out spelling doom for our northern pole .
At the beginning of September last year I wrote a post called “ Summer Ice to Disappear by 2030 , ” in which I quoted Dr. Mark Serreze , an Arctic specialist at the Boulder University of Colorado National Snow and Ice Data Center , saying that “ It ’s amazing .
It ’s simply fallen off a cliff and we ’re still losing ice . ”
Some near 10 months later , Dr. Serreze has predicted that , unless weather and ocean conditions change , it does not look like there will be any summer ice in the Arctic this year .
“ A large area at the North Pole and surrounding the North Pole is first - year ice , ” Serreze said .
“ That ’s the stuff that tends to melt out in the summer because it ’s thin , ” and thus , does n’t have the strength to stand up to the increased temperatures .
And so far , the preliminary evidence from a NASA satellite is showing that the ice surrounding the North Pole is “ considerably thinner ” than scientists have seen previously .
This , according to NASA ice scientist Jay Zwally , who believes there is slightly less than a 50/50 chance that the North Pole will be ice free .
We know that last year was a record year for ice melt across the entirety of the Arctic , and as such , the young ice that sprung up between the end of 07 ’s summer and 08 ’s summer will be young , and more susceptible to melting .
With a more conservative estimate , Cecilia Bitz at the University of Washington puts the odds of an Arctic without ice at 1 in 4 .
However , even though this is half what Serreze is predicting , it is still much worse than many climate models had been predicting , which was 1 in 70 sometime in the next decade .
Though there is nothing scientifically significant about the North Pole being ice free , it does hold a symbolic significance .
It caused such massive controversy last year when the Northwest Passage opened up that people begun to pay closer attention to it .
And , as Seth Borenstein of the AP notes , it is where Santa Claus lives .

I ’m constantly amazed by the things we create .
Advances in technology continue to accelerate at an astonishing rate — digital cameras are no exception .
Digital photography has taken off in recent years , nearly wiping out the existence of film cameras .
Although there are new film cameras being introduced to the market , most of what remains in the hands of photographers are remnants from the past .
Most film photographers
I ’ve encountered prefer to use outdated equipment ; analog cameras from decades past .
Why is this ?
And is the equipment really outdated ?
Do these cameras have any substantial benefits over the latest pieces of technology ?
Let ’s find out .
35 YEARS APART
As a comparison between old and new , we ’ll be looking at the following pieces of photography equipment .
The camera on the left is a 1973 - ish Minolta SR - T Super 35 mm film SLR .
It ’s fully manual in every aspect — which means focus , shutter speed , and f - number must be set by hand .
The camera can operate without any batteries , but it does have a very small ( and extremely long - lasting ) one to run the light meter ( I ’d consider that a luxury item on this camera ) .
And after 35 years , it still works just fine .
This camera was given to me by my Father (… or maybe he ’s just lending it to me ) several weeks ago .
He also had a few lenses for it : 50 mm f/1.4 , 135 mm f/2.8 , 80-200 mm f/3.9 , and a 2 x doubler .
The camera on the right is a 2008 Sony Alpha a700 APS - C format dSLR with 12 megapixels .
It ’s fully automatic in every aspect — which means focus , shutter speed , f- number , ISO , etc can be determined by the camera or by the photographer .
The camera is useless without a battery , and the battery might only last a few days .
I purchased this camera just a few months ago .
I also have a small collection of lenses for this camera ( most of which were acquired while I was using my Minolta Maxxum 7D ) : 50 mm f/1.4 , 100 mm f/2.8 , 10 - 20 mm f/4-5.6 , and 18-200 mm f/3.5-6.3 .
Both cameras operate in the same basic fashion ( since they ’re both SLRs ) , but they are also completely different on many levels .
And in several areas , I ’m finding the old film camera to be superior .
Of course there are many more things that the dSLR does better than the film SLR I ’ve shown here , but that ’s not the point of this article .
So let ’s explore the reasons I ’m falling in love with this old film camera .
NOT A SLAVE TO ELECTRICITY
How amazing is the fact that this old camera can take photos with no assistance from a battery ?
Every motion it goes through while capturing that image is driven by the potential energy stored when you wind the roll to the next position .
Not only that , but the timing for the shutter , mirror flip , and stopping down of the aperture all work in - sync to allow a controlled slice of light to land on the film .
It really is amazing .
I did mention this camera has a battery … but I also said it was a luxury item .
It runs the light meter ( which we ’ll talk about in a moment ) , but it is n’t critical to the operation of the camera .
An external light meter or educated estimate could also suffice .
SLOWING DOWN AND USING YOUR HEAD
I suppose one of the biggest differences between the two cameras is the amount of time they take to use .
The dSLR is quick — point , focus , shoot .
No messing with manual controls if you do n’t want to .
The film SLR , on the other hand , is painfully slow to frame up a photo .
Manual exposure is n’t so bad , but the manual focus aspect takes more time and effort for somebody who is n’t used to it ( like myself ) .
Not only are the controls slower , but the size of the media is smaller too .
36 shots to a roll rather than several hundred .
Granted , you can put more film in the camera , but that costs money .
These limits really force you to slow down and pay attention to what you ’re doing , and that ’s a good thing .
A SUPERB VIEWFINDER
Having never used a full frame camera before , I had n’t realized how drastically different the viewfinders are .
After using the film camera for a short period , looking back through the viewfinder of the dSLR is a bit disappointing .
If you ’ve ever had a hard time understanding the “ crop factor ” on your dSLR , try this little experiment .
Get a 35 mm camera and a dSLR outfitted with lenses of the same focal length ( I have a 50 mm for each ) .
Then look at some object through both viewfinders .
Guess what ?
The object is the same size .
Your digital camera does n’t magnify things , it just cuts out a bunch of the scene around the edges .
Hence the term “ crop factor “ .
The above images were taken through the viewfinder of my film SLR ( left ) and my dSLR ( right ) .
You can see that the subjects are the same size , but the dSLR shows much less of the scene due to the 1.5 x crop factor .
The images were not scaled separately , only aligned and cropped simultaneously to produce images fit for the web .
ANALOG LIGHT METERS RULE
Like I mentioned above , the only reason my film SLR has a battery is to run a light meter .
The neat thing about this light meter is that it ’s analog , meaning it does its job constantly .
It ’s an elegant design — simple , intuitive , and it has such a low power consumption that the battery will last for years .
Digital cameras , on the other hand , only meter the light when you depress the shutter release half - way ( unless there are models out there that also provide constant metering ) .
So even if you ’re using manual mode , you still have to meter the scene with the press of a button .
Maybe it ’s not a big deal for most photographers , but you ’d think the camera would at least offer the option for continuous metering .
As shown in this photo , the light meter is the needle and the exposure setting is the ring .
As more light enters the lens , the needle moves down .
With less light , it moves up .
The ring is moved by adjusting your film speed , f- number , and shutter speed .
To set the exposure correctly , just make the needle go through the ring .
MANUAL FOCUS , NO PROBLEM
Well … sort of .
Focusing a lens manually is still a difficult skill to acquire , no matter how many visual aids you have .
See , digital cameras are very much intended to be auto - focused .
The focusing rings do n’t have the latitude you need to fine tune your setting , plus there ’s no rangefinder to tell you that you ’re focused properly .
In my film SLR ( which has no auto - focus capability ) , there is a focusing aid built into the camera called a “ rangefinder ” .
The area at the center of the viewfinder gives an indication that the scene is either out of focus or in focus .
This particular rangefinder is a “ split image rangefinder with a microprism collar and matte ground glass with Fresnel ” ( seriously … ) , and it works as shown in the images above .
The image to the left is focused too shallow , the center image is focused , and the image on the right is focused too deep .
So when your split image goes away , you ’re in focus .
Awfully handy , but it still takes time and effort to achieve sharp focus — especially when using lenses like the 50 mm f/1.4 !
In these images you can see the actual size of the rangefinder in comparison to the entire frame .
The previous images appeared to make the rangefinder quite large , but that ’s only because of the lens I used to take the photos ( 105 mm macro ) .
So it ’s basically a chunk of glass that sits directly above the mirror .
Again … elegant and simple .
DOES ANY OF THIS STUFF MATTER ?
Sure it does !
It ’s interesting to see how things have progressed over the years , and how technology has effected photography .
The era of film cameras was a very important one , and it would be wise not to forget where our roots lie .
Also , it would be wise for camera manufacturers to look back at these old cameras every once in a while and take some notes .
The people who designed them did a lot of things right , and it appears as though the digital wave has wiped out many of those things .
At the top of the article I pondered why many film photographers prefer to use older equipment .
I suppose the answer will be different for everybody , but for me it has something to do with the fact that I ’m using a camera that ’s older than I am and it ’s the same camera that has taken so many photos of me as a child ( plus all the reasons I ’ve listed throughout the article ) .
Tell me … will your digital camera still be working in 35 years ?
How about 5 for that matter ?

Faiza M was described to be living " virtually as a recluse "
A French court has denied citizenship to a Muslim woman from Morocco , ruling that her practice of " radical " Islam is not compatible with French values .
The 32 - year - old woman , known as Faiza M , has lived in France since 2000 with her husband - a French national - and their three French - born children .
Social services reports said the burqa - wearing Faiza M lived in " total submission to her male relatives " .
Faiza M said she has never challenged the fundamental values of France .
Her initial application for French citizenship was rejected in 2005 on the grounds of " insufficient assimilation " into France .
She appealed , and late last month the Conseil d'Etat , France 's highest administrative body which also acts as a high court , upheld the decision to deny her citizenship .
The 14 Different Kinds Of Headaches You Can Get — And How To Treat Each One
There 's no getting around it : Headaches are the absolute worst — but the only real way to get rid of the pain is knowing which type of headache you 're dealing with ( yes , there 's more than just one ) .
They key ?
Knowing exactly how to describe your pain and symptoms ( like having a headache in the back of your head versus the right or left side ) — it 's the best way for doctors to determine whether you have something temporary like a sinus headache , or something a bit more chronic , like migraines .
But as far as what causes headaches goes , no one really knows : " We know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about what causes headaches , ” says Charles Flippen , MD , associate professor of neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
“ We know what areas of the brain are generating pain , but we do n’t have the whole picture . "
That said , your headache symptoms can help you ( and your doctor ) determine which type of headache you 're experiencing .
Here , 14 different types of headaches , what can cause each one , and , most importantly , how to get rid of them ASAP .
1. Tension headaches
Tension headaches are the most common type of headache , and feel like a constant ache or pressure around the head , or a headache in the back of the head or neck .
They 're not as severe as migraines , and are n't usually accompanied by nausea and vomiting , which means they rarely stop someone from continuing their regular activities ( so they 're just a huge nuisance ) .
Over - the - counter treatments , such as aspirin , ibuprofen , or acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , are usually sufficient to treat tension headaches , which experts believe may be caused by contraction of neck and scalp muscles ( including in response to stress ) , and possibly changes in brain chemicals .
2. Cluster headaches
Cluster headaches , which affect men more often than women , are headaches that occur in groups or cycles .
Cluster headaches recur regularly , even multiple times daily , over a certain period of time and then may be followed by a headache - free period of months or even years .
The headaches appear suddenly and are characterized by severe , debilitating pain on either the right or the left side of the head , and are often accompanied by a watery eye , nasal congestion , or a runny nose on the same side of the face .
During an attack , sufferers are often restless and unable to get comfortable and not likely to lay down the way someone with a migraine usually does .
The cause of cluster headaches is unknown , but they may have some genetic component .
Triggers can include alcohol , cigarettes , high altitudes , and certain foods .
There is no cure , but medications can reduce the frequency and duration of attacks .
3. Sinus headaches
When a sinus becomes inflamed , usually through an infection , it can cause pain .
Sinus infections are typically accompanied by a fever , and can ( if necessary ) be diagnosed by MRI or CT scan ( which can both detect changes in fluid levels ) , or by the presence of pus viewed through a fiber - optic scope .
These types of headaches are typically the most over - diagnosed , according to Peter Goadsby , MD , director of the Headache Center at the University of California , San Francisco .
Migraines , for example , can often be mistaken for sinus headaches , since symptoms like sinus pressure , nasal congestion , and watery eyes can happen in both types .
A true sinus headache is related to an infection and comes with nasal discharge that is green or tinged with red , says Dr. Goadsby .
Sinus infections often resolve with time or antibiotics , if necessary , and should n't cause nausea or light sensitivity , which are migraine symptoms .
Headaches due to sinus infections can also be treated with antihistamines or decongestants .
4. Rebound headaches
Overuse of painkillers for headaches — like aspirin , acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , ibuprofen ( Motrin , Advil ) , or prescription drugsc — can , ironically , lead to rebound headaches .
" Most of the patients we see in a headache center with daily headaches have medication - overuse — or rebound — headaches , " says Stewart Tepper , MD , director of research at the Center for Headache and Pain at the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute .
" They are on a merry - go - round and they can't get off , " says Dr. Tepper .
" They keep taking more medicine , they keep having more headaches , and so the patient becomes more and more desperate .
That 's when they end up coming to headache specialists to kind of reset the whole system . "
One theory is that too much medication can cause the brain to shift into an excited state , triggering more headaches .
Another is that the headaches are a symptom of withdrawal as the level of medicine drops in the bloodstream .
So how much medication is too much , and too often ?
Regularly taking any pain reliever more than twice a week or taking triptans ( migraine drugs ) for more than 10 days a month , can put you at risk for rebound headaches in just a few months .
5. Migraine headaches
Migraine headaches are severe headaches that are three times as common in women as men .
The cause is n't clear , but genes appear to play a role , and brain cell activity may affect blood vessel and nerve cell function .
Migraine headaches are defined by certain criteria :
At least five previous episodes of the same type of headaches
Headaches that last between four hours and 72 hours
Having at least two out of four of these features : one - sided pain , throbbing pain , moderate - to - severe pain , and pain that interferes with , is worsened by , or prohibits routine activity
Having at least one associated feature : nausea and / or vomiting , or , if those are not present , then sensitivity to light and sound
An oncoming migraine attack may , for some , be foreshadowed by an aura , which can include visual distortions ( like wavy lines or blind spots ) or numbness of a hand .
It 's estimated , though , that only 15 % to 20 % of migraineurs experience auras .
One common migraine trigger is change in your body , including hormones , stress , and sleeping or eating patterns .
" If you know skipping meals is a trigger , do n’t skip meals while menstruating and having a late night , " says Dr. Goadsby .
Treatment can include acetaminophen , ibuprofen , or triptans ( such as Imitrex or Zomig ) , which are drugs that specficially help treat or prevent migraines .
6. Dental headaches
There are dental - related conditions that can trigger headaches or face pain , such as bruxism ( a.k.a. , teeth - grinding ) and temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMJ ) , which affects the joints in your face , located just in front of your ear , which connect the jaw to the skull .
TMJ can be caused by bad jaw alignment , stress , poor posture ( like sitting at a computer all day ) , or arthritis , which affect the cartilage , muscles , or ligaments in the jaw .
Your dentist can help diagnose these types of headaches .
Treatment includes stretching the jaw , hot or cold packs , stress reduction , and bite guards .
7. Caffeine headaches
You love your coffee , but it can be a cruel companion .
For example , if you have two cups of coffee every day at 9 a.m. , and then miss those cups when you oversleep on Saturday — boom — you can end up with a caffeine withdrawal headache .
You will be more likely have them , though , if you drink a lot ( say , five cups of coffee a day ) , then go cold turkey .
Your only real options ?
“ You can take caffeine when you normally do and feed the addiction , or quit altogether " and suffer temporarily , says Dr. Goadsby .
8. Orgasm headaches
Orgasm - induced headaches are caused by uh , having an orgasm .
Luckily , they 're relatively rare and are more common in younger people , particularly men , Dr. Flippen says .
They usually start shortly after intercourse begins and end in a “ thunderclap ” headache at climax .
A dull headache can often linger for hours or a day .
Dr. Flippen says that there is often no known cause for these headaches , and they usually go away on their own .
He does recommend seeing a doctor , however ; in rare cases they can be a sign of something more serious .
A dose of pain reliever before sex may help ease the pain .
9 . Early - morning headaches
If you ’re waking up in pain , there are several possible culprits .
Migraines are more likely to happen in the morning , or medication may be waning in your body as you sleep , which causes a rebound headache , Dr. Goadsby says .
Sleep apnea sufferers may also be more prone to headaches early in the day , as are those with dental headaches .
In the absolute worse - case scenario , waking up consistently with a headache could be a symptom of a brain tumor , says Dr. Goadsby .
10 .
Ice cream headache
These headaches are typically known as brain freezes — a shooting head pain that can occur while enjoying a icy cold drink or treat on a hot day .
And while most everyone gets one in their lifetime , people with migraines may be especially prone to them .
Turns out , ice cream headaches have an impressive medical name — sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia — but they ’re not all that serious .
Experts think a cold sensation on the roof of the mouth can cause an increase in blood flow to one of the brain ’s arteries .
The cure ?
Take a momentary break from the frosty goodness until the pain subsides , or sip warm water to help quell the cold and constrict the brain artery .
11 . Chronic daily headaches
If you have a headache at least 15 days per month for more than three months you ’re considered to have chronic daily headaches , says Dr. Goadsby .
These could be caused by overuse of pain medications ( i.e. , rebound headaches ) , head injury , or in rare cases , meningitis or tumors .
But if there is no obvious cause , it could be because your body ’s pain signals are heightened or not working properly , says Dr. Goadsby .
Chronic daily headaches may respond to antidepressants ; beta blockers like atenolol , metoprolol , or propanolol ( used to treat high blood pressure and migraines ) ; anti-seizure medications like gabapentin or topiramate ; pain relievers like naproxen ( Aleve ) ; and even Botox injections .
12 . Menstrual headaches
As if PMS was n’t bad enough , the sudden drop in estrogen right before your period can sometimes trigger migraines , Dr. Flippen says , which usually occur between three days before and two days after your period has started .
Other women , however , may have PMS - related headaches that are n’t migraines .
These arrive about six days or so before your period , at the same time as any moodiness , cramping , or other PMS symptoms .
Dr. Flippen recommends over - the - counter headache remedies ; magnesium supplements may also help PMS - related head pain .
13 . Weekend headaches
Some people may experience headaches that mainly show up on the weekend .
These are thought to be caused by oversleeping on weekend mornings , going to bed later at night , or caffeine withdrawal .
Also , if your stress level is high all week , the weekend relief may trigger a headache .
Over - the - counter pain medications can be helpful , as can sticking to your regular sleep - wake schedule .
14 . Emergency headaches
Most headaches are n’t an emergency , but there are a few symptoms that warrant rapid attention , says Dr. Flippen .
One is a sudden onset headache that is quickly “ explosive , " which could be indicative of a brain aneurysm .
Another is when a headache comes with a fever or extreme rise in blood pressure , or if it occurs after a blow to the head or exertion .
Other problematic symptoms include vision or speech change , neck pain , dizziness , loss of sensation , or muscle weakness on one side of the body .
Call 911 if you have these worrisome symptoms in addition to headache .

As Village Voice reports Friday that a federal judge has issued an important ruling in a little - noticed lawsuit about the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 .
The power company ConEdison had a substation beneath the WTC7 , which suddenly imploded late on the afternoon of 9/11 .
ConEdison 's reinsurers have sued the parties involved in the construction of WTC7 for recompense .
Scanning through the copy of the ruling provided online by the Voice , we see the name AMEC pop up .
Ths is interesting , because AMEC is the British construction company which was in charge of " reinforcing " the wing of the Pentagon which was bombed on 9/11 .
From United States District Judge's ALVIN K. HELLERSTEIN's Jan. 12 ruling : " Plaintiffs filed Civil Action 02 Civ. 7188 on September 10 , 2002 against the City and the Port Authority , 2 and Civil Action 04 Civ. 7272 on September 10 , 2004 against the owners and lessees of 7WTC , and against the design and construction professionals who designed and built 7WTC and the leased floors of Salomon and the City .
Plaintiffs seek to recover their damage .
In order to ensure that a power outage would not disrupt Citigroup ’s trading activities at 7WTC , the Citigroup Lease provided that Citigroup would have the right to install " diesel emergency power generators … together with all ancillary equipment therefor . "
( Citigroup Lease at C - 10 . )
The Citigroup Lease included detailed provisions relating to the size and location of the generators and provided further that 7 World Trade Company would " arrange with the Port Authority for the installation of a diesel fuel storage tank on the property of the Port Authority and the installation of a fuel line from such facility running through the property of the Port Authority to the Tenant ’s emergency power generators . "
In 1988 , Salomon Inc. , now Citigroup , entered into an agreement with Silverstein as 7 World Trade Company ’s managing agent , pursuant to which Citigroup leased floors 28 - 47 and portions of floors 1 - 5 of 7WTC .
By Order of January 7 , 2005 ( the " F&K Order " ) , I ruled :
The complaint . . . mixes claims against numerous defendants labeled , " the Construction Defendants . "
It is impossible . . . to understand what each such defendant purportedly did in the construction of 7 World Trade Center , a multi-storied office building that collapsed 4 .
The Citigroup Construction Defendants
The Citigroup Construction Defendants — AMEC PLC , the general contractor ; Skidmore Owings and Merrill , L.L.P. ( " Skidmore " ) , the architect ; Flack & Kurtz ( " Flack " ) , the mechanical engineer ; Centrifugal Associates , Inc. ( " Centrifugal " ) , the infrastructure and mechanical subcontractor ; and Irwin Cantor , the structural engineer — are alleged , by the same general allegations as were used in the previous groupings of defendants , to have been negligent in the design and construction of 7WTC .
( Am. Compl . 7272 ¶¶ 183-88 . )
-----
So , Saloman controlled the first five and the top 20 floors of this building .
AMEC was in charge of wiring Saloman 's offices to diesel tanks elsewhere in the building .
That would have given AMEC access to the enitre infrastructure of the building , to be powered for " back - up power " or .... whatever else .
The judge has dismissed all charges against AMEC and will allow a limited negligence claim against leaseholder Silverstein and the Port Authority to go forawrd .
More from Vllage Voice indicates how suspicious New York 's literati are finally becoming of the anomalies : WTC7 was the last building to fall on 9 - 11 .
No one was killed there .
Compared to the twin towers it was a relative nobody among New York skyscrapers , but it has enjoyed posthumous notoriety because of the mystery of why exactly it fell .
Thanks to the neat and sudden collapse of the building , WTC7 is central to alternative theories about what happened on 9 - 11 — and particularly to the notion that the buildings in lower Manhattan were brought down by planned demolitions .
Mainstream inquiries also find puzzlement on WTC 7 .
The national investigation of Ground Zero building collapses has yet to issue its final report on building seven .
An earlier study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency punted on trying to explain the collapse definitively .
Not struck by planes , WTC7 appears to have collapsed solely because of fire — apparently a first for a steel - framed skyscraper .
The diesel fuel was the most likely culprit , even though FEMA said this " best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence . "
The city 's OEM command center used a 6,000 - gallon diesel tank ; this was one of several in the building .
Hellestein 's ruling does n't delve into whether the diesel fuel caused the collapse , or if it was a particularly bright idea to have it there , but finds that the city is immune under a state law .

" Let us understand , once and for all , that the ethical progress of society depends , not on imitating the cosmic process , still less in running away from it , but in combating it . "
— T. H. Huxley ( " Darwin's bulldog " , early advocate of evolutionary theory )
There is a quote from some Zen Master or other , who said something along the lines of :
" Western man believes that he is rebelling against nature , but he does not realize that , in doing so , he is acting according to nature . "
The Reductionist Masters of the West , strong in their own Art , are not so foolish ; they do realize that they always act within Nature .
You can narrow your focus and rebel against a facet of existing Nature — polio , say — but in so doing , you act within the whole of Nature .
The syringe that carries the polio vaccine is forged of atoms ; our minds , that understood the method , embodied in neurons .
If Jonas Salk had to fight laziness , he fought something that evolution instilled in him — a reluctance to work that conserves energy .
And he fought it with other emotions that natural selection also inscribed in him : feelings of friendship that he extended to humanity , heroism to protect his tribe , maybe an explicit desire for fame that he never acknowledged to himself — who knows ?
( I have n't actually read a biography of Salk . )
The point is , you can't fight Nature from beyond Nature , only from within it .
There is no acausal fulcrum on which to stand outside reality and move it .
There is no ghost of perfect emptiness by which you can judge your brain from outside your brain .
You can fight the cosmic process , but only by recruiting other abilities that evolution originally gave to you .
And if you fight one emotion within yourself — looking upon your own nature , and judging yourself less than you think should be — saying perhaps , " I should not want to kill my enemies " — then you make that judgment , by ...
How exactly does one go about rebelling against one 's own goal system ?
From within it , naturally .
This is perhaps the primary thing that I did n't quite understand as a teenager .
At the age of fifteen ( fourteen ? ) , I picked up a copy of TIME magazine and read an article on evolutionary psychology .
It seemed like one of the most massively obvious - in - retrospect ideas I 'd ever heard .
I went on to read The Moral Animal by Robert Wright .
And later The Adapted Mind — but from the perspective of personal epiphanies , The Moral Animal pretty much did the job .
I 'm reasonably sure that if I had not known the basics of evolutionary psychology from my teenage years , I would not currently exist as the Eliezer Yudkowsky you know .
Indeed , let me drop back a bit further :
At the age of ... I think it was nine ...
I discovered the truth about sex by looking it up in my parents ' home copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica ( stop that laughing ) .
Shortly after , I learned a good deal more by discovering where my parents had hidden the secret 15th volume of my long - beloved Childcraft series .
I 'd been avidly reading the first 14 volumes — some of them , anyway — since the age of five .
But the 15th volume was n't meant for me — it was the " Guide for Parents " .
The 15th volume of Childcraft described the life cycle of children .
It described the horrible confusion of the teenage years — teenagers experimenting with alcohol , with drugs , with unsafe sex , with reckless driving , the hormones taking over their minds , the overwhelming importance of peer pressure , the tearful accusations of " You do n't love me ! " and " I hate you ! "
I took one look at that description , at the tender age of nine , and said to myself in quiet revulsion , I 'm not going to do that .
And I did n't .
My teenage years were not untroubled .
But I did n't do any of the things that the Guide to Parents warned me against .
I did n't drink , drive , drug , lose control to hormones , pay any attention to peer pressure , or ever once think that my parents did n't love me .
In a safer world , I would have wished for my parents to have hidden that book better .
But in this world , which needs me as I am , I do n't regret finding it .
I still rebelled , of course .
I rebelled against the rebellious nature the Guide to Parents described to me .
That was part of how I defined my identity in my teenage years —
" I 'm not doing the standard stupid stuff . "
Some of the time , this just meant that I invented amazing new stupidity , but in fact that was a major improvement .
Years later , The Moral Animal made suddenly obvious the why of all that disastrous behavior I 'd been warned against .
Not that Robert Wright pointed any of this out explicitly , but it was obvious given the elementary concept of evolutionary psychology :
Physiologically adult humans are not meant to spend an additional 10 years in a school system ; their brains map that onto " I have been assigned low tribal status " .
And so , of course , they plot rebellion — accuse the existing tribal overlords of corruption — plot perhaps to split off their own little tribe in the savanna , not realizing that this is impossible in the Modern World .
The teenage males map their own fathers onto the role of " tribal chief " ...
Echoes in time , thousands of repeated generations in the savanna carving the pattern , ancient repetitions of form , reproduced in the present in strange twisted mappings , across genes that did n't know anything had changed ...
The world grew older , of a sudden .
And I 'm not going to go into the evolutionary psychology of " teenagers " in detail , not now , because that would deserve its own post .
But when I read The Moral Animal , the world suddenly acquired causal depth .
Human emotions existed for reasons , they were n't just unexamined givens .
I might previously have questioned whether an emotion was appropriate to its circumstance — whether it made sense to hate your parents , if they did really love you — but I would n't have thought , before then , to judge the existence of hatred as an evolved emotion .
And then , having come so far , and having avoided with instinctive ease all the classic errors that evolutionary psychologists are traditionally warned against — I was never once tempted to confuse evolutionary causation with psychological causation — I went wrong at the last turn .
The echo in time that was teenage psychology was obviously wrong and stupid — a distortion in the way things should be — so clearly you were supposed to unwind past it , compensate in the opposite direction or disable the feeling , to arrive at the correct answer .
It 's hard for me to remember exactly what I was thinking in this era , but I think I tended to focus on one facet of human psychology at any given moment , trying to unwind myself a piece at a time .
IIRC I did think , in full generality , " Evolution is bad ; the effect it has on psychology is bad . "
( Like it had some kind of " effect " that could be isolated ! )
But somehow , I managed not to get to " Evolutionary psychology is the cause of altruism ; altruism is bad . "
It was easy for me to see all sorts of warped altruism as having been warped by evolution .
People who wanted to trust themselves with power , for the good of their tribe — that had an obvious evolutionary explanation ; it was , therefore , a distortion to be corrected .
People who wanted to be altruistic in ways their friends would approve of — obvious evolutionary explanation ; therefore a distortion to be corrected .
People who wanted to be altruistic in a way that would optimize their fame and repute — obvious evolutionary distortion to be corrected .
People who wanted to help only their family , or only their nation — acting out ancient selection pressures on the savanna ; move past it .
But the fundamental will to help people ?
Well , the notion of that being merely evolved , was something that , somehow , I managed to never quite accept .
Even though , in retrospect , the causality is just as obvious as teen revolutionism .
IIRC , I did think something along the lines of : " Once you unwind past evolution , then the true morality is n't likely to contain a clause saying , ' This person matters but this person does n't ' , so everyone should matter equally , so you should be as eager to help others as help yourself . "
And so I thought that even if the emotion of altruism had merely evolved , it was a right emotion , and I should keep it .
But why think that people mattered at all , if you were trying to unwind past all evolutionary psychology ?
Why think that it was better for people to be happy than sad , rather than the converse ?
If I recall correctly , I did ask myself that , and sort of waved my hands mentally and said , " It just seems like one of the best guesses — I mean , I do n't know that people are valuable , but I can't think of what else could be . "
This is the Avoiding Your Belief 's Real Weak Points / Not Spontaneously Thinking About Your Belief 's Most Painful Weaknesses antipattern in full glory :
Get just far enough to place yourself on the first fringes of real distress , and then stop thinking .
And also the antipattern of trying to unwind past everything that is causally responsible for your existence as a mind , to arrive at a perfectly reliable ghost of perfect emptiness .
Later , having also seen others making similar mistakes , it seems to me that the general problem is an illusion of mind - independence that comes from picking something that appeals to you , while still seeming philosophically simple .
As if the appeal to you , of the moral argument , were n't still a feature of your particular point in mind design space .
As if there were n't still an ordinary and explicable causal history behind the appeal , and your selection of that particular principle .
As if , by making things philosophically simpler - seeming , you could enhance their appeal to a ghost - in - the - machine who would hear your justifications starting from scratch , as fairness demands .
As if your very sense of simplicity were not an aesthetic sense inscribed in you by evolution .
As if your very intuitions of " moral argument " and " justification " , were not an architecture - of - reasoning inscribed in you by natural selection , and just as causally explicable as any other feature of human psychology ...
You can't throw away evolution , and end up with a perfectly moral creature that humans would have been , if only we had never evolved ; that 's really not how it works .
Why accept intuitively appealing arguments about the nature of morality , rather than intuitively unappealing ones , if you 're going to distrust everything in you that ever evolved ?
Then what is right ?
What should we do , having been inscribed by a blind mad idiot god whose incarnation - into - reality takes the form of millions of years of ancestral murder and war ?
But even this question — every fragment of it — the notion that a blind mad idiocy is an ugly property for a god to have , or that murder is a poisoned well of order , even the words " right " and " should " — all a phenomenon within nature .
All traceable back to debates built around arguments appealing to intuitions that evolved in me .
You can't jump out of the system .
You really can't .
Even wanting to jump out of the system — the sense that something is n't justified " just because it evolved " — is something that you feel from within the system .
Anything you might try to use to jump — any sense of what morality should be like , if you could unwind past evolution — is also there as a causal result of evolution .
Not everything we think about morality is directly inscribed by evolution , of course .
We have values that we got from our parents teaching them to us as we grew up ; after it won out in a civilizational debate conducted with reference to other moral principles ; that were themselves argued into existence by appealing to built - in emotions ; using an architecture - of - interpersonal - moral - argument that evolution burped into existence .
It all goes back to evolution .
This does n't just include things like instinctive concepts of fairness , or empathy , it includes the whole notion of arguing morals as if they were propositional beliefs .
Evolution created within you that frame of reference within which you can formulate the concept of moral questioning .
Including questioning evolution 's fitness to create our moral frame of reference .
If you really try to unwind outside the system , you 'll unwind your unwinders .
That 's what I did n't quite get , those years ago .
I do plan to dissolve the cognitive confusion that makes words like " right " and " should " seem difficult to grasp .
I 've been working up to that for a while now .
But I 'm not there yet , and so , for now , I 'm going to jump ahead and peek at an answer I 'll only later be able to justify as moral philosophy :
Embrace reflection .
You can't unwind to emptiness , but you can bootstrap from a starting point .
Go on morally questioning the existence ( and not just appropriateness ) of emotions .
But do n't treat the mere fact of their having evolved as a reason to reject them .
Yes , I know that " X evolved " does n't seem like a good justification for having an emotion ; but do n't let that be a reason to reject X , any more than it 's a reason to accept it .
Hence the post on the Genetic Fallacy : causation is conceptually distinct from justification .
If you try to apply the Genetic Accusation to automatically convict and expel your genes , you 're going to run into foundational trouble — so do n't !
Just ask if the emotion is justified — do n't treat its evolutionary cause as proof of mere distortion .
Use your current mind to examine the emotion 's pluses and minuses , without being ashamed ; use your full strength of morality .
Judge emotions as emotions , not as evolutionary relics .
When you say , " motherly love outcompeted its alternative alleles because it protected children that could carry the allele for motherly love " , this is only a cause , not a sum of all moral arguments .
The evolutionary psychology may grant you helpful insight into the pattern and process of motherly love , but it neither justifies the emotion as natural , nor convicts it as coming from an unworthy source .
You do n't make the Genetic Accusation either way .
You just , y'know , think about motherly love , and ask yourself if it seems like a good thing or not ; considering its effects , not its source .
You tot up the balance of moral justifications , using your current mind — without worrying about the fact that the entire debate takes place within an evolved framework .
That 's the moral normality to which my yet - to - be - revealed moral philosophy will add up .
And if , in the meanwhile , it seems to you like I 've just proved that there is no morality ... well , I have n't proved any such thing .
But , meanwhile , just ask yourself if you might want to help people even if there were no morality .
If you find that the answer is yes , then you will later discover that you discovered morality .

INTUITIVE EQUALS FAMILIAR By Raskin , J . One of the most common terms of praise for an interface is to say that it is " intuitive " ( the word should have been " intuitable " but we will bow to convention ) .
Yet the Human Computer Interaction ( HCI ) literature rarely mentions the word , and for good reason .
This note attempts to clarify the meaning of " intuitive " for non-HCI specialists .
The impression that the phrase " this interface feature is intuitive " leaves is that the interface works the way the user does , that normal human " intuition " suffices to use it , that neither training nor rational thought is necessary , and that it will feel " natural . "
We are said to " intuit " a concept when we seem to suddenly understand it without any apparent effort or previous exposure to the idea .
In common parlance , intuition has the additional flavor of a nearly supernatural ability humans possess in varying degrees .
Given these connotations , it is as uncomfortable a term in formal HCI studies as it is a common one in non-technical publications and in informal conversation about interfaces .
As I learned from a talk given by Martin Marshall in Palo Alto ( at the May  94 BayCHI meeting ) , a number of commercial magazine - related " usability " labs that rate software qualities give 50 % of their weighting to User Satisfaction , 30 % to Productivity , and 20 % to Intuitiveness .
" Intuitiveness " in this context is considered to be a function of percentage of tasks completed and the number of help references made while in the very early stages of using a product .
There are occasional hints of the meaning of " intuitive " in the literature .
Stephen Oppenheimer , of the Review Board of InfoWorld magazine , noted in his review of Mathcad 4.0 that " The editing tools become increasingly intuitive over time . "
Similarly , Richard Collins in Flying ( October 1994 pg. 67 ) , speaking of a new aircraft navigation device , " Like anything , it can be learned , but it would take a lot of experience to do it intuitively . "
These uses of the term are uncharacteristic in that immediacy is normally an important aspect of " intuition " .
In the usual sense of the word , something cannot become intuitive over time , it is either intuitive or it is not .
What Oppenheimer is discussing is not intuition , but learning .
When the tools had been learned , he is saying , they became intuitive .
This is a strong clue as to the meaning of " intuitive . "
Many claims of intuitiveness , when examined , fail .
It has been claimed that the use of a computers mouse is intuitive .
Yet it is far from that .
In one of the Star Trek series of science fiction movies , the space ships engineer has been brought back into our time , where ( when ) he walks up to a Macintosh .
He picks up the mouse , bringing it to his mouth as if it were a microphone , and says : " Computer , ... "
The audience laughs at his mistake .
But that is just the whimsy of a screenwriter .
Or is it ?
I performed a deliberate experiment some years ago using one of the early Apple Macintosh computers .
I loaded a childrens program , The Manhole , where user interaction is strictly ( and cleverly ) limited to " clicking " on various places on an image .
Clicking consists of moving the cursor to some location on the screen by moving the mouse on a surface and momentarily pressing the only button on the mouse .
Clicking on certain places yields a new screen .
This cold description does not express the delight most people find in running The Manhole program , but that is not relevant here .
My subject was an intelligent , computer - literate , university - trained teacher visiting from Finland who had not seen a mouse or any advertising or literature about it .
With the program running , I pointed to the mouse , said it was " a mouse " , and that one used it to operate the program .
Her first act was to lift the mouse and move it about in the air .
She discovered the ball on the bottom , held the mouse upside down , and proceeded to turn the ball .
However , in this position the ball is not riding on the position pick - offs and it does nothing .
After shaking it , and making a number of other attempts at finding a way to use it , she gave up and asked me how it worked .
She had never seen anything where you moved the whole object rather than some part of it ( like the joysticks she had previously used with computers ) : it was not intuitive .
She also did not intuit that the large raised area on top was a button .
But once I pointed out that the cursor moved when the mouse was moved on the desks surface and that the raised area on top was a pressable button , she could immediately use the mouse without another word .
The directional mapping of the mouse was " intuitive " because in this regard it operated just like joysticks ( to say nothing of pencils ) with which she was familiar .
From this and other observations , and a reluctance to accept paranormal claims without repeatable demonstrations thereof , it is clear that a user interface feature is " intuitive " insofar as it resembles or is identical to something the user has already learned .
In short , " intuitive " in this context is an almost exact synonym of " familiar . "
Given this insight , the measure of intuitiveness used by the magazine usability labs is logical .
The percentage of tasks completed increases with increasing intuitiveness since it simply means that the user is already at least partially trained with respect to the feature or set of features under test .
Training tends to decrease the time required for task completion , especially at first .
Similarly , the number of times the user has to reference help screens increases with decreasing intuitiveness , that is , decreasing familiarity .
If the word " intuitive " is replaced by the more readily understood word " familiar " the criterion the magazines have established with respect to intuitiveness seems obvious .
The term " intuitive " is associated with approval when applied to an interface , but this association and the magazines  rating systems raise the issue of the tension between improvement and familiarity .
As an interface designer I am often asked to design a " better " interface to some product .
Usually one can be designed such that , in terms of learning time , eventual speed of operation ( productivity ) , decreased error rates , and ease of implementation it is superior to competing or the clients own products .
Even where my proposals are seen as significant improvements , they are often rejected nonetheless on the grounds that they are not intuitive .
It is a classic " catch 22 . "
The client wants something that is significantly superior to the competition .
But if superior , it cannot be the same , so it must be different ( typically the greater the improvement , the greater the difference ) .
Therefore it cannot be intuitive , that is , familiar .
What the client usually wants is an interface with at most marginal differences that , somehow , makes a major improvement .
This can be achieved only on the rare occasions where the original interface has some major flaw that is remedied by a minor fix .
The present rating systems of the magazines and the similar thinking of many users , managers , and marketers about products with significant human interface components serves to preserve the status quo , even when it can be shown that a feature that is completely familiar ( intuitive ) is deficient .
This tendency makes it more difficult for major advances in human interfaces to achieve commercial realization .
When I am able to present the argument given here that intuitive = familiar , I find that decision - makers are often more open to new interface ideas .
I suggest that we replace the word " intuitive " with the word " familiar " ( or sometimes " old hat " ) in informal HCI discourse .
HCI professionals might prefer another phrase : Intuitive = uses readily transferred , existing skills .
It would read very differently and more honestly if the magazines discussed above made it clear that ratings were based , for example , 50 % on user satisfaction , 30 % on productivity , and 20 % on familiarity .
Note that user satisfaction and early productivity ( long - term productivity , though of great importance to users , is not tested ) are strongly dependent on familiarity , so that the rating system is further flawed in not being built on a set of independent ( orthogonal ) bases : the three parameters tend to rise and fall together .
That quality of a new interface paradigm that is commonly titled " intuitive " may well turn out to be one of the worst qualities it can have .

As most of you will now know , I am living in New Zealand ( the place of my birth ) .
Before leaving the UK I decided that I would write a list specifically about my home land .
It has taken a while to get to it – but here it is !
Hopefully some of the other New Zealand readers will be able to contribute additional facts .
1 Facts 1 – 5
1 . While it is no longer the case , New Zealand was once governed as a part of the territory of New South Wales ( later a part of Australia ) .
When Australia federated in 1901 , New Zealand was offered a place as one of their states .
New Zealand refused and is its own country with no ties ( other than economic and commonwealth ) to Australia .
2 . A kiwi is not a fruit – it is New Zealand ’s native flightless bird ( pictured above ) and a slang term for a New Zealander .
Kiwis call the fruit “ kiwifruit ” – they are also known as Chinese Gooseberries .
3. New Zealand was the first major nation to have universal suffrage .
In 1893 it became legal for all male and female citizens of New Zealand to vote .
4. New Zealand was first discovered by Europeans in 1642 when Dutch sailor Abel Tasman arrived .
He left New Zealand after several of his crew were killed by Maoris , and it was not until 1769 that English Captain James Cook arrived and mapped the land .
5. Queen Elizabeth II is officially Queen of New Zealand .
She is represented in New Zealand by a Governor General , who ratifies all laws put before him or her by the elected parliament of New Zealand .
2 Facts 6 – 10
6. New Zealand is one of only three countries that have two official ( and of equal standing ) national Anthems .
The first is God Save the Queen ( the English National Anthem ) and the other is God Defend New Zealand .
The other two countries with two anthems are Denmark and Canada which both have a Royal Anthem and a State anthem .
7 . Another native bird of New Zealand ( the Moa ) was one of the largest birds in history – standing up to 3.6 m ( 12 foot ) tall and weighing 300 kg .
Unfortunately they were hunted to extinction by the Maoris by the end of the 1500s .
8 . When the Europeans arrived in New Zealand , it was already inhabited by the Maori people – Eastern polynesian settlers who arrived some time between 800 and 1300 .
Oral tradition says that they came from a place named Hawaiki ; its location is unknown .
The very strong linguistic connection to Cook Island Maori might suggest that they originated from that region of the Pacific .
9 . Another group of settlers ( who most likely came from the same group as the original Maoris ) settled on the Chatham Islands .
They were called the Morioris and they were pacifists .
In 1835 , groups of Maoris moved to the Chatham islands and wiped out nearly all of the Morioris – leaving only 100 by 1862 .
The last full - blooded Moriori ( Tommy Solomon ) died in 1933 .

10 . New Zealand was the first country to have its three top positions of power held simultaneously by women :
The Prime Minister ( Helen Clark ) , the Governor General ( Dame Silvia Cartwright ) , and the Chief Justice ( Sian Elias ) .
3 Facts 11 – 15
11 . New Zealand has a strong hold on the international trade in sheep meat .
There are presently around 9 sheep to every 1 human in New Zealand ( the population of New Zealand is 4 million ) .
12 . Wellington , the Capital City of New Zealand ( and home to me ! ) is the southernmost capital city in the world .
[ Image : Wellington City ]
13 . New Zealand was forced out of the ANZUS ( Australia , New Zealand , United States ) alliance in the 1980s when it outlawed nuclear arms and power .
To this day , there are no nuclear power stations in New Zealand , and a change of law would be required before one could be built .
New Zealand retains its military ties with the United Kingdom .
14 . New Zealand has one of the most liberal media arenas in the world .
Distinctly left wing versus right wing press is not as obvious there as in other nations .
15 . New Zealand is a plastic nation – almost all personal financial transactions are made with a card – credit or otherwise .
Most shops offer EFTPOS ( similar to the UK Chip and Pin which appeared two years later ) and cash is seen less and less .
It is possible that New Zealand was the first nation to offer this system of payment ( if someone can verify that I would appreciate it ) .
The majority of taxis now allow you to pay without cash through this system .
4 Facts 16 – 20
16 . New Zealand is a fairly liberal nation with homosexual marriage ( Civil Union ) being legal and prostitution , soliciting , and brothel keeping being legal .
The driving age is 15 , the consensual sex age is 16 , and the drinking age is 18 ( though minors accompanied by adults are allowed alcohol in restaurants ) .
17 . Lake Taupo ( one of New Zealand ’s most popular tourist destinations ) was the source of the largest known eruption in the world in the last 70 thousand years .
It had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8 .
It released over 530 cubit kilometers of magma .
[ Image : Lake Taupo ]
18 . New Zealand was the last major landmass to be populated ( with the exception of the polar regions ) .
19 . New Zealander and Nobel Prize Winner , Ernest Rutherford is known as the father of nuclear physics for his orbital theory of the atom .
20 . Sir Edmund Hillary – the first man to reach the peak of Mount Everest was a New Zealander ( born in Auckland ) and his face is on the New Zealand $ 5 bill .

Until last week , most economists were divided on whether the U.S. was in a recession or not .
Now , with the ailing mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the ropes , it 's clear that what 's unfolding is far worse than any recession .
As Britain 's normally staid The Telegraph newspaper notes , we could be on the verge of a new Great Depression .
That might seem far - fetched until you consider that last month , the Dow suffered its worst June since 1930 .
But The Telegraph is hardly alone in using such apocalyptic language these days .
The " D " word is starting to be mentioned more and more in the business media , as well as by economic commentators .
As David Bullock , managing director of investment fund Advent Capital Management , put it in a comment to The New York Times on Tuesday , " We are closer to the Depression scenario than not . "
Yes , a real Depression , complete with tent cities now springing up in what once were prosperous suburbs .
This doom - and - gloom language in describing the U.S. economy first began to pick up steam after investment bank Bear Stearns had to be bailed out by the government in May .
In describing the bailout , the Associated Press said that Bear Stearns was " On the verge of a collapse that could have shaken the very foundations of the U.S. financial system . "
The current crisis with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is infinitely larger than Bear Stearns .
The two companies either hold or guarantee a staggering $ 5.3 trillion worth of mortgages .
Indeed , the investment magazine MoneyWeek has noted that the crisis is big enough to doom the dollar .
As MoneyWeek notes : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might have been deemed too big to fail --- but who 's big enough to bail out the US ?
When investors start seriously asking themselves that question , expect the dollar to plunge .
Make no mistake , a catastrophic U.S. economic collapse is on the way .
Such is the inevitable fate of any Ponzi scheme economy that has been running on nothing more than smoke and mirrors ( and oceans of foreign capital ) now for many years .
Of course , those who are poor or working class know first - hand that the U.S. economy has been in increasingly serious trouble since around 1980 .
Wages have been steadily declining for everyone but the very rich .
And working class people now toil more hours for less pay than their counterparts in any other First World nation .
( They have to , as a 40 - hour workweek no longer is enough to put groceries on the table ) .
But as long as America had a tiny elite of prosperous super wealthy , we could always point to them and try to convince ourselves that our economy could n't be all bad .
After all , we would note , there are some people out there making a fortune .
All it takes is hard work and ambition , right ?
Today , with the stock market in the toilet , and the Fed having to step in to bail out the financial sector , it should be clear to anyone that the U.S. economy is in crisis .
If the U.S. economy actually produced anything of value , this would be nothing more than just another typical downturn in the economic cycle .
The problem is , the U.S. economy no longer produces anything of value .
Our economic activity basically consists of importing trillions of dollars from central banks in East Asia --- which we then use to prop up our Ponzi scheme economy .
The ocean of foreign capital that flows into our nation daily is used to pay for the shopping habits of U.S. consumers .
In fact , in recent years , the Great American Consumer has been hailed by U.S. economists as the " locomotive " of the world economy .
There was only one problem : U.S. consumers had zero savings and were depending on foreign capital to finance their shopping binges .
Now , with the stock market crisis and the ongoing housing mortgage crisis , nobody is in much of a mood to do any spending these days .
And with the dollar rapidly declining , it 's only a matter of time before the East Asian central banks start to unload their depreciating greenbacks ( which will accelerate the dollar 's fall even further in a vicious cycle ) .
The frightening thing is that East Asian central banks have n't even begun seriously dumping their dollars and yet the dollar is already plunging .
And the dollar has already lost an astonishing 40 percent against an index of U.S. trading partners ' currencies over the past seven years .
The key numbers which measure the current U.S. economic crisis are so far off the chart that it is difficult to even fathom them .
As economics writer Eamonn Fingleton has noted , the U.S. current account deficit ( the widest and most meaningful measure of our trade position ) now represents an astounding 6.5 percent of our gross domestic product .
As Fingleton notes , only one other major nation has ever exceeded this figure : Italy in 1924 .
That was just before Benito Mussolini seized dictatorial power .

TAMPA , Fla . --
The day after five members of Cuba 's under - 23 Olympic soccer team left their hotel with the intention of defecting , two more players disappeared Wednesday night .
Yendry Diaz told ESPN International on the phone that he and Eder Roldan also had left the Cuban team .
Diaz and Roldan are with friends in Tampa , but intend to join their fellow defector teammates in Lake Worth , Fla. , according to the Miami Herald .
The original five -- Jose Manuel Miranda , Erlys Garcia Baro , Yenier Bermudez , Yordany Alvarez and Loanni Prieto -- left Tuesday after a 1 - 1 draw against the United States in an Olympic qualifying tournament in Tampa .
The five already are in Lake Worth , a town north of Boca Raton , according to The Herald , which reached the players by phone Wednesday .
" ' We 're fine , calm , feeling hopeful about our new lives , " Bermudez told The Herald .
" Of course , we 're nervous because we 're young , have no family here , and we do n't yet know the way of life here , but we hope the Cuban and American communities will help us get started . "
Their first order of business when they got away from the hotel on Tuesday was to buy a cell phone , contact a lawyer -- and celebrate with a Cuban meal , according to The Herald .
" Of course , my heart will be in Cuba with my family , but I want to have the freedom to better my life , to play professional soccer , to be the best I can be , and for that we had to make this sacrifice , " Bermudez said in The Herald .
" The key now is to get the legal paperwork out of the way as quickly as possible so we can get on with our plans . "
Luiz Muzzi , general manager of United Soccer League club Miami FC , told The Herald that he was planning on hosting a tryout for them next week , after he was contacted by a friend of the players ' .
" I watched their game against the U.S. on TV , and I thought the Cuban team played very well , " Muzzi said .
" We were kind of scouting that game because anytime a Cuban team comes to the United States , there 's a chance someone might defect . "
Bermudez
told The Herald that he has contacted Lester More and Osvaldo Alonso for advice ; the two had defected in 2007 during the Gold Cup in Houston .
" They told us they 're happy for us , and that we have to be patient , but little by little , everything will work out , " Bermudez said in The Herald .
" Even though we are a little nervous , we know there is a very large community of Cubans here in South Florida , and that makes us feel more at home .
We hope to make them proud . "
An on - the - field consequence of the seven players ' desertion is that Cuba was forced to field a short - handed team in Thursday 's CONCACAF Olympic qualifier , which it lost to Honduras 2 - 0 in Tampa .
" It was a difficult result , " Cuban coach Raul Gonzalez said before leaving in the middle of his postgame press conference .
He was apparently upset with a question about the possible defection of an assistant coach .
" It was hard to play with 10 players .
That 's asking a lot .
But I
think we played well . "
Only 10 Cuban players were available Thursday night because in addition to the player desertions Roberto Linares was automatically suspended one game for receiving a red card in Tuesday 's game .
The Cuban delegation notified the Confederation of North , Central American and Caribbean Association Football earlier Thursday that the team would continue to participate in the tournament , CONCACAF general secretary Chuck Blazer said .
" CONCACAF has been notified by the head of the Cuban delegation that several players have left the team , " Blazer said .
" CONCACAF has no information on the location of the players or the circumstances surrounding their separation from the delegation . "
Cuban sports officials were stunned Thursday by the desertions .
" We feel really badly , " Antonio Garces of the Cuban Soccer Association told The Associated Press in a telephone interview .
Gonzalez on Thursday confirmed to ESPN Deportes that there was no security plan in place around the Cuban team to avoid defections .
The team was staying at the Doubletree Hotel Tampa Westshore Airport .
Zachary Mann , a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection , said it 's unlikely the agency will learn the men's whereabouts until they come forward .
The players likely would be granted political protection under the United States ' " wet foot , dry foot " policy that allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to obtain asylum .
Tampa police spokeswoman Andrea Davis said Wednesday the agency had not received any missing persons reports from the team , and officers were not called to the team 's hotel to investigate the disappearances

1. Xandros buys Linspire – What does it mean for Linux ?
Linspire owns the much touted CNR ( Click ' N Run ) software download mechanism for Linux that cuts across the different package formats for Linux distributions and claims to simplify installation of both free and commercial software packages .
Both are based , like Ubuntu , on Debian GNU / Linux , the ultimate community distribution of Linux , but neither have gained anything like the mind share of Ubuntu .
Both have tried to imprint a traditional software sales model on GNU / Linux .
Xandros has perfected the art of slotting into Windows networks through its development of BridgeWays and purchase of Scalix - the open source e-mail and groupware server based on HP OpenMail .
Linspire has been sold on OEM machines through WalMart in the United States .
Xandros makes a solid Linux distribution that has become the default operating system on the ASUS Eee PC , through which it can claim to have gained 1.5 million users .
Neither Xandros nor Linspire has won the hearts and minds of Linux users or developers .
Both are sold as Linux for the Windows user .
Both sell versions of GNU / Linux that are easy to install and use , and both have tried , with varying success , to break into the business and consumer desktop market that is currently owned by Microsoft .
Xandros bought Linspire the other day , and nobody really noticed .
The problem for Xandros and Linspire is that their primary market has been the OEM market for desktop users , a market that is locked by exclusionary contracts with Microsoft for Windows .
The success of the ASUS Eee PC may have changed perceptions , but even where Linux has been adopted by mainstream OEMS , such as HP or Dell , the more community conscious distributions , such as Ubuntu , have tended to win .
And the ASUS Eee PC may yet switch to Debian or Ubuntu .
The success of Ubuntu provides many lessons on how to succeed with free and open source software .
Ubuntu has street credibility where Xandros and Linspire have been left behind .
Where Xandros is sold in a box , Ubuntu is given away free .
Where Ubuntu is seen to donate code back to the community , Xandros and Linspire have developed proprietary extensions .
Where Ubuntu asks for manufacturers to free their drivers , Xandros and Linspire have signed patent covenants with Microsoft .
Being easy to install and easy to use is not enough .
The first lesson of " open source business " is that your first debt is to your user and developer communities , from which everything else grows .
OEMs will look first to the most popular alternative .
Corel island
Xandros has been with us since August 2001 , when it sprang from the ashes of Corel Linux , which had its own chequered history .
Linspire came into being when its previous incarnation , Lindows , was sued by Microsoft for breach of trademark .
Microsoft claimed Windows as a trademark and contended that Lindows infringed its trademark .
Lindows counter - sued to have the Windows trademark revoked since Windows is a generic English word .
Generic words can not be trademarked .
Microsoft settled out of court , and gave Lindows , now known as Linspire , $ 20 million in compensation .
In return Lindows surrendered its name , but also gained acres of free publicity at the expense of Microsoft , but the publicity failed to resonate with the community .
Xandros began life as Corel Linux .
Between 1996 and 1998 Corel , founded in 1985 and battered by competition in its key markets by Microsoft , had accumulated losses of $ 265 million .
Just as things seemed to be at their darkest , Michael Cowpland , the British founder and chief executive of the Canadian software company , unveiled a bold new strategy .
Corel was to become a Linux company , distributing its own version of Linux , establishing a new market for both WordPerfect and CorelDraw , the graphics software that had been the backbone of Corel 's business .
The purchase of WordPerfect was bold enough .
At one time WordPerfect was the undisputed king of word processing , but by 1994 its market share had begun to crash and burn .
That year Novell bought the word processor for the eye watering sum of $ 1.4 billion , but its fortunes did n't change , and eighteen months later Novell offloaded WordPerfect to Corel for the princely sum of $ 20 million in cash and $ US100 million in stock .
The rising star
By 1999 , Microsoft had over 90 per cent of the word processing / spreadsheet market , and WordPerfect Office had become a shadow of its former self , a perfectly competent office suite , just as good as Word / Excel , but overpowered by the marketing muscle and monopoly power of Microsoft .
Not many people think about what it 's like to be a bat , but for those who do , it 's enlightening and potentially groundbreaking for understanding aspects of the human brain and nervous system .
Cynthia Moss , a member of the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science program at the University of Maryland , College Park , Md. , is one of few researchers who spend time trying to get into the heads of bats .
Her new research suggests there is more to studying bats than figuring out how they process sound to distinguish environments .
Partially supported by the National Science Foundation , her research paper appears in the June 18 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" For decades it 's been recognized that a bat 's voice produces sounds that give the bat information about the location of objects , " says Moss .
" We 're now recognizing that every time a bat produces a sound there are changes in brain activity that may be important for scene analysis , sensorimotor control and spatial memory and navigation . "
The research could help neurobiologists understand mechanisms in the human brain and ultimately benefit human health , but that may not happen for some time as more research is needed .
Moss and her colleague , Nachum Ulanovsky from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel , reviewed more than 100 studies and determined the brief calls emitted through a bat 's mouth or nostrils and their returning echoes play a pivotal role in motor control and have other behavioral implications .
In short , echoes from a bat 's voice cause the bat to turn its head and ears , and give the bat 's brain a description of the scene .
The echoes also cue a bat 's memory about its environment so it can safely fly between points .
" Our review highlights new research findings suggesting that the bat 's vocal production does more than yield echoes , " says Moss .
" We 're learning every time the bat produces a vocalization , there are changes in brain activity that are essential to complex behaviors . "
For example , when a bat pursues prey , a moth or some other insect , it computes the 3D location of objects in its environment -- a tree , a wall or a lamppost -- from information carried by the echoes of high - pitched vocal chirps produced at rates of 2 -150 chirps per second .
Research shows it actually uses these echoes to remember details of the environment in which it operates , displaying a very sensitive spatial memory component .
The vocalizations tell the bat the horizontal and vertical positions of its prey from differences in the arrival time , intensity , and variety of echoes it receives .
It estimates target range from the time delay between the outgoing vocalization and returning echo .
It also uses its sonar system to assess the size of a target .
Finally , when zeroed in , it swoops down on its prey .
Researchers are able to draw correlations between how bats and humans process information to perform functions .
Both are mammals having the same basic brain organization , which leads to obvious comparisons .
According to Moss , bats engage in vocal - motor behaviors to generate signals to probe the environment , while some blind humans produce tongue clicks to generate sounds for echolocation .
Both bats and humans engage in so - called " motor behaviors " that shape their perceptions of the world .
A bat turns its head , moves its ears , and changes its flight path in response to echo information from the environment .
A human moves his eyes or turns his head to augment his perception of auditory and visual signals .
" All of these motor behaviors influence the animal 's perception and representation of the environment , " says Moss .
" But of interest to us is the idea that these vocal - motor behaviors contribute to environmental perception , memory , and spatial planning far beyond the processing of sound . "
" It may be that some of the information we learn from the bat gives us a window into understanding mechanisms of the human brain , " says Moss .
" But those outcomes are a little bit down the road . "

The two main opposition parties , the PPP of late PM Benazir Bhutto and the PML - N , led by another former PM , Nawaz Sharif , have a clear majority .
If they form a coalition with a two - thirds majority in parliament they could impeach Mr Musharraf .
The BBC's Chris Morris in Islamabad says Mr Musharraf has never looked weaker than he does today .
The full scale of the defeat inflicted on the pro-Musharraf PML - Q will become clearer during Tuesday as more results come in .
NATIONAL RESULTS SO FAR PPP ( Bhutto's party ) : 87 PML - N ( Nawaz Sharif ) : 66 PML-Q : ( pro-Musharraf ) 38 MQM ( Sindh - based ) : 19 ANP ( Secular Pashtuns ) : 10 Others : 38 Source : Geo TV
Whether the PPP and the PML - N decide to work together in a coalition remains to be seen .
Our correspondent says there is a great deal of political bargaining to come .
Unofficial and provisional results show big gains for Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto 's parties .
According to the website of the Geo private TV station , the PPP leads the tally with 87 seats , with the PML - N following with 66 seats .
This gives the two opposition parties a combined total of 153 seats in the parliament with some seats still to be declared .
PML - N leader Nawaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he hoped to work with other opposition parties to rid Pakistan of what he described as a dictatorship .
Whosoever wins we should accept it - that includes myself
President Musharraf
Analysis : Musharraf reeling Pakistani press upbeat
The pro-Musharraf PML- Q was a distant third , with 38 seats .
The chairman of the pro-Musharraf PML - Q party , Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain , told Associated Press Television News his party accepted the results " with an open heart " and was prepared to " sit on opposition benches " .
Several notable ministers in the government had lost their seats , while dramatic gains were made by some smaller parties .
In the North West Frontier Province , the Awami National Party , which campaigns for Pashtun nationalism , has defeated the Islamist incumbents .
Most official counts will not be declared until later on Tuesday .
Speaking earlier , Mr Musharraf had said : " The result will be the voice of the nation and whosoever wins we should accept it - that includes myself , " said Mr Musharraf .
Though he did not stand in the parliamentary election himself , correspondents say the clear defeat of his supporters has made his position more precarious .
President Musharraf has been a major US ally in the " war on terror " but his popularity has waned at home amid accusations of authoritarianism and incompetence .
His forces have been trying to contain a Taleban - influenced Islamist insurgency along the country 's rugged frontier with Afghanistan .
The election has been preceded by months of violence , including the suicide attack that killed PPP leader , Ms Bhutto , in December .
The poll was initially scheduled for early January but was delayed after her assassination .
Democratic mandate
Supporters of the PPP and PML - N were celebrating in the streets on Tuesday .
Leaders of both opposition parties had earlier warned the polls would be rigged in favour of the government .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I hope that this election is a positive step towards democracy , peace and economical growth Atif Majid , Kuwait
The next government will have to decide how it chooses to work with a president who has never had much time for politicians with broad popular support , our correspondent says .
Pakistani newspapers spoke of a " rout " of Mr Musharraf 's allies , with The News proclaiming : " Democracy takes revenge . "
One of Pakistan 's top lawyers who has been under house arrest for several months said he could already sense a wind of change after the election .
Aitzaz Ahsan told the BBC his police guards had left and his telephone landline had been reconnected .
He warned that the country 's lawyers may resume street protests if controversial Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , who was sacked in a row with Mr Musharraf , was not re-instated within weeks .
Mr Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 .
International pressure forced him to step down as army chief last year and the parliamentary election has been viewed as a key milestone along Pakistan 's path from military to civilian rule .
Fear of violence
At least 20 people are reported to have died in election - day violence , with the PPP reporting 15 of its members killed .
There were also some reports of missing ballot boxes .
But there was also widespread relief that there were none of the major bomb attacks which had marred the run-up to the election .
Fears of violence had dissuaded many of the country 's 80 million eligible voters from leaving their homes , and voter turnout was estimated to be less than 40 % .
Close to half a million security personnel , including about 80,000 soldiers , had been deployed to quell any outbreak of violence .

Graham Barker ’s Navel Fluff Collection
Some people see navel fluff or bellybutton lint as life ’s little annoyances .
Not Graham Barker : he began collecting them since 1984 , and now has the world ’s largest collection of navel fluff according to Guiness Book of World Records :
It was on the 17th of January 1984 that I found myself under - occupied in a youth hostel in Brisbane .
The night was steamy and stormy - too wet outside and too hot inside to do very much , and my attention drifted to my belly button .
There it was … fluff !
I must have seen it before that night , but this occasion was the first time I ever picked it out and wondered about it .
I became curious about how much navel fluff one person could generate ( enough to stuff a cushion , maybe ? ) , and the only way to find for sure was to collect it and see .
My first piece of navel fluff was stored in an empty film canister , and the collection had begun .

The Asphalt Museum is actually a real museum in a real building in Sacramento , California , but it ’s weird enough that we ’ll just have to include it on this list .
It has a large collection of ( you guessed it ) everything asphalt .
The museum was founded by Scott Gordon and Marie Vans in 1991 , while both attended Colorado State University .
In addition to asphalt “ samples ” from famous ( like Route 66 , Highway I , and the ancient Roman road Appian Way ) and not - so - famous roads , the museum also has a recipe on how to make your own asphalt : Link

12 . Nancy Alford ’s Mangles
What is a mangle ?
You ’ll be forgiven if you do n’t know what it is : a mangle is a cast iron contraption with two wooden rollers , a spring , and a side wheel with handle .
Its function is to wring clothes dry after you wash them , so obviously it ’s now obsolete with the invention dryers and all …
A few years ago , Nancy Alford was in a local department store when she saw , and fell in love with , a mangle .
For her sixteenth wedding anniversary , Nancy wanted ( and got ) - you guessed it , a mangle .
Her husband thought she was mad .
Since then , she has collected so many of them that they had to build a new house ( which she aptly named Mangleten ) to fit all her mangles .

13 . Victor Paul Taylor ’s Scratchcard Collection
Victor Taylor is a lotologist ( yes , a made up word meaning someone who collects lottery tickets ) .
He has a particular interest in “ Instants ” Scratchcards , produced by Camelot for the UK National Lottery .
As far as I can tell , none of the scratchcards have been scratched , so he ’s sitting on a potential goldmine worth bazillions !
Check out his incredibly detailed collection , which starts with the 1995 issues : Link
14 . Lydia ’s AOL CDs
Younger Neatorama readers may not be familiar with AOL CDs , but the rest of us surely remember getting spammed with tons of these discs from America Online .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , AOL produced over a billion CDs ( with over 1,000 distinct designs ) for its direct mail campaign .
The strategy was a huge success : AOL became the largest dial - up Internet Service Provider in the world ( for a while anyway ) .
After its fateful merger with Time Warner and the decline of dial - up as a mean of accessing the web , the company stopped producing the discs in 2006 .
But fear not .
Lydia of Lydia ’s AOL Disks shares with us her collection of over 2,500 unique AOL diskettes and CDs .

15 . Museum of Burnt Food
The Museum of Burnt Food is dedicated to accidentally burnt food , er … carbonized culinary masterpieces ( no intentionally burned artwork there ! ) .
The museum was founded by harpist Deborah Henson Conant , who recounted this tale :
The museum was founded in the late 1980 ’s one night when Deborah put on a small pot of Hot Apple Cider to heat , then received an unexpected . . . fascinating . . . and very long phone call .
By the time Deborah returned to the kitchen , the Cider had become a “ Cinder ” and thus the first , and perhaps still the most impressive , exhibit : “ Free Standing Hot Apple Cider ” was born .
SINCE THEN , countless other works have entered the museum , such as “ Thrice Baked Potato , ” “ Why Sure , You Can Bake Quiche in the Microwave , ” the indestructible “ Mmmm … … Soy Pups , ” and the lovely matching set of Pizza Toast .
Deborah has a tip on kitchen decorating , which I think everyone should heed : “ Never scrimp on fire extinguishers and smoke alarms . ”

16 . Steve Salcedo ’s Street Sign and Traffic Light Collection
From left to right : Auto Club of Southern California Stop Sign ( c. 1940 ) ; Children “ Wanted Alive ” sign , the equivalent of “ Slow - Children at Play ” sign ( c. 1950 ) ; “ T ” Intersection with Marble Reflector ( c. 1940 ) ; Eagle 4 - way 12 ″ Beacons ( c. 1930 )
Steve Salcedo ’s fascination with street signs and traffic lights began when he received a bulletin board about traffic signs when he was just a small boy .
Two years later , his collection was well under way .
Currently , Steve has over 350 street signs in his collection - all legal ( rescued from street departments before they were scrapped , purchased from antique stores , flea markets , etc. ) : Link
17 . The Chocolate Wrappers Museum
In 1996 , Martin Mihál ’s began collecting empty chocolate wrappers from around the world with a sizeable collection of 674 wrappers .
A decade later , his collection grew to an astounding 38,579 wrappers !
Martin has over 8,700 wrappers from Germany alone and even a few wrappers from far - flung countries like Oman and Uzbekistan .
So , the next time you eat a chocolate , think of Martin before you throw away the wrapper !

18 . Becky Martz ’s Banana Labels
In 1991 , Becky Martz first noticed banana labels when she put two bunches of bananas in the fruit bowl together .
She noticed that the “ Dole ” labels actually were n’t quite the same : one said Guatemala and the other said Honduras .
Later that year , she noticed a particularly festive Chiquita label and decided that she wanted to collect banana labels .
Today , Becky has more than 7,000 different banana labels and even branched out to collect asparagus and broccoli bands .
If you think that this is a strange hobby , well , … it is .
But Becky is n’t alone : there are others like her in the world , and they even have their own Banana Sticker Collector Convention .

19 . Museum of Talking Boards
The Museum of Talking Boards is all about collecting Ouija boards .
The site is quite neat : it explains the history of the board , theory as to how it works , as well as things you should never do or ask .
And , of course , it has a fantastic gallery of over 80 antique talking boards .
The board above is the original Ouija board , created by Elijah Bond and Charles Kennard and produced in 1891 by Kennard Novelty Company .

21 . Dr. Val Kolpakov ’s Toothpaste Collection
Dr. Val Kolpakov is a practicing dentist in Saginaw , Michigan , so it ’s only natural that he has an unnatural affinity to toothpaste .
Starting in 2002 , Dr. Val began collecting toothpaste from around the world .
His website , Toothpaste World , categorizes toothpastes according to location , brand name , and year of production .
Right now , he has over 1,400 items : Link
I ’d be remiss if I did n’t share with you a toothpaste trivia from Dr. Val ’s website .
Here ’s the world ’s oldest known formula for toothpaste :
The world ’s oldest - known formula for toothpaste , used more than 1,500 years before Colgate began marketing the first commercial brand in 1873 , has been discovered on a piece of dusty papyrus in the basement of a Viennese museum .
In faded black ink made of soot and gum arabic mixed with water , an ancient Egyptian scribe has carefully described what he calls a “ powder for white and perfect teeth ” .
When mixed with saliva in the mouth , it forms a “ clean tooth paste ” .
According to the document , written in the fourth century AD , the ingredients needed for the perfect smile are one drachma of rock salt - a measure equal to one hundredth of an ounce - two drachmas of mint , one drachma of dried iris flower and 20 grains of pepper , all of them crushed and mixed together .
The result is a pungent paste which one Austrian dentist who tried it said made his gums bleed but was a “ big improvement ” on some toothpaste formulae used as recently as a century ago .

British Anzani Lawnrider ( c. 1960 )
The tireless curators of the British Lawnmower Museum , Brian and Sue Radam , dedicate their lives to preserving the best example of British engineering prowess : the lawnmower !
The lawnmower was invented in 1827 by English engineer Edwin Beard Budding , who wanted a superior alternative to the scythe .
He took a machine designed to cut the knap off cloth and used it to cut grass instead .
At the time , people thought that he was mad , so he tested his invention in the middle of the night so no one could see him !
The British Lawnmower Museum ’s now has over 200 vintage lawnmowers and part of 400 others : Link

25 . Museum of Hoaxes
I ’m going to end this long list with Neatorama pal Alex Boese ’s excellent website : Museum of Hoaxes .
Alex Boese probably has the strangest collection of them all : he collects stories about and examples of scams and hoaxes !
In 1997 , Alex created the Museum of Hoaxes as research notes for his doctoral dissertation , and the website quickly became popular .
So much so that Alex the “ hoaxpert ” wrote three books which we have featured on Neatorama before : The Museum of Hoaxes , Hippo Eats Dwarf , and Elephants on Acid And Other Bizarre Experiments .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Pentagon has agreed to cut from its budget $ 171 million to build police stations in Iraq after demands from Congress that the Iraqi government spend its recent oil windfall on reconstruction projects .
Iraqi employees attend the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in Najaf , Iraq , on March 15 .
In a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee released Tuesday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote that he had heard senators ' concerns " loud and clear " during hearings earlier this month .
As a result , he wrote , " We will seek full funding from the government of Iraq for this purpose . "
The amount is a fraction of the roughly $ 47 billion Congress has approved to rebuild Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
But Democrats and Republicans have complained that American taxpayers are continuing to pay for reconstruction work in Iraq when crude oil prices , now nearing $ 120 a barrel , have left the country 's U.S. - backed government reaping a budget surplus in the tens of billions of dollars .
" It 's not enough , but it 's an important step , " said Sen. Carl Levin , D - Michigan , the Armed Services Committee chairman .
Levin said Gates acknowledged that " there 's gonna have to be changes made , " and called the Pentagon chief 's actions an " important first step . "
" It 's a significant message to the Iraqis that there is a lot of pressure from the American people , from the Congress , to stop spending a lot of money in Iraq for things the Iraqis can pay , " said Levin .
He raised the issue earlier this month during hearings on the now - widely unpopular war .
Sen .
Mel Martinez of Florida , a Republican member of the committee , said Iraqis should pay as much of the cost of the war " as they possibly can afford . "
" I think it 's time to take the training wheels off when it comes to money , " he said .
The money Gates is redirecting came from the Defense Department 's budget for 2007 .
He told the committee the remaining $ 439 million in reconstruction project funds should continue , arguing those projects " present a critical opportunity " to make improvements in war - torn neighborhoods and develop the capacity of Iraqi security forces .
" These initiatives will enhance Iraqi Army and Air Force capabilities that will , in turn , further enable our own transition of mission , " he wrote .

All About U.S. Department of Defense • Iraq War • Oil Prices • The Pentagon
By Fred Feldman
June 28 , 2008 -- I am responding to ``Of Pay and Productivity : Is Cuba Done With Equality ? '' , an article by Moshe Adler , director of Public Interest Economics , which appeared in the June 20 Counterpunch ( a radical monthly print and daily webzine based in the US . )
The article deals with the latest modifications of the country 's wage structure made public June 11 .
I think it would be useful if I presented some general considerations , despite what I admit is a broad but rather too shallow knowledge of the Cuban Revolution .
I have never been in the country , for example .
My knowledge of Spanish has grown quite a bit in the recent period , so that I can plough through shorter Spanish - language articles with a dictionary in hand , but it is still in the poquito range .
I have to thank Helen Yaffe , Saul Landau and others whose contributions reflect their more extensive and intimate knowledge of Cuba .
This has already significantly improved my information level .
I have given a lot of thought to the Adler article , and I think my comments may help inspire further and more focused information , discussion and debate .
My focus is on the debate , to the extent to which it occurs , on the left , and the broader poliical and even theoretical issues that are posed .
Effect of media exaggerations
The debate is influenced by the widespread lack of information about Cuba combined with the misrepresentation of what was happening in the US capitalist media .
The misrepresentation includes truly bizarre declarations of " fact " .
The New York Times began its initial report on the new wage incentive with the statement that this was the first radical change in the Cuban wage structure since 1959 , when Castro decreed that all Cuban workers would receive the same wage .
This is a complete fantasy .
No such decree was ever issued , and there have been many changes in the wage structure as significant as this one .
An Agence France Presse article claimed , ``For years the pay for street sweepers and brain surgeons has been separated by just a few dollars a month .
'' An urban legend , pure and simple .
Personally , I find nothing objectionable about a street sweeper and a brain surgeon getting the same pay , but no country in the world is , has been or is likely soon to be close to this situation .
The fact that in Cuba , a street sweeper and a brain surgeon will both have a place to live , that their families will not suffer from malnutrition , have competent medical care , and that they and their children will be literate and have educational opportunities does not mean they are paid at basically the same rate .
They are not .
Of course , it is characteristic of US society and US mainstream journalists that they find something terribly wrong when the gap is at the relatively -- relatively -- modest Cuban level .
I have noticed that such claims in the ignorant big - business media about the level of wage and salary equality in Cuba had a real impact of the discussion , heightening fears about what might be coming in a Raulista new order .
As a bourgeois economist , Adler might seem quite peripheral to a discussion among supporters of socialism and the Cuban Revolution .
But he is genuinely sorrowful about the sad fate awaiting the Cubans as a result of this wage reform .
Nothing less than the restoration of capitalism and social catastrophe .
This sorrowful mood does find an echo among those friends of Cuba who are alarmed by the current shifts .
I want to admit my own biases .
I love the Cuban Revolution and have learned to love it more with the passage of time .
I have learned to respect the opinions of the leaders who , though far from perfect in their judgment unlike my infallible self , have managed with considerable skill and thoughtfulness overall in a wide variety of challenging situations .
As a result the revolution , as a revolution based on the people not the interests of a clique or caste of top officials , has survived longer than any of this kind in history .
So I approach their actions with a certain respect .
I keep my critical faculties alive alert but also try to arm myself against knee - jerk " revolutionary " reactions stemming from my own political training ( far from all bad in my opinion ) .
More importantly , I keep in mind my lack of knowledge of the details wherein , scientists like to say , God dwells .
Also , I do n't claim to know the future , as Adler and others do .
Pro-capitalist course in Cuba ?
Adler begins with a ringing proclamation :
" The Communist Party of Cuba has seen the light ; it has just announced that from now on wages in Cuba will not be determined by the government , which kept them nearly equal , but by workers ' productivity . "
Exciting , no ?
But he does n't stop there :
" Of course , since it was the Party itself that made this change , ideologically this is as momentous as the fall of the Berlin Wall . "
Hot puppies !
This proclamation of a world - historic shift is based on a statement that is factually inaccurate .
The Cuban government has not surrendered control of wages to the market , to productivity statistics , or to anything else .
The Cuban government proclaimed the new wage incentive for increasing production .
If they concluded this was not was called for , they could rescind it tomorrow .
This measure does not abandon government direction in regard to wages and can be modified by the government as and when it thinks best .
In almost any capitalist country today , this wage decree by a government would be considered intolerable micromanagement , not as the surrender of all control .
End of equality as social goal ?
" That this is an ideological defeat for equality and for communism there can be no doubt , " writes Adler .
Does the measure overturn a condition of near - complete equality which existed up till now ?
No .
Nor does it reverse the long - term course toward equality in Cuba , which continues to advance in some rather important areas such as women 's and gay rights ?
Again , no .
There is a general misunderstanding of what the term " equalitarianism " means in Cuban economic debates .
The term is not a new one there .
This refers to efforts to prioritise creating immediate simon - pure equality above everything else that is needful , regardless of the real practical social or economic consequences .
This can actually have destructive and demoralising consequences in a transitional ( still far from fully socialist or communist ) society .
It can obstruct the needs of social development that advances in a socialist direction , which alone can create the possibility of a world without economic inequality .
Che and material incentives
In that sense , Che Guevara also used the term , in contrast to the portrayals of him in the capitalist media and sometimes on the left as a simon - pure utopian " equalitarian " .
Another view falsely attributed to Che is that " material incentives do n't work " .
In a letter to the Guardian , Helen Yaffe neatly punctures the myth of wage equality in Cuba , as well as the misrepresentation of Che Guevara that identifies him with this fictional Utopia .
She points out that the real revolutionary Cuba was different and had to be :
" In reality , there has never been an `egalitarian wage system ' ( i.e. one where every worker was paid the same ) : Che Guevara himself devised a new salary scale , introduced in 1964 , with 24 different basic wage levels , plus a 15 % bonus for over - completion .
This scale -- which I studied during my research in Cuba on Che 's work as minister of industries -- linked wages to qualifications , creating an incentive to training , which was vital given the exodus of professionals and low educational level of Cuba 's workers ...
" The new pay regulations were introduced to standardise salary policy across the economy as part of the general implementation of the economic management system operating in army enterprises since 1987 .
Capped or not , bonus payments in Cuba are awarded for outperforming the national plan in the production of physical goods or services .
Your article did not mention the fact that these payments remain capped at 30 % of salary for various bureaucrats , technicians and economists -- a measure to prevent the emergence of a technocratic elite .
" The new salary incentives -- to increase internal production and productivity , particularly in agriculture and exports -- reflect Cuba 's push to reduce vulnerability to the global food price crisis , rather than a return to capitalism . "
Cuba is still on road to greater equality .
The incentive pay increase need not mark , in and of itself , a radical expansion of the current wage differentiations in the working class , nor make stratification of the working class in particular or the society in general radically wider and more explosive .
The trend may well be toward a general increase in wages and living standards , stemming in part from a rise in productivity .
I believe that is the aim of this measure , and I hope it is the result .
There is no necessary tendency of the wage incentive to divide the working class along hostile lines , as in incentives to intensified and more efficient labor can and do in the United States .
In Cuba , increased production and relative prosperity has consistently tended to strengthen the oppressed , not the oppressor .
Whether fundamental inequality will deepen or decrease in the next period will depend ultimately on whether the benefits of a rise in productivity , if the Cubans are able to achieve this as they intend , are socially shared rather than concentrated in the hands of individuals .
The whole Cuban tradition in better times and worse says that the former will be the case .
Unlike in the United States and other imperialist countries , where we have to live with the fact that when we produce for capital -- which we must do to live and raise families -- everything we produce goes into the hands of our class enemy and strengthens their hand against us .
They own the means of production , they hire us to work them , they own the goods we produce , and they reap the profits of our labour .
The wage incentive decreed by the Cuban government seems to me to be considerably less stratifying in its effects by far than the tourist industry and remittances from the United States , not to mention the period of " dollarisation " , have been .
These were all measures imposed on Cuba by economic difficulties that could not be evaded .
( I am leaving aside here the political advantages of tourism for the Cuban Revolution internationally , which I think are significant . )
Why workers need material incentives
Why are material incentives a necessary component of planning for such a society ?
Because the working people , even though the capitalists have been thrown out of power , still must live by the sweat of their brow .
And I might add , in a well ordered society , intensified labour can be recognised as costing more to produce .
The purpose of the incentive in this case is an elementary but perfectly legitimate one -- to inspire workers by a modest , uncorrupting ( in my opinion ) incentive to intensify their labour , take better care of their machines , and so on .
This is an attempt to move the working class , the agricultural workers and the society as a whole ( not just individual model workers ) away from the truly demoralising and corrupting " they pretend to pay us , we pretend to work " mentality .
This has social roots in the conservative administration of factories , and became the norm in the former Soviet and Eastern European post - capitalist societies .
The " they pretend to pay us , we pretend to work " mentality was institutionalised in the Soviet and Eastern European post - capitalist societies in their last decades , ultimately stemming from the officialdom 's need to pacify and live - and - let - live with the workers under their thumbs .
But it also affects revolutionary societies like Cuba which for long periods have had to grind away at a relatively low subsistence level , which can pass for " equality " when viewed from the outside .
To yield to it is to accept the perspective of eternal stagnation .
This is certainly not necessary or inevitable in Cuba .
There are , of course , those counterpose material incentives ( bad ) to moral and social and internationalist incentives ( good ) , and who attribute their preconception to Che Guevara .
But this " incentive " is linked organically to the perspective that their work can better the conditions of all ; that it can make their country stronger ; that increasing the productivity of labour will strengthen the position of their country in the world relative to the imperialist enemies ; that it will make Cuba a more effective contributor to the advancing process of economic social , political and diplomatic change , integration and unification in Latin America ; and the simple fact that Cuba 's unprecedented commitment to provide universal education and medical care cannot be sustained over time without a growing productivity of labour .
It is also linked to the victory , the advance the Cuban Revolution won in surviving and even going forward in some respects in the " special period " .
This was the catastrophic economic situation and potentially ruinous political situation caused by the disintegration and disappearance of the Soviet bloc to which Cuba had been economically and politically allied .
Have the Cubans become bourgeois economists ?
Adler insists that the Cuban leadership has " fallen for the fallacy that the wages in market economies are determined by productivity " .
There are two unexamined givens here for the price of one .
First , that the wage incentive demonstrates a decision to imitate the methods of " market economies " .
Aside from his insistence on the world - shaking significance of the adoption of this wage incentive , no evidence is provided .
The other unexamined given in Adler 's assertion is that the Cuban leaders believe that wages in capitalist societies are determined by productivity .
No evidence beyond the mere fact of the wage incentive is presented to support this .
But Raul Castro and other Cuban leaders are quite insistent that they are Marxists .
And Marx explained that wages are determined in capitalist societies by the cost of reproduction of labour power ( that is , of workers ) , as affected by such factors of the as the relationship of forces in the class struggle , and ( in imperialist countries ) the added flexibility the ruling classes gain by raking in super - profits from around the world .
There is plenty of evidence that the Cuban leaders take Marx 's analysis more seriously than Adler , who does n't consider it at all .
( His economic concepts apparently begin and end with Ricardo , the great British economist of the early 19th century .
Marx learned much from Ricardo but surpassed him by analysing the workings of capital from the standpoint of the exploited class in struggle . )
Adler vs. Marx on workers as producers
Adler believes that the whole idea that the productivity of labour can be increased is a fallacy , and that attempting this in Cuba must lead to catastrophe :
" As economist David Ricardo explained some two hundred years ago , the very idea of `worker productivity ' is a hollow concept .
Not only can a worker 's productivity not be measured , it can not even be defined .
" Ricardo pointed out that production is normally performed by workers who work not with their bare hands but with machines , producing not a whole product but instead performing only one step in a production process that has many .
Therefore , Ricardo explained , a worker 's productivity cannot be separated either from the productivity of the machine that she works with , or from the productivity of the rest of the workers in the production process .
When a skyscraper goes up , how much of a building would there be with only a crane operator but no crane , or with only crane and operator but no workers to pour the concrete ?
The workers and machines together form a team , and measuring the productivity of the team is easy . "
( Not having studied Ricardo , I cannot vouch for the accuracy of Adler 's version of his theory . )
Adler argues that worker productivity cannot be measured because in production , human beings work as team members with other beings called machines .
Who can tell what the human produces and what the machine produces ?
As the King of Siam says in The King and I , " Tis a puzzlement ! "
Except in Marx , of course .
He explains it almost from the get - go .
And his argument , in this case , is readily comprehensible from the standpoint elementary commonsense and natural materialism .
Unlike other arguments Marx's , which -- though generally equally correct -- run counter to the ordinary appearance of things .
Human labour produces machines .
Machines are not beings , but simply products of human labour -- in many ways the central , most indispensable products of human labour today .
They are produced by workers , labouring farmers and artisans .
Everything that is not produced by nature ( including by non-human animals ) is produced by human beings .
Machines produce nothing , except as tools created and utilised by human beings for the purpose of enabling human beings to produce more with less effort .
A part of the machine 's power is expended in producing each product , and as a result a portion of the cost of production of the machine enters into the cost of production of each item produced by the human labourer utilising the machine ..
And that 's that .
The machine has no productivity as such , only as an instrument for use in human production .
It is created by human production to serve human purposes .
Of course , if the point ever comes where machines become producers and creators in their own right , I will be all for welcoming R2D2 and C3PO into trade unions , explaining to them socialist views on everything from the Cuban Revolution to Cynthia McKinney and Barack Obama .
I will be glad to enroll them in a revolutionary international movement , and fight side by side with them against the Dark Side .
But until that actually happens , I think that Marx 's approach works better than Adler's .
Working people , not machines , are the producers of goods , including machines .
The power of machines to contribute to production is a human product , as are the goods that human beings produce with machines as their tools .
Importance of labour productivity
So labour productivity exists ( unlike machine productivity ) and is measurable .
Today in capitalist countries it gets measured in the interests of the capitalists , and workers find the time and motion specialist standing over their shoulder , looking for ways to squeeze more out of them to enrich the boss .
But after a socialist revolution , the productivity of labour remains a key guideline of how far forward the new society has gone and can go .
The increase in the productivity of labour is one of the central material forces for progress .
And without a growing productivity of labour , socialism and communism would never be attainable .
So when the Cuban government attempts to measure the productivity of labour and seeks ways to improve it , this should not be taken as evidence that they have turned against the labouring majority that brought them to power and keeps them there .
Cuba 's grim future , according to Adler
Adler concludes : ``Since productivity is not measurable , how is the Communist Party of Cuba likely to implement its plan to pay workers according to their productivity ?
Having fallen for the fallacy that the wages in market economies are determined by productivity , the Party will probably observe the pay differentials that exist in the West and implement them at home .
What 's in store for Cuba is the standard menu that comes with wage inequality , including poor public education but first - rate private schools , insufficient or no health care for the majority but excellent medical care for CEOs and government officials , a substantial increase in the length of the working day , with fewer vacations and job insecurity to boot . "
Wow !
Talk about how great oaks from little acorns grow !
The alleged acorn in this case being the proffering of a modest wage increase to encourage increases in labour productivity .
And the great oak being the destruction of public education , the elimination of universal medical care , growing illiteracy , a declining life span for the people , mass poverty and so on !
And no need to show how any of this comes about , let alone why it must come about !
( If Adler is right , I fear I will be duty bound to refuse my next annual pay increase , due in April .
Twenty - five cents an hour , $ 8 dollars a week , about $ 34 a month -- pretty much comparable to the Cuban wage incentive .
After all if a wage increase in a revolutionary , anti-capitalist , relatively equalitarian country like Cuba must have such catastrophic consequences , imagine what the consequences of a wage increase in the much more reactionary imperialist environment in the United States must be -- fascism , world war and the holocaust at least .
Let the boss have the quarter .
I do n't know about the rest of my co-workers but I do n't want those things on my conscience . )
But I think the matter can be presented more accurately in the opposite way .
The advanced and still advancing systems of medical care and universal public education in Cuba require a growing productivity of labour .
Socialist goodwill on the part of the leaders or the masses is not enough , and stagnation will not do .
If the conditions of the " special period " had gone on indefinitely these revolutionary social institutions would have begun to fray and disintegrate along with the revolution itself .
But Cuba survived the special period politically , socially and economically .
Events -- particularly in Latin America -- have sharply reduced the relative isolation that affected Cuba after the fall of the Soviet bloc , and opened up new prospects and perspectives for the revolution .
It takes more than positive ideals and ethics to create a socialist society .
The possibility of a socialist future for the world was opened up in part by the increase in the productivity of labour represented by the creation and rise of the modern working class .
And worldwide , further increases in the productivity of labour , oriented in a quite different social direction , are needed if socialism is to be won .
( And only human beings can increase productivity in industry and agriculture -- if you ask a machine to do it , however politely and whether with moral , material or mixed incentives , nothing will happen . )
Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Raulista Cuba
Mikhail Gorbachev took some measures like these in the Soviet Union at the beginning of his regime .
I did n't find the measures at that initial point wildly objectionable either .
But the context proved to be all important .
The Russian Revolution was one in which the forward drive of the workers and peasants as governing classes was decisively pushed back from the mid-1920s to the 1930s .
A caste of officials took command of the state , and the party was purged of all revolutionary - minded elements .
The non-capitalist state survived with sharp ups and downs , but beginning in the late 1960s , stagnation and decay became the norm in the government and economy and profound demoralisation took hold among the people .
By the time Gorbachev took power , matters had come to a pass where neither moral nor material nor social incentives could move things forward .
Could you imagine appealing to the workers to produce more based on ideals or the future of socialism in those years ?
In Cuba , however , the revolution is alive , a tribute to the capacities and revolutionary dedication of the leaders as well as the masses .
The people are different .
The leadership is different .
The morale is different .
In Cuba , a combination of material , moral and social and political incentives has the potential to continue the forward motion .
In some respects , it was one such combination that brought them through the very difficult " special period " after the collapse of their Soviet bloc allies .
Cuba is not turning away from socialism
Cuba is not ceasing to be socialist .
First of all , Cuba has not achieved socialism , and therefore cannot cease to be socialist .
The Cuban Revolution is socialist in the national - class - social character of the revolution , the government , and in the aspirations and goals of much of the population .
The nationalisation of the factories and other industries and resources has given the people an important weapon for defending and advancing their interests and their perspective .
I see no sign that this is being abandoned .
Is Cuba abandoning moral and social incentives ?
Are the internationalist missions of Cuban doctors , teachers and others are being abandoned ?
Is there any evidence that Cuban doctors and teachers routinely demand bribes for their services , as happened in the Soviet bloc ?
Or is Cuba giving up on internationalist support to countries that stand up to imperialism , especially those that undertake progressive social changes as well ?.
The army , though substantially draftee , remains from all reports highly motivated politically and socially , and internationalist in outlook .
The officers and ranks are not concerned only about their own material benefits .
Willingness to sacrifice , including their lives , for the defence of the revolution seems to me to be widespread in the working class , the agricultural sector , the working class and the intelligentsia .
Cuba , though no communist utopia by any means , remains a long , long way from a dog - eat - dog society , including with the new organisation of wages .
But Cuba cannot and will not reach socialism under present world circumstances .
The revolution must hold the fort and gain more ground as best the Cubans can until more allies and participating countries can be won for the cause .
That is the context of these changes , which seem moderate and reasonable to me , and seem to have been greeted favourably by the working people of the country .
Of course , whether these moves will have the desired results is another question .
That involves many questions , not least the parlous condition of the world capitalist economy and the fate of the national salvation , anti-imperialist and social transformations being attempted in a growing number of Latin American countries .
Cuba is capable of standing alone for a long time .
But things will surely be much better if they are less and less isolated instead .
If the new measures turn out to be flawed or imperfect , well , they can be corrected , adjusted , reversed or extended -- whatever is needed for the preservation of Cuba as a revolutionary state and society in an imperialist - dominated world .
I tend to think that the masses can make themselves heard in Cuba through many formal and informal channels ( more formal channels would be good , in my opinion ) .
And I am convinced that their leadership has the revolutionary conviction and capacity to correct errors if that proves to be needed .

He blew away the field at the Kentucky Derby .
He made the Preakness field look like circus ponies .
But on the day that would solidify his legacy and give racing a respite from intense scrutiny , Big Brown crumbled .
He crumbled so badly that one could legitimately wonder whether he was nothing but a chemical horse , a paper tiger propped up  and propelled  by steroids .
After three months of dominance , Big Brown became the first Triple Crown hopeful to finish dead last at the Belmont Stakes .
His jockey , Kent Desormeaux , said that heading into the final turn , when he called on Big Brown to give him that special reserve , he realized , “ I had no horse . ”
The racing public has the right to ask :
Did he ever have a super horse ?
On Friday , the trainer Rick Dutrow told reporters that he had not given Big Brown a shot of the anabolic steroid Winstrol since before the Kentucky Derby and would not use it Saturday at the Belmont .
Earlier , Dutrow admitted that he gave Big Brown and all his other horses shots of Winstrol on the 15th of each month .
He said he did not know what it did .
A day that the troubled racing industry hoped would temporarily focus attention on a historic achievement wound up raising more questions about the horse and the industry .

I ’m in love with my new Modernist Cuisine at Home cookbook ( thanks Mom ! ) and learning many things about equipment and specialty foods .
It also prompted me to buy my new favorite kitchen item : a Fagor Duo Pressure Cooker .
This thing is magical and is going to transform the way I cook .
Tamales ?
Done. 20 minutes .
Pork so tender it shreds upon stirring ?
30 minutes .
Why did I not buy one of these sooner ?!
After hours of poring over the cookbook I chose a Mexican theme .
I was drawn to the corn tamales recipe made with masa and lard .
At my local Mexican market I discovered they only sell lard in 10 pound buckets , but I had a tub of duck fat in my fridge ( duck fat popcorn ! ) and used that instead .
The trick is to really whip the fat so it ’s light and airy and blend fresh corn into the masa , which gives it a deep , layered flavor .
Decadent and delicious .
Because I managed to find store bought achiote paste and skipped the process of making the stock , the carnitas were very easy to prepare .
I simply pressure cooked the meat in the broth and then stirred in the annato - based seasoning .
The recipe for the “ Refried ” Bean Foam looked a little iffy as it only called for 1 2/3 cups liquid and a cooking time of one hour .
Sure enough , the first batch of beans were burnt to a crisp .
Luckily I had time to try again – this time with copious amounts of water .
Also , after the beans were cooked and blended there were still large chunks of tough bean skin that I knew would n’t make it through the whipping siphon .
So I added a step of pressing the puree through a fine sieve before it went into the canister .
So basically , this recipe was crap , but with a few modifications it turned out great .
I rounded out the meal with my favorite Caesar salad with buttery croutons .
The dinner was a huge success and I can’t wait to cook more from this book … next up might be a chicken wing party .
Aside from the expected drivel and boilerplate rhetoric , the testimony of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker before Congress on Tuesday had a few surprises .
Yes , we all know the administration ’s line : the " surge " is working , all ’s well , oh sure , more needs to be done but etc. , etc. , ad nauseam .
What I sense , however , is a shift away from the alleged " threat " posed by al - Qaeda in Iraq  which does n’t seem to be much of a factor anymore , according to the testimony of these two principals  and toward identifying the " real " enemy , the actual target of this administration ’s latest war plans : Iran .
This came out early on in the general ’s testimony , as he laid the blame for the recent violence in Basra at Tehran ’s feet :
" The recent flare - up in Basra , southern Iraq , and Baghdad underscored the importance of the ceasefire declared by Moqtada al - Sadr last fall as another factor in the overall reduction in violence .
Recently , of course , some militia elements became active again .
Though a Sadr stand - down order resolved the situation to a degree , the flare - up also highlighted the destructive role Iran has played in funding , training , arming , and directing the so - called Special Groups and generated renewed concern about Iran in the minds of many Iraqi leaders .
Unchecked , the Special Groups pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq . "
It used to be that the Sunni " dead enders , " as Donald Rumsfeld called them , were the face of the enemy in Iraq .
Then the administration very quickly learned that in order to sell the war to the American people , they had to somehow connect it to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Osama bin Laden , and so al - Qaeda in Iraq  a group that never existed prior to the invasion  was given top billing .
But what are these " Special Groups " who have suddenly stolen the limelight ?
Supposedly they are armed " rogue " elements of the various party militias that have been funded and trained by Iran , and  significantly  Lebanon ’s Hezbollah organization , to carry out terrorist activities in Iraq , and , presumably , kill American and Iraqi government soldiers .
An elaborate demonology has grown up in the War Party ’s circles to buttress this shaky and ill - defined concept : go here , here , and here to examine its many twists and turns .
This narrative is a variation on the Israeli worldview , which sees all the various Muslim and pan-Arabist groups in the region as essentially tentacles leading back to the same octopus head .
What it really boils down to , however  and this came out in the hearings , particularly in the questioning by Senators Barbara Boxer and Barack Obama  is the all - pervasive influence of the Iranians in Iraqi politics .
This is the administration ’s main complaint , and a major talking point of the Crocker - Petraeus dog - and - pony show .
Yet this raises an important question : why , after all , should the Iranians be funding terrorist attacks on the Iraqi government , when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is being received in Baghdad with hugs and kisses and our own president has to land in the dead of night , out of fear for his safety ?
The current leaders of the Iraqi government spent years in Tehran as the guests of the mullahs  who were funding , training , and providing sanctuary to the exile groups that eventually became the government of Iraq in the post - Ba’athist era .
Both the Badr Brigade and the Da’wa Party  the two major components of the ruling coalition  set up headquarters in Tehran before the " liberation " and received ( and continue to receive ) extensive funding and military aid from the Iranians .
So how are they different from these so - called Special Groups ?
The answer , quite simply , is that they are n’t all that different .
Both are Shi’ite .
Both are vying for power .
The only difference is that they belong to rival gangs , like the Crips and the Bloods .
And that ’s why our troops continue to die in Iraq , day after day , along with untold numbers of Iraqis : the wrong gang , by our lights , has the upper hand in Iraq , and if we leave they ’ll be in power instead of our chosen thugs .
This hearing underscored why public support for the war has steadily eroded , to the point that 60 percent of the American people want a specific timetable for withdrawal .
It has exposed the paucity of the War Party ’s arguments , giving even members of the president ’s own party , such as Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar , a platform from which to ask the one essential question everyone at those hearings ( except for John McCain and Joe Lieberman ) tried to get Petraeus and Crocker to answer , and that is : where does it end ?
When does it end ?
Where it ends is in war with Iran .
That has always been the goal of our occupation and the continued deployment of U.S. troops in the region .
The purpose of the " surge " is to extend the war , to surge over the border and spill the conflict into Iran , which no doubt awaits " liberation " with bated breath .
Then they ’ll be dancing in the streets , waving American flags , and greeting us as the Parisians greeted the Allies  you know , the way it was supposed to be the first time around in Iraq .
This time , however , the neocons will have their triumph  or will they ?
The clear purpose of the " special groups " alarm is to implicate Sadr as an Iranian agent  an irony in that the War Party ’s main Iraqi instruments , Ahmed Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress , turned out to be real Iranian agents , who did n’t hesitate to pass along vital U.S. secrets to Tehran .
Sadr , however , is a horse of an entirely different color : if anything , he ’s more anti-Iranian than any Shi’ite leader in the country .
For example , he and his fellow Sadrists have steadfastly opposed the scheme pushed by the major parties of the Shi’ite coalition to give the southern ( heavily Shi’ite ) portion of Iraq  Basra and environs  a large degree of autonomy , thus paving the way for Iranian domination and weakening the central government .
The plan would have created , in effect , a " Shiastan , " which would be politically and economically dependent on Tehran , but it was effectively scotched by the nationalistic Sadrists .
The big news in Iraq is the rise of the Sadrists as the main opposition party and the focal point of Iraqi nationalism .
Sadr ’s growing power and influence is the real reason Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ordered his troops to attack the Mahdi Army : upcoming provincial elections , which Sadr is sure to win in the south , could establish a rival center of power , and Maliki meant to nip this development in the bud .
What he succeeded in doing , however , was elevating Sadr ’s prestige even higher , while considerably lowering his own : in the big showdown with the Mahdi Army , the Iraqi " army " reportedly fled in disarray , with a good number of them defecting .
Not a very good performance , to be sure , and Maliki ’s American sponsors were clearly perturbed that he went ahead with this operation without consulting them first .
That ’s the problem , however , with these kinds of puppets : they sometimes insist on independent action , and that ’s where they fall down .
The underlying current of frustration and bafflement at this administration ’s war aims often burst through to the surface at these remarkable hearings .
I was particularly struck by Sen. George Voinovich ’s comments about America ’s impending bankruptcy , which made him sound like a less coherent , more emotional Ron Paul .
Obama , for his part , was flawless : his questions cut right to the heart of the issue .
In what should be taught in schools as a textbook case of how to think logically and make rational judgments , Obama demystified the " parade of horribles " with which opponents of the war are confronted  all the supposedly horrific consequences of a U.S. withdrawal .
Clearly , as Obama pointed out , we are n’t going to have a fully functioning , multi-ethnic , multi-confessional democracy in Iraq , and there will be a low but tolerable level of violence for some time to come , but  short of perfection  what degree of imperfection will we allow ourselves before we define where the endpoint is ?
A clear answer from either Crocker or Petraeus was n’t forthcoming , and yet Obama framed the question with such clarity that it seemed to answer itself .
The bad news coming out of this hearing is that the administration is trying to build up Sadr as the new Saddam .
When John McCain  who used the hearings to pontificate about how failure to achieve " victory " in Iraq would constitute an abandonment of America ’s " moral leadership "  averred that recent events in Basra were a setback for the U.S. , Crocker replied , “ It was , although it is not over yet , Senator . "
In his opening statement , Crocker also remarked that the " Special Groups " and Sadr were re-merging their forces  another indication that Sadr is the new devil .
In Iraq , we have a potentially endless list of enemies  and endless rationales for staying .
At the very least , a hundred years ‘ worth
As I ’ve pointed out before , the U.S. has no desire to see Iraq emerge as a strongly unified and independent entity : after all , that would preclude our continued presence .
What the Americans want is a country in disarray , with no strong leader overseeing the central government , and the various constituencies divided among themselves  all the better to dominate the country , rationalize the U.S. military presence , and prepare for war with Iran .

5 The Incredible Hulk Nearly Gets Man-Raped
In this 2008 sequel / reboot of Ang Lee 's Hulk , Bruce Banner ( played by Edward Norton ) attempts to keep his anger in check while accosted by the US government and his archenemy , the Abomination ( Tim Roth ) .
Previews indicate they have figured out what the first film did wrong , and set about doing completely different things wrong .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement What We Probably Wo n't See :
How about this little vignette from ' 80s Hulk # 23 in which Bruce Banner attempts to keep his anger in check while being accosted by two marauding homosexuals at the YMCA .
Evidently , Luellen and Dewey here are n't the friendly dudes the Village People sang about , so Bruce Banner has to think fast !
In comic books , as in life , honesty is always the best policy :
We readers may laugh at Dewey 's naivety , but remember , when you live in the Marvel universe , you run into crazy shit every day .

Elian Gonzalez returned to Cuba with his father in mid-2000
Elian Gonzalez , the Cuban boy at the centre of an international custody battle eight years ago , has reportedly joined Cuba 's Young Communist Union .
He was quoted by Communist youth newspaper Juventud Rebelde as saying he will never let down ex-President Fidel Castro and his brother Raul .
Elian , now 14 , was six when relatives in Miami lost their battle to keep him in the US .
He was returned to Cuba in mid-2000 with his father .
Juventud Rebelde said in its Sunday edition the boy was among 18,000 people who joined the Young Communist Union on Saturday .
Elian was found floating alone in the Florida Straits in late 1999 , one of the few survivors from a group of shipwrecked Cubans who had tried to reach the US in a handmade boat .
His mother was among those who died when the fragile craft hit a storm .
A bitter custody battle ensued between his relatives in Miami , backed by the anti-Castro Cuban American community there , and his father , supported by the Cuban government .
The US courts got involved , eventually ruling in favour of Elian 's father and the boy was returned to Cuba .
Correspondents say the Cuban government carefully guards Elian 's privacy .
The Federal Reserve noise machine is back at work , in the form of new testimony by Chairman Ben Bernanke , grimly warning the Senate Budget Committee of a future crisis .
Needless to say , the Washington Post , which loves these tales , slapped it on the online front page .
And what , or should I say who , is the source of this crisis ?
Is it Osama bin Laden and the cost of the War on Terror ?
Is it the ghost of Saddam Hussein and the two trillion dollar war in Iraq ?
Is it George Bush , Dick Cheney , the past Republican Congress and their tax cuts ?
No , Bernanke mentioned none of these .
So who 's the villain ?
Why ... I am !
I 'm a Baby Boomer .
My mother and dad did the deed - or so anyway my brothers told me - sometime in the backwash of the second world war .
And there I 've been , a demographic disaster , a ticking time bomb , a walking road to ruin , ever since .
This is news ?
Bernanke should check with the Census Bureau .
They will advise , I think , that the tale of the Baby Boomers is n't exactly new .
The last of us was born , so they say , in the early 1960s .
We 've been counted and schooled .
We marched against Vietnam : the FBI knows about us .
We pay taxes : the IRS knows about us .
We do email : the NSA knows about us .
Hell , Google knows about us .
Nobody in the history of the universe is better documented than we are .
Or Ben might ask Alan Greenspan .
Did he know about the Baby Boomers when he chaired a commission on Social Security back in 1983 ?
I was already 31 years old at the time ; Alan and I had actually met .
I 'm fairly sure he was aware , in general terms , of my existence .
And his commission , back then , knew exactly how old we'd all be when 2008 came around and kids born in 1946 started to retire .
The Greenspan commission put the Social Security system into a pay - in - advance mode .
Payroll taxes were raised and the Social Security trust fund built up an enormous surplus , held as US government bonds , ever since .
That surplus exists today .
Social Security assets are over four times costs right now - and are expected to remain above three times costs for at least the next twenty years .
That means interest payments will be coming in , to supplement payroll taxes and meet the bills .
Is there a Social Security financing crisis ?
No .
And there wo n't be one , either .
Bernanke says that our " problem " is an aging population , plus rising health care costs .
The inference is that we , as a society , cannot afford to keep our elderly in modest comfort , or to pay their medical bills .
He implies ( without quite saying it ) that the solution must be cuts in Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .
And that , of course , is what the press picks up .
Here 's the truth :
By any measure of living standards , we 're richer now than ever before .
By any projection , we will be richer still in twenty or thirty years .
By any measure , we can afford the Social Security program we 've got now .
And we can afford health care too , although costs are a problem , and getting insurance to those who do n't have it is an even bigger problem .
The " fundamental decision " is n't over how much to spend on Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
The fundamental decision is : what should happen to today 's working Americans , when we get old ?
For just as my generation did n't appear yesterday , we wo n't disappear , either , when pensions and health care are cut .
We 'll just lead poorer , sicker , and shorter lives .
Cutting Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid should be off the table .
Now .
After that , we can talk , if we must : about letting Bush 's tax cuts expire , or reforming health care , or about the money we could save by getting out of Iraq ; or , for that matter , about whether there really is , or really will be , a federal deficit problem .
When it comes to sex , a female rat knows how to avoid a communication breakdown .
To announce her sexual readiness , she will automatically arch her back , deflect her tail and stand rigid to allow an aroused male to mount .
Now , Rockefeller University researchers have figured out the precise chemical and physical mechanism in a group of brain cells that controls this swayback posture , a reflex called lordosis that signals one of life ’s most complex yet primitive instincts — the need for sex .
The group of cells that generates lordosis behavior resides deep in the brain in a structure called the hypothalamus .
When an aroused male touches the flanks of a female , these cells determine whether the female will present her rump .
“ By way of these cells , the female controls sexual reproduction , ” says lead researcher Donald Pfaff , head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology and Behavior .
“ That ’s why these cells are so important . ”
In past years , Pfaff and his colleagues have teased apart the neural circuitry and hormonal regulation of lordosis .
“ The struggle now , ” he says , “ is to understand it intimately at the cellular level , to bring it down to as fine a degree of chemical and physical knowledge as we possibly can . ”
All neurons , whether they reside in the hypothalamus or elsewhere , maintain a constant flux of charged ions across their cell membranes via donut - shaped proteins called ion channels .
The rise and fall of different brain chemicals can affect the flow of these ions into and out of the cell by opening or closing the channels .
Although the Pfaff lab had long known that norepinephrine , a brain chemical that heightens alertness and mediates stress , excites these cells in the hypothalamus , the question was which ions it affects and how .
Using a technique called whole cell patch clamp , Anna W.J. Lee , a postdoc in the Pfaff lab , found that norepineprine prevents the exit of potassium ions from these cells , called ventromedial hypothalamic neurons , a block that activates them .
( Specifically , norepinephrine reduces the fast - acting A - type potassium current . )
With potassium ions locked inside the cells , the cells fire pulses of electrical activity , which then trigger the rest of the lordosis circuit to operate .
But that ’s not all .
The team found that when female rats are treated with the sex hormone estradiol before the experiment , the number of cells that respond to norepinephrine soar , making the impulse to mate stronger .
It turns out that the sex hormone turns on a set of genes , those for the receptor onto which norepinephrine binds — a self - fulfilling biological prophecy in the name of female reproduction .
Besides activating these cells in the hypothalamus , Pfaff and his colleagues believe that norepinephrine plays a much broader role in stimulating sexual behavior .
“ Female rats not only become generally aroused and alert but also sexually aroused , ” says Pfaff .
“ The action of norepinephrine on these hypothalamic cells is a way in which generalized arousal force facilitates sexual arousal , which , in turn , fosters sex behavior , without which reproduction cannot occur . ”

The very first class I took when starting my computer science degree from Brigham Young University was CS 131 .
I forget the course title , but the teacher was Dr. Alan Ashton , a quiet , self - effacing but brilliant professor who would later become very , very rich by developing — along with Bruce Bastian ( with whom I shared a TA office for an entire school year ) — the WordPerfect word processing program .
Dr. Ashton was an outstanding instructor .
I took this class in 1974 , and all our programming was done on an IBM 360/65 mainframe in 360 / Assembly , on punched cards no less .
Yet Dr. Ashton thoroughly inculcated in us the concepts of structured programming , having us ( for example ) come up with half a dozen different ways of implementing a WHILE loop in assembler .
At the same time , he did his best to teach us the realities of software development and engineering .
One of his comments in class seemed so axiomatic that I immediately thought of it as “ Ashton ’s Law ” and have quoted it as such ever since :
Ashton ’s Law :
Whenever someone tries to do something for you , they usually end up doing it to you .
— Dr. Alan Ashton , 1974
I have long lost track of how many times over the past 34 years I ’ve thought of Ashton ’s Law or have spoken it out loud to others .
Dr. Ashton made the comment in the context of operating systems , software tools , and applications ; all we have to do is look at something like the User Account Protection in MS Vista to see that Ashton ’s Law is all too much alive and well .
But there is a deeper issue here in software design and implementation , which I ’m also sure Dr. Ashton had in mind .
When two software components have to interact , there is usually an explicit and documented ( by the source code itself , if by no other means ) interface for one component ( the ‘ called ’ component , for lack of a better term ) that the other ( the ‘ calling ’ component ) makes use of .
In designing functions or services of the called component , we often end up as perpetrators of Ashton ’s Law .
That is , in our desire to do something for those who will invoke these functions or services , we end up doing something to them .
We make decisions about preconditions , calculations , and results that may seem quite reasonable to us , and that we may have the best intentions for ; still , our decisions may lead to others cursing our names ( or at least our functions ) .
There are always tradeoffs in software development among such desirable features as reliability , performance , memory footprint , calling / service standards , security , simplicity , and so on .
Our priorities — even our requirements — may differ from those who will use our component ’s functions and services , and so a certain amount of friction is perhaps unavoidable .
What we can do is spell out all our assumptions and restrictions , and the reasons behind them , so that those using our functions and services know what they ’re getting ( or not getting ) .
However , there may exist also what is variously termed a deep , hidden or undocumented interface for the called component .
This deep interface deals with invisible and often unknown requirements , side effects , and consequences of a given function or service provided by the called component .
For example , the function or service may leave some aspect of the software system or the host computer system in a different state ( e.g. , changes to internal data structures , changes to files or databases , launching or killing of processes , and so on ) without making that fact explicitly clear in any documentation or the API itself .
You may feel there is a good reason for this , but it may also interfere with the calling component ’s on - going functions .
As with much of what I post here , this may seem quite obvious to you , but trust me — obvious or not , it ’s incredibly common and quite frustrating for those having to use the offending software .
As software engineers creating software components , systems , and applications to be used by others , we need to constantly keep Ashton ’s Law in mind and ensure that we are truly developing useful functionality for others instead simply making their lives more difficult .

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wants to pay a million dollars for fake meat  even if it has caused a “ near civil war ” within the organization .
The organization said it would announce plans on Monday for a $ 1 million prize to the “ first person to come up with a method to produce commercially viable quantities of in vitro meat at competitive prices by 2012 . ”
The idea of getting the next Chicken McNugget out of a test tube is not new .
For several years , scientists have worked to develop technologies to grow tissue cultures that could be consumed like meat without the expense of land or feed and the disease potential of real meat .
An international symposium on the topic was held this month in Norway .
The tissue , once grown , could be shaped and given texture with the kinds of additives and structural agents that are now used to give products like soy burgers a more meaty texture .
New Harvest , a nonprofit organization formed to promote the field , says on its Web site , “ Because meat substitutes are produced under controlled conditions impossible to maintain in traditional animal farms , they can be safer , more nutritious , less polluting and more humane than conventional meat . ”
I teach a class on Data Mining at Stanford .
Students in my class are expected to do a project that does some non-trivial data mining .
Many students opted to try their hand at the Netflix Challenge : to design a movie recommendations algorithm that does better than the one developed by Netflix .
Here 's how the competition works .
Netflix has provided a large data set that tells you how nearly half a million people have rated about 18,000 movies .
Based on these ratings , you are asked to predict the ratings of these users for movies in the set that they have not rated .
The first team to beat the accuracy of Netflix 's proprietary algorithm by a certain margin wins a prize of $ 1 million !
Different student teams in my class adopted different approaches to the problem , using both published algorithms and novel ideas .
Of these , the results from two of the teams illustrate a broader point .
Team A came up with a very sophisticated algorithm using the Netflix data .
Team B used a very simple algorithm , but they added in additional data beyond the Netflix set : information about movie genres from the Internet Movie Database ( IMDB ) .
Guess which team did better ?
Team B got much better results , close to the best results on the Netflix leaderboard !!
I 'm really happy for them , and they 're going to tune their algorithm and take a crack at the grand prize .
But the bigger point is , adding more , independent data usually beats out designing ever - better algorithms to analyze an existing data set .
I 'm often suprised that many people in the business , and even in academia , do n't realize this .
Another fine illustration of this principle comes from Google .
Most people think Google 's success is due to their brilliant algorithms , especially PageRank .
In reality , the two big innovations that Larry and Sergey introduced , that really took search to the next level in 1998 , were :
The recognition that hyperlinks were an important measure of popularity -- a link to a webpage counts as a vote for it .
The use of anchortext ( the text of hyperlinks ) in the web index , giving it a weight close to the page title .
First generation search engines had used only the text of the web pages themselves .
The addition of these two additional data sets -- hyperlinks and anchortext -- took Google 's search to the next level .
The PageRank algorithm itself is a minor detail -- any halfway decent algorithm that exploited this additional data would have produced roughly comparable results .
The same principle also holds true for another area of great success for Google : the AdWords keyword auction model .
Overture had previously proved that the model of having advertisers bid for keywords could work .
Overture ranked advertisers for a given keyword based purely on their bids .
Google added some additional data : the clickthrough rate ( CTR ) on each advertiser 's ad .
Thus , to a first approximation , Google ranks advertisers by the product of their bid and their CTR ( this was true in the first version of AdWords ; they now use more considerations ) .
This simple change made Google 's ad marketplace much more efficient than Overture's .
Notice that the algorithm itself is quite simple ; it is the addition of the new data that made the difference .
To sum up , if you have limited resources , add more data rather than fine - tuning the weights on your fancy machine - learning algorithm .
Of course , you have to be judicious in your choice of the data to add to your data set .
Update :
Thanks for all the comments .
Some of them raise interesting issues , which I 'd like to address in a follow - up post .
I 'm traveling without good internet access until the weekend , so it will have to wait until I get back .
Stay tuned !
Update 2 : There 's now a follow - up post that addresses some of the issues raised in the comments .
Update 3 : Here 's another illustration of the same point :
Simple math using lots of data is way more accurate than comScore 's analysis in predicting Google 's earnings .
Microsoft , the software giant flush with billions of dollars in its warchest , has agreed to buy Silicon Valley semantic search engine Powerset , we ’ve learned .
The purchase price is rumored to be slightly more than $ 100 million .
An announcement is expected next month .
Powerset , of San Francisco , has developed a technology that attempts to understand the full meanings of phrases you type in while searching , and it returns results based on that understanding .
By buying Powerset , Microsoft is hoping to close the perceived quality gap with Google ’s search engine .
The move comes as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer continues to argue that improving search is Microsoft ’s most important task .
Microsoft ’s market share in search has steadily declined , dropping further and further behind first - place Google and second place Yahoo .
Google has generally dismissed Powerset ’s semantic , or “ natural language ” approach as being only marginally interesting , even though Google has hired some semantic specialists to work on that approach in limited fashion .
Google ’s search results are still based primarily on the individual words you type into its search bar , and its approach does very little to understand the possible meaning created by joining two or more words together .
That ’s where Powerset sees an opportunity for growth , and perhaps where Microsoft finally sees a chance to get a quality edge .
However , Powerset ’s technology has remained controversial to people within the industry because , while sexy in theory , the natural language approach is difficult to pull off in practice .
Skeptics wonder if the technology can ever be developed enough to be useful within a major search engine .
That skepticism abounded during a long secretive stage in Powerset ’s development , but the company did launch its service last month to the public , so it ’s there for full view .
You can use it to search for items within Wikipedia , and we ’ve previously outlined various instances where it can be useful .
The Microsoft purchase appears to validate Powerset ’s technology , though the amount of the purchase is clearly less than Powerset ’s investors had originally hoped for .
Powerset was valued at a whopping $ 42.5 million after the first round of financing two years ago .
At the time , investors expected that new technology it was acquiring from PARC would help it make significant breakthroughs .
However , the technology has taken longer to develop than expected .
Powerset was also burning cash at a fast rate , and so a purchase at $ 100 million is considered a safe result for an area that is also seeing increasing competition ( players such as Hakia , Twine and TextDigger are all using similar approaches ) .
Rumors of Microsoft ’s interest in Powerset first surfaced a month ago in a piece by CNET ’s Dan Farber .
The deal does make sense for Microsoft , which has been trying to figure out its strategy in search since the rebuff of its purchase offer by Yahoo .
Many analysts saw Yahoo ’s advertising platform , not its search technology , as the main reason for Microsoft ’s interest .
However , Microsoft was left with $ 50 billion burning a hole in its pocket , and making technology acquisitons makes sense .
Also ,
Yahoo ’s search technology is one reason why its ad business is so vibrant .
“ The most important application for the foreseeable future is search , ” Microsoft ’s Ballmer said last week .
“ We do n’t have to dominate , but we ’d better have a darn good chunk of the search market over time , and we ’re working away at it . ”
Microsoft also recently rolled out a new “ Cashback ” program that offers cash back to users of its Live Search engine .
Microsoft spokesman Doug Free declined comment , saying the company does “ not comment on rumors or speculation . ”
Powerset chief executive Barney Pell declined comment .
He ’s believed to own about a third of the company .
The rest is owned by investors , his two cofounders and other employees .
Foundation Capital and the Founders Fund are the main investors .
A shakeup last year saw one of the founders , Steve Newcomb , leave the company .
In an interview , Pell said the company remains focused on developing its service and is proud of its new application for the iPhone .
He said some people have provided feedback that Powerset ’s iPhone application is even more useful than the Web version .
Things are so broken on the mobile web that improvements in interface such as Powerset ’s search are “ transformatively better on mobile devices , ” he said .
In response to our question about how Google is planning to use semantics , if at all , Google gave a very similar answer to the one Google ’s Director of Research Peter Norvig provided last year .
Norvig was on vacation this week , but a spokeswoman reiterated :
1. Search remains at the core of everything Google does and we are always working to improve it .
We are more focused on search innovation , and have more engineers working on search than ever before .
As Peter said , “ We do what ’s best for users now , and over the longer - term , we investigate technologies that will help in the future . ”
2 . I think it ’s important to first note that semantic search is very broad and means different things to different people .
As Peter mentioned in his interview with you , there are a couple of examples we can point out that incorporate a form of semantic search : – Fill - in - the - blank search ( see here ) .
– Question answering ( see here ; it gives a factual answer at the top of the page ) .

On April 9 , ABC News correspondent Jan Crawford Greenburgh broke an exclusive story on World News Tonight that provided new details surrounding how top Bush administration officials signed off on the use of harsh interrogation tactics in the “ war on terror . ”
Indeed , vice president Dick Cheney , secretary of state Colin Powell , attorney general John Ashcroft , CIA director George Tenet , and national security advisor Condoleezza Rice , grouped in the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee , gave the U.S. military and the CIA a green light to torture suspected al - Qaeda operatives and other “ enemy combatants . ”
According to Greenburgh ,
The high - level discussions about these “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were so detailed , these sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top al Qaeda suspects — whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news .
It has since emerged that the Department of Justice ’s Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) is investigating whether agency lawyers , including University of California law professor John Yoo and U.S. federal appeals court judge Jay Bybee “ improperly advised the military it could use harsh interrogation methods and concluded that President Bush ’s wartime authority could not be limited by domestic law or international bans on torture , ” according to the Associated Press .
The “ legal ” basis that established Bush regime policies on “ enhanced interrogations ” were provided by Yoo and Bybee ’s March 2003 memo from the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .
The 81 - page brief stated that the chief executive ’s power as “ commander - in - chief ” during a “ time of war ” were virtually limitless .
Yoo alleged that presidential wartime powers could not be restricted , even by binding international treaties ratified by the U.S .
Writing in The Nation , New York University law professor Stephen Gillers avers :
The memos are an abysmal piece of work , but they had great value to the President .
Dismissing the Geneva Conventions and other law , they used the veneer of serious legal scholarship ( abundant footnotes , many citations , long dense paragraphs ) to create an aura of legitimacy for near - death interrogation tactics and unrestrained executive power .
The memos had high credibility because they came from the OLC , the legal brain trust for the executive branch and ( until then ) the gold standard for legal acumen . …
When lawyers in private practice mess up , they face serious jeopardy .
They can be fired , sued for malpractice , disbarred or prosecuted .
Yoo and Bybee face no such risks .
The President wo n’t protest .
He got what he wanted .
And while a state disciplinary body can investigate , that is unlikely without Justice Department help .
According to Philippe Sands ’ investigative piece on Bush regime torture programs ,
The fingerprints of the most senior lawyers in the administration were all over the design and implementation of the abusive interrogation policies .
[ David ] Addington , [ Jay ] Bybee , [ Alberto ] Gonzales , [ Jim ] Haynes , and [ John ]
Yoo became , in effect , a torture team of lawyers , freeing the administration from the constraints of all international rules prohibiting abuse .
With the Geneva Convention ’s Common Article 3 declared “ quaint ” and “ obsolete ” by torture enablers such as Gonzales , Bybee and Yoo , the gates of hell opened for individuals branded “ enemy combatants , ” who could be held indefinitely in CIA and Pentagon global gulags .
The infamous March 2003 memo alleged that physical torture occurred “ only ” when the pain was “ equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death , ” and that mental torture required “ suffering not just at the moment of infliction but … lasting psychological harm . ”
While the memo may have been formally rescinded in December 2003 , torture of hapless prisoners continue , often at the hands of corporate mercenaries hired by the Pentagon .
That OLC legal analysts gave CIA and military interrogators carte blanche to commit war crimes without risk to themselves was driven home by Yoo ’s inept rationale , Yoo wrote :
‘ If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network , ’ Yoo wrote .
‘ In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . ’
In a follow - up to the April 2 piece , Dan Eggen writes :
Thirty pages into a memorandum discussing the legal boundaries of military interrogations in 2003 , senior Justice Department lawyer John C.
Yoo tackled a question not often asked by American policymakers :
Could the president , if he desired , have a prisoner ’s eyes poked out ?
Or , for that matter , could he have “ scalding water , corrosive acid or caustic substance ” thrown on a prisoner ?
How about slitting an ear , nose or lip , or disabling a tongue or limb ?
What about biting ?
The conclusion ?
None of this matters in a time of war according to Professor Yoo , because federal laws–indeed any law–prohibiting assault , maiming or other crimes perpetrated by U.S. military or mercenary interrogators are trumped by the president ’s unlimited power as “ commander - in - chief . ”
“ Self - inflicted pain ” and other CIA atrocities
When the Abu Ghraib torture scandal broke in 2004 , administration officials dismissed the grave abuses suffered by Iraqi prisoners as the work of a “ few bad apples ” on the “ night shift . ”
While no doubt debauched actors in a sordid drama whose script was edited in Washington , the underlings convicted for their crimes at Abu Ghraib were acting out scenes from a CIA “ masterwork ” composed decades earlier : KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation .
Written in July 1963 , the CIA ’s torture manual describes a fear - laced shadow world of hooding , isolation , drugging and other unseemly interrogation techniques described by historian Alfred W. McCoy in his landmark study , A Question of Torture .
According to McCoy , “ the CIA ’s perfection of psychological torture was a major scientific turning point , albeit unnoticed and unheralded in the world beyond its secret safe houses . ”
In contradistinction to physical torture , McCoy writes ,
For more than two thousand years , interrogators had found that mere physical pain , no matter how extreme , often produced heightened resistance .
By contrast , the CIA ’s psychological paradigm fused two new methods , ‘ sensory deprivation ’ and ‘ self - inflicted pain , ’ whose combination causes victims to feel responsible for their own suffering and thus capitulate more readily to their torturers .
…
Refined through years of practice , the method relies on simple , even banal procedures–isolation , standing , heat and cold , light and dark , noise and silence –for a systematic attack on all human senses .
Tracing the methodology employed at Guantánamo Bay ’s Camp Delta , CIA “ black sites ” in Europe and Afghanistan , and Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , McCoy tracks - back the CIA - Pentagon program to coercive techniques first explored by the CIA ’s MKULTRA “ mind - control ” experiments during the 1950s and 1960s .
While sensationalized in popular lore , primarily focused on the secret doping of unsuspected “ subjects ” with LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs , CIA - financed researchers concluded this line of inquiry , the elusive search for a “ Manchurian candidate , ” was a dead end .
At that point other , more subtle , yet intensely destructive means for breaking down prisoners during the interrogation “ process ” were explored .
Rooted in the Nazi - like experiments conducted at McGill University ’s psychiatric “ treatment ” facility , the Allan Memorial Institute , Dr. Ewen Cameron carried out research into what he termed “ psychic driving ” and “ depatterning . ”
Cameron and his staff subjected “ patients ” to a harsh regime of drugging and electroshock “ therapy ” in combination with a monstrous sensory deprivation regimen that built on the “ research ” of another CIA grantee , Dr. Donald O. Hebb .
Describing Hebb’s “ sensory deprivation ” experiments that employed a modified iron lung , McCoy writes :
Among the seventeen subjects , half had hallucinations and all suffered ‘ degrees of anxiety . ’
Apparently addressing their covert patrons , the Harvard psychiatrists concluded that ‘ sensory deprivation can produce major mental and behavioral changes in man , ’ and recommended its capacity to induce psychosis as ‘ more “ natural ” than the pharmacological and physical methods currently used ’– not of course , in polio treatment but , if we can finish their sentence , in CIA torture .
Hebb and Cameron ’s “ findings ” found their echo in the CIA ’s KUBARK interrogation manual :
1 . The more completely the place of confinement eliminates sensory stimuli , the more rapidly and deeply will the interrogatee be affected .
Results produced only after weeks or months of imprisonment in an ordinary cell can be duplicated in hours or days in a cell which has no light ( or weak artificial light which never varies ) , which is sound - proofed , in which odors are eliminated , etc .
An environment still more subject to control , such as water - tank or iron lung , is even more effective .
2 . An early effect of such an environment is anxiety .
How soon it appears and how strong it is depends upon the psychological characteristics of the individual .
3 . The interrogator can benefit from the subject ’s anxiety .
As the interrogator becomes linked in the subject ’s mind with the reward of lessened anxiety , human contact , and meaningful activity , and thus with providing relief for growing discomfort , the questioner assumes a benevolent role .
4 . The deprivation of stimuli induces regression by depriving the subject ’s mind of contact with an outer world and thus forcing it in upon itself .
At the same time , the calculated provision of stimuli during interrogation tends to make the regressed subject view the interrogator as a father - figure .
The result , normally , is a strengthening of the subject ’s tendencies toward compliance .
Across the decades , CIA and Pentagon studies , particular in the wake of America ’s disastrous invasion and occupation of Iraq , have focused on the use of sensory deprivation as one method of breaking down what they term “ resistant sources . ”
Since KUBARK ’s dissemination , these methodologies have been refined by the Pentagon ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program taught to U.S. Special Forces and pilots who may be captured as the result of armed conflict .
But as Salon ‘s investigative reporter , Mark Benjamin has documented , the SERE program was “ reverse - engineered ” by CIA contract psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen as a tool for torture .
Benjamin wrote ,
There are striking similarities between descriptions of SERE training and the interrogation techniques employed by the military and CIA since 9/11 .
Soldiers undergoing SERE training are subject to forced nudity , stress positions , lengthy isolation , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , exhaustion from exercise , and the use of water to create a sensation of suffocation .
‘ If you have ever had a bag on your head and somebody pours water on it , ’ one graduate of that training program told Salon last year ‘ it is real hard to breathe . ’
Many of those techniques show up in interrogation logs , human rights reports and news articles about detainee abuse that has taken place in Guantánamo , Afghanistan and Iraq .
( The military late last year unveiled a new interrogation manual designed to put a stop to prisoner abuse . )
An investigation released this month by the Council of Europe , a multinational human rights agency , added extreme sensory deprivation to the list of techniques that have been used by the CIA .
The report said that extended isolation contributed to ‘ enduring psychiatric and mental problems ’ of prisoners .
Isolation in cramped cells is also a key tenet of SERE training , according to soldiers who have completed the training and described it in detail to Salon .
The effects of isolation are a specialty of Jessen ’s , who taught a class on “ coping with isolation in a hostage environment ” at a Maui seminar in late 2003 , according to a Washington Times article published then .
( Defense Department documents from the late 1990s describe Jessen as the ‘ lead psychologist ’ for the SERE program . )
Mitchell also spoke at that conference , according to the article .
It described both men as ‘ contracted to Uncle Sam to fight terrorism . ’
The End of Impunity ?
It is precisely these highly - destructive , illegal techniques of “ self - inflicted pain ” that Judge Bybee and U.C. law professor
Yoo claimed as the president ’s “ right ” to employ as commander - in - chief .
As should be apparent in this brief summary , the misnamed “ war on terror ” is , in theory and in practice , a war of terror waged against resistant individuals and populations who have risen up against U.S. imperialist depredations .
As the Empire ’s hegemony is challenged across the planet , the control of other nations ’ resources deemed “ vital ” by U.S. multinational corporate looters , not the safety or security of the American people , is the primary motivator of America ’s destructive wars of conquest .
Since 9/11 , the Bush administration and their legal sycophants in the Justice Department and right - wing think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Federalist Society , have claimed that the criminal regime in Washington has the legal right to employ any tactic to pursue its sordid agenda .
But as Philippe Sands writes , U.S. immunity to prosecution for Addington , Bybee , Yoo and other torture enablers under the Military Commissions
Act may have very unintended consequences indeed .
Speaking with a judge and a prosecutor in a European city , the prosecutor concluded that immunity “ is very stupid . ”
He explained that
‘ it would make it much easier for investigators outside the United States to argue that possible war crimes would never be addressed by the justice system in the home country–one of the trip wires enabling foreign courts to intervene .
For some of those involved in the Guantánamo decisions , prudence may well dictate a more cautious approach to international travel .
And for some the future may hold a tap on the shoulder . ’
‘ It ’s a matter of time , ’ the judge observed .
‘ These things take time . ’
As I gathered my papers , he looked up and said , ‘ And then something unexpected happens , when one of these lawyers travels to the wrong place . ’
As former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said at one of the administration ’s strategy sessions on torture : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
Do you think current Hague “ resident , ” former Liberian president Charles Taylor , might enjoy a spirited game of chess with one of the NSC Principals ?
Late last night George Takei ( Star Trek ’s original Sulu ) announced that he and his long - time partner Brad Altman were engaged to be married .
The announcement comes just one day after the California Supreme Court ruled that same sex marriages are now legal in California , overturning a previous ban as unconstitutional .
Takei talked to TrekMovie about the wedding and more .
The announcement on Takei ’s website reads in part :
Our California dream is reality .
Brad Altman and I can now marry .
We are overjoyed !
At long last , the barrier to full marriage rights for same - sex couples has been torn down .
We are equal with all citizens of our state !
This issue is particularly close to Takei as he first came out as gay in 2005 to speak out against a veto , by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , of a same - sex marraige law .
Takei tells TrekMovie he and Brad are planning on tying the knot “ as soon as possible . ”
The court ruling will go into effect in June and they are currently looking over dates and possible locations .
Takei is considering the recently restored St. Vibiana ’s Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles .
Takei is also already planning on helping with the campaign to fight any November ballot measure to amend the California State Constitution to again ban same sex marriage .
Takei states “ I would like to think that Californians have changed and now know that we are not the stereotypes , but we are everybody we are your neighbors , your family , your co-workers . ”
Takei also takes heart in the fact that Gov. Schwarzenegger has backed the Court ’s ruling and will not support amending the Constitution .
Takei is n’t the only celeb announcing marriage plans following the ruling .
During a taping of her show on Friday Ellen DeGeneres announced she and Portia de Rossi will also wed .
Takei with his husband - to - be , Brad Altman
George keeping busy
Besides wedding plans , Takei is still keeping busy .
The actor says that for the last week he has been doing voice recordings for an unnamed EA video game .
He also recently finished a “ last minute ” cameo for the Adam Sandler comedy You Do n’t Mess with the Zohan .
Takei also has a role as a “ snooty maître de ” in the R rated comedy American Summer from the guys behind American Pie .
That film is now at Cannes looking for distribution .
Starting later in the month George will be going on a multi-city speaking tour as part of Asian - pacific heritage month .
Takei also is slated for some summer conventions , see his site for more info on his appearances .
George does n’t hate Bill
In the last week William Shatner has been doing a publicity tour and the subject of Trek feuds and George Takei seems to come up a lot ( like on Conan O’Brien show or The Howard Stern Show ) .
When asked about the supposed feud Takei did admit he wishes Shatner would learn to pronounce his name correctly , but felt the feud has been overblown , noting
Intel launched its new embedded x86 system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) today , and in doing so , moved a small step closer toward eventually competing head - to - head with ARM .
Formally , the new SoC platform is known as the Intel EP80579 Integrated Processor Family , but the project was code - named Tolapai , and that name trips off the tongue more readily .
Tolapai is n't just a new integrated SoC ; it 's Intel 's first volley into a mobile and " embedded " market space that the company believes will grow enormously in the coming years .
Unlike how ARM and other companies use the term , when Intel talks about " embedded systems , " the company is n't just referring to point - of - sale terminals or industrial applications , but to a category of what it refers to as mobile Internet devices ( MIDs ) .
Tolapai itself is aimed at the embedded storage market , point - of - sale terminals , and security applications , but Intel 's longer - term roadmap is considerably more ambitious .
The term MID , in Intel parlance , is n't just a reference to a form factor , but an expression of what a device is ( or is n't ) capable of .
According to Doug Davis , vice president of Intel 's Digital Enterprise Group , MIDs should deliver the " actual " Internet experience .
When asked to clarify , Davis stated that the word actual referred to " the ability to run the Internet applications that are typically developed for the IA architecture ( i.e. , Core 2 Duo , Centrino ) . "
From Intel 's perspective , pushing x86 technology into such mobile Internet devices makes perfect sense .
Non-x86 processors and system - on - chip ( SoC ) parts based on ARM , MIPS , and PowerPC architectures still hold a significant power consumption advantage over any hypothetical x86 SoC , but that once - insurmountable gap has narrowed recently by process shrinks and power optimizations .
At the 65nm process node , Intel still wo n't be close on power consumptions , but things start to get interesting at 45nm , and really interesting at 22nm .
But more on that later .
Intel claims that the EP80579 is an entirely new design , so let 's take a peek inside .
The " Acceleration Services Unit " in yellow above is only present on chips that support Intel 's QuickAssist technology .
Intel 's taken a different path with Tolapai .
Instead of designing a monolithic SoC and scaling it by frequency ( or frequency and cache ) , Intel built itself a modular core that can be configured in any number of ways .
Customers who want stronger CPU performance , but need only minimal video and I/O capabilities , will be able to purchase SoC's with Intel 's QuickAssist technology , while other customers with different I/O , video , and CPU needs will have appropriately optimized products available to them as well .
The QuickAssist moniker refers to the acceleration abstraction layer ( AAL ) Intel has developed for Tolapai .
This layer allows programmers to access a series of field programmable gate arrays ( FPGA 's ) attached to the SoC's FSB .
The term QuickAssist does n't refer to any particular method of utilizing these accelerators , but to the framework itself .
Current Tolapai products are all based on Intel 's Pentium M processor , at clock speeds that range from 600 MHz - 1.2GHz .
Asked why Intel chose the Pentium M for its first - generation embedded SoC , instead of Atom , Davis responded that the processor had been available at the time , and was suitable to the task at hand .
Intel declined to give a product - by - product TDP breakdown , but indicated that Tolapai TDP ranges from 11W at the low end ( 600MHz , no accelerators ) to 21W at the high - end ( 1200MHz , w/ accelerators ) .
( By way of comparison , the most feature - rich and robust embedded ARM SoCs typically run in the sub - 2W range , so Tolapai still is n't even close in terms of raw power draw . )
The Pentium M wo n't be hanging around for very long ; future embedded SoC products from Intel will be based on Atom , which will reduce the overall part 's power draw significantly .
Intel , were it collectively peering over my shoulder at this very moment , would be quick to point out that there 's no reason to avoid the Pentium M - based product series now if you intend to build a straight - up MID .
Tolapai , even in its current incarnation , has a 45 percent smaller footprint and consumes 34 percent less power than a current - generation equivalent IA - based device .
I 'd advise against trying to map Intel 's statements on the long - term importance of MIDs against current Tolapai TDP .
The company 's presentation made it clear that the Intel envisions a not - too - distant future in which ubiquitous Internet connectivity between people and machines will have become the worldwide norm .
The " worldwide " part might take a bit longer , but the types of low - cost , Internet - capable devices that Intel is proposing will be critical components of any strategy to bring the planet online .
Intel 's position could be concisely , and I think accurately , summarized as " The Internet is going everywhere , and we 're going with it . "
But of course , as long as the TDPs of x86 SoCs stay above 2W , there will be plenty of places where the Internet goes that Intel can't ( yet ) follow .
What recession ?
Texas looking at $ 10.7 billion surplus Oil prices help Texas rake in $ 10.7 billion surplus
Sales tax revenue also aids projected overflow Perry hopes to share with you
AUSTIN —
The nation may be on the verge of a recession , but the Texas economy is doing well enough for Comptroller Susan Combs to predict Tuesday that the Legislature will have a $ 10.7 billion surplus when it convenes in January .
Much of the extra money can be attributed to record oil prices .
While motorists are being socked with ever - increasing gasoline costs , oil and gas employment in Texas has been booming , the comptroller 's office reported .
If Combs ' early forecast holds up , Gov. Rick Perry would like to return part of the money to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts or rebate checks , spokesman Robert Black said .
But those steps would need legislative action .
Oil and gas employment in Texas grew by 7.5 percent between March 2007 and March 2008 , leading an overall increase of 214,000 Texas jobs , comptroller 's spokesman R.J. DeSilva said .
Consequently , sales tax revenue , a major source of state government income , also continues to grow .
And , DeSilva added , Texas has been insulated more than other states from the sub - prime mortgage lending crisis .
Texas , he said , avoided the housing price bubbles that hurt states like California and Florida .
Combs wo n't make her official revenue estimate until about the time the Legislature begins in January .
She made an early forecast when asked about Speaker Tom Craddick 's recent prediction , in a speech in South Texas , that the surplus could be as high as $ 15 billion .
" Counting the Rainy Day ( savings ) fund , I believe we are about $ 10.7 ( billion ) , " she said .
Her forecast is higher than the $ 10.1 billion surplus with which the state ended the 2007 fiscal year last Aug. 31 .
Combs said she believes the speaker 's office " misread " a revenue figure .
" The comptroller is correct as things stand today , " Craddick spokeswoman Alexis DeLee said later .
But she said the speaker still believes the surplus could be " significantly higher " by the time lawmakers convene .
' Some sort of tax relief '
Black said Perry was anticipating a large surplus as well .
" With a surplus of this magnitude , I know the governor believes we need to look at some sort of tax relief , whether it be on property taxes , business taxes or some type of actual rebate , like the federal government can do but we have n't been able to , " Black said .
The last installment of school property tax cuts ordered by Perry and the Legislature in 2006 went into effect last year , but much of the savings already has been eroded by rising property values and appraisals .
An expanded business tax , enacted to help pay for the property tax reductions , is still untried and under fire .
Companies had until May 15 to file their first reports under the new levy , and Combs recently extended that deadline by 30 days .
Perry floated the tax rebate idea in the 2007 session , but it went nowhere .
It would require a constitutional amendment , including a two - thirds vote in both the House and the Senate plus approval by Texas voters .
Black acknowledged that there will be a need for increased spending on crucial needs , such as Medicaid and public education , including higher fuel costs for school buses , and the Legislature will have to balance those demands .
But , he added , the governor wants to keep Texas ' economic engine " going and growing . "
In budget - preparation instructions this week , the governor 's office and the Legislative Budget Board asked agencies to submit zero - growth spending requests plus options for reducing spending by 10 percent .
Dick Lavine , senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities , which promotes programs for low - and middle - income Texans , warned that the rosy forecasts still may be premature .
' A lot of uncertainty '
Texas has weathered the economic downturn better than many other states , he acknowledged , but he added , " There 's still a lot of uncertainty in the financial markets . "
And , Lavine pointed out , it will be next May before lawmakers draft a final version of the next two - year state budget .
" There is certainly no way to know " what the budgetary demands on lawmakers are going to be then , he said .
Legislative budget - writers also have expressed caution .
Sen .
Steve Ogden , R - Bryan , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , recently warned that no one knows how well the new business tax will perform or whether a weakening economy will force the federal government to reduce spending on programs , such as health care , that it helps the state to fund .

It had a huge influence on me forty years ago in ways that would have exasperated Chesterton .
He did all he could to keep me from becoming a Calvinist , and instead made me a romantic one — a happy one .
If I thought his broadsides against predestination really hit home and undid true biblical doctrine , I would keep my mouth shut or change my worldview .
But his celebration of poetry and paradox undermines his own abomination of the greatest truth - and - mystery - lovers around today , the happy Calvinists .
Nothing in this Calvinism - abominating book came close to keeping me from embracing the glorious sovereignty of God .
On the contrary , the poetic brightness of the book , along with the works of C. S. Lewis , awakened in me an exuberance about the strangeness of all things — which in the end made me able to embrace the imponderable paradoxes of God ’s decisive control of all things and the total justice of his holding us accountable .
One of the reasons that Calvinism is stirring today is that it takes both truth and mystery seriously .
It ’s a singing , poetry - writing , run -through - the - fields Calvinism .
It ’s the Arminians that are the rationalists .
Arminianism trumps biblical sentences with metaphysics :
God ca n’t control all things and hold us responsible .
God ca n’t choose some and love all . ”
Why ?
Metaphysics .
Out with mystery !
It just ca n’t be !
So Chesterton ’s anti-Calvinist shotgun sprays all around today ’s poet - Calvinist and misses the mark .
Read Orthodoxy .
A few of you may be swept away into the folly of Roman Catholic sacramentalism .
A few others may be confirmed in your tiff with joyless Calvinists .
But for many readers , especially the Bible - saturated ones , this book will awaken such a sense of wonder in you that you will not feel at home again until you enter the new world of the wide - eyed children called the happy - Reformed .
Here is a flavor of what to expect in Orthodoxy : 1
“ [ This book ] recounts my elephantine adventures in pursuit of the obvious . ” ( 12 )
“ It is one thing to describe an interview with a ... creature that does not exist .
It is another thing to discover that the rhinoceros does exist and then take pleasure in the fact that he looks as if he did n’t . ” ( 11 )
“ Exactly what does breed insanity is reason .
Poets do not go mad ; but chess - players do .
Mathematicians go mad , and cashiers ; but creative artists very seldom . ” ( 17 )
“ Only one great English poet went mad , Cowper .
And he was definitely driven mad by logic , by the ugly and alien logic of predestination .
Poetry was not the disease but the medicine ....
He was damned by John Calvin . ” ( 17 )
“ The poet only desires exaltation and expansion , a world to stretch himself in .
The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens .
It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens in to his head .
And it is his head that splits . ” ( 17 )
“ The madman is not the man who has lost his reason .
The madman is the man who has lost everything but his reason . ” ( 19 )
“ Mysticism keeps men sane .
As long as you have mystery you have health .
When you destroy mystery you create morbidity . ” ( 28 )
“ The ordinary man ... has always cared more for truth than for consistency .
If he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other , he would take the two truths and the contradictions along with them . ” ( 28 )
“ When we are very young children we do not need fairy tales : we only need tales .
Mere life is interesting enough .
A child of seven is excited by being told that Tommy opened the door and saw a dragon .
But a child of three is excited by being told that Tommy opened a door . ” ( 54 )
“ Man is more himself , man is more manlike , when joy is the fundamental thing in him , and grief the superficial .
Melancholy should be an innocent interlude , a tender and fugitive frame of mind ; praise should be the permanent pulsation of the soul .
Pessimism is at best an emotional half - holiday ; joy is the uproarious labor by which all things live . ” ( 159 )
South Korean Robin Hood
Most people have seen at least one of the Robin Hood movies , and likely remember the scene where he wins the archery contest by shooting his arrow right down the middle of his opponents arrow .
In most cases you would have thought this to be simply a Hollywood filming trick , and it probably was , but that does n’t mean it can not be done in real life .
Below is a video of a South Korean archer who becomes our real life Robin Hood when he does the same arrow trick we all saw in the movies .
Surprised ?
Well South Koreans have been dominating archery for some time .
If you remember in 2004 , a South Korean archer broke 3 world records in archery during a single Olympic event .

Was Napoleon poisoned ?
For decades , scholars and scientists have argued that the exiled dictator , who died in 1821 on the remote island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic , was the victim of arsenic , whether by accident or design .
The murder theory held that his British captors poisoned him ; the accident theory said that colored wallpaper in his bedroom contained an arsenic - based dye that mold transformed into poisonous fumes .
The evidence behind both theories was that scientists had found arsenic in hairs from Napoleon ’s head , which diminished the idea that he had died of stomach cancer .
Arsenic is highly toxic , and its poisoning symptoms include violent stomach pains .
“ There is nothing improbable about the hypothesis of arsenic poisoning , ” wrote Frank McLynn in “ Napoleon : A Biography ” ( Arcade , 2002 ) .
“ Science gives it rather more than warranted assertibility . ”

The fate of the nation 's water supply is under debate as hearings in the House and Senate begin on the Water Restoration Act of 2007 .
Opponents claim this Act threatens to greatly expand the Federal Government 's roll in water management .
This
Act would define waters of the U.S. as " all interstate and intrastate waters and their tributaries , including lakes , rivers , streams ( including intermittent streams ) mudflats , sand flats , wetlands , sloughs , prairie potholes , wet meadows , playa lakes , natural ponds , and all impoundments of the foregoing " .
In other words , this bill will give the federal government total control of the most basic of all commodities necessary to life on this earth .
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers currently have authority over all waters considered navigable in the U.S. The Code of Federal Regulations 33 CFR 329.4 defines navigable waters as " those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and / or presently used , or have been used in the past , or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce .
" The Water Restoration Act , a bipartisan bill lead / sponsored by Congressman Oberstar , is an amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Act , commonly known as the Clean Water Act .
Since major amendments were enacted in 1977 , the Clean Water Act protected all of the nation 's waters as Congress intended , until 2003 , when the Bush administration gave in to pressure form corporate polluters and redefined the meaning of water .
This happened through a bureaucratic device called a ' guidance ' , whereby the EPA instructed federal environmental law enforcers to back off from holding many polluters accountable .
Proponents of the Clean Water Restoration
Act see it as restoring what was Congress 's original intent , that the Clean Water Act protect all of the nation 's waters .
They see water quality and quantity issues as needing examination this spring , and believe now is the time for getting legislation to protect the water supply in order with the passage of this Act .
They see the Act as offering needed protection from water pollution , from terrorists , and being in the interests of national security .
Under the Public Trust doctrine , the government is prohibited from converting something such as water to the status of a commodity .
Water is considered a basic human right that must remain in the public trust , meaning that it is so important to our survival that it should never be reclassified as a commodity .
Many believe that the Water Restoration
Act lays the foundation for removing water from the Public Trust and facilitating it to fall under the ownership and control of corporations as a commodity .
This is similar to how seeds have fallen into corporate control when they were once viewed as part of the Public Trust under the assumption that all people have a right to seeds with which to grow food for themselves .
Commodity owning corporations can now sue the government if it acts in any way to prevent them from making profits they believe they are entitled to .
This ability to sue for impaired profit making can be the result of environmental regulations , of Federal laws which may prevent the corporations from hiring illegal workers , or issues of eminent domain in which an individual 's land stands in the way of corporate earnings , and the courts have not acted to protect the interests of the corporation .
All the corporation has to do to supersede federal law is claim ' trade illegal ' provisions of NAFTA and CAFTA .
Federal laws and regulations are then put aside , along with property rights .
CAFTA goes a long way in establishing the privatization of water supplies , including in - land navigated waters and the right to use and access the water supplies .
If the federal government is unable to gain total control of all water from whatever source , it is highly unlikely that water can be taken from the status of Public Trust and changed to that of commodity .
If in fact the Water Restoration Act allows for the complete control of the federal government over all water in the country , as it opponents claim , water can loose its status as part of the Public Trust , and become a commodity available for corporate ownership .
The Water Restoration
Act federalizes all inland and coastal waters from any source .
This
Act is needed to set the stage for the corporate privatization guaranteed under CAFTA , and would effectively convert the entire water supply from any source into the status of a commodity .
As it stands now , any corporate agriculture business operating in any area is allowed to bypass water treatment plants , sewage treatment , and tap directly into underground aquifers even if it depletes the water supply to the surrounding communities .
GMO seeds require up to three times the normal amount of water to activate and grow , but efforts to limit use or regulate disposal have been unsuccessful .
The corporate rights are seen to exceed those of the individual and community as CAFTA clearly claims priority for " investor protections " .
Opponents of the Water Restoration
Act see the World Bank along with the United Nations as active in the effort to use NAFTA as well as CAFTA to convert the world 's water supply to commodity status , to be controlled by private investors via global trade and investment agreements .
Water will no longer be a community or individual right and resource if they are successful .
Water will become a globally traded commodity subject to markets and the ability to pay , just like oil has .
If the World Trade organization is able to convert water to the status of a tradable commodity , it will be subject to international trade policies favoring only the giant corporation and investors .
When corporations have sought to overturn domestic environmental laws or regulations , the laws have been declared null under the ' trade illegal ' provisions of both NAFTA and CAFTA which declare that the right of the corporation cannot be superseded or infringed upon by laws or regulations that hinder the amount of profit they estimate can be attained .
Under a currently established World Bank system , credit or loans will not be issued to Third World countries and others unless they agree to allow foreign investors access to privatize their water supply .
It required mass demonstrations in Bolivia to force out a subsidiary of Bechtel that had privatized the water supply , increased costs three - fold initially , dispensed with system upkeep , and left a quarter of the rural homes without access to water .
England privatized their water system , resulting in a 45 % overnight increase in costs .
Maintenance levels dropped and the quality of the water deteriorated significantly .
Several people became ill and one died from an E. coli contamination in a Canadian town after the water supply was privatized .
The owner of the water knew of the contamination but did not notify the public until people became ill .
In a meeting at the Hague , water executives stated that as long as water was coming out of the tap , the public had no right to any information as to how it got there or its quality .
In the U.S. private investors have already succeeded in taking over some community water supplies .
In other places the communities have fought against the sale of publicly held supplies realizing that this most important element of human survival should never be in the control of private corporations whose one and only duty is to produce ever increasing profits for investors .

Juggalos ( a.k.a. the rabid fans of demented horror - core rap duo Insane Clown Posse ) tend to scare the shit out of most people .
Maybe it ’s because they ’re connected with violent hooliganism , wear clown makeup out in public , or are just all - around freakazoids .
( There ’s also the fact their cars usually sport a sticker of a hatchet - wielding killer on their cars , which is the logo for ICP ’s label , Psychopathic Records ) .
Personally , I dig Juggalos and think they ’re funny in a weirdo - cool kind of way , which why I was highly amused by this clip I found on YouTube recently of the local Juggalo known as Spooky Z Tha Gravedigguh .
Besides being a rabid follower of ICP , the dope dude likes to unleash wicked raps and horrific hip - hop verses in much the same fashion as his heroes Violent J and Shaggy 2
Dope while dressed in brutal - looking costumes .
He ’s not the only one of his kind , however , as there ’s a whole crew of PHX rappers like Spooky Z who rock the same kind of hip - hop style as ICP or other artists on Psychopathic Records like Twiztid , Blaze Ya Dead Homie , and Boondox .
They go by monstrous monikers like Ajax , JJ SoSik , or the Darkside Immortals , and usually can be found hanging out and performing at the Monstar Shop , 3619 West Camelback Road ( pretty much the official hangout and headquarters for Juggalos here in Phoenix ) .
The shop ’s holding a killer concert this weekend headlined by Native American rapper and Psychopathic artist Anybody Killa , with additional performances by dEwBi , JJ SoSik , Darkside Immortals , Goodfella Tiny , Kronik C , and Ajax .
Spooky Z will also be rapping at the show , in addition to celebrating the release of his latest album Poetry of Worms .
The show starts at 6 p.m. , and tickets are $ 12 ( there 's also a free in - store signing session at 2 p.m. ) .
Check out this gonzo video where Spooky relentlessly pimps the gig while dressed in what I ’m assuming is his usual performance costume of a mohawked leather skull mask .
( He also manages to run a decapitated head through a saw and waves a knife around in between the plugs ) .
As a bonus , here ’s some footage of a previous ABK in - store session ...
… as well as a video of the rapper doing his thing at the Monstar Shop in 2006 .
Conserving biodiversity must be considered when developing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation , researchers warn in today 's edition of Science .
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is currently discussing ways of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ( REDD ) in developing countries .
REDD has great potential to deliver benefits for biodiversity and people , as well as for the climate .
However , it is likely that these benefits will be concentrated in forests with high carbon stocks and that land use change may shift to low - carbon forests and other ecosystems important for biodiversity .
Dr Lera Miles , lead author and Acting Head of the Climate Change and Biodiversity Programme at the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre ( WCMC ) , said : " Land use change , mostly deforestation , accounts for 18 - 25 % of global annual greenhouse gas emissions .
We support the initiative to conserve forests , which will help to address this growing problem as well as maintain valuable habitats ; however , we are concerned about potential unintended negative impacts on some ecosystems .
" If forests are protected through REDD without addressing the underlying causes of forest clearance , such as increasing demand for food , then some clearance of natural ecosystems will simply shift to other areas and different habitats will be destroyed . "
Dr Miles and her colleague and co-author of the paper Dr Valerie Kapos , Visiting Fellow at the University of Cambridge and Senior Advisor at UNEP - WCMC , suggest that a shift in the focus of conservation investment may be needed to counteract these potential side effects of REDD .
Increased conservation focus may be needed on forests with lower carbon density , which would be less valuable in carbon terms , but still rich in biodiversity , and on non-forest ecosystems such as savannahs , grasslands and wetlands , which would also be under increased pressure .
Dr Kapos said : " Currently , much conservation investment is focused on species - rich tropical forests .
A successful REDD mechanism would direct far more funds to tropical forests than are currently available for biodiversity conservation .
We suggest that in such a scenario , strategies for conservation investment will need urgent re-thinking .
" The climate change convention has agreed to a trial period for testing approaches to REDD , which presents an important opportunity to assess the magnitude of potential unintended impacts .
Conservation scientists and practitioners need to assess the potential consequences of REDD for biodiversity , and to communicate clearly their findings .
Decision - makers will need to take these findings into account as REDD evolves towards a global agreement . "
The 2007 statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations indicate that from 1990 to 2005 the world lost 3 % of its total forest area , some 13 million hectares per year .
The greatest losses were in Latin American and the Caribbean ( 7 % over 15 years or about 16 million hectares per year ) Africa ( 9 % over 15 years or 4.4 million hectares per year ) .
Land use change ( mostly deforestation ) accounts for 18 - 25 % of global annual greenhouse gas emissions .
McCain now backs offshore drilling , was against Republican changes postion yet again for votes
After years of being against offshore drilling , John McCain has changed his position and now proposes lifting the ban on offshore drilling as part of his plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil .
" The stakes are high for our citizens and for our economy , and with gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon , many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far - off plans of futurists and politicians , " McCain will say Tuesday in Houston , Texas , according to excerpts of his speech released by his campaign .
" We have proven oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the United States .
But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production .
And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use . "
McCain 's plan , like President Bush 's that was defeated , would let individual states decide whether to explore drilling possibilities .
During his last run for the presidency , in 1999 , McCain supported the drilling moratorium , and he scolded the " special interests in Washington " that sought offshore drilling leases .

Fast - moving black holes leave behind hole - less galaxies .
Are some super - massive black holes screaming through the Universe at speed ?
NASA
A black hole 600 million times the mass of the Sun has been kicked out of the centre of a distant galaxy , according to research from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany .
The first - of - its - kind observation , if confirmed , would be a long - awaited validation for theorists .
It has long been predicted that when massive black holes merge with each other they can cast off so much energy that they recoil with enough speed to escape their resident galaxy .
But an earlier search for evidence of such runaway massive black holes turned up disappointingly empty ( see Static holes defy theory ) .
If such black holes are running wild in intergalactic space , then some galaxies should no longer have black holes at their centres .
That would raise many questions for astronomers , who have come to believe that black holes are crucial in controlling the growth of galaxies .
Stefanie Komossa , an astrophysicist at Max Planck , says her team got lucky in spotting the black hole among thousands of interesting candidates in the astronomical database produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
" It instantly stuck out as something very special and unusual , " says Komossa , lead author of the study , which will be published on 10 May in The Astrophysical Journal1 .
They think the escapee is moving at 2,650 kilometres per second .
Super massive
Black holes , objects with such strong gravitational pull that light can’t escape , often form when ordinary stars collapse .
But these pale in size and mass to the ' super - massive ' black holes ( SMBHs ) that lie at the centre of most galaxies and that grow as they devour stars .
They can also grow when two of them collide during the merger of two galaxies .
For decades , general relativity theorists have tried to simulate the complicated ' death spiral ' of merging SMBHs .
The final moments of the merger carry huge amounts of momentum , which should be able to exert a significant kick on the merged black hole .
Early simulations showed maximum kick velocities of a few hundred kilometres per second — fast enough to eject black holes from small dwarf galaxies .
But in the past few years , newer models , which include the spins of the SMBHs , show that the black holes should be able to recoil at thousands of kilometres per second — fast enough to escape the tug of galaxies of any size .
The report from Komossa ’s team is the first observation of this — an " enormous validation " for the theorists , says Scott Hughes , an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
" The smoking gun analogy really works , " he says .
" This is the recoiling gun . "
Well spotted
Komossa looked for the kicked black hole by examining wavelengths of light emitted by gases that swirl around black holes just before being swallowed .
Theory supports the idea that a kicked black hole carries some gas with it and leaves some behind in the galaxy .
Komossa found evidence for two separate portions of such gas , and measured the difference in speed between them , producing a likely candidate for a fast - moving black hole .
She says that the kick probably happened in the past million years , because otherwise , the recoiling black hole would run out of glowing material to eat up .
In that time , the black hole may have travelled several thousand light years , she says .
Komossa hopes to corroborate the discovery with a follow - up observation by the Hubble Space Telescope , which has high enough resolution to spot a spatial difference between the galaxy and its black hole .
Something to see here
The result does more than just please the modellers .
Astrophysicists have been planning missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ) , which would measure the subtle ripples in space caused by faint gravity waves .
But they do n’t know how common gravity - wave producing events , such as black - hole mergers , really are .
Komossa ’s result gives LISA ’s proponents some assurance that there will something to detect .

Also , SMBHs are intimately tied to the evolution of galaxies .
They release jets of energy that can shock gas nebulae , turning on the gravitational collapse of gas that leads to star formation .
Astronomers have noticed a reliable correlation : the bigger the SMBH , the bigger the bulge of stars in the core of the galaxy .
If galaxies without black holes at their centre turn out to be relatively common , then explaining galaxy formation and evolution could become problematic .
Astronomers are excited by the result , but are eager to see some corroboration .
Erin Bonning , a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , last year conducted the study that turned up no signs of such fast - moving holes , and says the computer algorithm she used missed this particular one .
“ It is making us wonder what else we may have missed , ” she says .
She says that Komossa ’s data and analysis seem sound .
“ It ’s the most convincing thing I ’ve seen to date . "

McCain ’s flourishing flip - flop list
Update :
This post has been updated , expanded , and broken down by category .
Just to follow - up briefly on Michael ’s guest - post from yesterday , Sen. John McCain ’s ( R - Ariz . ) new - found opposition to Roe v.
Wade is rather remarkable , even for him .
In 1999 , McCain was in New Hampshire , campaigning for the GOP nomination as a moderate .
He proclaimed himself a pro-life candidate , but told reporters that “ in the short term , or even the long term , I would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade . ”
He explained that overturning Roe would force “ women in America to [ undergo ] illegal and dangerous operations . ”
Yesterday , campaigning for the GOP nomination as a conservative , McCain said the opposite .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask one question about abortion .
Then I want to turn to Iraq .
You ’re for a constitutional amendment banning abortion , with some exceptions for life and rape and incest .
MCCAIN : Rape , incest and the life of the mother .
Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So is President Bush , yet that has n’t advanced in the six years he ’s been in office .
What are you going to do to advance a constitutional amendment that President Bush has n’t done ?
MCCAIN : I do n’t think a constitutional amendment is probably going to take place , but I do believe that it ’s very likely or possible that the Supreme Court should — could overturn Roe v.
Wade , which would then return these decisions to the states , which I support … .
Just as I believe that the issue of gay marriage should be decided by the states , so do I believe that we would be better off by having Roe v.
Wade return to the states .
The old McCain did n’t want an amendment and did n’t want Roe overturned .
The new McCain completely disagrees with the old McCain .
It ’s worth noting that politicians ’ opinions on abortion can , and often do , “ evolve ” over time .
Dick Gephardt and Al Gore , for example , both opposed abortion rights before eventually becoming pro-choice .
With this in mind , McCain ’s unexpected shift may simply reflect yet another pol whose thinking has changed over time .
Or , far more likely , McCain is once again abandoning any pretense of consistency and integrity , and is now willing to say literally anything to win .
Let ’s return , once again , to McCain ’s flourishing flip - flop list , which is now a Top 11 list .
* McCain criticized TV preacher Jerry Falwell as “ an agent of intolerance ” in 2002 , but has since decided to cozy up to the man who said Americans “ deserved ” the 9/11 attacks .
( Indeed , McCain has now hired Falwell ’s debate coach . )
* McCain used to oppose Bush ’s tax cuts for the very wealthy , but he reversed course in February .
* In 2000 , McCain accused Texas businessmen Sam and Charles Wyly of being corrupt , spending “ dirty money ” to help finance Bush ’s presidential campaign .
McCain not only filed a complaint against the Wylys for allegedly violating campaign finance law , he also lashed out at them publicly .
In April , McCain reached out to the Wylys for support .
* McCain supported a major campaign - finance reform measure that bore his name .
In June , he abandoned his own legislation .
* McCain used to think that Grover Norquist was a crook and a corrupt shill for dictators .
Then McCain got serious about running for president and began to reconcile with Norquist .
* McCain took a firm line in opposition to torture , and then caved to White House demands .
* McCain gave up on his signature policy issue , campaign - finance reform , and wo n’t back the same provision he sponsored just a couple of years ago .
* McCain was against presidential candidates campaigning at Bob Jones University before he was for it .
* McCain was anti-ethanol .
Now he ’s pro-ethanol .
* McCain was both for and against state promotion of the Confederate flag .
* And now he ’s both for and against overturning Roe v. Wade .
It ’s not exactly a newsflash that McCain is veering ridiculously to the right in a rather shameless attempt to reinvent himself , but Dems should take advantage of the situation and help establish the narrative now .
Despite his rather embarrassing record of late , we still have major media figures telling the public that “ no one would accuse McCain of equivocating on anything . ”
Now is the time to begin characterizing McCain — accurately — as a man with no principle beliefs .
Dems should not only criticize McCain ’s constantly evolving opinions on nearly everything , they should openly mock him for it now , so that the storyline becomes second nature ( like the GOP did with “ serial exaggerator ” Al Gore ) .
The nation is seeing McCain 2.0 , and we like the old one better .
Is Idaho ’s Walt Bayes just another Republican homophobe running for office ?
Or is this candidate a highly - placed operative of the international homosexual conspiracy ?
Walt Bayes , who gained notoriety two years ago by going on an anti-abortion hunger strike that lasted 59 days , said he wasnt sure how the issue could be handled other than providing different facilities for gay and straight students in schools .
The topic came up after Bayes mentioned it in his campaign literature , where he wrote ,  It is absolutely wrong to force any student to share the same bathrooms and showers with homosexual teachers or students . …
Bayes said that when he was 18 it would have been an absolute catastrophe for him to have showered with girls .

“ Rape is Like Being Force - Fed Chocolate Cake ” Blogs BNP Official
Not only can blogging wage war on your health , but public figures are getting in trouble for their online opinions .
The BNP ’s Nick Eriksen learnt this the hard way last week , after he was sacked as the party 's London Assembly candidate for publishing jaw - droppingly obtuse views on rape on his blog .
The post has since been removed , but luckily journalists were quick to spot the following :
" Rape is simply sex ( I am talking about ' husband - rape ' here ) ...
Women enjoy sex , so rape cannot be such a terrible physical ordeal …
To suggest that rape , when conducted without violence , is a serious crime is like suggesting force - feeding a woman chocolate cake is a heinous offence . ”
Yeah .
Whoa .
Londonist wants to know how someone with these kinds of views can have possibly gotten as far as Eriksen has in government : up until now , his blog has been either ignored or praised by fellow BNP leaders , including one entry in 2005 describing career women as “ unnatural and vile . ”
Eriksen claimed his commentary sought to “ stimulate debate ” .
Almost 80 % of rapes are “ acquaintance rapes , ” or sexual acts forced upon women by someone they know .
Partner / husband rapes are the most common , and according to a 2000 British Crime Survey , strangers were responsible for a mere 8 % of the rape victims surveyed .
So no , Eriksen , rape is not exactly , nearly , or approximately anything remotely like eating cake , and whoever the perpetrator is , rape is by definition violent , and is never “ simply ” sex , whether or not it is instigated by a husband .

Producing local condoms will help preserve the world 's largest rainforest
The Brazilian government has begun producing condoms using rubber from trees in the Amazon .
The health ministry says the move will help preserve the largest rainforest in the world .
It will also cut dependence on imported contraceptives , which are given away to fight Aids .
The Brazilian government has one of the biggest programmes in the world to distribute free condoms in the fight against the disease .
The new state - run factory is in the north - western state of Acre , and will initially produce 100 million condoms a year , which will be known by the name Natex .
Officials believe that not only will it generate income for Amazon residents , but it will involve using a product which is widely available and can be obtained without destroying large areas of the rainforest .
The latex will come from the Chico Mendes reserve , an area named after the famous conservationist and rubber tapper who was shot dead in 1988 by local ranchers .
The factory will benefit at least 500 families and provide 150 jobs in the town of Xapuri which has a population of around 15,000 people .
The health ministry says the condoms will be the only ones in the world made of latex harvested from a tropical forest , and will reduce the reliance on foreign imports .
The Brazilian government says it is the world 's largest single buyer of condoms , purchasing more than a billion of the contraceptives in recent years to give away free as part of the country 's national programme to combat Aids .
The policy , which is at its most visible during the Carnival period , has often been criticised by Catholic bishops who say it only encourages promiscuity .

What are these ?
Can Americans ever be this free ? -- Picture courtesy Wikipedia
by blogSpotter
Why are Americans so prudish ?
There are many reasons to wonder .
Europeans are more relaxed in every respect with regard to body image .
They have topless beaches and the European men are much more inclined to wear skimpy Speedos , regardless of body shape .
When I was in Europe , I watched a bit of " Euro TV " in various hotels -- sometimes late at night , or during the day between museum forays .
I was amazed that they showed what we would consider R-rated movies for general audiences after 10:30 PM .
Even the daytime TV commercials showed more than Americans see at a peep show .
The same relaxed attitude also extends to print media , where Europeans flaunt what they have in weekly news magazines aimed at the general public .
In Amsterdam , one of the nicest most historic canal streets is in the " red light " district .
They do n't see a need to set aside any other area for “ the world ’s oldest profession ” .
Americans are prudes by any measure .
American men wear boxy , down - to - the - knee swim suits .
Women have even flirted with a return to one - piece suits -- Hello Miss America 1923 .
We fastidiously put V - chips in every TV and have several agencies that enforce censorship and movie ratings .
America has a few nude and topless beaches , but they 're more the subject of silly jokes than serious sunbathing .
Magazines with adult content are in wrappers or covers partially concealed and proof of age is required to buy one .
Red light districts are usually in a bad , physically remote part of town -- somewhere near docks or warehouses .
That people might " have needs " is seen as a heinous evil that should only ever be met with monogamous , marital coupling and prayer sessions if needed .
Particularly the American South ( the " Bible Belt " ) has a problem with things like sexually oriented businesses , massage parlors and condom stores .
Mind you , the presence or need of such things has n't gone away -- America simply chooses to indulge its appetites privately , furtively , under the cloak of darkness .
A part of the American psyche says , " It 's not a sin if I do n't get caught " .
The very concept of " getting caught " , that sex is a crime -- is American as Apple pie .
When you think about it , we ’re not much better than the Communist Chinese , who claim to have eradicated all sexual promiscuity in their country with Socialist ideals .
We ’ve just done it with Jesus ( and as effectively , which is to say not at all ) .
How did we get to be this way ?
We were founded by an assortment of chaste religions -- Puritans , Amish , Shakers and Quakers .
The irony is that our nation was founded on secular principles but the secularity was more to protect religions from each other than to banish them per se .
We were and still are an amalgam of strongly - felt religions , where Europeans are becoming bored and blasé with their own monolithic and traditional religions .
In America , Christian soldiers have forged onward with crazed determination while in Europe , sophisticates have become cynical and agnostic ; they give alms and say prayers more to satisfy cultural expectations than to satisfy a burning spiritual need .
Will America ever be less uptight about sex ?
Can we ever “ get real ” about human nature and the human condition ?
It may well come to pass , but we will probably have to be as old as Europe and as burned by religion as they have been .
Rome was n’t built in a day , and the Church of Rome did not lose its glorious patina all in a day .
Can sex and spirituality coexist in the same philosophical plane ?
I think so , but Americans will have to learn to “ think different ” to borrow from an Apple commercial .

Lehman ( LEH ) CEO Dick Fuld has another rumor to deal with today ... but this one might help the stock price .
The New York Post , citing anonymous sources , is reporting that Lehman 's management is mulling a privatization plan .
Exactly how the deal would work remains unclear , but in a report released yesterday , a Fox - Pitt bank analyst suggested that Lehman could go private at a 25 % premium to its current stock price .
Lehman 's shares have tumbled 79 % so far this year and 37 % last week on rumors of insolvency .
30 % of outstanding equity is held by employees .
The Post :
Details on how such a take - private maneuver might work are not clear .
However , the rationale is that the free - fall in Lehman 's shares , which tumbled as much as 15 percent yesterday , is attracting hungry vultures hoping to snap up the ailing fixed - income shop on the cheap .
" The idea is why sell to someone else at so cheap a price when they could buy themselves , " noted one source .
If the reports are true , they suggest that Lehman employees and insiders are confident enough in the firm 's position to want to redouble their bets .
Then again , it could all just be a ploy by LEH management to try and prop up a stock price that is circling the drain .

In a way , W. is very different from the cocky , know - nothing , chip - on - his - shoulder “ Bully Bush ” I followed on his maiden European tour in 2002 .
His disdain for Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder , and theirs for him , was bristlingly clear .
He told the bemused French that he ’d heard tell from Jacques about their “ fantastic food , ” and he lectured the bewildered Germans , as though they were thick on the subject , that Saddam was evil because he “ gassed his own people . ”
This time , he left the heavy lifting on Afghanistan to the more popular Laura Bush , while he hung out with French , German and Italian leaders he likes .
“ Your Eminence , ” he told the pope , “ you ’re looking good . ”
Angela Merkel dodged when asked at a press conference whether she would miss W. , but said she liked being able to “ call a spade a spade with him . ”
He enthused that “ German asparagus are fabulous , ” and wryly told a Paris audience that “ my hair is a lot grayer , ” assuming that the French , with their history of foiled colonialism , would know why .
He seemed , all these years later , intent on spiritual absolution .
In other ways , however , W. was not very different .
He was still pushing , but more softly , the same refrain that turned Europe so virulently anti-American : his muscular proselytizing that sometimes military power is necessary to break up terror networks , and that there is “ a moral obligation ” to extend “ a more hopeful and compelling vision ” of democratic ideals to “ provide our security and to spread the peace . ”
Europeans overwhelmingly agree with Scott McClellan , the former Bush press secretary , that this approach amounts to “ coercive democracy , ” and that the administration ’s “ compelling vision ” on Iraq was undergirded with a brazenly untruthful and cynically manipulative propaganda campaign .
On the illicit rush to war , W. ne regrette rien .
He reiterated a rhetorical sop to those who yearn for a scintilla of remorse , telling The Times of London that his gunslinging talk made him seem like a “ guy really anxious for war , ” and that phrases like “ dead or alive ” and “ bring them on ” “ indicated to people that I was , you know , not a man of peace . ”
The Bushes have a hard time with the connective tissue between words and actions .
In this case , the words , while dime - store Western , were not the problem .
The actions were the problem .
W. was really anxious for war .
He felt that if he could change Middle East history , he could jump out of his father ’s shadow forever .
A Democratic lawmaker who saw the president in the Oval Office recently and urged him to bring the troops home from Iraq quickly recounted that W. got a stony look and replied that 41 had abandoned the Iraqis and thousands got slaughtered .
“ I will never do that to them , ” 43 said .
Sounds like Oedipal déjà vu all over again .
Thought - provoking articles about our ancient history and the importance of our creation in God 's own image and fall from grace .
Each new false religion of the post - Flood period has sought to detract from our Creator and from our responsibilities in this life ; evolution 's effect is no different and it ( macro- evolution ) continues to lack any scientific substance .
Pray about this !
And study as needed , especially since the media continues to report this issue inaccurately .
Please study the plethora of Biblical and scientific knowledge standing squarely against this spiritual deception .

As a couple of folks pointed out -- I have interchanged " production " and " usage " in this post incorrectly - - however , China 's 2007 cement exports were only 33 million tons out of 1.3 billion tons produced .
So , at least for China , production is a good proxy for demand / consumption .
My apologies for the mistake .
This post updates Stuart 's post about this two years ago ( and yes , it 's still a graph that will blow you away ! ) with two more years of USGS cement data , 2006 and 2007 .
The growth in China , from 1 GT to 1.3 GT in two years is mindboggling , even India and Russia are interesting ... and there 's more to think about under the fold .
Cement is mainly used to make concrete , and is sort of the " active ingredient " in concrete - it is combined with sand and gravel in roughly fixed proportions .
So cement production can be considered a rough proxy for the total amount of construction going on in a country .
Annual production of cement by country in billions of metric tons .

Source : USGS 2006 report ( PDF ) and the USGS 2008 report ( PDF ) .
Also interesting is the percentage of the world 's production of cement that China took up in 2007 ( 50 % ) compared to 2004 ( 42.5 % ) ; some of this can no doubt be due to preparation for the Olympics , but that surely cannot not be all of that growth can it ?
Also note that other countries ( perhaps the " developing world ? " ) seems to be using less of the total proportion of cement used .
Some things we learned from the comment thread from Stuart 's post a couple of years ago :
Remember , in China , oil is n't used in cement production .
In the " clinker " stage , it 's all coal .
In the blending stage it 's electricity ( which is generated 80 % from coal in China ) .
And cement production in China is inefficient .
There are hundreds of small plants , both wet and dry processes , and the local environmental impact is severe .
Making a pound of cement releases a pound of CO2 .
And a Gigaton or two ?
This also is n't a new phenomenon .
This link shows data back to 1999 that illustrated that China has been at this for quite a while , but perhaps not to this extent .
To conclude , here is the percent change of production bar graph from 2005 to 2008 .
Think about what all that means in terms of energy .

Anatomical Theatre : Depictions of the Body , Disease , and Death in Medical Museums of the Western World
Anatomical Theatre is a photographic exhibition documenting artifacts collected by and exhibited in medical museums throughout Europe and the United States .
The objects in these photos range from preserved human remains to models made from ivory , wax , and papier mâché .
The artifacts span from the 16th Century to the 20th , and include examples from a wide range of countries , artists , and preparators .
The photographs in this exhibition were taken by Joanna Ebenstein , a New York - based photographer and designer , on the course of a one - month pilgrimage to the famed medical museums of the Western World .
On the course of the trip , she visited museums in England , Scotland , Hungary , Italy , Austria , The Netherlands , and the United States ( see full list of museums here ) ; at each , she interviewed curators or keepers , and photographed both behind - the - scenes and in the museum exhibit areas .
Anatomical Theatre is a traveling exhibition ; it debuted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham 's Alabama Museum of the Health Sciences in September 2007 .
It was supported in part by a Reynolds Associates Research Fellowship in the History of the Health Sciences fellowship .
Its next destination has yet to be determined .
THE PHOTOGRAPHER WOULD LIKE TO THANK : Heather Chaplin , Tara Cunningham , James Edmonson , Richard Faulk , Megan Fitzpatrick , Michael Flannery , Pam Grossman , Eric Huang , Laura Lindgren , Susannah McDonald , Evan Michelson , Mike Johns , Gerard Newland , Rosamond Purcell , Stefanie Rookis , Michael Sappol , Gretchen Worden , as well as the curators at all the museums I visited who so graciously opened their institutions to me and my camera .

Speeding up Firefox :
I used to be a dedicated IE ( Microsoft Internet Explorer ) guy .
I liked the way it worked .
Recently , though , I 've fully switched over to Firefox .
I 've had Firefox installed before , but I still used IE as my default browser , until one day I saw the light .
I imported all my favorites and settings into Firefox , and set it as my default browser .
I have no regrets about this .
Firefox just is the better browser , for many reasons .
Firefox is faster and more secure than other browsers .
Tests have been done to prove this .
During some of these experiments , IE crashed so hard that it could n't even complete the test .
There are also so many things you can do to customize it to make it do everything the way you want it to .
From around the net you can find Add-ons and Skins for Firefox to change or add to the power or just to change the look .
To tell you something funny , I 've actually found a few skins that make Firefox look exactly like IE ( myFireFox 2.0.0.10 ) , for those who are going to miss it .
Firefox also comes built in with a spell - checker .
This is when you 're typing Ramblings , for example , it underlines the words you got wrong in red , same as Word , and gives you choices of the correct spelling .
This also comes paired with auto completing .
Firefox detects fields such as " Email : " and " Name : " and lets you know that you can let Firefox fill those in for you .
There are some great tools out there that you stick onto Firefox as Add - ons to aid you in your web development .
I know that if there was a problem in my code and I tried the page with IE , it would tell me so .
In Firefox it would actually tell me the type of problem ( whenever possible ) and the line in the code that it occurs in .
This is one of the many benefits of the 2 add - ons I have installed : Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar .
Firefox now is the most popular browser used in the world .
I can partially prove this by what I see through Google Analytics .
More than 65 % of the visitors to my websites use Firefox , while the remaining 35 % use other browsers including IE .
After some time of using Firefox steadily , I do start noticing how much faster it is , and the greater ease of browsing the World Wide Web .
Tabbed browsing is also done better in Firefox .
You can even get an Add - on to make it even more better - der -er .
I 've done it and it 's superb .
One part of Firefox tabs is what I enjoy the most .
Do you even accidentally close a tab ?
We all do , but in Firefox you have a sub-section in the history where you can recover " recently closed tabs " .
Them Firefox developers are amazing !
For more information , you can always do a search on the " benefits of Firefox " .
You 'll be amazed at all the good things you find in the results .
There are probably many more that I have n't discovered yet , but I 'm sure we 'll all hear about it in the comments , along with your recommendations and experiences with Firefox .

WHY do some people reach their creative potential in business while other equally talented peers do n’t ?
After three decades of painstaking research , the Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck believes that the answer to the puzzle lies in how people think about intelligence and talent .
Those who believe they were born with all the smarts and gifts they ’re ever going to have approach life with what she calls a “ fixed mind - set . ”
Those who believe that their own abilities can expand over time , however , live with a “ growth mind - set . ”
Guess which ones prove to be most innovative over time .
“ Society is obsessed with the idea of talent and genius and people who are ‘ naturals ’ with innate ability , ” says Ms. Dweck , who is known for research that crosses the boundaries of personal , social and developmental psychology .
“ People who believe in the power of talent tend not to fulfill their potential because they ’re so concerned with looking smart and not making mistakes .
But people who believe that talent can be developed are the ones who really push , stretch , confront their own mistakes and learn from them . ”

Just outside Butte , Montana lies a pit of greenish poison a mile and a half wide and over a third of a mile deep .
It has n’t always been so – it was once a thriving copper mine appropriately dubbed “ The Richest Hill in the World . ”
Over a billion tons of copper ore , silver , gold , and other metals were extracted from the rock of southwestern Montana , making the mining town of Butte one of the richest communities in the country , as well as feeding America ’s industrial might for nearly a hundred years .
By the middle of the twentieth century , the Anaconda Mining Company was in charge of virtually all the mining operations .
When running underground mines became too costly in the 1950’s , Anaconda switched to the drastic but effective methods of “ mountaintop removal ” and open pit mining .
Huge amounts of copper were needed to satisfy the growing demand for radios , televisions , telephones , automobiles , computers , and all the other equipment of America ’s post - war boom .
As more and more rock was excavated , groundwater began to seep into the pit , and pumps had to be installed to keep it from slowly flooding .
By 1983 , the hill was so exhausted that the Anaconda Mining Company was no longer able to extract minerals in profitable amounts .
They packed up all the equipment that they could move , shut down the water pumps , and moved on to more lucrative scraps of Earth .
Without the pumps , rain and groundwater gradually began to collect in the pit , leaching out the metals and minerals in the surrounding rock .
The water became as acidic as lemon juice , creating a toxic brew of heavy metal poisons including arsenic , lead , and zinc .
No fish live there , and no plants line the shores .
There are n’t even any insects buzzing about .
The Berkeley Pit had become one of the deadliest places on earth , too toxic even for microorganisms .
Or so it was thought .
In 1995 , an analytic chemist named William Chatham saw something unusual in the allegedly lifeless lake : a small clump of green slime floating on the water ’s surface .
He snagged a sample and brought it to biologist Grant Mitman at the nearby Montana Tech campus of the University of Montana , where Mitman found to his amazement that the goop was a mass of single - celled algae .
He called in fellow Tech faculty Andrea and Don Stierle , experts in the biochemistry of microorganisms .
The Stierles had recently been trekking about the northwest , looking for cancer - fighting compounds in local fungi with great success .
Coincidentally , the Stierles ’ funding had just run out , and they needed a new project .
They leapt at the opportunity to study these bizarre organisms .
After examining the slime under a microscope , the researchers identified it as Euglena mutabilis , a protozoan which has the remarkable ability of being able to survive in the toxic waters of the Berkeley Pit by altering its local environment to something more hospitable .
Through photosynthesis , it increases the oxygen level in the water , which causes dissolved metals to oxidize and precipitate out .
In addition , it pulls iron out of the water and sequesters it inside of itself .
This makes it a classic example of an extremophile .
Euglena mutabilis
Extremophiles are organisms that can tolerate and even thrive in environments that will destroy most other living things .
Some can even repair their own damaged DNA , a trait which makes them extremely interesting to cancer researchers .
The Stierles reasoned that where there ’s one extremophile , there may be others – most likely blown in by the wind .
Given their previous successes with strange microorganisms , the researchers believed that the Berkeley Pit and its fledgling extremophile population could produce some medically useful chemicals .
The Stierles were so intrigued by the possibilities that they started work even before securing funding .
A squadron of expert researchers was recruited from the undergrads at Montana Tech , and even from a local high school .
They collected water samples , isolated microorganisms , and cultured them .
The team eventually identified over 160 different species , but they lacked the equipment needed to isolate the interesting chemicals from the microorganisms .
Shlepping around western Montana , the Stierles begged and borrowed time at other facilities while they doggedly processed the cultured organisms .
Their tenacity led to the discovery of a number of promising chemicals .
Three of these , berkeleydione , berkeleytrione , and Berkeley acid , came from species of the fungus Penicillium that had never been seen before , and were therefore named after the Berkeley Pit .
The next step was to see what effect these chemicals had , if any , on other living cells .
Thanks to modern biochemical assay techniques , dozens of chemicals can be tested against one organism⁠ — or one chemical against dozens of organisms⁠ — in a single pass .
For reasons that are not entirely clear , many compounds which attack cancer cells are also harmful to brine shrimp , therefore most modern assay tests include the brine shrimp lethality test as a standard procedure .
The Stierles exposed swarms of tiny crustacean volunteers to the Berkeley Pit chemicals , and to their delight , five of the chemicals showed anti-cancer properties .
Further tests revealed that berkeleydione helped slow the growth of a type of lung cancer cell , and Berkeley acid went after ovarian cancer cells .
All five were passed along to the National Cancer Institute for further study .
Other researchers are looking into the Pit as well – not for cancer - fighters or other drugs , but simply for ways to help clean the place up .
In 1995 , a flock of migrating snow geese stopped at the massive pond for a rest , and at least 342 of them died there .
Authorities now use firecrackers and loudspeakers to scare away migrating waterfowl , but there have been a few smaller die - offs nonetheless .
Also , on certain mornings , a sinister mist creeps out of the Pit and wraps its tentacles around the streets of Butte .
Citizens are understandably anxious about this potentially poisonous fog of doom .
The water level is rising at a rate of several inches a month , and if unchecked it will spill over into the area ’s groundwater in twenty years .
That danger has earned the area the dubious distinction of being one of the EPA ’s largest Superfund sites .
Normally such water is treated by adding lime to the water to reduce the acidity and remove much of the metal , however the Berkeley Pit is so saturated with undesirables that this process would produce tons of toxic sludge every day .
Other methods are safer , but are prohibitively expensive .
Currently , the EPA ’s plan is to focus on containment .
Grant Mitman believes that the best way to clean up the Pit is to use the algae that already live there .
E. Mutabilis , for one , tends to grow in clumps .
These clumps clean up their neighborhoods enough for other extremophiles to move in .
These organisms would collect the metals within their own cells , and upon dying they would sink to the bottom and drag the metals with them .
To Mitman , it ’s all a matter of finding the right mix of extremophiles for a self - sustaining algal colony .
Once the right mix is found , there are many other mine - contaminated waters awaiting treatment that could use a similar biology - based cleanup .
With metals concentrated at the bottom , and cleaner water at the top , the Pit could conceivably be reopened .
The bottom sludge could be collected and processed for its ever - more - valuable metal content , and the water could be used for industry or agriculture .
While it might not be safe to drink , the water could still be worth a quarter million dollars a year in a water - hungry West .
In the meantime , the Pit has become a popular tourist attraction .
There ’s a small museum and gift shop located well above the water level .
A number of National Historic Landmarks related to mining are in the area , which has prompted some people to call for the creation of a National Park centered on the Pit .
With luck , what was once the Richest Hill in the World could eventually provide riches of a different sort .
· Plan said to be response to American missile shield · No reaction from Havana to newspaper report
Russia is said to be considering the use of bases in Cuba as a refuelling point for its nuclear bombers , in a move reminiscent of the 1962 missile crisis .
The move would be in retaliation for the Bush administration 's plan to site a missile defence shield in Europe .
Russia says America 's proposal for the shield in Poland and the Czech Republic poses a direct threat to its security .
Citing a " highly placed military source " , a report in Monday 's Izvestiya said the Kremlin wanted to use Cuba as a base for its long - range Tu-160 and Tu-95 strategic nuclear bombers .
" While they are deploying the anti-missile systems in Poland and the Czech Republic , our long - range strategic aircraft already will be landing in Cuba , " the source told the paper .
No final decision on landing bombers in Cuba had been taken , it added .
In 1962 Nikita Khrushchev , Russia 's then leader , attempted to site nuclear missiles on the Caribbean island .
His aim was to lessen the then strategic nuclear gap with the US .
He eventually backed down and withdrew the missiles .
The US secretly removed its missiles from Turkey .
Izvestiya is owned by Russia 's state gas giant Gazprom and reflects official thinking .
It is frequently used by the Kremlin as a vehicle for leaking information .
The possible use of Cuba as a nuclear base dominated yesterday 's Russian newspapers .
Komsomolskaya Pravda said " our bombers " could be stationed under America 's " belly " , threatening the US in the same way it threatens Russia .
But Russia 's defence ministry poured cold water on the report yesterday .
" Russia , guided by its peaceful policy , is not creating military bases at the borders of other states , " Russian news agencies quoted Ilshat Baichurin , acting head of the defence ministry 's information department , as saying .
US and European diplomats also played down the report , saying they did not regard the threat as realistic even though General Norton Schwartz , who has been nominated as the US air force commander , warned on Tuesday that such a move by Moscow would amount to crossing a dangerous threshold .
Russian defence analysts told the Guardian there was little strategic point in using Cuba as a base and the idea seemed to have been floated to irritate the US .
Russia 's nuclear aircraft have a range of up to 1,900 miles , allowing them to fire a nuclear missile at the US from much further away than Cuba , defence expert Pavel Felgenhauer said .
It was unclear yesterday whether Cuba had agreed to Russia 's proposal .
In a brief note on a government website , Fidel Castro said his brother Raúl , Cuba 's president , was wise not to respond to the report .
Most observers believe that the president would be unlikely to agree to any request from Moscow .
Do n't let them deceive you with their fancy topographic buzzwords , and smartypants search algorithms .
They just use these , and have people who move them really really fast as you click .
Seriously .

This article was first published in 2008 .
What do you do if it ’s 1941 , your country has just entered a war , and there ’s an urgent need for an engine to propel a tank – an engine you do n’t have ?
If you are the Chrysler Corporation , you develop a design that uses five of your six cylinder car engines , arranged around a common crankcase .
The result was 30 cylinders , 21 litres and an output of 470 hp at just 2700 rpm !
If Chrysler had started from scratch to design a tank engine , they would have developed an engine that was nothing like the A57 Multi-Bank .
But the need for speed – both in design and production – made use of existing tooling and design obligatory .
The starting point was the L - head , 4.12 - litre in - line six .
A slightly revised cylinder head reduced the compression ratio to 6.2:1 from the standard engine ’s 6.8:1 , but production Dodge carburettors were retained .
The five engines were arranged around a cast iron crankcase , with each ‘ sub engine ’ being geared to a common ring gear .
A single central shaft handled all the output .
Using existing tooling and designs were the cylinder blocks , pistons , connecting rods , crankshafts and cylinder heads .
Another advantage of the design was its compact shape ; important in the rear - engine tank installation .
The prototype engine had major difficulties with carburetion ; the differing lengths of the intake tracts made carburettor synchronisation and fuel distribution problematic .
The carbs were moved so that they all sat at the same level ( also improving accessibility ) and sheet metal guides were inserted in induction pipes to improve fuel distribution .
The placing of the carburettors on the same plane also simplified the throttle linkages and air cleaner .
The distributors , that on the original engines were positioned alongside the mid-point of the engines , were moved to the end of the camshafts .
The camshaft of each sub-engine was driven by gears instead of the chain used on the donor car engine .
The prototype engines used five separate water pumps belt - driven from the crankshaft pulleys , but because of the lack of individual flywheels , the belts were subjected to alternating loads and belt life proved short .
Given that a tank engine must be extremely reliable , the decision was made to use a single water pump driven by an accessory shaft located in the central crankcase .
Dry sump lubrication was used with an oil cooler .
Complete with radiator , cooling fan and clutch , the Multi-Bank weighed a considerable 5244 lb ( 2384kg ) .
The engine was used in the M3A4 and M4A4 Sherman tanks .
What an amazing piece of engineering !

Members of the Crossville , TN Chapter of The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster have installed a giant Flying Spaghetti Monster statue outside The Cumberland County Courthouse in Crossville , Tennessee .
Here ’s a statement from the group :
We are lucky enough to live in a country that allows us , its citizens , the freedom of speech .
I have chosen to put up a statue of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to represent the discourse between people of all different beliefs .
The many faiths , ethnicities , and backgrounds of Cumberland County ’s residents make our community a stronger richer place .
I respect and am proud that on the people ’s lawn , the county courthouse , all of these diverse beliefs can come together in a positive dialogue .
Here , we are all able to share the issues close to our hearts whether it is through a memorial to the soldiers killed fighting for our country , the Statue of Liberty honoring our nations welcoming promise to all , a group ’s fight to stop homelessness or powerful symbols of faith .
I greatly treasure this open forum between everyone in the community .
The Flying Spaghetti Monster is a pile of noodles and meatballs , but it is meant to open up discussion and provoke thought .
Being able to put up a statue is a celebration of our freedom as Americans ; a freedom to be different , to express those differences , and to do it amongst neighbors even if it is in a noodley way .
Genomic imprinting is a mechanism that regulates gene expression in the developing fetus and plays a major role in regulating its growth .
Research published in Nature Genetics by a team of international scientists has established an identical mechanism of genetic imprinting which evolved 150 million years ago .
" This paper shows that we share a common genetic imprinting mechanism which has been active for about 150 million years despite the differences in reproductive strategies between marsupials and humans , " said Professor Geoffrey Shaw of the Department of Zoology at the University of Melbourne , a coauthor on the paper .
The study was a large team effort involving researchers in the UK , from the Babraham Institute , the University of Manchester , the Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge , in Australia , from the University of Melbourne , and the USA , from the University of Texas at San Antonio ( all part of the Sequence Analysis of Vertebrate Orthologous Imprinted Regions ' SAVOIR ' consortium ) .
Professor Marilyn Renfree who lead the University of Melbourne research team says marsupials give birth to very small young that develop mainly within the pouch while humans have more developed young at birth that undergo a large period of growth in the uterus .
" Our team provided vital samples and genetic resources from marsupials to enable this study and contributed our world - leading expertise on marsupial biology and genomics to the interpretation of the results , " Professor Renfree said .
" We all carry two copies of every gene in our DNA , one inherited from our mother and one from our father .
So for each gene we have a ' back - up ' .
Normally , both copies of the gene are used for development , but in some special cases the gene from either our mother or father is switched off , so we only have one active copy .
This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting , " explained Dr Andrew Pask also from the Department of Zoology .
" Because there is no back up copy , when errors occur in this process , it results in many human genetic diseases mainly affecting growth and brain function . "
Pask explains that a key gene regulating fetal growth is the Insulin - like - growth - factor - 2 or IGF2 which is an imprinted gene .
" We inherit a single working copy of this gene from our fathers , while the copy we inherit from our mothers is switched off .
The switch for this gene is controlled by another gene known as H19 .
The H19 gene is unusual gene that makes a microRNA and not a protein . "
" MicroRNA genes have been sought in marsupials for years , and now for the first time one has been discovered , " Dr Pask said .
Pask explains that the microRNA structure is virtually identical to that of mice and humans , but there was no evidence of this gene or a similar microRNA in the more distantly related platypus .
" Understanding how genetic imprinting evolved is important , " said Dr Shaw , " It helps us to determine how the mechanism works and what we can do to avoid the development of a number of human diseases . "

Steel flashes and blowtorches glow as 20,000 workers build a $ 10 - billion university ordered up by a king who hopes Western ingenuity will revive the economy of this ultraconservative Muslim nation .
When finished next year , King Abdullah University of Science and Technology will offer coed classes , Western professors , a curriculum in English and other touches loathed as dangerous liberalism by Islamic fundamentalists .
The West may be dependent on Saudi crude , now as high as $ 145 a barrel , but this campus outside an ancient fishing village is recognition that the country that is home to Islam ’s holiest shrines needs the likes of USC , Oxford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to survive globalization .

Saudis have studied in the U.S. and Europe for decades , bringing back expertise without directly exposing the kingdom to Western classrooms and professors .
But the new university is inviting the secular
West a step closer in another ideological battle between Saudi reformers led by King Abdullah and the Wahhabi sect of puritanical Islam that has resisted outside influences since the days of desert caravans .
“ Saudis are beginning to realize they are not the center of the universe , ” said Tariq Maeena , a writer and aviation expert .
“ The king hopes that a young Saudi will be in a class with an American professor .
The king is jabbing the conservatives from all sides .
He ’s not doing it with a massive decree , but incrementally , and all the radicals can do is roll their eyes and say , ‘ Uh - oh , we ’re losing more power . ’ ”
Amira Kashgary , a literature professor at a women ’s college , said , “ We are part of the global world now .
Whether we like it or not , and regardless of our political and religious systems , there are changes seeping through our lives .
“ The radicals ran a wicked Internet campaign against the university .
They said it is another sign liberals are invading us . ”

The kingdom ’s huge oil reserves cannot mask Saudi Arabia ’s problems : 40 % of its population is younger than 18 , its schools are backward and its economy is not diverse enough to compete in a high - tech future balanced between the West and the rising powers of China and India .
King Abdullah is building the university , along with six multibillion - dollar Economic Cities , to provide jobs and open the country to global markets .
Conservatives fear that these international voices , from South Asian construction workers to Western scientists , will change the religious fabric .
“ Men and women learning together should remain forbidden , ” said Mohammed Ben Yehia Nogeemy , a member of the Saudi Juristic Academy , a religious organization that issues fatwas .
He said that such an atmosphere could be regarded as sedition and “ if any Saudi official has the intention to allow the establishment of a coeducational university , that will be a big mistake that will need to be corrected . ”
But the king , for now , is a step ahead of the conservatives .
Nogeemy was not in attendance on a recent afternoon when oil money seduced brainpower at a hotel along the Red Sea in Jidda .

Silver trays of hors d’oeuvres and alcohol - free champagne glided through a crowd of Western academics gathered for a conference on the university ’s goals .
Soldiers with Humvees and .50 - caliber machine guns stood guard outside to scare away would - be terrorists , while inside mathematicians and molecular biologists tried on blue university ball caps and pocketed Lamborghini pens left on seats as gifts .
The university , known as KAUST , is promising academic freedom , the mixing of cultures and religions , and subjects as varied as nanotechnology and crop development .
The country ’s ubiquitous and often abusive morality police will not patrol the campus , depicted on the university ’s interactive website with unveiled women .
Going unveiled is a crime in Saudi society that could lead to lashings and imprisonment .
KAUST will be “ a new house of wisdom , ” Ali Ibrahim Naimi , the Saudi minister of petroleum and mineral resources , told the guests .
He said world research projects and the Saudi economy , with a 12 % unemployment rate , would benefit from the “ easy flow of ideas and people into and out of the region . ”
To ensure that , KAUST is not under the jurisdiction of the Education Ministry , which is controlled by fundamentalists and often forbids the teaching of music , art and philosophy .

The project is overseen by Aramco , the Saudi oil company founded by U.S. firms in the 1930s .
Aramco has experience in creating a parallel world :
In its gated communities in the eastern part of the country , alcohol is available but hidden , there ’s a pee- wee baseball winter carnival , and Western women drive cars , a practice forbidden to Saudi women .
With a chocolate - scented cigar in one hand and a honey - flavored coffee in the other , Maeena sat in his favorite Jidda cafe , nodding hellos to young men with laptops and waiters who know his preferences .
This is the world he likes , a place to write , a den of intellectual freedom in Saudi Arabia ’s most liberal city .
He said KAUST , which is being built 50 miles north of the cafe , is another sign that the country ’s religious and ideological barriers are weakening .
“ It ’s an act of opening us up to a better side of education , ” said Maeena , who , like many of his generation , attended college in the U.S. “ The West has planted those seeds of liberalism in me and thousands like me .
We were young Saudis educated in the West in the ‘ 60s , ‘70s and ‘ 80s , but this slowed as the seeds of fundamentalism took hold here in the 1990s . ”

The Saud family ’s alliance with the Wahhabis dates to the 1700s , but the most recent wave of fundamentalism intensified in the 1980s and was fueled by anger over U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia after the 1991 Persian Gulf War , leading to terrorist attacks .
When militants struck in the kingdom after the Sept. 11 attacks , the government began cracking down on Wahhabi religious schools and radical preachers .
Abdullah has not moved as swiftly as many reformers would like -- Wahhabis control the courts , and ultraconservative members of the royal family hold key government posts , including the Interior Ministry .
“ The king is older and does n’t have a lot of time , ” said Maeena , a columnist for the Arab News .
“ Every good Saudi says , ‘ I pray for the king ’s long life . ’
He is our hope .
We were a pariah nation after Sept. 11 , and he ’s slowly taking us out of this . ”
Samar Fatany , a radio commentator , said of the fundamentalists , “ They are the ones who want to make us live in the dark ages of camels and caravans and tents . ”

But conservatives remain powerful .
They desire Western scientific and technological advances , but want nothing to do with democracy , women ’s rights , religious rights and other cultural freedoms that cloud the Wahhabi goal of evoking the centuries - old golden era of Islam .
That vision was less threatened when the students of Maeena ’s generation went abroad to study .
Now , with the new university rising , Nogeemy wants the professors to find separate lives , like the Aramco oil engineers before them .
“ I do not fear any creeping Western influence , ” he said , “ because Westerners who come to Saudi Arabia are experts of very high caliber who live in isolated communities where they can maintain their own culture . ”
Of the university , Nogeemy said , “ We can tolerate that a male professor teaches female students .
. . .
There would not be sedition there .
But male and female students should not be together . ”

After the alcohol - less cocktail party at the hotel in Jidda , the Western academics and their Saudi hosts retired .
The slide shows that whirled with DNA - like designs were put away , and Sami M. Angawi , an architect , drove through the streets wondering whether the university would melt into the community or become another gated pocket of Western ideals .
Angawi stopped his car at a hospital he had designed .
It was after midnight .
The building did n’t look like a hospital ; one hallway resembled the nave of a cathedral , another opened to a mosque , and another to a courtyard bright with moonlight .
His intent , he said , was to mix different styles into one voice , to allow architectural nuances from one culture to seep into another .
“ To just implant a foreign university here will not work , ” he said .
“ What do we do with it ?
Put fences around it ?
We do n’t allow it to interact with the rest of Saudi society ?
Advertisement
“ Do we just want science without culture ?
Does science grow without culture ?
You have to have a unity .
Without interaction you create polarization , and with that the extreme will grow more extreme . ”
The sliding doors opened and Angawi stepped from the stone floor back into the night .

During the 2008 presidential race , John McCain ’s online team has often used web video to get the candidate ’s major campaign themes out onto the internet .
But an offhand verbal riposte by one of the members of that team has turned into a viral video that ’s providing just the kind of attention they do n’t want .
It ’s reviving the idea that the Republican presidential candidate is clueless when it comes to technology .
Speaking at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York Monday , McCain deputy e-campaign director Mark Soohoo responded to a comment about McCain ’s self - professed computer illiteracy by saying that McCain is " aware of the internet . "
The comment , caught on video and uploaded to the web on Tuesday by Micah Sifry , one of the two organizers of the conference , quickly made the rounds on the web and on Twitter .
It eventually provided fodder for one of CNN ’s regular off - beat stories done by its national correspondent Jeanne Moos , who took to the streets to conduct an unscientific survey of what Americans both young and old thought of McCain ’s computer illiteracy .
Everyone but one person interviewed agreed that McCain should know how to use a computer .
One woman exclaimed : " Oh , that ’s absolutely ridiculous . "
Even Hu Jintao , China ’s president , surfs the web .
To be fair , what this online branding obscures is the fact that McCain is probably more familiar with , and better versed than most of the roster of the 2008 presidential candidates on the nuances of telecommunications and internet policy because of his work as a longtime member and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation — work for which he has received frequent praise from consumer advocacy groups and think tanks .
So with all this in mind , take our poll .
Explain your vote in the comments section .
San Jose , California - 10 Apr 2008 : Computer memory that combines the high performance and reliability of flash with the low cost and high capacity of the hard disk drive could be closer than you think , thanks to a team of IBM ( NYSE : Computer memory that combines the high performance and reliability of flash with the low cost and high capacity of the hard disk drive could be closer than you think , thanks to a team of IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) scientists .
In two papers published in the April 11 issue of Science , IBM Fellow Stuart Parkin and colleagues at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose describe both the fundamentals of a technology dubbed " racetrack " memory as well as a milestone in that technology .
This milestone could lead to electronic devices capable of storing far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today , with lightning - fast boot times , far lower cost and unprecedented stability and durability .
Within the next ten years , racetrack memory , so named because the data " races " around the wire " track , " could lead to solid state electronic devices – with no moving parts , and therefore more durable – capable of holding far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today .
For example , this technology could enable a handheld device such as an mp3 player to store around 500,000 songs or around 3,500 movies – 100 times more than is possible today – with far lower cost and power consumption .
The devices would not only store vastly more information in the same space , but also require much less power and generate much less heat , and be practically unbreakable ; the result : massive amounts of personal storage that could run on a single battery for weeks at a time and last for decades .
" It has been an exciting adventure to have been involved with research into metal spintronics since its inception almost 20 years ago with our work on spin-valve structures , " said Dr. Parkin .
" The combination of extraordinarily interesting physics and spintronic materials engineering , one atomic layer at a time , continues to be highly challenging and very rewarding .
The promise of racetrack memory - for example , the ability to carry massive amounts of information in your pocket - could unleash creativity leading to devices and applications that nobody has imagined yet . "
IBM is no stranger to creating entirely new markets that spring from exploratory research such as this .
Just a few of the many game - changers invented at IBM Research include the memory chip , the hard disk drive and the relational database .
Currently , there are two main ways to store digital information : solid state random access flash memory , commonly used in devices such as mobile phones , music players and digital cameras , and the magnetic hard disk drive , commonly used in desktop and laptop computers and some handheld devices .
While both classes of storage devices are evolving at a very rapid pace , the cost of storing a single data bit in a hard disk drive remains approximately 100 times cheaper than in flash memory .
While the low cost of the hard disk drive is very attractive , these devices are intrinsically slower and , with many moving parts , have mechanical reliability issues not present in flash technologies .
Flash memory , however , has its own drawbacks – while it is fast to read data , it is slow to write data , and it , too , has a finite lifespan .
Flash , can be reused only a few thousands of times because it eventually breaks because it is slightly damaged by each use or " rewrite . "
Since racetrack memory has no moving parts , and , rather than storing data as ensemble of electronic charge , uses the " spin " of the electron to store data , it has no wear - out mechanism and so can be rewritten endlessly without any wear and tear .
A closer look at racetrack
For nearly fifty years , scientists have explored the possibility of storing information in magnetic domain walls , which are the boundaries between magnetic regions or " domains " in magnetic materials .
Until now , manipulating domain walls was expensive , complex , and used significant power to generate the fields necessary to do so .
In the paper describing their milestone , " Current Controlled Magnetic Domain - Wall Nanowire Shift Register , " Dr. Parkin and his team describe how this long - standing obstacle can be overcome by taking advantage of the interaction of spin polarized current with magnetization in the domain walls ; this results in a spin transfer torque on the domain wall , causing it to move .
The use of spin momentum transfer considerably simplifies the memory device since the current is passed directly across the domain wall without the need for any additional field generators .
In the review paper that describes the fundamentals of racetrack , " Magnetic Domain - Wall Racetrack Memory , " Dr. Parkin and colleagues describe the use of magnetic domains to store information in columns of magnetic material ( the " racetracks " ) arranged perpendicularly or horizontally on the surface of a silicon wafer .
Magnetic domain walls are then formed within the columns delineating regions magnetized in opposite directions ( e.g. up or down ) along a racetrack .
Each domain has a " head " ( positive or north pole ) and a " tail " ( negative or south pole ) .
Successive domain walls along the racetrack alternate between " head to head " and " tail to tail " configurations .
The spacing between consecutive domain walls ( that is , the bit length ) is controlled by pinning sites fabricated along the racetrack .
In their paper , the scientists describe their use of horizontal permalloy nanowires to demonstrate the successive creation , motion and detection of domain walls by using sequences of properly timed nanosecond long spin-polarized current pulses .
The cycle time for the writing and shifting of the domain walls is a few tens of nanoseconds .
These results illustrate the basic concept of a magnetic shift register relying on the phenomenon of spin momentum transfer to move series of closely spaced domain walls – an entirely new take on the decades - old concept of storing information in movable domain walls .
Ultimately , the researchers expect the racetrack to move into the third dimension ( 3D ) with the construction of a novel 3D racetrack memory device , a paradigm shift from traditional two - dimensional arrays of transistors and magnetic bits found in silicon - based microelectronic devices and hard disk drives .
By moving into the third dimension , racetrack memory stands to open new possibilities for developing less expensive , faster devices because it is not dependant on miniaturization as dictated by Moore ’s Law .
Racetrack memory : in the fast lane
Dr. Parkin ’s advances with racetrack memory build on his prior accomplishments in memory technologies including the spin valve , and Magnetic Tunnel Junctions ( MTJs ) and breakthroughs in magnetic RAM ( MRAM ) .
Racetrack memory encompasses the most recent advances in this realm , the field of metal spintronics .
The spin-valve read head enabled a thousand - fold increase in the storage capacity of the hard disk drive in the past decade ; the MTJ is in the process of supplanting the spin-valve because of its higher signal .
MTJs also form the basis of modern MRAM , in which the magnetic moment of one electrode is used to store a data bit .
Whereas MRAM uses a single MTJ element to store and read one bit , and hard disk drives use a single spin-valve or MTJ sensing element to read the approximately 100 GB of data in a modern drive , racetrack memory uses one sensing device to read 10 to 100 bits .
Further understanding of the interaction of spin polarized current with magnetic moments is essential .
" For example , this might allow a reduction in the current density needed to manipulate or move domain walls , " said Dr. Parkin .
" This would drop the power needed for racetrack further , and enable even lower power devices .
We expect that our exploration of a wide variety of materials and structures will provide new insight into domain wall dynamics driven by current , making possible domain wall based memory and even logic devices that were previously inconceivable .
It will not only change the way we look at storage , but the way we look at processing information .
We 're moving into a world that is more data - centric than computing - centric . "
MIT researchers have developed a novel technique to measure the strength of the bonds between two protein molecules important in cell machinery : Gently tugging them apart with light beams .
" It 's really giving us a molecular - level picture of what 's going on , " said Matthew Lang , an assistant professor of biological and mechanical engineering and senior author of a paper on the work appearing in the June 30 advanced online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
Last fall , Lang and others demonstrated that light beams could be used to pick up and move individual cells around the surface of a microchip .
Now they have applied the optical tweezers to measuring protein microarchitectures , allowing them to study the forces that give cells their structure and the ability to move .
The researchers focused on proteins that bind to actin filaments , an important component of the cytoskeleton .
Depending on the arrangement and interaction of actin filaments , they can provide structural support , help the cell crawl across a surface or sustain a load ( in muscle cells ) .
" We 're trying to understand how nature engineered these molecular linkages to use in different ways , " said Lang .
Actin filaments are most commonly found either bonded or crosslinked by a much smaller actin binding protein .
The researchers studied the interactions between the proteins by pinning one actin filament to a surface and controlling the motion of the second one with a beam of light .
As the researchers tug on a bead attached to the second filament , the bond mediated by the actin - binding protein eventually breaks .
With this technique , the researchers can get a precise measurement of the force holding the proteins together , which is on the order of piconewtons ( 10 ^ - 12 newtons ) .
The same technique could be used to investigate many of the other hundreds of protein interactions that occur in the cytoskeleton , said Lang .
Lead author of the paper is Jorge Ferrer , a recent PhD recipient in biological engineering .
Other MIT authors of the paper are Hyungsuk Lee and Benjamin Pelz , graduate students in mechanical engineering ; and Roger Kamm , the Germeshausen Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Biological Engineering .
Jiong Chen of Stony Brook University and Fumihiko Nakamura of Harvard Medical School are also authors of the paper .
The research was funded by the Nicholas Hobson Wheeles Jr. Fellowship , the W.M. Keck Foundation , and the Westaway Research Fund .
Six Eurovision divas in front of the camera , naked
An ambitious Serbian project gathers six most beautiful Eurovision 2008 women for a special photo session .
Journalist Goran Iovanovic and photographer Zoran Ilic selected six most gourgeous ladies from Eurovision 2008 for a special photo session , which will be published in Alo daily newspaper , and Blitz Puls magazine .
What ’s so special about it , you might wonder .
Well , something you do n’t get every day is that the ladies wear nothing but the national flag of their country .
Just like Marilyn Monroe with the US flag , back in the 40s .
The beauties , invited to participate in the project are Ani Lorak from Ukraine , Kalomira from Greece , Morena from Malta , Joanna from Bulgaria , Charlotte Perrelli from Sweden , and Isis Gee from Poland .
Asked how he decided to kick off this project , Goran said that he would n’t have missed this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , when tens of lovely ladies come to Belgrade .
Goran promised to send over photos , so you will be able to enjoy them pretty soon .
If you are too impatient , and are luckily in Belgrade , have a look at Monday ’s issue of Alo .
Google Gears now works in Mozilla ’s upcoming Firefox 3 web browser .
The company has n’t made an official announcement as yet but the Gears code site lists Firefox 3 support for release candidate two .
A Google spokesman also confirmed it to El Reg today .
Originally dubbed Google Gears , the online apps project had its moniker truncated last month because the internet giant wants it to become a Silicon Valley orgy love - in for cloud computing - obsessed web programmers .
The firm said in a blog post last month : “ We want to make it clear that Gears is n't just a Google thing .
We see Gears as a way for everyone to get involved with upgrading the web platform . ”
Of course , with Gears , Google is also aiming to put a sizeable dent in Microsoft ’s proprietary software kingdom by punting its range of web - based apps including GMail and Google Docs .
Developers at the ubiquitous search engine have also been working on adding support to Opera and Apple ’s web browser Safari .
Gears already supports Internet Explorer and Firefox on Windows , Mac and Linux platforms .
Meanwhile , Firefox 3 is expected to arrive at some point this month . ®
Broadband services and speeds are ranked higher than any other " new " service when it comes to their importance to consumers .
New survey results from Pike & Fischer Broadband Advisory Services show that while HDTV and digital phone service were important to some consumers , high - speed data came out ahead of the rest .
The report , titled " Communications Industry Survey : Views on the U.S. Economic and Regulatory Climate , " is being presented at the company 's Broadband Policy Summit IV taking place in Washington , DC this week .
Pike & Fischer asked some 280 executives , engineers , and consultants from the cable , phone , satellite TV , broadcast , and technology equipment industries of their opinions on the appeal of various services to customers .
When asked to rank a number of " advanced communications services " on a scale of one to five ( five being the highest ) , almost 40 percent of Pike & Fischer 's survey respondents gave high - speed data the highest rating .
Comparatively , only about 25 percent ranked HDTV as high , and digital phone service was at the bottom of the list , with under 10 percent ranking it a five .
Of course , " fast " Internet access means something a little different in the US than it does in other countries .
A recent report by Akamai pointed out that countries like South Korea , Japan , and Hong Kong all have relatively high percentages of broadband connections over 5 M bps ( 64 , 48 , and 35 percent , respectively ) , while only 20 percent of US connections fall into that category .
When it comes to just " fast " connectivity ( over 2 Mbps ) , the US ranked at number 24 in the list — South Korea once again came out on top , followed by Belgium and Switzerland .
This data came about a year after a survey performed by the Communication Workers of America , which said that the average download speed in the US was a mere 1.9 Mbps .
These results were " deeply troubling , " according to the CWA , even though certain states ( such as Kansas , New York , and Rhode Island ) had averages that were considerably higher than the national average .
The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation presented data at the same time , however , that said the average download speed in the US was 4.8 M bps — still lower than Canada , many western European countries , Japan , and Korea — but more than twice as fast as CWA 's numbers .
Despite this difference , it 's clear that the US has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to broadband speeds .
Pike & Fischer points out the fairly obvious ( to us geeks , anyway ) : without high broadband speeds , millions of other features being offered to us by cable companies and telcos will have a harder time getting off the ground .
" This suggests to us that , while multichannel video providers may be spending a lot of their ad dollars promoting their high - def channels and their ' triple - play ' bundles , they still rely on their broadband speeds to seal the deal with customers , " Pike & Fischer Broadband Advisory Services Scott Sleek said in a statement .
" Every one wants to claim that they offer the fastest Internet access , and believe that will be more important to customers than how many HD channels they offer . "

Explanation : What do Saturn 's rings look like from the other side ?
From Earth , we usually see Saturn 's rings from the same side of the ring plane that the Sun illuminates them .
Geometrically , in the above picture taken in April by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn , the Sun is behind the camera but on the other side of the ring plane .
This vantage point , specifically 17 degrees above the ring plane , gives a breathtaking views of the most splendid ring system in the Solar System .
Strangely , the rings have similarities to a photographic negative of a front view .
The ring brightness as recorded from different angles indicates ring thickness and particle density of ring particles .
Elsewhere , ring shadows can be seen on the sunlit face of Saturn , shown sporting numerous cloud structures in nearly true color .

Retelling of Florida 's 2000 Election Debacle Condenses 36 Days of Aborted Democracy into 2 Hours of Taut , Heartbreaking Political Suspense
... And Yet , the Lessons Continue to be Ignored ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/28/2008 , 1:05 am PT
I do n't mind admitting it .
For an Election Integrity journalist , HBO 's Recount is pure pornography .
Anticipation for Sunday 's Memorial Day premiere showing was at the top of last weekend 's holiday agenda .
And the excitement grew still more late Friday when the good folks of PDA Florida made my week ( my month ?
my year ?
my last four eight years ? ) by sending me an actual Palm Beach County " CES Votomatic III " voting booth , one which they tell me was among the 24 used in HBO 's film itself .
Since I have a very difficult time paying the bills around here --- contrary to popular opinion , election integrity blogging is n't the windfall it might otherwise appear --- perhaps I 'll consider the kind gift a reward for my too - many years on this beat .
Though perhaps my consolation prize would be a better way to look at it .
When I first opened it , actual chads ( HBO 's film advises the plural of " chad " is actually " chad " ) from the 2000 election spilled out of the machine all over the office floor .
The gods of democracy and the goddess of the Butterfly Ballot were taunting me .
I rather enjoyed it .
I learned long ago that I 'd have little choice .
So it was with great anticipation that I sat down on Sunday night to watch the film as it premiered , along with the " Diebold Document Whistleblower " ( and my new colleague at VelvetRevolution.us )
Steven Heller and his wife , and Robert Carillo Cohen , one of the filmmakers of HBO 's landmark documentary , the Emmy - nominated Hacking Democracy which enjoyed a re-airing earlier in the day , as the cable net set the stage for its newest democracy thriller / heart - breaker , Recount .
None of us , including Heller , who anticipated hating the fictionalized re-telling of America 's crushing democratic abortion of 2000 , would be disappointed ...
As it turns out , HBO seems to have gotten just about all of it right from a factual standpoint .
At least from the perspective of someone who followed those extraordinary 36 days incredibly closely both during and since , as the country hung in limbo as if , yes , dangling by a chad .
There was quite a bit of nuance packed in to the two fast - paced hours , even down to the dirty machinations of Florida 's corrupt and soulless Rep.
Tom Feeney who played a minor , but key role in both the film and the stolen election .
Getting it right , or close to it , is apparently no small feat , since even the New York Times , the " paper of record " , was unable to do so even in their review of the film , seven years after they covered the actual events , and six years after they correctly wrote , " If all the ballots had been reviewed under any of seven single standards ... Mr. Gore would have won . "
Never mind history though , now for the Times it 's the revisionistic : " Mr. Bush would have come out slightly ahead , even if all the votes counted throughout the state had been re-tallied . "
( For the record , the Times was right six years ago , here 's the evidence [ PDF ] , and wrong last week . )
While time has done few favors for the Times , the historical distance , and time - compression of the two hour film , managed to capture the thrilling , exhausting and disappointing back and forth , up and down roller coaster of the original saga --- while identifying the players who deserve much of the thanks for the failure to count every vote accurately , as per the voters ' intent , or even at all --- in what was finally democracy lost .
Among the players targeted for failing to ensure the proper administration of democracy : then - Democratic Vice - Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman , who the film identifies as having almost single - handedly allowed hundreds of military ballots to be counted for George W. Bush despite any evidence whatsoever that any of them were actually cast prior to the close of polls on November 7th , 2000 .
While I had been aware of the Gore campaign foolishly rolling over to the cynical and opportunistic GOP attempts to bully them , by painting them as anti-troop --- based on their eventually - abandoned premise that all counted ballots should actually be legal ones --- I had n't drawn a direct bead on Lieberman for blowing that call .
If the filmmakers were accurate in that depiction , then it looks like one of John McCain 's biggest supporters in 2008 had been undermining Democratic White House ambitions long ago .
Given the film 's familiar outcome , no small amount of credit is due the filmmakers who were able to succeed in having a room of jaded ( understatement ) election buffs still rooting for the good guys to pull it out this time around .
( Without giving too much away , they did n't .
Gore was still named the loser , despite having received more votes in Florida in 2000 than Bush [ PDF ] , even after tens of thousands of legal minority voters were excluded from voting at all , merely because their names sounded something like others who had purportedly been convicted of a felony at one time or another . )
The result : a taut , often hilarious , consistently engaging , still - maddening and sick - making political thriller .
History would thank you for watching it .
Again and again .
While the cast was largely superb , and the casting spot -on , there was one character who we were glad to see named , but who was slightly miscast .
That would be our old friend , the entirely corrupt , then - boss of the FL House , Tom Feeney who was , as history , documentation and polygraph test tell us , just finishing up with an attempt at having a piece of vote - rigging software created by a South Florida computer firm where he worked as general counsel and registered lobbyist , even while serving as speaker of Florida 's Legislature .
And , oh yes , he had previously served as Jeb Bush 's running - mate during his first attempt to become the Sunshine State 's governor .
So Feeney has been a long time Friend of the Bush's , and he was in the front lines to award the state , voters be damned , to his Bush pals come hell , high - water or even results showing Bush received fewer votes in the state .
The infamous sleaze of the man --- he 's portrayed cahooting with the Bush campaign and steamrolling the Florida House into legislation that would seat Bush 's electors no matter the decisions of either the FL or US Supreme Courts --- comes through in thuggish spades .
He 's shown doing what he does best ( lying to the media ) , even if the actor who portrays him ( Antoni Corone ) is a large , burly fellow rather than the puny , pathetic little figure / tool of a man that Feeney actually is .
But that 's rather small potatoes , as we appreciated the filmmakers having pulled out the accurate , if oft - overlooked , illustration of a man and a party willing to put power and politics far before country .
The rest of the cast was largely spot on .
Laura Dern , in our opinion , actually underplayed the role of walking caricature , FL SoS Katherine Harris , who 's seen awaking into her dream role as the ultimate GOP power broker able to hand the " victory " to Bush in Florida , while advised by the ever - present Republican lobbyist J.M. " Mac the Knife " Stipanovich ( Bruce McGill ) , who somehow was able to obtain direct access to the inner-sanctum office of the SoS / Co-chair of Bush 's Florida campaign .
That Dern actually underplayed the role --- despite having brought so much camp , the only thing missing was a tent , a sleeping bag and a flashlight --- is a point made strikingly clear during the film 's closing credits as shots of the actual historical players , just portrayed in the film , flash by in dreadful reminder that what we just saw was , sadly , all too real .
The actual Harris , far more camped - out and tramped - out then anyone could possibly play " credibly " , is seen , on horseback , celebrating her rich post - Election theft reward as a new U.S. Congresswoman ( only to fall in disgrace just one Congressional session later ) , out - camping Dern hands down and breasts up .
While Steve Heller was unable to watch much of the film without it driving him crazy ( yes , he and his wife would pay a great personal price for this Administration 's anti-democratic electioneering some years later , as he was forced to fend off felony charges for having been instrumental in revealing that Diebold Inc . 's powerful Republican law firm , Jones Day was instructing the voting machine company on how they might avoid their own criminal charges for lying to the state of California about having secretly and illegally installed uncertified hardware and software in 2004 ) , his wife Michelle was enthralled by the breathless ups and downs of the contest as it played out in the film .
An election junkie herself during the ensuing years , given her husband 's key role in successfully taking on the giants of Diebold and Jones Day in 2004 , if only temporarily , she had n't followed those infamous 36 days quite as closely when they actually played out .
She had no idea , until watching the film , that it had been as insane as all of that .
It was .
Yes , the very real back and forths and ups and downs in the real life saga was as impossibly stunning when they occurred in real time , perhaps even more so , as they come across during the two hour depiction .
I can imagine no Indiana Jones film with as many gasp - inducing twists and turns as this story when it actually played out back in 2000 , and even during its HBO re-telling .
But remember , this is pornography to guys like me .
( Another Election Integrity junkie , Utah 's Barbara Bellows - TerraNova is a bit more critical , and not without reason , for a few important points the film either did n't get exactly right , or otherwise omitted entirely .
Read her less laudatory take on Recount here . )
Hacking Democracy 's Rob Cohen seemed similarly impressed after we watched it together .
He was justifiably pleased that his all - too - real documentary film , which begins with the scuttled 2000 recount , may have helped pave the way at HBO for the Recount theatrical film .
Both films cover the - 16,022 votes ( that 's negative 16,022 votes ) that were discovered as tallied for ( actually against ) Al Gore on optical - scan voting systems in Volusia County , Florida .
That negative number would lead to Gore 's original concession on Election Night , followed by his infamous un-concession an hour or so later after the " error " was discovered .
More on that machine , and Volusia 's continuing use of them , even still in 2008 , was published by M.C. Moewe at Daytona News - Journal over the weekend .
Moewe has been diligently trying to get to the bottom of that failure in Diebold 's op - scan system for years .
She writes in her article this weekend , which used Recount to help further the largely untold and almost wholly un-investigated story of those negatives votes in Volusia :
In Volusia County , the same " crazy " optical scan machines that delivered Gore 's negative vote total are still in use .
The negative votes in 2000 could have been caused by four problems according to internal e-mails written by the machine 's manufacturer , then called Global Election Systems .
A corrupt memory card , an invalid read from a good card , corruption of memory or a card from an " un-authorized source . "
Students at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania won a court battle to keep the e-mails public .
If it was a memory card failure problem , those issues still plague elections here .
...
The agency charged by law to act as a clearinghouse for information on voting systems nationwide , the U.S. Election Assistance Commission , said in November that it could not tell local election officials about the potential problem because a state or local agency had not yet told them .
They still have not been informed , said Commission spokesman Bryan Whitener .
" There is not the slightest bit of authority that this agency has to get information , " Whitener said .
Whitener 's comments , of course , are nonsense .
There is nothing in the EAC 's mandate from the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) --- which created the agency , in part , to serve as a clearinghouse for voting system problems --- that would disallow them from informing states about problems , such as the one that still remains on Diebold op - scan systems littered across the country .
Moewe further informs us , chillingly ...
To figure out what happened [ back in Volusia in 2000 ] , the " second " memory card must be found , according to an e-mail dated Jan. 18 , 2001 , addressed from Talbot Iredale , who is still with Diebold .
" I do know that there were two uploads from two different memory cards , " according to the e-mail .
" The second one is the one I believe caused the problem .
They were uploaded on the same port aprox .
1 hour apart . "
Moewe 's husband , Rogers Cadenhead , a computer programmer who blogged quickly about his wife 's article this weekend , states the obvious : " As a programmer , I 've never understood how Diebold 's voting software accepted negative votes and lowered a candidate 's total .
You'd think the logical impossibility would 've caused the input to be rejected before it altered the course of American history . "
" Logic " had little to do with anything in Florida 2000 , of course .
And that failure in Florida would , apparently , recommend those voting machines made by Global Election Systems ( GES ) to Diebold , Inc. , who is similarly less than concerned about " logic " or security , it seems .
Hacking Democracy goes on to explain that Diebold , shortly after the 2000 election , would acquire GES , the company whose voting system " failed " that night in Volusia .
Neither film is able to definitively explain exactly what happened to cause the miscount , which became the basis for Bush 's cousin at Fox " News " calling the state for Dubya late on Election Night , followed quickly by Gore 's " concession " , and later , the argument made to the Supreme Court that Bush would be " irreparably harmed " if votes were allowed to be counted since the media had already declared him the " winner " .
The documentary film proceeds to reveal that our system is just as vulnerable to hacking and / or error today --- and this coming November --- as it was back then .
It also offers some rather startling evidence for what may have caused that 2000 " anomaly " which has , as Moewe detailed , never been explained by the state of Florida , Diebold , or anybody else .
So what will horrify you about the election system as seen in Recount , is only multiplied when Hacking Democracy informs you that little has changed ... other than things becoming arguably much worse now than they were back then .
Machines similar or identical to the ones that failed on Election Night in Florida , and the ones that Tom Feeney ( who is now a U.S. Congressman ) allegedly attempted to arrange vote - stealing software for , would be deployed across the entire country thanks to the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) of 2002 , legislation created by felonious Republican Rep.
Bob Ney of Ohio and other jailed cronies , in purported reaction to the 2000 debacle .
Hacking Democracy 's Cohen pointed out to me that when they first went to HBO with their documentary , they were told the cable behemoth stayed away from political films .
But that was , perhaps , 20 or 30 Bush approval points ago .
While we 're tens of thousands of dead bodies later , there will never be the apologies due from the Republicans ( including those on the U.S. Supreme Court ) who tragically put party and power over country in Florida in 2000 , and the Democrats who allowed it to happen .
As Kevin Spacey 's character Ron Klain , who headed the recount for Gore 's team , says tearily into the phone near the end of Recount --- the actor , clearly informed by the 7 years of carnage that have occurred since then --- he " just could n't get 'em counted , Mr. Vice President . "
HBO could not have picked a more tragically appropriate day , Memorial Day , to premiere their new film .
It will be airing constantly over the next several days and via OnDemand .

Remember that some life insurance types impact your overall tax situation .
For example , whole life insurance or universal life insurance are typically the best for a single individual , as the growth of cash in these policies is tax - deferred as long as your deposits do n’t violate the maximum tax accrual rules .
When you are married , a permanent joint last - to - die life insurance policy might work very well .
It pays out a tax - free benefit to the policy owner ’s beneficiary when the second spouse registered on the policy passes away .

Reader hominid. todd says that a Google rep emailed him about the long - awaited status of the Browser Sync extension for Firefox 3 .
Turns out they 're discontinuing development on it .
Here 's Google 's response to hominid. todd 's inquiry :
The clock 's ticking down till Tuesday June 17th , when the final version of Firefox 3 will be ready …
Thanks for trying out Google Browser Sync and for all of your feedback .
It was a tough call , but we decided to phase out support for Browser Sync .
Since the team has moved on to other projects that are keeping them busy , we do n't have time to update the extension to work with Firefox 3 or to continue to maintain it .
For those of you who want to continue to use Firefox 2 , we 'll maintain support for old versions of Google Browser Sync through 2008 .
After that , we can recommend a few other products that scratch a similar itch .

Here ’s a novel punishment : A Florida judge has sentenced two pranksters to one minute of YouTube shame .
With the popularity of Google ’s video sharing site has come an unfortunate rise in pranks from people chasing their 15 minutes of web fame .
Kids plot , film , and proudly upload their practical jokes – and sometimes , those videos wind up becoming the evidence that ’s used against them in court .
That was the case for two unnamed boys who were arrested after flouting their “ fire in the hole ” stunt .
The gag revolves around pulling into a restaurant ’s drive - through window and ordering a drink ; once the waitress hands you the soda , you yell , “ fire in the hole ” and throw the beverage back in her face .
These scofflaws pulled off the prank last July , soaking Jessica Ceponis at a Taco Bell outside Orlando .
The very clever Ms. Ceponis found the video , anonymously befriended the kids online , and appealed to their hubris to confirm their identities .
After a call to one boy ’s mother , and another to the police , two of the boys in the car ( the 16 - year - old driver and the 15 - year - old videographer ) were arrested on battery and criminal - mischief charges .
On top of their fine and community service , the judge ordered them to post a follow - up video on YouTube .
This apology , which the boys wrote and filmed themselves , had to warn other kids about the consequences of pranks .
( More than 7,300 viewers so far . )
It ’s not the most exciting video , but I like discipline that think outside of the box .
Once the boys have fulfilled their sentence , the charges against them will be dropped – but the YouTube video will live on .

U.S. marshals in New Hampshire have made plans to arrest convicted tax protesters Ed and Elaine Brown of Plainfield , along with their supporters , according to an anonymous Justice Department source who also threatened this author with jail .
“ Anyone who is going to carry out plans killing officers , agents , and government persons after Ed is arrested is in way over their head , ” said the message , which was routed through a proxy server in a failed attempt to obscure its source .
“ If you continue to pursue these threats , you along with several of your fellow Ed supporters are going to jail .
Ed is a convicted felon and several more are going to be rounded up in their stupity [ sic ] . ”
Ed and Elaine Brown stopped attending their tax evasion trial in January saying they could not receive a fair trial .
They were convicted and sentenced in absentia to 63 months in prison each for various charges of tax evasion and money laundering .
Since that time , the couple have remained in their home and vowed to resist with deadly force anyone who attempts to seize them and take them to prison .
Two weeks ago , I said here that while I do n’t believe that shooting federal agents is the appropriate thing to do at this time , I support those who would challenge the income tax laws as they amount to nothing more than theft and slavery , and can never be legitimate , no matter how many judges agree .
How some desk jockey at the Department of Justice confused this with a threat of violence , I ca n’t tell .
Anyway , if you are an Ed Brown supporter , put your affairs in order .
They ’re probably going to try to take you away , too , whether you have made any threats of violence or not .

If I was n't so lazy , I 'd try to fit this to some kind of curve and calculate a maximum with standard deviation and everything .
A while ago I found this comic on xkcd.com
The general idea is that your dating pool increases with age since large age differences turn less creepy the older you get .
If you date someone younger , the creepiness is defined as C = A /2 + 7 , where A is your age and C is the lowest age at which you should date someone .
For someone else dating you , their age must therefore be D = 2 * A - 14 , where A again , is your age , and D is the upper sociably acceptable age of someone you should date .
Therefore , your dating pool should be limited by the numbers C and D , but since C increases with 0.5 per year and D increases with 2 per year , the overall dating pool - size increases with 1.5 years for every year you grow older .
( I am 34 , therefore C = 24 and D = 54 ) .
In all calculations , half ages have been rounded down for maximum creepiness .
So , the dating pool increases , but at some point people start to die off , and the dating pool will start to decrease naturally .
This opened up a profound question for me : I made some calculations using the number of men living in Norway sorted by age ( in one year intervals ) , carefully picked from the norwegian census bureau and combined with some fancy excel / maple magicThe model 's lower boundary is 14 , simply because at that point A = C = D .
The upper boundary is 70 , set by me .
Observations :
The dating pool increases until you get to the age of 44 , where it stalls and falls off as people start to die .
At 70 the whole model seems to break down ( the upper creepiness is larger than any known age for a human , 126 ) .
It shows that the dating pool of men grows until the age of around 45 where it naturally starts to decrease again , but not by much until your upper bound gets so large that people start to die off .
Facts in numbers :
The highest dating pool is at the age of 44 where just over 69 % of the male population is dateable .
The mean dateable population is : 0.493 with a standard deviation of 0.200I fitted the data to a polynomial of fourth degree in Maple and found a maximum at 47.3 years of age .
I 'd also consider doing the chart for women , but I can't see much of a point since the curve will probably take the same shape with a larger tail since the average age of death for women is higher .
In addition , the data shows all men , not just singles , while this conforms more to reality ( people do fuck around while married ) , it is in violation of certain social norms .
I leave it to the reader to consider the importance of this .
It would also be interesting to see such a chart based on statistics from a country with a higher death rate ( average age of around 30 or so ) , but I am uncertain if such is available .
I leave it to future statistics nerds to figure that out .

Cole said Wednesday morning that no major changes were in the works at the NRCC yet .

GOP scrambles after Mississippi loss
Republican
House leaders are scrambling to contain the damage after a third straight special election loss , with NRCC Chairman Tom Cole putting the blame on the party ’s public image and former NRCC Chairman Tom Davis warning of a bloodbath in November if members can’t divorce themselves from the “ brand ” put on their party by President Bush .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner told reporters Wednesday morning that he expected a Republican leadership meeting later in the day would focus on “ changes that may be necessary in order to adapt to the environment that we are dealing with . ”
Advertisement
But sources who attended the “ awkward ” leadership meeting said that not one word was said about the GOP ’s electoral woes or the steps party leaders might take to address them .
Other sources have talked of the possibility of replacing Cole with Davis , who has been critical of the party and of Cole ’s handling of its congressional campaign arm .
But it ’s not clear what Davis , who is retiring from Congress , would gain from the job , and it ’s even less clear that Boehner would want him to have it .
Boehner said Wednesday morning that he had “ no preconceived ideas ” about how the party should respond to Tuesday ’s special election in Mississippi ’s 1st Congressional District , a conservative stronghold where Democrat Travis Childers cruised to an eight - point win over Republican Greg Davis despite more than $ 1 million in NRCC spending and a visit from Vice President Dick Cheney .
Cole said Wednesday morning that no major changes were in the works at the NRCC yet – but he stressed the word “ yet . ”
On a conference call later with reporters , he insisted that the Republican Party itself – and not NRCC strategy – was responsible for the Mississippi loss and earlier defeats in Republican districts in Louisiana and Illinois .
“ When you lose three of these in a row , you have to go beyond campaign tactics , ” Cole said .
“ A large segment of the American public does n't have confidence in the Republican Party to deal with the issues in front of us .
What we have to do is look in the mirror bit and ask how we lost our way . "
Davis downplayed rumors of a coup Wednesday but distributed a “ Where We Stand Today ” memo in which he said the three special election losses were “ canaries in the coal mine , warning of far greater losses in the fall , if steps are not taken to remedy the current climate . ”
“ The political atmosphere facing House Republicans this November is the worst since Watergate and is far more toxic than the fall of 2006 , when we lost 30 seats ( and our majority ) and came within a couple of percentage points of losing another 15 seats , ” Davis wrote .
“ Whether measured by polls , open seats , money , voter registration , generic ballot , presidential popularity or issues , our party faces a steep climb to maintain our current numbers . ”
Davis warned that the Republicans could lose 19 more seats in November if they do n’t find a way to reinvent their brand , which he said is now “ an albatross to our members . ”
“ We do n’t need to abandon long - held principles , but we do need to understand our shortcomings and make appropriate adjustments , ” Davis wrote .
“ It starts with the brand , and the brand is Bush . “
Davis said that Sen. John McCain , by contrast , wo n’t “ drag anyone down ” but ca n’t “ carry anyone over the finish line , ” either .

Foreword
The need of support for handling measurement units does not require any approval .
It is in particular true for the Ada programming language with its stress on safety and maintainability .
The proposed set of packages represents a possible solution of the unit problem .
Dimension checking is performed at run-time , so performance is sacrificed for safety .
However , an attempt was made to reduce performance hit .
The type Measure used to represent dimensioned values can be constrained to a specific unit .
Operations on constrained subtypes of Measure could be potentially as efficient as floating - point operations .
They are declared inlined , so that at least theoretically , a decent compiler could perform discriminant calculation and check at compile time .
The key features of the approach :
The type Unit denotes the dimension of a physical entity .
The type Measure represents a dimensioned value ;
Mixed unit arithmetic .
Values in SI ( Le S ystème I nternational d'Unités ) units can be mixed with irregular units ( such as foot and yard ) as long as the result is defined ;
ystème nternational d'Unités ) units can be mixed with irregular units ( such as foot and yard ) as long as the result is defined ; Shifted unit support ( a widely used instance of a shifted unit is degree of Celsius ) ;
The type Measure is generic , parameterized by a floating - point type .
A non-generic version based on the type Float is also provided ;
String to Measure conversion supports as wide set of irregular units as possible ;
Currently the powers of the base unit components lie in the range - 8..7 .
This limitation has an implementation reason ( absence of 64 - bit modular integers in some Ada compilers ) .
For further discussion of this topic see ;
GTK + widgets for a comfortable visual measurement unit editing and selection .
The rest of the library can be used independently on this part as well as on GTK +.

1. Types
Two types are used for dealing with units .
The type Unit denotes the dimension of a physical entity .
The type Measure represents a dimensioned value it is defined in a generic package Measures which is instantiated with the desired floating - point type as the parameter :
generic
type Number is digits <>;
package Measures is
...
The package Float_Measures is an instance of Measures for the standard Float type : .
1.1 . The type Unit
The type Unit is defined in the package Units .
A value of the type Unit corresponds to a kind of physical entity , like energy , charge or velocity .
The package itself is rather useless , because there are few things one can do with units .
They are :
Exponentiation , the power is an integer ;
Multiplication ;
Division ;
Square root ;
Conversion to String .
Or in Ada terms the following functions are defined :
function " ** " ( Left : Unit ; Right : Integer ) return Unit ;
function " * " ( Left , Right : Unit ) return Unit ;
function " / " ( Left , Right : Unit ) return Unit ;
function Sqrt ( X : Unit ) return Unit ;
Values of the type Unit build a group .
A value of Unit type can be viewed as an unordered set of seven base components ( mass , length , time , current etc. ) .
Each component has integer exponent part .
The function Sqrt is defined for only units which components have even exponent parts .
The exception Constraint_Error is propagated when the result of an operation is illegal .
The package also declares the exception Unit_Error and the type :
type Code_Set is ( ASCII_Set , Latin1_Set , UTF8_Set ) ;
and the procedure :
procedure Split
( SI : Unit ;
Current : out Natural ;
Luminescence : out Natural ;
Temperature : out Natural ;
Mass : out Natural ;
Length : out Natural ;
Quantity : out Natural ;
Time : out Natural
) ;
The procedure returns base unit powers of the argument SI .

1.1.3 . Conversion to ASCII and Latin - 1 strings
The package Units .
Edit provides the function Image is used to convert Unit to String :
function Image
( Value : Unit ;
Latin1 : Boolean := True
) return String ;
The syntax of the result string is :
< result > ::= < list > / < list > | 1 / < list > | < list > | 1 < list > ::= < item > [ <*>< list > ] < item > ::= < base - unit > [ < power > ] < base - unit > ::=
A | cd | K | kg | m | mol | s
Here <*> is either * ( if Latin1 is false ) , or · from Latin - 1 character set .
When Latin1 is false < power > is always ^ < number > .
With Latin - 1 character set enabled , powers 2 and 3 are indicated using the corresponding superscript characters : 2 and 3 .
The following table lists the Latin - 1 characters used for output :
Special characters Character Latin - 1 Meaning 2 B2 16 Power 2 3 B3 16 Power 3 · B7 16 Multiplication operator
1.1.4 . Conversion to UTF - 8 encoded strings
The package Units . UTF8 _Edit provides the function Image used to convert Unit to an UTF - 8 encoded string :
function Image ( Value : Unit ) return String ;
The syntax of the result string is :
< result > ::= < list > / < list > | < list > | 1 < list > ::= < item > [ · < list > ] < item > ::= < base - unit > [ < power > ] < base - unit > ::=
A | cd | K | kg | m | mol | s < power > ::= [ - ] < number > < number > ::= < digit >[ < number > ] < digit > ::= 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
Powers are output as superscript digits .
When all powers are negative , the output uses no fraction but negative powers instead .
For example : m - 2 instead of 1/m2 .
The following table summarizes the list of special characters and their encodings in UTF -8 :
Special characters Character UTF - 8 encoding Code point Meaning 2 C2 16 B2 16 00B2 16 Power 2 3 C2 16 B3 16 00B3 16 Power 3 4 E2 16 81 16 B4 16 2074 16 Power 4 5 E2 16 81 16 B5 16 2075 16 Power 5 6 E2 16 81 16 B6 16 2076 16 Power 6 7 E2 16 81 16 B7 16 2077 16 Power 7 8 E2 16 81 16 B8 16 2078 16 Power 8 9 E2 16 81 16 B9 16 2079 16 Power 9 - E2 16 81 16 BB 16 207B 16 Power - · C2 16 B7 16 00B7 16 Multiplication operator
1.1.5 . Design notes
Some words about the design .
I did n't make the type Unit private because then it could not be used as a discriminant of the type Measure ( see the package Measures ) .
To have Measure discriminated seems to be very important .
It allows to define subtypes of Measure with fixed Unit component .
For the same reason and for performance sake too , Unit is a modular number .
As the result it inherits a number of operations which are disallowed by making them abstract .
In the current implementation the type Interfaces .
Unsigned_32 is used .
This determines the range of the exponent part of a base component as - 8..7 .
With Interfaces .
Unsigned_64 the range would be - 512..511 .
The following fragment of the file units.ads can be modified if the compiler supports modular numbers larger than Interfaces .
Unsigned_32 :
with Interfaces ;
package Units is
--
--
Here we define the type used to represent units .
It should be a
-- modular type with a defined operation Shift_Right .
--
subtype UnitPower is Interfaces .
Unsigned_ n ;
. . .
Rational powers are not allowed , because the choice of base units in SI ensures whole powers of all physical values .
Examples like Schottky - Langmuir equation can be easily written in a correct form with whole powers .
Often it is argued that rational powers might be useful for dealing with intermediate results .
A simple example x = ln ex shows that in general case it can not be done anyway .
1.2 . The type Measure
A value of the type Measure ( defined in the package Measures ) represents some quantity of a physical unit :
type Measure ( SI : Unit := Units. Base .
Unitless ) is record
Gain : Number ;
Offset : Number ' Base := 0.0 ;
end record ;
Measures can be added , subtracted , multiplied , divided and exponentiated .
The type Measure is a discriminated record type .
The discriminant SI has the type Unit .
Its value defines the dimension of a Measure .
Unconstrained instances of Measure can be declared as :
Entity : Measure ; --
May hold value of any measurement unit
. . .
Entity := 5.0 * A / s ; --
Set value 5 A/s
Entity := 3.0 * km ; --
Set value 3.0 km
Entity := Entity + s ; -- Illegal ( km + s ) , Unit_Error
It is possible however , to create constrained subtypes of Measure capable to hold values of only a specific dimension .
For instance :
subtype Speed is Measure ( Velocity ) ;
Car_Speed : Speed ; --
Only velocities are allowed
. . .
Car_Speed := 10.0 * km / h ; -- OK
Car_Speed := A ; -- Illegal , Constraint_Error
The type Measure has two components : Gain and Offset .
To get a SI equivalent of the value one should sum Gain and Offset .
This is what the function Get_Value actually does .
For instance :
Meter : Measure := ( Length , Gain => 1.0 , Offset => 0.0 ) ;
Foot : Measure := ( Length , Gain => 0.3048 , Offset => 0.0 ) ;
The subtype Dimensionless for dimensionless measures .
1.2.1 . Shifted and unshifted Measures
The field Offset of the type Measure defines the value shift .
Measures with zero offset are called unshifted .
They form a field with addition and multiplication operations :
Meter : Measure := ( Length , Gain => 1.0 , Offset => 0.0 ) ;
Foot : Measure := ( Length , Gain => 0.3048 , Offset => 0.0 ) ;
. . .
Meter * Foot -- 0.3048 square meters
Meter +
Foot -- 1.3048 m
Meter ** 2 -- 1 square meter
Most of physical units and all SI units are unshifted .
Shifted measurement units are rare .
Degrees of Celsius and Fahrenheit is an example of shifted units .
The degree of Celsius can be defined as :
Celsius : Measure := ( Temperature , Gain => 1.0 , Offset => 273.15 ) ;
Actually , the field Offset should also be a discriminant of the type Measure .
Unfortunately it is illegal in Ada .
Measures of same dimension and shift form a set closed relatively addition , subtraction and multiplication to a number ( i.e. a group ) .
Therefore :
5.0 * Celsius -- Legal , 5 ºC = 278.15 K
Celsius + Celsius -- Legal , 2 ºC = 275.15 K
Celsius * Celsius -- Illegal , Unit_Error is propagated
In other words , shifted measures can be neither multiplied nor divided , except when a shifted measure is multiplied to or divided by a dimensionless unshifted value as in the first example above .
Note that addition and subtraction are only legal when dimension and shift are same for both operands :
Kelvin : Measure := ( Temperature , Gain => 1.0 , Offset => 0.0 ) ;
Celsius : Measure := ( Temperature , Gain => 1.0 , Offset => 273.15 ) ;
. . .
Celsius + Kelvin -- Illegal , Unit_Error is propagated
Celsius * Kelvin -- Illegal , Unit_Error is propagated
Mixing of differently shifted measures is ambiguous .
In the given example Celsius and Kelvin could be added if one would be converted to another :
Convert ( Celsius , Kelvin ) + Kelvin -- +275.15 K ( unshifted ) = 2ºC
Celsius + Convert ( Kelvin , Celsius ) -- -271.15 ºC ( shifted ) = 2 K
Note that the numeric equivalent of the result depends on whether Celsius is converted to Kelvin or inversely .
Even if two zeros ( 0 ºC and 0 K ) are added the results will differ :
Convert ( 0.0 * Celsius , Kelvin ) + 0.0 * Kelvin -- +273.15 K ( 0ºC )
0.0 * Celsius + Convert ( 0.0 * Kelvin , Celsius ) -- -273.15 ºC ( 0 K )
1.2.2 . Operations defined on Measures
Unary operations :
function " abs " ( Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
function " + " ( Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
function " - " ( Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
Exponentiation :
function " ** " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Integer ) return Measure ;
Multiplication :
function " * " ( Left : Number ' Base ; Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
function " * " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Number ' Base ) return Measure ;
function " * " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
Division :
function " / " ( Left : Number ' Base ; Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
function " / " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Number ' Base ) return Measure ;
function " / " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
Addition and subtraction :
function " + " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
function " - " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
Comparisons :
function " > " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Boolean ;
function " < " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Boolean ;
function " = " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Boolean ;
function " >= " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Boolean ;
function " <= " ( Left , Right : Measure ) return Boolean ;
The equality operator can be applied to any pair of measures .
The inequality operation is implicitly defined by the compiler .
Scale shift ( value destructive ) :
function " and " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Number ' Base ) return Measure ;
The result of scale shift is formed by adding the value of the parameter Right to the field Offset .
Note that the numeric SI equivalent of the result will differ from one of the parameter Left .
For instance :
Celsius : constant Measure := K and 273.15 ; -- 1 ºC ( is not equal to 1 K )
See also the functions Normalize and Shift which perform scale shifts retaining the value .
The exception Constraint_Error is raised by the operations when the corresponding numeric operation does .
This behavior depends on whether Number ’Machine_Overflows is true , as Ada Reference Manual states in 4.5.5 ( 22 ) .
Also Constraint_Error is propagated out of multiplicative operations " * " , " / " and " ** " when the dimension of the result cannot be represented as Unit because of a base unit power overflow .
1.2.3 . Unit conversions
The function Get_Value returns a SI equivalent of the argument :
function Get_Value ( Value : Measure ) return Number ;
The function Get_Value_As returns a numeric equivalent of the first argument in the measurement units defined by the second argument :
function Get_Value_As ( Value , Scale : Measure ) return Number ;
For instance Get_Value_As ( T , Celsius ) returns the value of T in degrees of Celsius .
The arguments Value and Scale should have same units .
Otherwise the exception Unit_Error is propagated .
function Normalize ( Value : Measure ) return Measure ;
The function Normalize returns an unshifted measure with the numeric equivalent same as one of the argument .
For example :
Zero : Measure := Normalize ( 0.0 * Celsius ) ; -- 273.15 K ( non-shifted )
Here 0 ºC is converted to its non-shifted equivalent 273.15 K .
function Shift ( Value : Measure , Shift : Number ' Base ) return Measure ;
The function Shift returns the argument shifted to Shift items .
Unlike the operation and , the numeric equivalent of the result is same as one of the first argument .
The value of the parameter Shift is subtracted from the field Gain and added to the field Offset to produce the result :
Zero : Measure := Shift ( 0.0 * Celsius , - 273.15 ) ; -- 273.15 K
Here 0 ºC is converted to its unshifted equivalent 273.15 K. Note that Normalize ( X ) is equivalent to Shift ( X , X.Offset ) .
function Convert ( Value , Scale : Measure ) return Measure ;
The function Convert is used for measurement unit conversions .
The value of the first argument is converted to the measurement units of the second argument .
The arguments Value and Scale should have same dimension .
Otherwise the exception Unit_Error is propagated .
Convert ( X , Y ) is an equivalent of Shift ( X , Y. Offset - X.Offset ) .
This is null operation if both arguments have same Offsets .
Otherwise , the result has the shift of the second argument .
function To_Measure ( Value : Number ) return Measure ;
This function returns a dimensionless unshifted measure corresponding to Value .
1.2.4 . Constants
Few constants of the type Measure are defined in the package Measures .
They correspond to the base SI measurement units :
Base SI constants Constant
The base SI unit A Ampere cd Candela K Kelvin kg Kilogram m Meter mol Mole s Second
and dimensionless SI units :
Dimensionless constants Constant Meaning Np Neper * rad Radian , plane angle sr Steradian , solid angle
* Neper is not a SI unit .
It is put here to have a constant for 1 SI other than rad .
Actually Np = rad = sr
The generic package Measures_Derived defines the constants corresponding to the derived SI measurement units :

1.2.6 . Conversion from String
There are two encoding - specific generic packages responsible conversions of Measure to and from strings and one universal generic package for handling any encoding .
The package Measures_Edit and the package Measures_UTF8 _Edit are encoding - specific .
Both packages have same formal parameters :
generic
with package Irregular_Measures is new Measures_Irregular ( <> ) ;
with package Float_Edit is
new Strings_Edit.Float_Edit ( Irregular_Measures.Measures_Of.Number ) ;
package Measures_ [ UTF8 _ ] Edit is ...
The package Measures_Edit is used for dealing with strings encoded in either ASCII or Latin - 1 character sets .
The package Measures_UTF8 _Edit is used for the strings encoded in UTF - 8 ( see Unicode Transformation Format ) .
The package Measures_UTF8 _Edit instantiates Measures_Universal_Edit in its public part under the name Universal_Edit .
The routines provided by both packages are almost identical and differ only the sets of symbols supported .
( The packages Float_Measures_Edit and Float_Measures_UTF8 _Edit are instantiations of Measures_Edit and Measures_UTF8 _Edit for the standard type Float . )
The following subroutines are used for measures input :
procedure Measures_Edit .
Get
( Source : String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : out Measure ;
Latin1 : Boolean := True
) ;
procedure Measures_UTF8 _Edit.
Get
( Source : String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : out Measure
) ;
The procedures Get input a measure from the string Source .
The process starts from the Source ( Pointer ) position .
After successful completion Pointer is advanced to the position following the measure taken from the string .
The parameter Value accepts the measure .
The flag Latin1 of Measures_Edit .
Get indicates Latin - 1 character set support .
With Latin1 = true the set of recognized symbols is extended as shown in the table below .
The variant Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
Get is used for UTF - 8 encoded strings .
It supports an even larger set of symbols :

The measure syntax is :
< measure > ::= ( < measure > ) < measure > ::= < measure > [ < dyadic - operation > ] < measure > < measure > ::= < prefix-operation >< measure > < measure > ::= < measure >< postfix- operation > < measure > ::= < number > < measure > ::= < unit > < dyadic - operation > ::= ** | ^ | * | · | / | + | - | and < prefix - operation > ::= + | - < postfix- operation > ::= < superscript - integer >
Space and tabs can be used as delimiters .
Two consequent lexemes shall be separated by at least one delimiter if the first one ends with a letter while the second starts with a letter .
For instance :
As Illegal , there is no any delimiter between A and s A s OK , A*s A·s OK , A*s 5A OK , 5* A
The exponentiation operation ( ** or ^ ) has the highest priority .
Then the multiplication ( * , · or empty ) follows .
The division ( / ) has lower priority than the multiplication , therefore kg / m*s is an equivalent to kg / ( m*s ) .
The lowest priority has the shift ( and ) .
The right argument of the exponentiation operation should be dimensionless and have zero fraction , i.e. be convertible to an integer without a precision loss .
< superscript - integer > is recognized only in UTF - 8 variant and when Latin1 = true , but then only the powers 1 , 2 and 3 are supported .
< unit > is a name denoting a measurement unit , such as foot :

These procedures input a measure in the form of a numeral multiplied by dimensioned scale .
The syntax of measure and the parameters except Value are identical to corresponding procedures Get .
The parameter Value has the type Scaled declared in the package Measures as follows :
type Value_Format is ( Scalar , Numeric , Canonic , Jumbled ) ;
type Scaled ( Format : Value_Format := Canonic ) is record
Numeral : Number 'Base ;
Scale : Measure ;
end record ;
The input may fall into one of the following categories :
Scalar is a numeric value with no scale specified .
The field Numeral contains the value .
The field Scale is 1 SI . ;

1.2.7 . Conversion to String
The packages Measures_Edit and Measures_UTF8 _Edit provide the following subroutines for measures output :
procedure Measures_Edit .
Put
( Destination : in out String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : Measure ;
Latin1 : Boolean := True ;
Derived : Boolean := True ;
RelSmall : Positive := Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
AbsSmall : Integer :=-Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
Field : Natural := 0 ;
Justify : Strings_Edit .
Alignment := Strings_Edit .
Left ;
Fill : Character := ' '
) ;
procedure Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
Put
( Destination : in out String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : Measure ;
Derived : Boolean := True ;
RelSmall : Positive := Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
AbsSmall : Integer :=-Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
Field : Natural := 0 ;
Justify : Strings_Edit .
Alignment := Strings_Edit .
Left ;
Fill : Character := ' '
) ;
These procedures place the measure specified by the parameter Value into the output string Destination .
The string is written starting from Destination ( Pointer ) .
The procedure from the package Measures_Editt has the parameter Latin1 , which when true , allows using of Latin - 1 characters listed in the table above , otherwise the output is done in ASCII .
The procedure from the package Measures_UTF8 _Edit uses UTF - 8 encoded characters from the table .
In all cases only the code positions in the table having white background are used in output .
So for example in UTF - 8 for Ohm , Greek omega is used rather than the Ohm sign .
The parameter Derived if true , allows derived SI units ( such as N , F etc. ) to appear in the output , and , additionally to them , °C .
These units appear only alone or else with a numeric factor .
They are not mixed with other units , like in N/s .
The parameters RelSmall and AbsSmall specify the precision of numeric output ( see Strings_Edit .
Float_Edit for further information ) .
The procedure from the package Measures_Edit has additional optional parameters Field , Justify , Fill .
When the parameter Field is not zero then Justify specifies alignment and Fill is the character used for filling .
When Field is greater than Destination ' Last - Pointer + 1 , the latter is used instead .
The UTF - 8 variant from the package Measures_UTF8 _Edit does not have these parameters because they would be meaningless for a UTF - 8 encoded output .
After successful completion Pointer is advanced to the first character following the output or to Destination ' Last +
1 . A measure can be output in one of the following forms :
Format Measure type Example < gain >
Unshifted , dimensionless ( a number ) 25.7 < unit >
Unshifted , Gain = 1 ( a SI unit ) m/s < gain > * < unit > Unshifted 25.7 ·W < gain > and < offset >
Shifted , dimensionless 4.1 and 6.4 < unit > and < offset >
Shifted , Gain = 1 A and 100.0 < gain > * < unit > and < offset > Shifted 35.08·A and 100.0
For instance :
Text : String ( 1 .. 80 ) ;
Pointer : Positive := 1 ;
. . .
Put ( Text , Pointer , 25.0 *N , Derived => False , AbsSmall => 0 ) ;
will put 25 · kg·m / s² into the string Text starting from the position 1 .
The parameter Derived= false forbids use of N ( newton ) in the output .
Otherwise the result would be 25·N .
The parameter AbsSmall=0 tells that the value has the precision ±0.5·10 AbsSmall - 1 , so only the digits before the decimal point are output .
For further information about floating - point I/O see the description of the package Strings_Edit .
The procedure factors out SI prefixes of power 10 ±3n .
The prefix is then applied to the first unit , like for example in
25.7·km/s
Note that the parameter AbsSmall is corrected according to the prefix , so the effective small used for the output of < gain > ( divided by 10 ±3n ) is AbsSmall - 3n .
The choice of the prefix is influenced by AbsSmall to avoid , when possible , representations of gain with an exponent .
Exceptions Layout_Error Pointer is not in Destination ' Range or there is
no room for the output

The functions Image convert the parameter Value to string .
The parameters Latin1 , Derived , RelSmall and AbsSmall have same meaning as in Put ( see ) .
1.2.8 . Handling I/O in multiple encodings
The generic package Measures_Universal_Edit provides unified subroutines for string I/O with arbitrary encodings :
generic
with package Irregular_Measures is new Measures_Irregular ( <> ) ;
with package Float_Edit is
new Strings_Edit.Float_Edit ( Irregular_Measures.Measures_Of.Number ) ;
package Measures_Universal_Edit is ...
The package provides a set of subroutines similar to ones of Measures_Edit and Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
They differs from the corresponding subroutines of these package in one additional parameter Mode , which for each subroutine determines the character set to be used .
procedure Get
( Source : String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : out Measure ;
Mode : Code_Set
) ;
procedure Get
( Source : String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : out Scaled ;
Mode : Code_Set
) ;
procedure Get_Unit
( Source : String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : out Measure ;
Mode : Code_Set
) ;
function Image
( Value : Measure ;
Mode : Code_Set ;
Derived : Boolean := True ;
RelSmall : Positive := Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
AbsSmall : Integer := - Strings_Edit.MaxSmall
) return String ;
function Value
( Source : String ;
Mode : Code_Set
) return Measure ;
procedure Put
( Destination : in out String ;
Pointer : in out Integer ;
Value : Measure ;
Mode : Code_Set ;
Derived : Boolean := True ;
RelSmall : Positive := Strings_Edit.MaxSmall ;
AbsSmall : Integer := - Strings_Edit.MaxSmall
) ;
The parameter Mode has the enumeration type Code_Set .
The meaning of the values is as follows :
ASCII_Set is same as the corresponding subroutine of Measures_Edit with Latin1 false .
. Latin1_Set is same as Measures_Edit with Latin1 true .
. UTF8 _Set is same as Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
This package has a non-generic instance Float_Measures_Universal_Edit for the measures based on the standard type Float .
1.3. GTK + widgets
The described here packages use GtkAda , an Ada bindings to GTK + , a portable platform - independent graphical framework .
To make use of this packages you need installed :
GTK + run-time and developing libraries installed ;
GtkAda installed .
If you get a distribution of GtkAda it typically contains GTK + run-time and libraries in it ;
GtkAda contributions .
You can place the files of in the same directory as the source files of the measurements units for Ada .
1.3.1 . Unit selection widget
The generic package Measures_Gtk_Edit provides an interactive unit selection widget .
The widget might look like :
The widget consists of :
an edit field , where a measurement unit can be directly input ;
an tree view widget that provides commonly used units divided into sections ;
a spin box , where the unit factor can be adjusted , if the unit selected is regular .
The box disappears for irregular units or when the user starts to type the unit into the edit field .
The widget can be composed with other GTK + widgets using standard widget packing techniques ( see ) .
It is also possibly to select a measurement unit in the form of a dialog , see the child package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
Dialogs for further information .
The widget emits two signals , which are usually handled by a dialog window containing it .
The dialog translates them into a response so that user could select a unit using simple button press or double click :
commit is emitted when an enter key is pressed within the widget or else when upon a double click on a unit row in the tree view ;
is emitted when an enter key is pressed within the widget or else when upon a double click on a unit row in the tree view ; reject is emitted when an escape key is pressed .
Selection of a unit in the tree view is intelligent .
When the value in the edit field can interpreted as a numeral multiplied by a scale then the selected unit replaces the scale .
If additionally the new unit is compatible with the old one , the numeral part is modified to retain the integral value .
When the value in the edit field is not interpretable in the described form then the selected unit replaces it completely .
The package is declared as follows :
generic
Class_Name : String ;
with package UTF8 _Edit is new Measures_UTF8 _Edit ( <> ) ;
package Measures_Gtk_Edit is ...
The formal parameters of the package is the name of the GTK + class the widget will have .
Class names are used in GTK + to associate external resources like styles with the widget .
The second parameter is an instance of the package Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
There exists an instantiated version of Measures_Gtk_Edit for the standard floating point type : Gtk.Float_Measures_Edit ..
It is a child package of Gtk to make its naming consistent with the naming scheme used in GtkAda .

The type Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record is the type of the widget object .
The type Gtk_Unit_Selection is a reference type used to deal with the widget .
This is the standard scheme used in GtkAda .
One might need Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record only when a new widget type were derived from it .
The following operations are defined in the package :
function Filter
( Widget : Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record ;
Value : Measure
) return Boolean ;
This is a primitive operation of Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record .
A derived type might wish to override it .
The function is used to filter out the measurement units , which can not be selected .
Such units do not appear in the tree view and are not accepted as direct input .
The parameter Widget is the widget object .
The parameter Value is a measurement unit to check .
The function returns true if Value is acceptable .
The default implementation returns false if Value is incompatible with the unit constraint set on Widget .
Otherwise , or when no constraint is set , the result is true .
function Get
( Widget : not null access Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record
) return Measure ;
function Get
( Widget : not null access Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record
) return GLib.
UTF8 _String ;

The parameter Initial specifies the initial selection .
It can be any string .
Note that Initial is not checked to be a valid measurement unit , neither it is passed through Filter .
Instead it is accepted as - is .
When Initial contains a valid measure that can be found in the tree view box , it is additionally selected there .
This search is takes into account SI prefixes when measurement unit is regular .
So , Initial " km " would select " m " with the SI prefix k for 103 .
The parameter Constraint is optional .
It specifies the unit to which the widget must be constrained .
When specified , the default implementation of Filter will accept only the measures compatible with Constraint .
The parameter Widget is the result .

1.3.2 . Dimensioned value entry
The child generic package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
GEntry provides a widget having the functionality of a combo box for dimensioned values input .
The widget is a descendant of Gtk_Entry .
It also implements the GtkCellEditable interface and thus can be used with a tree view cell renderer to provide unit input in a tree view control .
When focused a drop down box containing the unit selection list appears .
The user can selecting a unit from the list and directly edit the content of the entry box .
generic
type Custom_Unit_Selection_Record is
new Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record with private ;
package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
GEntry is ...
The formal generic parameter is a unit selection widget type derived from Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record .
This widget will be used within the entry .
The class name of the widget is constructed from the class name specified in the actual generic parameter by adding " Entry " to it .
There exists an instantiated version of Measures_Gtk_Edit .
GEntry for the standard floating point type : Gtk.Float_Measures_Entry ..
It is a child package of Gtk to make its naming consistent with the naming scheme used in GtkAda .
The package defines the type of the unit selection entry widget :
type Gtk_Unit_Entry_Record is
new Gtk_Entry_Record with private ;
type Gtk_Unit_Entry is
access all Gtk_Unit_Entry_Record'Class ;
The widget is a specialized entry .
The entry is not directly editable .
When user attempts to edit it a pop down window containing Custom_Unit_Selection_Record is shown .
When the entry contains a text it is shown there .
When the text is a valid measure it is selected in the unit selection tree .
The user can change the selection or manually edit the measure .
The editing is committed by pressing enter or cancelled by pressing escape keys .
It is also cancelled by leaving the focus .
When the editing is successful the result of becomes the new content of the entry .
The following subprograms are defined in the package :
function Editing_Canceled ( Widget : not null access Gtk_Unit_Entry_Record )
return Measure ;
This function return true if the last editing was cancelled by user .
It is used in a cell renderer when it handles editing - done signal .

) return Measure ;
function Get
( Widget : not null access Gtk_Unit_Entry_Record ;
Scale : Measure
) return Measure ;
This function parses the entry text and returns it as a measure .
The result is checked against the Widget 's constraint if any .
Constraint_Error is propagated if unit does not match .
When the parameter Scale is specified is shall have the units compatible with the Widget 's constraint .
Otherwise Constraint_Error is propagated .
When the widget is unconstrained Scale is ignored .
When the widget is constrained and Scale is specified then a numeric content of the widget is treated as a valid measure by multiplying to Scale .
When the content is dimensioned , Scale is ignored .
Note that the Set_Numeric has no effect on this behavior .

Allowed : Boolean
) ;
This procedure controls the Widget 's behavior when the input is a plain number and the widget is constrained to non-dimensionless values .
In this case specifying a plain number is allowed , otherwise such input causes unit mismatch error .
Style properties of the unit entry widget .
The following table summarizes them :
Name Type Default Description has - header Boolean false
True if the unit selection tree view should have column 's header
1.3.3 . Dimensioned value cell renderer
The child generic package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
GEntry.Cell_Renderer provides an editable cell renderer for GTK + tree view widget .
The renderer indicates dimensioned values as fixed - point numbers in using the specified scale .
When edited , the renderer drops down a unit selection list .
The user can select a unit from the list and edit the value entry .
The input when the dimensioned is automatically converted to the scale of the renderer .
When the input contains no units there the value is assumed specified in the renderer 's scale .
The renderer rejects any improperly dimensioned input .
The renderer class name of the widget is constructed from the class name specified in the actual generic parameter of its parent by adding " CellRenderer " to it .
generic
package Measures_Gtk_Edit.GEntry.Cell_Renderer is ...
There exists an instantiated version of Measures_Gtk_Edit .
GEntry.Cell_Renderer for the standard floating point type : Gtk.Float_Measures_Cell_Renderer ..
It is a child package of Gtk to make its naming consistent with the naming scheme used in GtkAda .
The package defines the type of the renderer :
type Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record is
new Gtk_Abstract_Renderer_Record with private ;
type Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure is
access all Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record'Class ;
The following subprograms are defined :
function Get ( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record )
return Number ;
function Get ( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record )
return Measure ;
function Get ( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record )
return GValue ;
function Get ( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record )
return UTF8 _String ;
These functions are used to query the rendered value .
It can be obtained as :
a plain number scaled to the renderer 's scale ;
measure ;
GTK + value of the type GType_Double scaled to the renderer 's scale ;
String composed out of the rendered value followed by the scale specification text of the renderer .
function Get_Type return Gtk_Type ;
This functions returns the GTK + type of the renderer .
procedure Gtk_New
( Cell : out Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure ;
Scale : UTF8 _String := " " ;
After : Natural := 0 ;
) ;
This procedure creates a new renderer .
The result is returned through the parameter Cell .
The parameter Scale determines the dimension and the multiplier of the edited values .
It must be a valid measure specification for Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
Further the gain of the measure has to be non-negative otherwise Constraint_Error is propagated .
When Scale is specified empty , it assumed to be 1 SI .
The parameter After specifies the number of decimal positions after the decimal point for the rendered values .
Observe that the values are rendered in Scale .
Exceptions Constraint_Error
A numeric error in unit expression of Scale .
The value of Scale has non-positive gain Data_Error Syntax error in Scale Unit_Error Illegal unit expression ( like m/°C )
procedure Initialize
( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record'Class ;
Scale : UTF8 _String := " " ;
After : Natural := 0 ;
) ;
This procedure is called by any derived type from its Initialize .
Exceptions Constraint_Error
A numeric error in unit expression of Scale .
The value of Scale has non-positive gain Data_Error Syntax error in Scale Unit_Error Illegal unit expression ( like m/°C )
procedure Put
( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record ;
Value : Number
) ;
procedure Put
( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record ;
Value : Measure
) ;
procedure Put
( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record ;
Value : UTF8 _String
) ;
procedure Put
( Cell : not null access Gtk_Cell_Renderer_Measure_Record ;
Value : GValue
) ;
These functions are used to set the rendered value .
It can be one of the following types :
a plain number scaled to the renderer 's scale ;
measure , Unit_Error is propagated when Value has the units incompatible with Cell ;
has the units incompatible with ; GTK + value of the type GType_Double scaled to the renderer 's scale or else GType_String .
When the value is of GType_String , the effect is same as if it were passed as string ;
String containing a measure in the format of Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
The value when dimensioned is treated as if it were passed as a measure .
When the value is dimensionless the effect is same as if it was passed as a plain number .
Exceptions Constraint_Error
A numeric error in unit expression Data_Error Syntax error Unit_Error Illegal unit expression ( like m/°C ) , incompatible unit
Properties of the renderer .
The following table summarizes them :
Name Type Default Description after UInt 0 Digits after decimal point scale string -
The text representing the scale of the rendered values .
When empty the scale is 1 SI text string -
The text representing the rendered value including the scale value GDouble - Scaled number , the value rendered
1.3.4 .
Unit selection dialogs
The child generic package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
Dialogs provides a simple way to query for a measurement unit from a dialog box :
generic
type Custom_Unit_Selection_Record is
new Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record with private ;
package Measures_Gtk_Edit .
Dialogs is ...
The formal generic parameter is a unit selection widget type derived from Gtk_Unit_Selection_Record .
This widget will be used within the dialog .
The package provides the following subprograms :
function Get
( Constraint : Unit ;
Initial : GLib.UTF8 _String := " " ;
Title : GLib.UTF8 _String := " Unit selection " ;
Confirm : GLib.UTF8 _String := " gtk-ok " ;
Cancel : GLib.UTF8 _String := " gtk - cancel " ;
Parent : Gtk_Window := null ;
Flags : Gtk_Dialog_Flags := Modal ;
Missing : GLib.UTF8 _String := " No unit specified " ;
Erroneous : GLib.UTF8 _String := " Illegal unit " ;
Incompatible : GLib.UTF8 _String := " Incompatible unit "
) return GLib.
UTF8 _String ;
function Get
( ... --
Same parameters as above
) return Measure ;
function Get
( ... --
Same parameters as above , without Constraint
) return GLib.
UTF8 _String ;
function Get
( ... --
Same parameters as above , without Constraint
) return Measure ;
These function cause a dialog to appear .
The dialog has the unit selection widget in it and up to two buttons .
A function does not return until the dialog closes .
When the user presses the OK button , which label is specified by the parameter Confirm , the selected measurement unit is checked for validity and it is the result of the function .
The result is either a string or a measure .
On failed checks the dialog does not end and an appropriate message text is shown as the parameters Missing , Erroneous and Incompatible specify .
When the parameter Cancel is not an empty string , the Cancel button is shown .
When the dialog box is closed using the window manager or the Cancel button , the functions propagate End_Error exception .
The button names can refer to GTK + stock buttons , as the default values do .
Otherwise , the underline character within the name refer to the hot - key character .
The parameter Constraint limits the measurement unit to a specific dimension .
In the example shown on the figure it was Units .
Base .
Length .
When Constraint is omitted , any valid measurement unit is acceptable .
An additional or alternative constraint can be imposed by the type Cunstom_Unit_Selection_Record , as Filter describes .
Title is the dialog window title .
Parent is the parent window of .
The parameter Flags is the dialog flags .
The package has an instantiated version for the standard floating - point type : Gtk.Float_Measures_Dialogs .
2. Packages
Two separate sets of packages implement the types Unit and the type Measure .
There is also a set of supporting packages used internally .
2.1 . The packages related to the type Unit
The packages related to the type Unit :
Package Provides Units
The type Unit , unit arithmetic Base
The constants corresponding to the base SI units Constants
The constants corresponding to some physical entities Edit Conversion to ASCII and Latin - 1 strings UTF8 _Edit Conversion to UTF - 8 encoded strings
2.2 . The packages related to the type Measure
The following packages are related to the type Measure :
Package ( generic ) Provides Non-generic version ( Float ) Measures
The type Measure , measure arithmetic , constants corresponding to the base SI units .
Float_Measures Measures_Derived
The constants corresponding to the derived SI units .
Float_Measures_Derived Measures_Edit Input and output of measures ( ASCII and Latin - 1 string conversions ) Float_Measures_Edit Measures_Elementary_Functions
Elementary functions ( sqrt , log , exp etc. ) Float_Measures_Elementary_Functions Measures_Gtk_Edit GTK + widget for measurement unit selection Gtk.Float_Measures_Edit Dialogs GTK + dialogs for measurement unit selection Gtk.Float_Measures_Dialogs GEntry GTK + widget for editing units with the functionality of a combo box Gtk.Float_Measures_Entry Cell_Renderer

The following example shows how the generic packages are instantiated :
with Measures ;
with Measures_Derived ;
with Measures_Irregular ;
with Measures_Edit ;
with Strings_Edit.Float_Edit ;
. . .
type Real is digits ... ;
--
-- Instantiation of Measures with the type Real as the parameter
--
package Real_Measures is new Measures ( Real ) ;
--
-- Instantiation of Measures_Derived
--
package Real_Measures_Derived is new Measures_Derived ( Real_Measures ) ;
--
-- Instantiation Measures_Irregular
--
package Real_Measures_Irregular is
new Measures_Irregular ( Real_Measures_Derived ) ;
--
-- Instantiation Measures_Edit
--
package Real_Edit is new Strings_Edit.
Float_Edit ( Real ) ;
--
-- Instantiation Measures_Edit
--
package Real_Measures_Edit is
new Measures_Derived
( Real_Measures_Irregular ,
Real_Edit
) ;
2.3 . Packages defined for internal use
The software uses the packages Strings_edit and Tables .
The following table shows the packages defined for internal use :
Package Provides Measures_Generic_Edit
Generic package for I/O of measures for all types of encodings .
Measures_Edit , Measures_UTF8 _Edit , Measures_Universal_Edit instantiate it .
Measures_Table_Of_Integer
The table of SI prefixes ( their powers ) or unit operations ( coded as integers ) .
Instantiates the package Tables with Integer as the parameter .
Measures_Table_Of_Measure
The table of measurement units .
Instantiates the package Tables with Address as the parameter .
3. Examples
3.1 . Self - tests
The subdirectory test_units contains various tests .
The file test_measures .adb contains a test program for the packages Measures and Units .
It also estimates the performance hit when the type Measure is used for calculations instead of Float .
With GNAT compiler the program can be built using gnatmake :
> gnatmake - I.. test_measures.adb
The file test_gtk_unit_selection.adb is a test program for GTK +.
To build it one needs installed :
Provided that GtkAda contributions is placed in the directory gtkada on the same level as the root directory of this software the command line to build test_gtk_unit_selection might look under Linux as :
> gnatmake - I.. - I../../gtkada test_gtk_unit_selection.adb `gtkada-config`
Under Windows instead of automatic configuration of GtkAda paths , you should specify the install directory of GtkAda implicitly :
> gnatmake - I.. - I../../ gtkada -IC:/GtkAda/include/gtkada test_gtk_unit_selection.adb
3.2 . Unit converters and mappers
The subdirectory units - examples contains a simple sample programs which convert dimensioned values .
3.2.1 . Unit converter for Win32
The following is the full source code of the converter .
It is located in units-examples→units - converter→win32 .
The fragments relevant to dealing with units are highlighted yellow .
The rest is dealing with Windows API .
The program uses Windows Unicode support .
For this measures input and output is performed in UTF - 8 format using the package Float_Measures_UTF8 _Edit .
Note that Windows uses UTF - 16 encoding therefore all strings are converted from Wide_String to UTF - 8 and back using subroutines of the package Strings_Edit .

Google 's April surprise for state / Big chunk of record tax receipts from insiders ' stock sales
Internet giant Google 's stock has soared since it went public almost two years ago -- and that has created a windfall for state government coffers .
California took in a record $ 11.3 billion in personal income tax receipts in April , $ 4.3 billion more than it collected last April .
It 's almost certain that a significant chunk of April 's haul came from Google employees -- perhaps one - eighth or more of the tax receipt gain .
The fact that a single high - flying Silicon Valley company is giving such a big boost to the state treasury can be determined by examining insider stock trading information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Fourteen of Google 's top executives and directors sold $ 4.4 billion worth of stock last year , according to Thomson Financial .
That includes founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page , each of whom sold about $ 1.3 billion worth of stock .
Assuming the 14 insiders had acquired the shares at very low cost and that all were in the top 10.3 percent state - tax bracket , they could have owed the state close to $ 450 million in capital gains tax on their stock sales .
And it was n't only the top executives .
Many lower - level Google employees also sold stock in their company last year .
They do n't have to publicly disclose their sales .
We do n't know how much tax this group paid , but it clearly lifted the state 's total take from Google well above the $ 450 million figure .
It 's not clear exactly when the Google insiders paid their tax bills .
It 's possible they made estimated state - tax payments last year when they sold the stock .
In that case , their tax payments would not be included in April 's state - tax haul .
But it 's much more likely that they paid all or some of their capital gains tax in April when they filed their 2005 tax returns or requested an extension .
What we do know is that the Franchise Tax Board received a lot of very large checks with extension requests last month , says Brad Williams , director of fiscal forecasting with the state legislative analyst 's office .
" We did get a little information from the Franchise Tax Board about where the biggest payments were coming from , and a lot were coming from Silicon Valley , the San Francisco area .
That tends to suggest it is sales of stock , maybe by founders of companies , people with large numbers of shares , " Williams says .
Tech stocks had a good year in 2005 , and insiders at lots of companies cashed in options and sold shares .
But their gains were dwarfed by the fortunes made by Google insiders .
In 2005 , officers , directors and other insiders at the largest 200 publicly held companies in the Bay Area sold a total of $ 9.6 billion in stock , up from $ 7 billion in 2004 , according to Thomson Financial .
Google alone accounted for almost half of the 2005 total .
The Google founders still own the vast majority of their shares , which means they could make more contributions to the tax kitty if they decide to diversify their holdings and the company 's stock price holds up .
So far this year , a dozen Google insiders have sold $ 1.9 billion worth of stock , according to Thomson .
But it is risky for a state to rely on capital gains taxes , and April 's big payoff does n't mean that the state can count on Google bolstering the budget indefinitely .
In the late 1990s , taxes on capital gains and stock options started flooding into the state treasury .
In fiscal 2000 - 01 , they reached $ 17.5 billion , representing 39.3 percent of personal income tax revenues .
Thinking those gains would last , the state embarked on a spending spree .
But stock - market income fell off a cliff after early 2000 .
In 2002 - 03 , capital gains and stock options contributed only $ 5.4 billion , or 16.6 percent to personal income tax revenues .
Capital gains from Google and other companies are n't the only factors behind the surge in tax receipts .
Another likely source of April 's tax take , which could be less volatile than stock - based capital gains , is real estate .
There are no figures yet for 2005 , but for tax year 2004 , personal tax returns included $ 15.5 billion in gross capital gains from real estate , up from $ 9.6 billion the previous year .
Most of those gains came from the sale of rental property and second homes , but they also included the taxable portion of capital gains on the sale of primary residences .
If real estate capital gains grew at the same rate in 2005 as they did the previous year , they could have reached $ 25 billion in 2004 .
Assuming an average state - tax rate of 9 percent , they could have generated $ 2.3 billion in tax revenues for 2005 .
Again , a good portion of those gains could have showed up in the April tax figure .
Real estate gains " are more widely distributed " than stock market gains , says Williams .
" You 're not depending on a handful of people making decisions about huge stock sales .
You 're talking about a large number of people making individual decisions .
It 's not as volatile ; it 's probably more recurring .
However , it is subject to conditions in the real estate market , and right now we 're worried about a real estate bubble and what it will mean for both the volume of transactions and the rate of appreciation . "
Small businesses could have accounted for another portion of the April surprise .
Many companies that do business as sole proprietors , partnerships or limited liability corporations report their business income on their personal income tax returns .
" Last year was an extraordinary year for profits .
We knew that going in , but they may have been even better than we thought , " says Williams .
California is not the only state with burgeoning tax coffers .
" The surge is being seen by many states , " especially those that -- like California -- have rising property values and progressive tax structures , says Tim Blake , a senior municipal - debt analyst with Moody 's Investors Service .
Federal - tax revenues are also coming in much stronger than expected , a large part of the increase coming from capital gains and business profits .
" High - income taxpayers are doing better than low - income taxpayers , generally , " says Blake .
California 's tax structure is highly progressive , which makes it highly volatile .
For the 2004 tax year , 38,000 California tax returns reported more than $ 1 million in income .
They represented just 0.2 percent of all state - tax returns , yet they accounted for 14 percent of total adjusted gross income and about 30 percent of the total personal tax .
The top 3 percent of the returns , those with incomes exceeding $ 200,000 , paid about 60 percent of all state taxes .
" What happens to the top 1 percent is of great interest to the Department of Finance , " says David Hitchcock , a debt analyst with Standard & Poor's .
