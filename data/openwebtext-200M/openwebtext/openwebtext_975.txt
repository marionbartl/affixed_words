Yes , every one of these clowns opposes health care reform ; remember their faces in case you see one when the revolution comes
Judging from the talking points being constantly spewed by the likes of Mitch McConnell ( R- KY ) , Eric Cantor ( R- VA ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) , Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , Max Baucus ( DLC - MT ) , Blanche Lincoln ( DLC - AR ) , Mary Landrieu ( DLC- LA ) , Joe Lieberman ( DLC - CT ) , and Ben Nelson ( DLC - NE ) , and by the coverage in the corporate media , all of it driven primarily by corporate dollars , one would think that most people oppose Obama 's tyrannical plans to impose dreaded health care reform on the American people .
But , no .
Americans overwhelminglyhealth care reform .
Wisely , they do n't trust the crooked CEOs who run the insurance companies and they do n't trust the bought off , sold out Republicans in Congress .
Every single poll that comes out shows that Americans -- by gargantuan margins , favor genuine , government - run health care .
That 's why the insurance companies and their shills in Congress are fighting tooth and nail , like mad dogs , to kill thebetween an Insurance company bailout ( the Senate Finance Committee plan authored by Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley ) and single payer .
The compromise , which offers consumers a choice , is called the " public option . "
Anyone who likes their for - profit Insurance company 's service can stick with it .
Otherwise , they can opt for the non-profit government run plan .
Studies by the insurance industry show that within a couple of years there will be virtually no people choosing for - profit insurance companies
This story in today ' sis just what the doctor ordered in reminding people that Blue America is asking for donations for the television ads were doing to make Arkansas voters aware that their senator is n't reallysenator ; Blanche Lincoln belongs to the Big Business CEOs who have financed her career .
While she works behind the scenes to protect the interests of her Insurance Industry patrons , Americans " are strongly behind one of the most contentious proposals Congress is considering , a government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers , according to the latest / CBS News poll . "
Even half the respondents who admitted they areprefer this plan , while among normal Americans , the margins are staggering .

Is our democracy real ?
Is it time for us to go out into the streets like the courageous Iranian patriots in Tehran who are fighting the powerful establishment in their country ?
In our country we have just as selfish and greedy an establishment , only they do n't wear military uniforms and clerical drag ; they wear three piece Armani and Zegna suits and demand the taxpayers subsidize their hundred dollar lunches and private jets .
Have n't we had enough yet ?
Max Baucus , the entire Republican Party , Joe Lieberman , Mary Landrieu , Ben Nelson , Arlen Specter , and , as Pam points out so eloquently this morning , Kay Hagan are all just as guilty as Lincoln when it comes to taking money from Big Insurance and selling out working families .
Blue America would love to deal with all of them .
Except for Specter , though , only Lincoln is up for re-election in 2010 .
Some have five - and - a - half years before they have to face the voters again .
Lincoln is on the Heath subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee .
There is a reason why health insurance companies have chosen her to lavish the most money on -- and it's the same reason we 've chosen her as well .
Please give -- because it really does count .

HIV is a disease that made its debut in the early 1980 ’s with a block buster sized boom .
However , like so many other things that , grip our attention so tightly in the beginning , we as a society lost interest .
Yet over 25 years later HIV / AIDS has not lost interest in us .
The Obama administration has started a new campaign , “ 9 ½ minutes ” .
It ’s called 9 ½ minutes because every 9 ½ minutes someone in the United States becomes infected with HIV .
Every 9 ½ minutes !
That ’s huge !
HIV is still out there and it ’s not going away anytime soon .
One of the problems with HIV is that “ I ’m not at risk ” mentality .
Many of you are reading this right now thinking just that .
I have worked in the field of HIV for over 10 years and I ’ve learned that we are all at risk .
Our grandparents who are widowed and now living in nursing homes , they ’re at risk , even though we do n’t want to think about it .
Our children , younger than we were when thought about having sex , they ’re at risk .
Those of us who have been married for years and only been with our spouse , unfortunately we too are at risk .
Just this morning I saw on television that 50 % of men have cheated , weather that figure is right or wrong does n’t matter , what matters is that just because you have n’t been unfaithful does n’t you ’re your spouse has n’t .
The Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) states that more than 1 million people in the United States are infected with HIV .
That is over 30 % of the population .
Unfortunately 1 in 5 of those infected do n’t know they have it .
Do you know your HIV status ?
HIV is transmitted 3 ways : Mother to Infant : either during the birthing process or through breast feeding , Sex : and yes Oral sex does count , or Sharing Needles .
Focusing on the second and third , is it at all possible that you have it ?
If you ’ve done something above , yes it is possible .
So what can you do to reduce risk ?
Practice safe sex , do n’t share needles ever .
National HIV Testing Day is June 27th .
The test is quick and easy .
They can test by a swab in your mouth .
So how is it possible that they can test you through your mouth and you ca n’t get it from kissing ?
The test actually removes particles from your spit that detects anti-HIV antibodies , proteins that the body immune system makes in response to HIV .
The test is not actually measuring the HIV .
A confirmatory test would be needed if a positive result came back .
Saturday is a great opportunity to get the test and learn your status .

UPDATE : PETA has responded to President Obama 's killing of a fly .
Click here to read the shocking details ...
Who says President Obama is weak on defense ?
It was almost like watching that scene from Karate Kid when Mr. Miyagi showed Daniel how to kill a fly with his chopsticks .
Except it was the White House version of it .
And no less dramatic .
President Obama played the part of the seasoned Sensei while CNBC's John Harwood was the hapless kid played by Ralph Macchio .
Yes , it was high drama in the East Room today .
PETA has yet to issue a statement , but we could n't sit on this pivotal story waiting for one .
We just had to go with it .
Yawn
Obama was speaking to Harwood about the administration ’s efforts to improve financial regulation .
Normally that conversation would be about as exciting as watching paint dry .
Actually watching paint dry would probably be more interesting .
Thankfully a housefly would n't leave the president alone disrupting the interview numerous times .
That 's when Obama 's razor sharp reflexes kicked in .
( see video below )
Presidential skill
In a move only rivaled by President Bush 's ducking of two flying Iraqi shoes back in December , President Obama nailed the fly in mid-air sending the insect to an early but much deserved grave .
It was n't as though Obama set out to kill the fly originally .
He warned the fly more than once .
" Get out of here , " Obama told the fly , waving his hands ( to express the seriousness of the situation ) .
Harwood , noting the relentless nature of the insect , said to the president , " That 's the most persistent fly I 've ever seen . "
But not once did the reporter offer to assist Obama .
That 's when Obama took things into his own lightning fast hands pulverizing the insect like Miyagi or even Chuck Norris might do .
Moments passed before a stunned Harwood stammered , " Nice .. . "
Cool Hand Obama looked at the humbled reporter and said , " Now , where were we . "
Celebrate
That 's when Obama decided to spike the football .
And do a little dance .
" That was pretty impressive , was n't it ? "
Obama said gloating over his fresh kill .
" I got the sucker .
What do you think , Gibbs ? "
His press secretary must have been stunned as well as he did n't respond to the president 's question .
Obama then directed the CNBC 's cameras to focus in on the body of the lifeless fly .
You could say the photo of Obama towering over the trophy was somewhat reminiscent of Sarah Palin 's photo with the moose she shot a few months ago .
After Harwood composed himself , he told his CNBC colleagues that this might be Obama 's " make my day moment . "
Let 's see Dick Cheney question Obama 's credentials on national defense now ...

The first artificial organ for liver patients that uses immortalized human liver cells , the Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device , or ELAD® , is a bedside system that treats blood plasma , metabolizing toxins and synthesizing proteins just like a real liver does .
NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center is currently one of only a small number of hospitals in the U.S. offering this therapy to acute liver failure patients as part of ongoing clinical trials .
" These studies are looking at how well the system can extend patients ' lives until a liver transplant becomes available .
We 're also interested to see if it can relieve the burden on the patient 's liver enough so that it can regenerate and regain some of its function , " says Dr. Robert Brown , site principal investigator , chief of the Division of Abdominal Organ Transplantation , and director of the Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center .
Dr. Brown is also the Frank Cardile Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics ( in Surgery ) at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
The ongoing studies look at whether ELAD liver support improves survival compared with standard medical therapy .
Patients are randomly assigned to receive either standard medical therapy plus the ELAD system , or standard medical therapy alone .
Patients eligible for the study have life - threatening acute liver failure , often due to an infection .
Another trial open to patients with liver failure due to drug overdose without underlying liver disease is expected to begin enrollment later this year .
The current trials expand on prior results from Phase 1 and 2 trials in the U.S. and U.K. , and a pivotal , randomized , controlled clinical trial at two sites in China during 2006 and 2007 .
In the latter study , 69 patients with hepatitis B or C who had suffered ALF were treated with either ELAD or standard therapy .
Thirty - day transplant - free survival rates were statistically higher in the ELAD group compared with the control .
Artificial livers have been attempted since the 1960s .
Because previous designs did n't use human liver cells , they could n't adequately filter toxins or create chemicals essential to metabolism and blood - clotting .
With the ELAD system , four 12 - inch cartridges containing cells derived from human liver cells and fibers are mounted on a standard blood - pumping unit .
The patient 's blood plasma flows inside of hollow fibers to allow appropriate two - way transfer of metabolites across the fiber membrane .
Liver transplantation is limited by the supply of donor livers .
According to the United Network for Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) , there were approximately 6,500 liver transplants performed in 2007 ; however , there are more than 16,000 patients on the waiting list .
Each year only about one - third of those who need a donor liver will receive one , and many patients die while waiting .
Acute liver failure afflicts more than 30,000 Americans each year , including those with chronic liver diseases like hepatitis , as well as those whose livers were damaged , such as by taking too much acetaminophen pain medicine .
If not treated effectively and promptly -- usually by transplantation -- patients experience organ failure , bleeding , coma and death .
When a donor organ is n't available or if the patient is too sick for surgery , ELAD could be their only option .

Now they tell us .
On Monday , two men with considerable responsibility for enabling the banking meltdown confronted the error of their ways .
Not directly , of course , for accountability is hardly the mark of either Lawrence Summers , the top White House economic adviser , or Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
Their careers have long been fueled by error .
Summers was one of the leading prophets of radical financial deregulation in the Clinton administration .
And Geithner , as head of the New York Fed , looked the other way during Wall Street ’s collapse and then responded by opening wide the spigot of taxpayer dollars to resuscitate Citigroup and AIG .
What they wrote this week in a joint Op - Ed article in The Washington Post is a condemnation of the Wall Street shenanigans they once abetted and celebrated .
I hope their apparent sudden conversion to common sense indicates the seriousness of the banking regulation plan that President Obama will present to Congress today .
“ Over the past two years , we have faced the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression , ” they wrote , placing the blame squarely where it belongs , on the unregulated derivatives markets they once gushed over .
“ The current financial crisis had many causes … in the widespread use of poorly understood financial instruments , in shortsightedness and excessive leverage at financial institutions .
But it was also the product of basic failures in financial supervision and regulation . ”
What irony that Summers , who as Bill Clinton ’s treasury secretary pushed through legislation guaranteeing “ legal certainty for Swap Agreements ” and banning the regulation of securitized mortgage debt , should now admit that “ securitization led to an erosion of lending standards , resulting in market failure that fed the housing boom and deepened the housing bust . ”
According to Summers and Geithner , the Obama plan to be revealed today promises that all derivatives dealers will be “ subject to supervision , and regulators will be empowered to enforce rules against manipulation and abuse . ”
If such language is ever passed into law , I hope that Brooksley Born is in the gallery and gets the standing ovation she deserves .
That ’s the woman who , when she headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , warned that the derivatives market needed to be regulated .
Summers and his predecessor as treasury secretary , Robert Rubin , destroyed Born ’s career because she dared to accurately predict today ’s crisis .
But better late than never , although it ’s a shame that Obama ’s economic whiz kids are only now getting serious about cracking down on Wall Street hustlers after first guaranteeing their toxic paper with trillions of taxpayer dollars .
Nor should we assume that the Obama plan will not be subverted by the financial industry lobbyists , whose enormous campaign treasure chest , now financed by taxpayers , allows them to slice and dice congressional voting blocs the way they did subprime mortgages .
Already there ’s a joker in the deck of the Obama proposal in that it relies heavily on the Federal Reserve , which on the regional level is fully controlled by the very financial industry firms that it is expected to monitor .
Summers and Geithner write that “ all large , interconnected firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the system will be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve . ”
Like we never heard that one before .
Because of bad deregulation laws , those large , interconnected firms were allowed to grow to the point where their failure indeed threatened “ the stability of the system . ”
What we need to do is return to the basic principle of the New Deal - era Glass - Steagall Act ( which Clinton reversed ) that broke up “ too big to fail ” financial conglomerates because , by definition , when such companies threaten to fail , we taxpayers are left picking up the tab .
It was depressing that the president told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he favors “ a relatively light touch when it comes to the government … in terms of financial regulation . ”
And that “ [ w ] e had a regulatory system that was outdated that did not encompass the non -bank sector . ”
Nonsense .
We had a regulatory system inherited from Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal that for 60 years sustained a wall between the traditional heavily regulated banks and the non-bank hustlers on Wall Street who should have never been allowed to play their funny money games with people ’s savings and home mortgages .
That wall was torn down by President Clinton at the behest of Wall Street lobbyists and now must be restored if there is to be true reform .
The reforms presented by Obama are an important start , but I worry they do not face up to the reality that financial conglomerates too big to fail are too big to be allowed to exist .

Revolution talks with Raymond Lotta
Socialist Revolution in the 20th Century
Controversies and Lessons , Part Three
Raymond Lotta is a Maoist political economist .
He is author of America in Decline and editor of And Mao Makes Five and Maoist Economics and the Revolutionary Road to Communism .
Since 2005 , he has been speaking on college campuses and in the media as part of the Set the Record Straight Project , which is taking on the distortions and misrepresentations about the first wave of socialist revolutions in the 20th century .
In December 2008 , he helped organize a major symposium , “ Rediscovering China ’s Cultural Revolution ” held in New York City .
Raymond Lotta is a contributing writer for Revolution newspaper ; recent articles and interviews have also appeared in the Economic and Political Weekly ( India ) , GlobalResearch.ca ( Canada ) , and Agence France - Presse .
This is the third , and final , part of this interview .
Part One appeared in Revolution # 166 ( May 31 , 2009 ) ; Part Two appeared in Revolution # 167 ( June 7 , 2009 ) .
Question : Raymond , you talked quite a bit about the achievements of the Cultural Revolution .
But socialism was overthrown in China in 1976 .
There are people , including some who would describe themselves as Maoists , who look at this and conclude that there was something fundamentally wrong with the concepts guiding these revolutions , especially the leading role of a communist vanguard party .
How do you respond to this ?
Raymond Lotta :
There is a question here of what lessons should and should not be drawn from the first stage of the communist revolution .
The Soviet and Chinese revolutions achieved these amazing , these truly liberating , things .
But they did this in a world still dominated by imperialism and in which the proletariat is still learning how to remake society .
These societies were a glimpse of the future ... and they showed that a new state power and institutionalized vanguard leadership are indispensable , if you are serious about mobilizing the masses to revolutionize society and the world .
Question :
But you ’re not saying that there were n’t problems ?
Raymond Lotta :
There were shortcomings and errors , some of them quite serious , especially in the case of Stalin and the Soviet Union , though we can’t overlook that this was the first attempt to build a socialist society , and in extremely hostile external circumstances .
Even in China , where Mao led in developing a groundbreaking understanding and emancipatory practice for continuing the revolution , there were some problems in conception and in methods .
These problems were not the main cause of the defeat of socialism in 1976 .
But they had an effect .
These problems in conception and method influenced the alignments of social forces within revolutionary China at the time of the reactionary coup ... the understanding of the masses about where society needs to go and how ... and influenced the theory and practice of how the revolutionary state was interacting with the world arena .
Again , these were secondary shortcomings in an overwhelmingly positive experience , but they exerted real influence .
The new Manifesto of the RCP , USA , Communism : The Beginning of a New Stage , speaks to this .
It points out that , among some forces , one response to this current moment and the whole experience of the first stage is to refuse to engage with Mao ’s analysis of the real contradictions of the socialist transition , or to reject it and distance themselves from this whole experience .
Many of these forces say we have to “ go back to the drawing board ” or come up with something new for the 21st century .
And under this umbrella many of these forces are going back to the past ... to the 18th century and to the outlook and principles of bourgeois democracy , and its formal processes of competitive elections , its declarations of classless democracy and equality — all of which cover over and legitimize bourgeois class dictatorship .
And then there is what Bob Avakian , Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party , USA , has been doing .
As the Manifesto puts it , Avakian is “ building on all that has gone before , theoretically and practically , drawing the positive and negative lessons from this , and raising this to a new , higher level of synthesis . ”
The New Synthesis
Question :
There ’s a lot of controversy about this as well .
Raymond Lotta :
This new synthesis is based on a deeper understanding of the dynamics of socialist society as a transition to communism .
It speaks to the challenges of exercising leadership in socialist society in a way that is more consistent with the aims of communist revolution ... and to the kind of society socialism must be if it is going to open the way to communism .
Really , what is the essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat — what is the proletarian revolution really aiming for ?
Marx wrote this wonderful passage which summarizes this concisely .
He talked about communism as the abolition of all class distinctions , of all the production relations on which those class distinctions rest , of all the social relations that correspond to those production relations , and the revolutionizing of all the ideas that correspond to those social relations .
This has come to be called the “ 4 Alls . ”
That ’s what the communist project is about : achieving the 4 Alls .
Avakian ’s new synthesis is more scientifically grounded in this ... at going at the achievement of these 4
Alls more deeply and more all - sidedly to emancipate all of humanity .
Question : Maybe you could say some more about the content of this .
Raymond Lotta : Avakian is bringing forward a new model of socialist society .
You need firm and visionary leadership to guide the complex and challenging struggles to achieve the goal of a world community of freely associating human beings .
You need to hold on to power ; you do n’t want to allow the capitalists back in to power .
But this new power has to be worth holding on to .
Socialism has to be a vibrant and exciting place that people would want to live in and that would open the pathways to communism .
A highly important aspect of this new model of socialist society is a greater role for dissent , the greater fostering of intellectual ferment , more scope for creativity in the arts , and more of an atmosphere of experimentation and initiative than existed in the Soviet Union when it was socialist and in revolutionary China .
Question :
In what sense is this different from the Cultural Revolution ?
Raymond Lotta :
It ’s building on but actually going beyond the Cultural Revolution .
There ’s a lot we could get into , but let me give an example .
One of the great things about the Cultural Revolution was that it brought the masses into “ forbidden ” arenas , like the sciences , the arts , management and administration .
There were these extraordinary transformations aimed at reducing what Mao called the “ three great differences ” : between mental and manual labor , town and country , worker and peasant .
You had peasants and workers being admitted into the universities on a vast scale .
You had intellectuals and artists going to the countryside ... no , not as punishment as the bourgeois accounts distort it but as part of overcoming the lopsided concentration of intellectual , cultural , and scientific resources in the cities and bringing the intellectuals into closer contact with the masses — to share knowledge and to learn from peasant masses .
You had things like “ open - door ” research , where scientific experiments were conducted among the peasants .
There was a revolution in culture , breakthroughs like the model operas that combined high artistic quality with revolutionary themes .
Peasants and workers were on the stage instead of feudal emperors .
These works projected powerful images of strong , independent , revolutionary women .
They involved innovative collective forms of producing art .
There was an explosion of amateur artistic expression among the masses .
The Cultural Revolution profoundly revolutionized what Marxists call the “ superstructure ” — the political structures , social relations and social institutions , values and ideas of society .
This was pathbreaking — and we as communists have to go up against the bourgeois lies and distortions .
But we also have to dig into this experience deeply .
In working on the mental / manual contradiction , there was tendency to go at this one - sidedly — from the side of bringing the basic masses into the intellectual spheres ... and from the side of integrating intellectuals with the masses .
This was correct and important .
But as Avakian has summed up , there was not sufficient recognition and appreciation of the very important contribution that intellectuals and intellectual ferment plays in socialist society .
In other words , working on the contradiction from this side — this was not sufficiently recognized and appreciated .
Role of Intellectuals
Question :
But are n’t intellectuals privileged ?
Raymond Lotta :
You do n’t want to replicate the ivory - tower relations of capitalist class society , where the masses are locked out of the realm of working with ideas , and where you have small islands where a stratum of people can work with ideas while the great majority of humanity is not only prevented from doing so but subjected to exploitation .
But you lose something very important if you simply see the matter in terms of reducing privilege .
This might seem counterintuitive , but the fact is , you ca n’t overcome the gap between mental and manual labor ... you ca n’t do that without a rich intellectual life , without giving scope and space to intellectuals , artists , and scientists .
One of the very positive aspects of intellectual life is the tendency to look at things in new ways and from new angles ... and to challenge the status quo and hidebound thinking .
All this puts questions of all kinds before society , raises the sights of the masses , and generally promotes a critical and exploratory spirit .
All this is essential to the search for the truth — to humanity knowing the world more deeply , so it can be transformed more thoroughly .
Avakian has been emphasizing that you ca n’t get to communism without this .
Question :
You talked about this as a problem in previous socialist societies .
Where did this come from ?
Raymond Lotta :
Well , this is a big question , in part involving some of the particular historical and social conditions out of which these revolutions emerged .
But there were also questions of orientation and methodology that Avakian has examined , and he provides some conceptual tools to evaluate and explore this .
In the realm of epistemology — the branch of philosophy dealing with issues of knowledge — Avakian has identified the phenomenon of “ class truth . ”
This is the idea , and it has had considerable currency in the international communist movement , that “ truth has a class character ” ... that the bourgeoisie has its truth and the proletariat has its truth about the same phenomena .
But this is wrong !
There is one reality .
What ’s true is true : it either corresponds to or does not correspond to reality in its motion and development .
And this notion of “ class truth ” overlaps with the erroneous idea that people of proletarian or peasant background have special access to the truth ... by virtue of their social position .
But , again , truth is truth no matter who articulates it , and what ’s wrong is wrong no matter who articulates it .
And getting at the truth , for proletarians as well as people of other social and class strata , requires the grasp and application of a scientific approach to society and the world .
Now Marxism provides the most thoroughgoing and systematic approach to understanding society and nature in their complexity and changing - ness .
But people who do not use this method — and even people who disdain and oppose Marxism — can discover important truths .
Avakian has pointed out that you want to promote Marxism in socialist society , the socialist state has to be doing this ... but you ca n’t make Marxism some “ official ideology . ”
You ca n’t impose it on people .
It has to be taken up consciously and willingly .
It has to be ideologically fought for ; it has to be interacting with other outlooks and methods ; and you need to be learning from all kinds of intellectual trends and currents .
There is class struggle in the realm of ideas over truth .
But you ca n’t dismiss people or their ideas because they do n’t come from “ good class backgrounds . ”
You ca n’t dismiss what they ’re saying or bringing forward because they may hold political positions opposed to the revolution and to communism .
You have to critically sift through all of this ... including uncomfortable and inconvenient truths that different people bring forward , that point to negative things in socialist society and in the leadership of society .
In socialism , you want the clash of ideas and debate on a vast , society - wide scale .
But the concept of “ class truth ” has impeded that kind of rich process of contention and ferment in previous socialist societies .
The Role of Elections
Question :
What you are emphasizing about the “ clash of ideas ” raises the question of elections under socialism .
Would n’t it be better to put the party to the test of competitive elections ?
Raymond Lotta :
Within the framework of not letting go of power , competitive elections under socialism are very important .
They are part of a larger process of uncovering problems in society and deepening understanding ... part of the search for the truth ... part of a larger process of bringing the masses into political and intellectual life .
It ’s crucial that contending lines be debated out broadly .
But the question of whether society should be socialist ... this is not going to be put up for vote .
This would be a betrayal of the struggle and sacrifice that brought the revolution to power ... a betrayal of the interests of the world revolution : “ oh , thanks a lot — you allowed yourself to be ‘ voted ’ out of office , to be ‘ out - organized ’ by old and new bourgeois and exploiting forces that threaten and cajole for the sole purpose of bringing back the old system . ”
This is different from some in the international communist movement who see multiparty elections as a means of preventing capitalist restoration under socialism .
There ’s a tendency to want to find a short - cut to a very difficult and vexing problem : how to keep on the socialist road to communism , and how to maintain the communist party as a vanguard party in power at the same time that you are creating the conditions , as part of the worldwide advance to communism and overcoming the division of society into classes , to go beyond the need for institutionalized leadership .
Avakian makes the point in his recent “ Ruminations ” talk1 that this whole approach of putting communist leadership up for vote assumes that the masses will spontaneously gravitate to correct understanding .
But this is not the case .
There are the advanced , intermediate , and backward among the masses .
And the communist revolution is challenging all traditional relations and ideas .
There ’s complexity to the class struggle under socialism .
Again , it ’s important for these contending lines to be debated out broadly .
But these things are not going to just sort themselves out .
The capitalist roaders and new bourgeois forces have a lot going for them .
They have spontaneity on their side .
They appeal to the customary way of doing things , the “ tried and true . ”
They rely on the force of habit deeply ingrained in class society — “ leave it to the skilled and experienced who seem to know what ’s best . ”
The capitalist roaders also have international capitalism on their side — in some cases , gaining actual support and backing — and the whole weight of world capitalism ... I ’m talking about its pressures and threats , and its inducements , all this is working to their advantage .
So the proletariat , through its vanguard party , ca n’t let go of state power , by allowing its rule to be put up for vote .
There needs to be leadership — genuine revolutionary communist leadership — or the revolution will be lost — which is unconscionable .
Avakian is saying that there should be contested elections over key issues facing society and the state .
These things need to be vigorously debated out .
There will be a civil society under socialism ... associations and organizations that are not part of the government ... in this case the socialist government .
There will be elections in which organized forces will be advancing platforms and putting forward candidates for positions of governance at various levels .
This will have real stakes ... I ’m talking about real policy outcomes .
Question :
But you are setting certain terms .
Raymond Lotta :
The new synthesis envisions and requires the revolution to firmly hold on to power to defend and advance the revolution .
You have to suppress counterrevolution .
To be clear , this is not the same as opposition to the government and to socialism ... we ’re talking about active efforts to undermine and overthrow the socialist state .
And this distinction has to be clearly spelled out in a constitution .
The new synthesis sees the need to unleash a whole process marked by greater elasticity than has been the case in the first wave of socialist revolution .
It sees a greater role for the contestation of different ideas and dissent throughout society , including ideas opposed to socialism and communism ... and as articulated by the most ardent advocates of those ideas .
The new synthesis envisions more space for initiatives running in all kinds of diverse and creative directions .
Getting to communism is not a single line of march forward .
Socialism has to be a society of great diversity , initiative , and experimentation .
There has to be all kinds of vibrant interplay between intellectuals and the masses .
And the new synthesis envisions even greater involvement of the masses themselves in working with ideas and in the actual direction of society in every sphere , taking up and wrestling with the biggest problems of the revolution .
At the same time , this has to be led , in an overall sense , so it is contributing to the achievement of communism .
Question :
This brings us back to the question of institutionalized leadership .
Raymond Lotta : Avakian has put forward the formulation “ solid core with a lot of elasticity ” to describe this orientation of the future socialist society .
First , there must be a solid core of leadership .
This solid core must firmly grasp the fundamental and final goal of the revolution , the achievement of communism , throughout the world , and must hold firmly onto the reins of power against imperialist pressure and capitalist elements arising within socialist society — and it must maintain the new state power as a socialist state power in transition to communist society .
Second , this leadership must expand the solid core to the greatest degree possible at any given time .
Third , it must be consistently working toward the realization of the conditions where such a solid core will no longer be necessary .
And , fourth , it must give expression to the greatest degree of elasticity at any time .
This elasticity is crucial .
Dissent and contestation need to be raging over the big issues of society and the world .
There has to be continual deepening of understanding , the continual interrogation of society and its leadership in all spheres and all institutions and structures .
It ’s not going to be some neat and orderly process .
As I said , in an overall sense it has to be led , summed up and sorted out , so that you are going towards communism .
But not led in the sense of being managed .
And the more far - reaching , probing , and contestational the texture of socialist society is — and I ’m talking about protests and upheavals — well , the greater the risks of losing power .
But that ’s where you have to be prepared to go !
It ’s mind - expanding .
Avakian has said that a hallmark of vanguard leadership in socialist society has to be actively seeking to go to that “ brink of being drawn and quartered . ”
What he means is that you will not be changing society in the ways it must be changed ... the masses of people will not be gaining the knowledge and understanding they must ... and they will not be able to increasingly develop the ability to master and transform society , in the direction of communism ... if you are not doing this .
This is all necessary to get to communism .
It ’s all necessary to finally overcoming the contradictions and conditions that require institutionalized vanguard leadership .
I ’m only touching on some aspects of the new synthesis , but taken as a whole it is a framework for the renewed advance of the communist project ... for how we can go further and do better in the next stage of communist revolution .
The new synthesis has ideologized revolution and communism back on the scene .

Few saw the potential of Napster in 1999 , said Mr Taylor .
The music industry would be in better shape now if it had engaged with Napster rather than fought it .
So says Geoff Taylor , head of music industry body BPI , in a column written for the BBC .
In the column , Mr Taylor expressed " regret " that the music industry did not move faster to work out how to use the net to promote and sell records .
But , he said , many sites that have come in the wake of Napster pose a threat because they are populated by pirates .
Mr Taylor said it was " probably true " that the music industry would be better prepared in 2009 if it had worked with Napster instead of taking the service to the courts .
" I , for one , regret that we were n't faster in figuring out how to create a sustainable model for music on the internet , " wrote Mr Taylor .
He added that the music industry in 1999 , when Napster debuted , would have struggled to create that business model because of rights issues , a lack of good copyright protection software and an inability to track downloads so that royalties were properly awarded .
The invention of Napster and all that has followed may soon deliver its greatest legacy - a renaissance in artistic creativity for the digital age

Geoff Taylor on Napster
The music industry took on Napster , said Mr Taylor , because the file - sharing system had no interest in developing the elements needed to turn it into a business .
" In 1999 Napster developed a great digital service , but did so at the expense of music , while the music business protected music at the expense of progressing online digital services , " he wrote .
Ten years on , said Mr Taylor , the music industry has got to grips with digital music , but added that file - sharing sites and technologies that have since emerged are doing damage to the music industry .
Innovation and investment , he said , was being undermined by piracy .
" There is simply no getting around the fact that billions of illegal free downloads of music every year in the UK mean that significantly less money is coming into the music ecosystem , " wrote Mr Taylor .
Finally , he said , Napster 's impact would be on more than just technology .
" The invention of Napster and all that has followed may soon deliver its greatest legacy - a renaissance in artistic creativity for the digital age , " he said .
In response , Jim Killock , head of the Open Rights Group , said : " It 's great that the BPI are willing to apologise for their past mistakes with Napster , but they are busy trying to make the same mistake again by ' clamping down ' on illicit P2P .
" By trying to get the government to clamp down on users , they risk alienating music 's greatest fans , and bringing copyright into disrepute , " he said .

As we announced yesterday , Google has released Latitude , its extension to Google Maps which allows you to share your location with your friends .
Here are ten reasons why I think it will succeed …
1. It ’s Google .
They are big , they are a verb , they are well known and well trusted .
Although the mobile apps space seems crowded , the fact that an 800 lb Gorilla just entered the room will make it change – and it ’ll probably squash a few people , push a few out , sit on a few , and maybe eat some .
It has already ‘ scaled ’ .
And ladies and gentlemen , it has just entered your building …
2 . It ’s Viral .
As I walked to where a local fishmonger parks his van each week , yesterday morning , I was able to invite several friends to join my network just using one hand on my phone .
Some had responded by the time I was walking back home with my fish .
By the time it was being cooked , I ’d invited over 50 people to share – and some messaged me to say thanks .
By the evening , several friends had done the same , and invited me to connect with them on Latitude .
3. Everything is local .
Yesterday , I could see where Boris was in Amsterdam , Sheryl in Washington , Anton near Galway , Bryan in New York , Will 2 miles across town in Edinburgh .
But what is important to me is always local – wherever I am – and especially if I am in a new place .
I want to know how to reach that meeting , where to get wifi or coffee , what ’s a nice spot for a 2 - hour lunch meeting , and when I ’m on the road , the mobile phone is my lifeline .
Over 90 % of people keep their mobile phone within a few metres of them 24 hours a day .
4 . It ’s Desktop and Mobile .
In my browser ’s iGoogle page , Latitude automatically appeared top left yesterday after I ’d downloaded latitude to my phone .
Nice touch .
And so I can respond to friends wanting to share their location with me , see their status , and update my status ( which updates in Gtalk , and also , optionally , Twitter and Friendfeed ) .
The desktop is where I can comfortably access information that is more verbose , more structured .
The mobile is where my search needs and attention span are different – Latitude serves both , and as a user , I can get valuable input from sharing both types of data .
5 : I am the most important person in the world .
You come second .
Everyone has an ego .
We like to have attention from others .
So it ’s natural to want to say “ here I am ” .
Latitude panders to that simple human need perfectly .
When there ’s a big conference like The Next Web , it ’d be great for finding new friends and pinpointing old ones .
And for switching it off sometimes , too , or appearing to be at a meeting when I ’m actually playing in the park with my child .
When I am thinking about sharing ‘ locations ’ , I feel it ’s nice to add things to maps like a good restaurant I know in Barcelona , or the cheapest place to park near our office in Edinburgh .
This is information I already share with friends , but now , I can put that information into play once , and leave it there for my friends – and they might update me if that restaurant closes , or they find a great bookshop – and share that with their friends .
6. Everyone understands Maps .
And if not , everyone understands satellite images .
And so everyone can relate to the information on a map .
Columbus went on instinct , but he started with maps .
I love to be able to see other cities and countries , whether I have been there , am going there , happen to meet someone from there , or if it ’s just in the news or comes up in conversation .
Maps satisfy my curiosity easily , and they are a starting point for asking for other types of information .
Who what when where why how how much ?
Wow , if live updates and location status was around when I was 19 , I ’d probably still be recovering from all the great parties and great stories I covered for the student newspaper , and still be amazed at how small the world was , because I had discovered so many mutual friends .
I can now see how Jim Haynes ‘ legendary Paris Sunday Night Dinners can scale .
Jim , we ’ll see you soon – really , or virtually !
7. Uncomplicated sharing .
Hre ’s the message you get when someone wants to share Latitude with you .
Subject : John Brown wants to share their location with you on Google Latitude
Message : John Brown ( [ email protected ] ) wants to share their location with you on Google Latitude .
You can use Latitude on your mobile phone , PC , or both .
To accept or reject the request , or to learn more about Latitude , click the link below .
http://m.google.com/latitude
( And a map showing where John is )
Simple , brief , to the point .
No hype , no lengthy explanation , no hard sell about how useful this is .
Brevity and clarity .
I do n’t mind sending or receiving that sort of message .
8 . That ’s not Latitude .
That ’s just an upgrade …
I used my non-GPS enabled phone ( better for texting ) , and then a GPS enabled one ( nice camera and great for doing interviews ) – both simply upgraded existing software .
It ’s not Google Latitude I installed , it ’s just the latest version of Google Maps .
3.0.0 . I remember when Windows reached version 3.0 was when that product really started to get useful .
And part of the reason it will succeed is that Google does n’t complicate or burden this by calling it mobile social networking , or ‘ location - aware interactive group software ’ .
Nah .
It calls it “ Latitude ” .
Like Docs , Maps , Earth , Mail , Images , News , Shopping , Checkout , Friend Connect , Maps .
Simple .
Functional .
Google .
9 . They still do n’t get it .
But they will .
In the Financial Times this morning ( and you may have to register to read that ;-) , the focus in their story about Latitude is privacy .
The headline ?
‘ Google to track mobile users ‘ .
Big brother anxiety is what has stopped ‘ mobile social networking ’ success .
Well sorry , privacy is dead , in the same way that newspapers are dying – and for similar reasons .
For those who fail to understand why Stephen Fry should have gained a following of over 100,000 on Twitter , here is the news .
Personal publicity and personal engagement lets you talk , lets you share ideas , makes you friends , and lets you influence people .
Always been that way , just now the tools are different – radically so – it ’s people power – always scary for the status quo .
And when things that one , younger generation ‘ gets ‘ and embraces readily as a vehicle for change and liberation , but another can’t understand , resist , and insist is dangerous , there ’s only ever one endgame – because the old folks die , and the cycle is endless .
So Latitude is part of an Attitude .
Dude .
10 . And What ’s next ?
It ’s a stable release , and it works .
iPhone application is yet to come , but it works in any web browser .
But what might be next is obviously including messaging .
And I can imagine the APIs might allow dating applications , being alerted to free wifi as you pass a cafe or pub , checking what films are on nearby – all of which the advertisers might be persuaded to pay for – Mobile AdSense , in effect .
Overlaying your own data onto maps , sharing that with others , and being able to choose what to filter in or out , or subscribe to a network ’s data or recommendations or reviews all have revenue possibilities .
Not to mention that the data carriers will love this extra data traffic as their revenue from call charges declines .
Android - based phones like the T - Mobile G1 may become suddenly much more desirable .
It ’s a building block in a semantic web – it ’s part of The Next Web .
Google , you did it again .
What would we do without you ?

Electronic chips keep getting smaller by the day .
The chief reason behind this is the reduction in size of the transistors that form an integral part of chips .
The pursuit of Moore ’s law has pushed the limits of physics ; scientists keep on finding newer and better ways to implement smaller yet more efficient technology .
Intel has always been at the vanguard when it comes to advances in nanotechnology .
It has made a transition from the current 65nm technology to 45nm size thus enabling more computational ability and greater power efficiency due to the smaller size .
Unlike its old transistors , the new ones comprise of metal gate and high k - gate oxide that are electrically more efficient materials and cause less power leakage .
And if 45 nm was n’t small enough Intel has already started work towards the development of 32nm technology .

EFCA ‘ COMPROMISE ’?….
With the upcoming fight over the Employee Free Choice
Act certain to be contentious , three companies with a fairly progressive reputation — Costco , Starbucks , and Whole Foods — are looking for a “ third way . ”
The companies , calling themselves the “ Committee for a Level Playing Field , ” not surprisingly , oppose EFCA .
They have , however , put together an alternative that they see as a compromise measure .
Their proposal would maintain management ’s right to demand a secret - ballot election and would leave out binding arbitration .
The proposal would keep the third main element of card check — toughening the penalties for companies that retaliate against workers before union elections or refuse to engage in collective bargaining .
But it would also toughen penalties for union violations , and it would make it easier for businesses to call elections to try to decertify a union .
To address labor ’s concern that businesses intimidate workers before elections , it would set a fixed period in which an election must be held , limiting the delays that give employers time to exert pressure .
The proposal does not specify what the time period should be .
The proposal would also provide unions equal access to workers before elections — for instance , by allowing organizers to address workers on a lunch break in the company cafeteria just as management can .
“ We wanted to see what we can do to come up with a compromise position that is going to address the concerns of labor and also protect the sanctity of the collective bargaining process and secret ballot , ” said Costco Wholesale chief executive James D. Sinegal .
Lanny Davis , a former special counsel to President Clinton , is reportedly helping to push this compromise , and told the Post that he ’s received positive feedback from about 20 Senate offices .
We do n’t know which 20 , but not surprisingly , Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas , a right - leaning Democrat who may break with his party over EFCA , said the proposal “ could result in a reasonable compromise . ”
It ’s too soon to say whether this measure will gain traction , but the anti-union forces have already denounced the compromise measure — the Workforce Fairness Institute used phrases like “ non-starter , ” “ even worse , ” and “ beyond absurd ” — almost immediately .
The AFL - CIO was similarly wary , though obviously for different reasons .
Stay tuned .
Update :
By the way , the proposal for the “ Committee for a Level Playing Field ” might sound familiar to regular readers of the Monthly .
A couple of issues ago , we ran a provocative piece by T.A. Frank with a related recommendation :
“ The question , then , is how much of a fight the card check provision merits .
And the answer is probably a little , but not a lot .
What most undermines the secret - ballot process is that employers can violate the law in numerous ways without consequences .
Under EFCA , however , every illegal action has the potential to be costly , so firings , spying , threats , or other forms of intimidation would be less likely .
Also , there is an alternative way to preserve the secret ballot while guarding against company malfeasance : expedited elections .
Under current law , months can go by between when NLRB announces the results of a card check vote and when a secret - ballot election is held .
If , however , this campaign window were reduced to just a few days , employers would have less opportunity to intimidate union supporters into changing their minds .
Workers I spoke to in Lancaster seemed content with this alternative .
And some savvy people in the labor movement I spoke to feel the same way — provided that employers either refrain from captive - audience campaigning or else grant union members equal access to the workplace during a campaign . ”
Second Update : I spoke this morning with a committee aide that Democratic leaders on the House Committee on Education and Labor will not accept this compromise , because the arbitration element of EFCA cannot be removed .
Something to keep in mind .
Third Update : A spokesperson for the House Education and Labor Committee further clarifies that Chairman Miller also continues to oppose dropping the provision that gives the choice of workers to organize through majority signup .
Trying to make sense of the Timberwolves ’ first two picks
Probably the most perplexing sequence of events occurred early last night when the Minnesota Timberwolves picked Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn — two pure point guards — with back - to - back picks .
My first instinct was that GM David Kahn ( Kaaaaaaaaaahn ! ) was working out a trade for one of the guards , possibly moving Rubio to the Warriors or Knicks or some other team for a pick and / or veteran help .
But then Ric Bucher popped his head in to inform us that Kahn said that he plans to play Rubio and Flynn together .
Later on , Kahn mentioned a few examples of point guard duos that have played well in the past , citing Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars , Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge , and …gulp … Michael Jordan and John Paxson .
Setting aside the Jordan / Paxson comparison for a moment , let ’s look at the other two examples .
DJ and Ainge were both 6 ’ 4 ″ combo guards and neither guy had to have the ball in his hands to be effective .
I do n’t think the same will be said about Rubio or Flynn ( certainly not Rubio ) .
Dumars was 6 ’ 3 ″ defensive stopper and deadeye shooter , while Zeke was a ball - dominant playmaker .
In short , Thomas was a pure point guard , while Dumars , Ainge and DJ were combo guards .
Those backcourts worked because the two players complemented each other .
But back to Jordan / Paxson — if I ’m a Timberwolves fan and I hear that my general manager is referring to Michael Jordan as a point guard , I ’m getting out on the ledge .
MJ was a 6 ’ 6 ″ wing , who could do everything — handle , shoot , post up and play defense .
He was more of a 2/3 who could run the point if necessary .
If Kahn really thinks that he was a point guard , then that shows an alarming lack of basic knowledge about the game .
But that ’s not the only reason the comparison is invalid .
A general manager should not be invoking Jordan ’s name when discussing his first few picks in the draft .
He is arguably the greatest player ever to play the game , so it ’s not fair to expect your rookies to do the same things he did .
Any backcourt that featured Jordan would have worked .
He was that good .
Once Hasheem Thabeet , James Harden and Tyreke Evans were off the board , I thought for sure the T - Wolves would take a point guard ( Rubio or Flynn ) and Stephen Curry , who is a smallish combo guard that can shoot the lights out .
If you want to run him at off guard , you need to pair him with a pure point guard to set him up .
A Flynn / Curry or Rubio / Curry backcourt would have had a real chance at working .
Rubio / Flynn would serve as the playmaker , while Curry ’s shooting would create space for Al Jefferson and Kevin Love to work in the post .
Defensively , a backcourt like that would have its share of problems , but at least it would make sense on the other end of the court .
I just do n’t think a Rubio / Flynn backcourt will work .
Both players are ball - dominant and neither guy shoots the ball very well .
Rubio is n’t strong enough to cover most opposing shooting guards and Flynn is n’t tall enough to cover big guards on the block .
Throw in the fact that Rubio does n’t sound too thrilled about the prospect of playing in Minnesota , and Kahn might have one big mess on his hands .
Here is some more commentary about Minnesota ’s first two picks …
Bill Simmons , from his draft day diary :
An orgasmic Fraschilla says Rubio is “ the best passer in the last decade of drafts ” and he ’s “ got a Gretzky - like feel , he sees the game two and three plays ahead . ”
Totally agree .
So much for Minnesota doing the right thing .
The Wolves just took Syracuse ’s Jonny Flynn … whom I really like … but … well … he ’s a point guard .
Did n’t they just take Rubio ?
Did I black out ?
You ’re going to have two young ball handlers playing together — one who ’s 5 - foot - 11 , the other who ’s 18 years old and weighs 180 pounds ( and 30 of that is his hair ) , and that ’s your plan ?
Who ’s guarding the Kobes and Vinces out of those two ?
Why did n’t they just take Curry ?
And why are n’t the ESPN guys wondering about a trade here or , at the very least , murdering this pick ?
THEY JUST TOOK TWO STRAIGHT POINT GUARDS !!!!!!!!!!
Chris Mannix , SI.com :
In a draft deep with point guards , Minnesota seemingly picked all of them .
At least that ’s what it felt like as four of the first five picks by new GM David Kahn play the point .
After a couple of trades , the Timberwolves were left with Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn , along with UNC shooting guard Wayne Ellington and forward Henk Norel of the Netherlands .
For now , the Timberwolves say they will go to camp with both Rubio and Flynn .
But Rubio may have something to say about that .
Sources close to Rubio say he is less than enamored with the prospect of playing in the Twin Cities and that his buyout situation with his Spanish club remains sticky .
If Rubio balks at coming to Minnesota or if he is forced to remain in Spain for another year ( a long shot , but possible ) , the Timberwolves could be forced to deal him .
Tom Powers , Pioneer Press :
At first , we thought Kahn had a trade up his sleeve .
After all , he had just sent his two top shooting guards to Washington .
Randy Foye and Mike Miller saw the bulk of the action at that position for the Wolves last season .
As near as I can tell , someone named Bobby Brown currently sits at the top of the Wolves ’ depth chart at that position .
That ’s because he is the only veteran two - guard left on the roster .
And he ’s not even a true shooting guard .
But Kahn quickly sent word that he planned to keep both players , giving examples of how two point guards have co-existed in the same backcourt — Michael Jordan and John Paxson , for instance .
Chad Ford , ESPN : Rubio and Flynn might have been the two best point guards in the draft .
But to fall in love with them both and actually take them both amounts to point guard polygamy .
I really do n’t know what to think about the Timberwolves ’ draft .
I keep waiting to hear about a trade that tells us where Rubio or Flynn is really going , but it has n’t come , and GM David Kahn says he wants to keep them both .
So , to recap : The Wolves traded two key players on their roster , Randy Foye and Mike Miller , and took back bad contracts to get the No. 5 pick , a questionable move .
Then they got the two guys they love , Rubio and Flynn . Terrific .
Then Kahn announced his idea to have Rubio and Flynn play together in the backcourt .
Huh ?
I could see it , I guess , had it been Stephen Curry they drafted to play alongside Rubio .
But Flynn as a 2 guard ?
Really ?
The Wolves appear to have outsmarted themselves .
Here ’s the problem : Even if the Wolves ’ idea to play them together was a good one ( and it is n’t ) , I do n’t think Rubio would go for it .
If he wants to , he can go back to Spain for the next year or two ( or more ) and really foul things up for the Wolves .
Given how things look right now , I think he just might do it .
Jim Souhan , Star Tribune : Kahn assures us the two will play together , in the manner of Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge or Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas .
That concept , along with Flynn ’s toughness , is intriguing , but this draft will be defined by Rubio .
He could be great .
He could be a soft Euro who gets eaten up by stronger , fiercer players such as Tyreke Evans and Flynn .
I lean toward the former view .
In a league that has outlawed handchecking , skilled guards — and especially skilled guards with size — can dominate .
The key for Rubio will be working with a coach who can help him develop and teammates who can make use of his passing .
That ’s where this gets tricky .
At this moment the Wolves ’ two cornerstone players — Al Jefferson and Rubio — might as well play different sports .
Jefferson needs room and time in the low post , and the Wolves did n’t draft Rubio to stand outside , dump the ball in to Jefferson and get back on defense .
Henry Abbott , TrueHoop : [ Kahn ] called Rubio potentially a “ transformational ” player , and was clear that “ it was not an attempt to take Ricky to trade him . ”
( There was a report from a TrueHoop reader in Minnesota that Kahn was effusive about Jonny Flynn , and mentioned to the assembled crowd that it was possible Rubio would not come over this season , which was odd as Rubio had said time and again he would come . )
Whether Kahn intends to keep Rubio or trade him , it ’s a good strategy to say he ’s in Minnesota to stay .
Were Kahn to say that he drafted Rubio to trade him , he ’d lose leverage in trade negotiations .
( He needs his suitors to think that he ’d hate to part with Rubio , but for the right price … we could talk . )
Remember when the Bucks drafted Yi Jianlian , and there was much bellyaching about whether not the Chinese player would report to Milwaukee ?
A year later , Yi was later traded to a team more to his liking , in New Jersey .
His hard - bargaining agent was Dan Fegan — who also represents Rubio .
That ’s no sign the relationship between the Timberwolves and Rubio will end the same way — culminating in an eventual departure .
But it ’s starting out in similar vein .

Parametrized Tests and unittest
Yet another blog entry on unittest ; this is the last one in my list so I 'm not planning any more for a while .
Something that both nose and py.test provide that unittest ( the Python standard library testing framework ) does n't is a builtin mechanism for writing parametrized tests .
The technique that both nose and py.test use ( currently anyway ) is to allow your test methods to be generators that return a series of tests .
The testing framework then runs all these tests for you .
Whenever I 've needed to run a series of similar tests with different input parameters I 've always used a simple loop ; something like :
def testSomething ( self ) :
for x in range ( 100 ) :
for y in range ( 100 ) :
self .
assertSomethingForXandY
( x , y )
The problem with this approach is that as soon as you have a failure for any of the x , y value combinations the test will stop running .
In some circumstances it would be much better for all the tests to run and have all the failures reported instead of just the first .
With nose , you could write the above test like this :
def testSomething ( self ) :
for x in range ( 100 ) :
for y in range ( 100 ) :
yield self .
assertSomethingForXandY , x , y
Nose would detect that the test is a generator and collect the functions ( along with their arguments ) that it yields and run them independently .
The disadvantage of this approach is that you can't know up front how many tests you have ( and indeed it could change every time you run the tests ) and neither are they isolated from each other ( they share the fixture ) .
Although unittest does n't include an equivalent it is easy to achieve the same thing and there are several possible approaches .
The two I 've come up with , prompted by another discussion on the Testing in Python mailing list and with Brandon Craig Rhodes , are available as params .
py from my unittest - ext sandbox project ( where I tinker with unittest related stuff from time to time ) .
( Note - after showing you two possible approaches I 'll show you some better ways that other people have found for solving the same problem . )
The first uses a metaclass in concert with a decorator .
You decorate methods with a list of dictionaries - for every dictionary in the list the method will be called with the parameters from the dictionary .
( It 'll be easier to understand when I show you some code using it . )
The metaclass examines all decorated methods at class creation time and adds new test methods to the class .
import unittest
from types import FunctionType
class Paramaterizer ( type ) :
def __new__ ( meta , class_name , bases , attrs ) :
for name , item in attrs .
items ( ) :
if not isinstance ( item , FunctionType ) :
continue
params = getattr ( item , ' params ' , None )
if params is None :
continue
for index , args in enumerate ( params ) :
def test ( self , args = args , name = name ) :
assertMethod = getattr ( self , name )
assertMethod ( ** args )
test .
__doc__ = " " " %s with args : %s " " " % ( name , args )
test_name = ' test_%s_%s ' % ( name , index + 1 )
test .
__name__ = test_name
if test_name in attrs :
raise Exception ( ' Test class %s already has a method called : %s ' %
( class_name , test_name ) )
attrs [ test_name ] = test
return type .
__new__ ( meta , class_name , bases , attrs )
def with_params ( params ) :
def inner ( func ) :
func .
params = params
return func
return inner
class TestCaseWithParams ( unittest .
TestCase ) :
__metaclass__ = Paramaterizer
You do n't need to use the metaclass directly , instead subclass TestCaseWithParams :
class Test ( TestCaseWithParams ) :
@ with_params ( [ dict ( a = 1 , b = 2 ) , dict ( a = 3 , b = 3 ) , dict ( a = 5 , b = 4 ) ] )
def assertEqualWithParams ( self , a , b ) :
self .
assertEqual ( a , b )
@ with_params ( [ dict ( a = 1 , b = 0 ) , dict ( a = 3 , b = 2 ) ] )
def assertZeroDivisionWithParams ( self , a , b ) :
self .
assertRaises ( ZeroDivisionError , lambda : a / b )
The disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know ( or calculate ) all of the parameters at class creation time instead of when the test runs .
The advantage is that the number of tests is known ahead of running the tests - so countTestCases on the TestSuite works as normal and each failure is recorded individually .
Another approach is to use the same generator technique as nose / py.test with a decorator that runs all the tests yielded by the generator .
def test_generator ( func ) :
def inner ( self ) :
failures = [ ]
errors = [ ]
for test , args in func ( self ) :
try :
test ( * args )
except self .
failureException , e :
failures .
append ( ( test .
__name__ , args , e ) )
except KeyboardInterrupt :
raise
except :
e = sys .
exc_info ( ) [ 1 ]
errors .
append ( ( test .
__name__ , args , e ) )
msg = '
' . join ( ' %s %s : %s : %s ' % ( name , args , e .
__class__ .
__name__ , e ) for ( name , args , e ) in failures + errors )
if errors :
raise Exception ( msg )
raise self .
failureException ( msg )
return inner
class Test2 ( unittest .
TestCase ) :
@ test_generator
def testSomething ( self ) :
for a , b in ( ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 3 ) , ( 5 , 4 ) ) :
yield self .
assertEqual , ( a , b )
def raises ( ) :
raise Exception ( ' phooey ' )
yield raises , ( )
This is a bit less ' heavy ' than using a metaclass .
Decorated tests are all run to completion .
If any test fails or errors then an appropriate failure is raised - with the message listing all the failures .
It has the advantage of allowing tests to be created at test execution time , but the disadvantage of all failures only counting as a single failure .
The total number of tests counted will only count generative tests as a single test .
If you run the code above you 'll see how errors are reported and it is ok ( could do better - must try harder ) .
It is also easy to use with any unittest based test framework .
Of course other people have come up with better ideas - which I may evaluate for integrating into unittest .
They do still suffer from the problem of non-deterministic number of tests ( breaking the countTestCases part of the unittest protocol ) but this is unavoidable with this feature .
Konrad Delong posted one solution to his blog : Reporting assertions as a way for test parameterization .
The code is here .
He uses a decorator to collect the failures / errors and modifies TestCase.run to be aware of them .
I like this technique .
Robert Collins has a different solution , which at the heart uses a similar technique but is more general and powerful .
This is his testscenarios project .
( Every time I try to actually find the code on a launchpad project I go round in circles for a while first .
Anyway - it 's here . )
The project is described thusly :
testscenarios provides clean dependency injection for python unittest style tests .
This can be used for interface testing ( testing many implementations via a single test suite ) or for classic dependency injection ( provide tests with dependencies externally to the test code itself , allowing easy testing in different situations ) .
Instead of just individual tests it allows you to parameterize whole test cases - so you can do ' interface ' testing where you swap out the backend implementation and check that all tests pass for various different backends .
The basic nose / py.test technique for generator tests is a dirty hack .
They introspect the test method code objects to see which of them are generators .
Holger Krekel , core developer of py.test , also thinks that they offer little real advantage over loops and is looking to replace them in py.test with a more powerful system .
This uses pytest_generate_tests and he describes it in : Parametrizing Python tests , generalized .
This new system is more powerful , but it seems to make the simple cases more difficult .
If Holger is right in that a generalized mechanism that only caters for the simple cases does n't really have much advantage then this new system may indeed be a winner .
Gadgets : Samsung SSD , Sharkoon SATA Adaptor , Mimo USB Monitor and Powermate USB Volume Knob ( ! )
Over the last few months I 've bought a few new gadgets , and they 're well overdue a review ; so here goes .
As I 'm sure you 're aware Solid State Drives are hard drives using flash memory instead of mechanical disks ; this eliminates the need for spin up , plus makes seek times and data rates potentially much faster and power consumption less .
I wanted this for my Apple Macbook Pro , which only had a 120 gig hard drive .
Advantages for me would be a bigger hard drive , a faster hard drive , and through less heat / power a longer battery life as well .
Fitting it was a royal pain in the *ss .
I followed the instructions from this article : Upgrade Your MacBook Pro's Hard Drive .
They 're pretty good , the only place I deviated from them was that once I got inside my Mac the bluetooth module was n't on top of the hard drive I was removing .
This was a good thing .
The hardest part was levering the keyboard top panel from off the innards .
This really did n't want to come off , and it is attached by a ribbon cable to the motherboard so you can't be too violent in your attempts to pry it free .
It came eventually .
Scraping the ribbon cable that is glued to the top of the existing drive free is also slightly nerve - wracking .
Choosing an SSD is almost as painful as fitting .
The current crop of drives are the first that are within the realms of affordable ( although still expensive ) , but many of them suffer from real performance issue once you have written a certain amount of data ( random write access becomes far slower than even normal hard drives ) .
This AnandTech Article is essential reading on the subject .
It was written before the PB22 came out , and the conclusion it came to is that only the OCZ Vertex and the Intel X25 - M are worth having .
From what I 've read the PB22 does n't suffer the same problems that plague the earlier drives and it is cheaper than both the Vertex and the X25 - M so I decided to go for it .
And as for performance , well .
XBench reported ( results here ) an average of 3 x faster than a standard Macbook Pro on all the drive benchmarks .
The difference in general is noticeable but perhaps not overwhelming .
The most striking change was in launching Microsoft Office for the Mac ; it launched in about 3 seconds instead of 12 !
The disappointing thing is that starting my Windows VM ( VMWare Fusion ) is not much faster , although shutting it down is ( which was already pretty fast ) .
Even worse , booting my Mac up ( something I do n't do very often ) - if you include the fifteen to twenty second freeze on start which arrived with the new drive - took about the same amount of time .
In the end , whilst trying to fix a different problem with another of my new gadgets I reset the PRAM on my Macbook , which fixed it !
Now on the once a month occasion I restart my laptop it will happen really quickly .
Overall the biggest difference that fitting the SSD made was that I now have a bigger hard drive .
Everything is faster but possibly not enough to make it worth the cost , it seems that other than Word most of the apps I start are network or CPU bound .
The downside is that after investing in the SSD I probably have to wait another couple of years before I replace my Macbook .
When I ordered the SSD I also ordered a 2.5 " SATA adaptor to go with it .
I asked the salesman if the adaptor would work with the SSD and he did suggest that buying an SSD and then using it through a USB adaptor did n't sound that sensible .
Actually I wanted the adaptor to clone the internal drive of my Mac onto the SSD before fitting it .
The nice thing about the Sharkoon is that it has connectors for SATA drives and 2.5 " / 3.5 " IDE drives .
Like many geeks I often have random hard drives lying around and this will allow me to use them .
It worked fine ( without needing a driver ) on Mac OS X , despite not advertising Mac compatibility .
It even comes with some funky rubber sheaths for attached drives if you want to leave one connected for anything other than a short period of time .
To clone the internal drive in the laptop onto the SSD I used Carbon Copy Cloner .
Cloning a 120gig drive ( CCC claimed it would do a block level clone but actually did a file level clone ) took hours .
It was slightly worrying to see the occupied size of the new drive was about 200meg less than the original - but I imagine this is a consequence of smaller blocks on the SSD and CCC doing a file level clone .
Anyway it worked fine .
Mimo monitors make a range of 800x480 pixel USB monitors .
I wanted the 740 touchscreen monitor for a home media server project .
The 740 was out of stock so I ended up with the 710 and the media server project got shelved ( I ditched wireless for my main computer as it was sporadically unreliable and with a wired connection to the desktop no need for a separate server ) .
The monitor is a fantastic second monitor for my laptop but I only use it when I have a power source .
Rather than see it unused I have it attached to my desktop ( technically my sixth monitor ) showing my twitter stream via Tweetdeck .
This photo shows the Mimo and the Powermate volume control ( see below ) .
It turned out to be an irresistible but expensive toy , quelle surprise .
Definitely useful though and in constant use , so it 's fared better than some of the expensive toys I 've bought in the past ( Nintendo DS I 'm talking to you ) .
Unfortunately there is a problem with the displaylink driver and the Mac OS X 10.5.7 update .
Some details of the problem here and more here ( apparently it is a known issue with 10.5.7 and not the fault of the driver ) .
Uninstalling and re-installing the driver worked for me , but sometimes the display does n't work if I restart my laptop with it plugged in ( remembering to unplug it before restarting does the trick ) .
This was another toy .
Whenever I am at my computer I almost inevitably have a movie playing and this expensive little knob is a volume control .
It has much more granularity than using the keyboard to control the volume and I find it surprisingly useful .
You can configure different behaviour ( e.g. scrolling ) for different applications , but I just use it as a volume control .

Future adventures of unittest and a mini-rant
There is a general rule that innovation does n't happen in the standard library .
Instead modules or techniques that have already proven themselves in the Python community are adopted into the standard library .
This is exemplified in the standard library testing framework , unittest , which until recently stagnated whilst frameworks like nose and py.test pushed forward the boundaries of testing in Python .
Features like test discovery and cleanup functions that have been brought into unittest first appeared in other testing frameworks .
The next releases of Python ( 2.7 / 3.1 / 3.2 ) will see but some great improvements to unittest but it is still far from being perfect .
In the spirit of lists of things I do n't like about something I do like ( and before I rant ) here are what I think are the main problems ( or the main perceived problems ) with unittest :
It is a single monolithic file , it should be a package Hard to extend / write plugins People want to write functions not classes - unnecessary boilerplate
No class ( or module level ) setUp and tearDown
No standard mechanism for parameterized ( generative ) tests
Let 's dig into these and see what we can do about them :
Currently unittest.py is 1760 lines of Python and test_unittest.py is 3699 lines .
Frankly that 's horrible and it makes unittest hard to understand and hard to maintain .
Benjamin Peterson ( the current Python release manager ) has said he will split unittest into a package after Python 3.1 is released .
If he does n't have time for it then I 'll do it .
Once you are familiar with the responsibilities of the various moving parts in unittest ( TestCase , TestRunner , TestLoader , TestSuite and TestResult ) it is pretty easy to extend .
Unfortunately it is difficult to extend so that other people can reuse what you have done .
If you write a TestResult that writes colorized output to the console and I write one that pushes results to a database then the chances are that a new project will have to choose one or the other and can't use both .
It is n't impossible , and there are projects that do it very well , but there is no standard plugin mechanism or culture of sharing extensions .
I 'd like to look at whether a plugin system with some compatibility with the nose / py.test plugins is plausible or just a pipe dream .
Haha -
I shake my fuzzywuzzy beard at you in bewilderment .
Do you people dislike OOP , the class statement is mere boilerplate to you , I mumble incoherent French obscenities in your general direction .
( Did you know the French acronym for object - oriented programming is POO ? ) .
I find grouping tests by class very useful .
Although nose and py.test allow you to organise tests as module level functions most people I know still use classes to group tests .
In fact unittest does provide a way for you to write test functions rather than classes - but I 'm not telling you what it is .
This is a double edged sword .
For expensive fixtures ( like big databases ) it is a slow pain to have to recreate them for every test ( in setUp ) .
What you think you want is to be able to have a class or module level setUp where it is done once and shared between tests .
Nose and py.test give you what you think you want ( which in general is a good policy I guess ) , but this does violate test isolation .
When unittest runs tests it instantiates the TestCase separately for every test it runs ; every test is run in a fresh instance unsullied by previous tests .
You can already work round this by creating class attributes instead of instance attributes of course .
The Twisted test framework ( built on unittest ) used to provide for shared fixtures with setUpClass / tearDownClass .
When this was discussed recently on Testing in Python , people had this to say of them : Jonathan Lange :
It 's worth treading carefully where Shared Fixtures are concerned .
They tend to lead to Erratic Tests and Fragile Tests .
Twisted added setUpClass and tearDownClass to Trial and they have caused us nothing but grief .
To be fair , they were added before classmethod was added to Python , which caused much of the pain .
Andrew Bennetts : I agree with Jonathan here .
Twisted 's setUpClass / tearDownClass were terrible , for the reasons he gave .
They both recommended instead the testresources library for shared resources with unittest .
Other than being GPL this looks like a useful library .
At some point I 'll investigate this and consider how shared fixtures might be usefully added to unittest .
And this topic I leave for a blog entry all of its own ...
Now for the rant ...
I have a lot of admiration for nose and py.test .
They have helped popularise Python testing and brought many new and interesting ideas .
They have n't had features compelling enough to make me jump from unittest ( and until recently IronPython compatibility has been an issue for much of what I 've done ) but I can understand why many new projects use them .
Something that p*isses me off about them though is the way that their evangelists extoll their virtues by denigrating unittest , and in ways that I think are bizarre .
If the library / framework that you like so much so good then let it stand on its own two feet and not denigrate alternatives .
The latest person to do this , and so raise my ire , was the otherwise sound - and - sensible Brandon Craig Rhodes in the first part of his Python testing frameworks article on the IBM developerworks site .
Of a short unittest example he says :
Look at all of the scaffolding that was necessary to support two actual lines of test code !
First , this code requires an import statement that is completely irrelevant to the code under test , since the tests themselves simply ignore the module and use only built - in Python values like True and False .
Furthermore , a class is created that does not support or enhance the tests , since they do not actually use their self argument for anything .
And , finally , it requires two lines of boilerplate down at the bottom , so that this particular test can be run by itself from the command line .
The scaffolding that he is talking about is two lines at the start of the test module and two lines at the end .
One of those lines is the import of unittest ( irrelevant ? ? ) and the other is the class definition .
As I mentioned , most serious users of nose / py.test still write class structured tests and any serious testing module is going to import a whole lot of stuff - including objects from your testing framework .
This criticism seems vacuous and unrepresentative of any serious testing environment ( four lines may be a lot when your whole testing code is less than ten lines - but in the real world this is less than a non-issue ) .
Unfortunately many of the criticisms of unittest in articles on alternative testing frameworks seem to state this as one of the most important advantages of switching ...
Brandon also says later of the assert methods " First , calling a method hurts readability " .
This I can understand but just plain disagree with I guess and I do n't think unittest would be improved by providing a host of assert functions to import rather than having them as methods on TestCase ( see my previous comments on OOP and fuzzywuzzy beards ) .
I 'm also dubious of the heavy magic done by nose / py.test to support useful error messages when using plain asserts .
This magic has portability implications to other implementations like Jython and IronPython .
The other two ( whole ) lines of boiler - plate that Brandon bemoans are the lines necessary to make a test module executable on its own :
if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : unittest.main ( )
This is true , up until Python 2.6 these two ( whole ) lines are needed .
However , test discovery and better command line options have been added to unittest in Python 2.7 .
If we 're going to be precise about the matter though , you may need these two lines in your test module under unittest - but in a fresh install of Python the whole nose module itself becomes unnecessary boilerplate compared to unittest ...
I 've exchanged emails with Brandon about this , and he suggested we both blog about it - so I eagerly await his response .
Archives
About two years ago , I posted a review of US state tourism web sites , in which I uncovered a range of web site design going all the way from great to downright ugly .
More recently , Sam Dunn did his own summary of 22 well - designed state tourism web sites .
Comparing Sam ’s picks for the best state tourism web sites against their 2007 counterparts made me go back and look through my own list to see how all the sites had changed .
All I can say is “ What a difference two years makes . ”
Note : all screenshots were taken in a 1024 ×768 browser window .
Alabama
Alabama ’s web site was good to begin with :
Alabama state tourism website : 2007
So I ’m not too surprised that it has n’t really changed :
Alabama state tourism website : 2009
Alaska
This dull and uninviting site was in dire need of a redesign :
Alaska state tourism website : 2007
What an improvement !
The new site is much more modern and appealing :
Alaska state tourism website : 2009
Arizona
The old site was mediocre in terms of design and overdid it with the desert color scheme ( yes , we get it — Arizona is dusty ) :
Arizona state tourism website : 2007
For some reason no one at the tourism has felt the need to do much at all with the site since .
If anything , the layout of the home page has taken a step backwards :
Arizona state tourism website : 2009
Arkansas
Arkansas ’ tourism site has undergone a transformation , going from an ancient - looking :
Arkansas state tourism website : 2007
To a much more modern , vibrant , content - rich ( and yes , very yellow ) design :
Arkansas state tourism website : 2009
California
I liked the California site before , even though the home page was all done in Flash :
California state tourism website : 2007
Apparently , the all - Flash approach did n’t work out as it has gone , although the new site still retains the flavor of the old one and is nicely organized :
California state tourism website : 2009
Colorado
Other than having great imagery , Colorado ’s site was fairly workmanlike in its design :
Colorado state tourism website : 2007
The current site is much improved , with a super Flash carousel and a much cleaner layout , which although it verges on being a little on the empty side :
Colorado state tourism website : 2009
Connecticut
Having a pretty decent , albeit somewhat stark , site to begin with :
Connecticut state tourism website : 2007
Connecticut have opted to not really change much at all .
A little color would n’t go amiss :
Connecticut state tourism website : 2009
Delaware
Delaware ’s site was n’t bad , but was already looking dated in 2007 :
Delaware state tourism website : 2007
Well , there ’s been no redesign and for some reason the potentially useful “ attractions & events ” section has been pushed down to make room for a letter from the governor :
Delaware state tourism website : 2009
Florida
Florida ’s web site captured the feel of the state well , although it had a few layout issues :
Florida state tourism website : 2007
The new web site is a marked improvement , with a lot to see and do as you plan your trip :
Florida state tourism website : 2009
Georgia
Georgia ’s site was pretty but a little bland :
Georgia state tourism website : 2007
The new site is an improvement , both in terms of the visuals and in bringing more functionality and information to the home page :
Georgia state tourism website : 2009
Hawaii
The old site was n’t too bad at all , although it was a little sparse on home page content :
Hawaii state tourism website : 2007
The current site does a much better job of representing the idea of Hawaii as well as bringing a lot more content and interactivity to the forefront :
Hawaii state tourism website : 2009
Idaho
The old site was in need of a redesign , with a dated design that underserved the features of the state :
Idaho state tourism website : 2007
Although a little rigid in terms of layout , the new site is much more appealing :
Idaho state tourism website : 2009
Illinois
Illinois ’ site was well organized but rather cold and uninviting :
Illinois state tourism website : 2007
Strangely , the redesigned site is even more so ( it reminds me of John McCain ’s infamous ‘ black ’ web site ) :
Illinois state tourism website : 2009
Indiana
The old site gave a wonderful impression of how damn cold it must be there right now ( although I ’m not sure if this was intentional ) :
Indiana state tourism website : 2007
Although the current site uses a little more color , the layout of the home page has degraded over time and it does n’t feel as integrated as the previous design :
Indiana state tourism website : 2009
Iowa
The old site was in desperate need of a redesign — even the imagery was awful :
Iowa state tourism website : 2007
And what a great redesign it turned out to be .
The home page is brimming with content , color , vacation ideas and tools .
I ’m not quite sure what happened with the background image implementation , but this is a small detail :
Iowa state tourism website : 2009
Kansas
Two years ago the Kansas site had a fairly uninspiring , middle - of - the - road site design :
Kansas state tourism website : 2007
Well , it has n’t changed except to remove a great chunk of content from the center of the home page and add a “ welcome to our web site ” heading :
Kansas state tourism website : 2009
Kentucky
Kentucky ’s old site was appealing to look at and well laid out :
Kentucky state tourism website : 2007
So it ’s not surprising that they ’ve chosen to stick with the design :
Kentucky state tourism website : 2009
Louisiana
The old web site felt oddly broken into two parts , with a giant trip booking tool that took over far too much of the home page :
Louisiana state tourism website : 2007
The redesigned site is a considerable improvement with a pleasing design and a much greater focus on content :
Louisiana state tourism website : 2009
Maine
Maine ’s site looked perfectly acceptable a year ago :
Maine state tourism website : 2007
However , I much prefer their redesign .
Here ’s how to present winter without it looking cold and dreary :
Maine state tourism website : 2009
Maryland
Back in 2007 , Maryland had one of the worst - designed web sites :
Maryland state tourism website : 2007
Although not a contender for ‘ best of the bunch , ’ its redesign has at least brought it up to par :
Maryland state tourism website : 2009
Massachusetts
Massachusetts has gone from a very dated looking home page and design :
Massachusetts state tourism website : 2007
To one which feels much more contemporary and is content - rich and actually useful :
Massachusetts state tourism website : 2009
Michigan
The old site was certainly full of content , but suffered from a lackluster design :

The redesigned site is a big improvement in terms of overall design and layout , although it feels in need of some bolder imagery and color choices :

Minnesota
In 2007 Minnesota ’s site looked great above the fold but then seemed to run out of ideas as you scrolled down :

The new site is more interesting to look at and has a more cohesive home page design .
However , on closer inspection it feels like it needs one more pass to turn it into a truly great design :

Mississippi
I found the color scheme of the old site to be pretty unappealing and the overall layout rather uninspiring :

Incredibly , the design of the site has n’t changed a bit in 2 years :

Missouri
While the old site was n’t bad , once you got below the fold there was n’t much to recommend from a design standpoint :

The new site has certainly made some bold design choices , although I ’m not sure they entirely work once you move down into the content area .
I also have no idea why the search box is so huge :

So , that ’s my roundup of US state tourism sites 1 to 25 .
Stay tuned for the rest and some concluding thoughts in part 2 .
The concrete lion statue at the centre of a demon possession claim looks less angry now than it did when it was at the Wainuiomata flat where Janet Moses died , a jury has heard .
The Crown claims the 22 - year - old mother - of - two drowned during a ceremony to exorcise a curse or makutu on October 12 , 2007 .
A kaumatua , or elder , had linked the demon possession to a lion statue that Ms Moses ' sister had taken from the Greytown Hotel a few weeks earlier .
In the High Court at Wellington today witness Horo Kepa said that in October 2007 he had heard about the lion and went to look at it .
It was behind his grandparents ' Wainuiomata flat .
It had been covered and when he removed the cover the statue looked angry and wild .
He was asked if it was the same statue that is an exhibit before the court .
" Yes , but it looked angrier than that , " he told prosecutor Grant Burston .
Mr Kepa 's parents are among nine of Ms Moses ' uncles and aunts charged with her manslaughter .
But witnesses from the family have told the jury they thought they had to help remove the makutu , or curse , and that Ms Moses would have wanted them to help .
CHILD'S ABNORMAL , SCARY VISION
Earlier today the court heard that Ms Moses ' young daughter had a vision of her grandfather and her dead grandmother talking about Ms Moses with blood around her mouth .
Ms Moses ' daughter Keita had her third birthday two days after her mother died .
In court today Ms Moses ' cousin Natalie Wharepapa , whose parents are among the nine charged with Ms Moses ' manslaughter , said she sought the advice of older members of the family when Keita talked about her " vision " .
Keita said she had seen her paternal grandparents , one of whom had died more than 20 years earlier , at her parents home talking about her mother and saying she had blood on her mouth .
Ms Wharepapa said she thought it abnormal and scary .
After asking for advice the decision was made to take Keita and several other children to the Wainuiomata flat where Ms Moses and other members of the extended family had gathered .
But when Keita saw her mother she screamed and did not want to go near her , and Ms Moses did nothing in response .
" Janet was normally the best mother you could get , " Ms Wharepapa said .
The trial is continuing .
THE ACCUSED
* Nine members of Janet Moses ' extended family are charged with her manslaughter , which the Crown alleges was the result of an attempt to remove a curse - a makutu - or evil spirit .
* The accused are : John Tahana Rawiri , 49 , Georgina Aroha Rawiri , 50 , Aroha Gwendoline Wharepapa , 48 , Hall Jones Wharepapa , 46 , Tanginoa Apanui , 42 , Angela Rangiaroha Orupe , 46 , Gaylene Tangiohorere Kepa , 44 , Alfred Hughes Kepa , 48 , and Glenys Lynette Wright , 52 .
All are siblings of Ms Moses ' mother , or their partners .
* Two people , whose names are suppressed , are charged with cruelty to a 14 - year - old girl in their care .
* The charges date from October 12 , 2007 , at Wainuiomata , when the Crown alleges Ms Moses and others were subjected to a water - based ceremony .
When British foreign secretary David Miliband arrived in Colombo on April 29 to press for a humanitarian halt in Sri Lanka 's military offensive to run over the last corral of LTTE leadership , the response was interesting .
Miliband gave a long explanation , distinguishing his government 's concern for civilian population and the right of Sri Lankan troops to rout Tigers .
But Colombo was in no mood to listen to even a remote suggestion for a halt .
Within hours , huge derogatory posters with Miliband 's picture , " Wanted for aiding and abetting terrorism " were put up across Colombo .
The Sri Lankan defence minister Nandasena Gotabhaya Rajapakse  the president 's younger brother  even asked the US and UK to " mind their own business " .
The United Nations was also accused of double standards and pro-terrorist leanings .
Outside the British embassy , a group of pro-government monks sat on a protest , asking Britain whether they would pressure the US to send humanitarian aid to Osama Bin Laden .
Colombo had successfully appropriated the " war on terror " discourse and used it effectively to go for a massive military offensive against the LTTE that was literally ruling 15,000 square kilometers in the north and east of the island .
Though the Tigers had nothing similar with Al Qaeda or other Islamic groups , Colombo deliberately fit its decades - long ethnic problem in the larger discourse of the war on terror .
Ignoring every call for a ceasefire , the Rajapakse regime provided its armed forces with unflinching political support to take the war to its logical conclusion .
And when the elite regiment of the Sri Lankan army 's 53 division finally made the final push , they not only eliminated the entire top brass of the LTTE , but also claimed to have produced the bullet - ridden body of its chief Velupillai Prabhakaran .
This final battle has put the curtains on the LTTE , who effectively occupied the centrestage of the ethnic dispute between Sri Lanka 's majority Sinhalese population and its Tamil minority .
But the violent rout of one of the world 's most powerful terror group , which had militarily defeated Sri Lanka 's army in three earlier wars , forcing Colombo to join a peace process brokered by Norway came with a bigger lesson for insurgencies fighting for a political cause .
AK - 47s cannot defeat a state and when people and communities with genuine political grievances take up arms , it only provides the state with an easy way out to enforce a military solution .
9/11 has completely blurred the line dividing terrorism and armed struggle for political rights and now any violent movement  no matter how genuine and righteous its cause may be  will not get any sympathy from the international community .
The rise and fall of theTigers , in fact , is a lesson for insurgent groups across the world .
From a gang of 40 boys in 1975 , the group rose to achieve a military prowess unknown for any insurgent group in the world .
The discipline and determination of its cadre to lay down their lives for the Eelam cause was unprecedented .
After 25 years of single - minded devotion and readiness to kill and die for the Tamil homeland , Tiger leader Prabhakaran seemed invincible .
But the Tigers failed to understand that war alone is never enough .
And at the height of their military success when they forced Colombo to enter into a peace process , Prabhakaran and his group did n't understand the necessity of the transition from terror tactics to pure politics .
History had given the Tigers a rare chance even in a post - 9/11 world to sit at a negotiating table and ensure that the Tamil minority gets genuine political and constitutional rights in Sri Lanka .
But like several other insurgencies , the Tigers too were blinded by their military success and a false sense of invincibility .
Today , the Tamil minority , in whose name the Tigers killed and died , are at the mercy of a ruling alliance in Colombo which is dominated by a Sinhala - Buddhist supremacist discourse .
In the process of the Tigers ' humiliating defeat , they took away any semblance of credibility from the moderate political forces from the Sinhalese majority too .
The military success of Rajapakasha regime has effectively eclipsed Ranil Wickramasinghe and other political parties who had supported a historic truce with Tigers in 2002 .
Like the Tigers , the Kashmir insurgency also had several opportunities to understand the world 's changing political realities , halt violence and take a moral high ground on a negotiating table .
But each time , the opportunity provided by a military success was lost with a complete underestimation of the power of the state .
Then there is another worrying aspect of the Tigers ' rout .
This group had consistently silenced every voice of dissent among its own community with the aim of becoming the sole representatives of Tamil aspirations .
And after their rout , there is hardly any other voice to represent the besieged and battered Tamils in Sri Lanka .
In fact , Colombo's propaganda machinery has become so effective that even non-violent representatives of Tamil grievances are dubbed Tiger proxies and thus terrorists .
A look at the fate of the Tigers has a script that fits almost every insurgency that has been recently crushed .
The struggle of Chechen people in the caucus is a perfect example .
They were able to militarily oust Russia from Chechnya in August 1996 but failed to end the war .
Soon they provided Moscow with a perfect alibi for military invasion when they incited a rebellion in neighbouring Dagestan .
Then , 9/11 changed the discourse for good .
The traditional strategy of armed struggles to seek support on the issue of human rights violations by the state and the fear of a humanitarian crisis no longer generates support in the West , especially the US , which was blamed for similar high - handedness in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The final lesson is about the support from neighbouring countries to armed struggles .
The Sri Lankan Tamils understood in the most brutal manner that no nation in the world supports a separatist struggle unless it has strategic vested interests .
It is no secret that Tigers were propped up by New Delhi to achieve a long term strategic goal inside the island nation .
Soon , however , the ambitions of the group and its leader Prabhakaran clashed with New Delhi 's interests , turning the Tigers against the very hands that fed it .
The disastrous consequences of this support are still resonating in Sri Lanka and India where its flames consumed a former prime minister .
The story is , in fact , repeating itself in Pakistan today where the army is battling Taliban along its western border .
States battling an insurgency within its borders also need to understand that military success alone cannot help bring peace .
Colombo has a golden opportunity today to reach out to its Tamil minority , devolve and provide constitutional guarantees to address their genuine grievances .
If that does not happen , it is only a matter of time before another Prabhakaran is born in the besieged north .

Apple has released updates for QuickTime and iTunes designed to plug multiple security vulnerabilities .
The updated version ( 7.6.2 ) of QuickTime , released on Monday , addresses security bugs that create a possible mechanism for hackers to pwn either Macs or Windows PCs after tricking users into opening booby - trapped movie or audio files .
The existence of one of these 10 QuickTime flaws partially disclosed with the publication of the Mac Hacker 's Handbook by Charlie Miller and Dino Dai Zovi , back in March .
At a talk during CanSec West , Miller said there was a flaw in the media playing software but withheld details beyond hinting at where the bug might be located .
Another Mac hacker , Damian Put , pined down the bug a month later and sold the details to 3Com ’s TippingPoint security tools division for an undisclosed sum that probably ran into thousands , MacWorld reports .
Apple credited both Miller and Put with identifying the bug in its advisory on the QuickTime update here .
Apple also released a fix for a stack buffer overflow bug affecting iTunes .
Users are advised to upgrade to iTunes 8.2 to guard against the solitary flaw which , left ignored , creates a possible means for hackers to inject hostile code onto vulnerable systems . ®
Rainn Wilson , Hollywood 's new favorite archetypal dweeb , has a small role in Michael Bay 's " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , " a very not - small movie which opens today .
Wilson , who catapulted to nerd - fame as Dwight on " The Office , " is a bright spot in an otherwise poorly received film , which will still make a mint this weekend .
We spoke to Wilson , who is vacationing with his family in Oregon this week , about preparing for the role , wearing leather pants and Michael Bay 's predilection for " hot extras . "
Wall Street Journal :...

He is basically talking to himself .
The words come out , the translator translates them into Arabic .
But then they just seem to linger , reverberating off the cell walls and ceiling , unacknowledged .
The room is just as the lawyer had imagined it would be .
An eight - by - ten steel - and - concrete shed , with a separate holding cell and bunk to the right .
He is sitting with his translator and the JAG lawyer detailed to the case at a small metal card table .
All of this is just as he had pictured in his mind .
It is the man shackled to the floor right in front of him he could n't come to terms with .
The briefing material estimates the man 's age at about thirty - five .
But he appears far older — the seven years he 's spent locked out of sight have aged him severely .
His slight black face is dull and cracked like an old road .
His long black beard is streaked with gray , his fingernails yellow , his upper teeth missing .
He 's managed to flip his sandals off to one side and lean back in his chair .
He is slouching , looking away .
The lawyer spent six months trying to get into this room .
He 'd written letter after letter to the prisoner .
He 'd come to Guantánamo twice before to see him , and on each visit he'd been turned away without explanation .
But today , the day before the arraignment , the prisoner has agreed to see him .
Yet he does not talk and keeps looking away .
The lawyer has an hour to make this work .
He can feel his heart beating faster and faster , and being nervous is not going to help .
So he makes himself slow down as he speaks .
" I'm a civilian attorney , " he says .
" I 'm here to help defend you if you will accept me .
I 'm not a military interrogator . "
His words come out deliberately , as if he 's chiseling them into stone .
The prisoner 's eyes drift away .
He looks down at the prayer schedule taped to the table , then up at the large clock on the wall , then back out to nothing .
Fifteen minutes pass like this .
The lawyer glances at the clock now as well .
What now ?
he thinks .
What now ?
In all his years with the firm , he 's never had a client just ignore him like this .
And if he does n't get through to the prisoner and quick , the prisoner will be left to face the commission alone .
And he will surely lose .
He takes a long look at the JAG lawyer to his right , then back at the prisoner , still leaning back in his chair .
With a deep breath he starts in on his last chance to connect with this man .
" I 'm married , " he says .
" My wife is waiting for me back in Arizona where we live .
We will be celebrating our fortieth wedding anniversary later this year . "
His words echo off the hard walls and steel .
He continues , " I have four grown children .
They do n't know what I 'm doing today , in this little room , on this little island , and I do n't know if they will fully understand why I 'm doing it .
But I miss them , " he says .
" I want to see them . "
The prisoner glances over , then back at the clock .
It 's absurd , the whole scene , the white - shoe corporate attorney sitting in a dank shed trying to explain esoteric legal concepts to an illiterate peasant .
None of this makes any sense .
He remembers the wedding not long ago in Phoenix , standing with his wife when a friend pulled him aside .
" The FBI called me , " his friend said .
" They were asking all sorts of questions about you .
Is everything okay , Howard ?
Are you all right ? "
The lawyer had laughed .
The same thing had happened with his neighbors a few weeks before .
The FBI had asked everyone in the neighborhood for tips or information on the lawyer 's habits , and the neighbors wondered if the lawyer was tied up with the Mafia .
" Yes , I 'm fine , " the lawyer said .
" It 's about a case I 'm working on .
I 'm trying to represent a prisoner at Guantánamo — "
" What ? "
His friend cut him off .
" Are you serious ? "
" I know , " the lawyer said , shaking his head .
He tried to explain ; he told his friend what he told anyone who asked : " Everybody deserves a lawyer .
Even suspected terrorists . "
It was the same thing he'd told his children for years when they asked him how he could defend some of his corporate clients , like large tobacco companies .
He looks at the prisoner and continues , " My father passed away from Alzheimer 's disease six years ago .
He grew up in Yonkers , near New York , during the Great Depression .
He never went to college , but he had street smarts .
And he was a fighter ; he'd get beaten up by the Irish kids in the neighborhood every day . "
Then he moves on to his mother .
He knows very little about the man before him .
But he knows that he must have family .
Maybe they can connect on family .
The prisoner has n't spoken to his own family in seven years .
He looks up , impassive , his demeanor unchanged by the lawyer 's life story .
He 's been chained to the floor , and still the lawyer talks .
And the lawyer talks , and talks .
A half hour more has passed .
The lawyer , unwilling or unable to accept his obvious failure , wo n't stop .
He always took pride in thinking of himself , like his autodidact father , as a fighting blue - collar boy .
He weighed little more than 150 pounds in high school , but he wanted to be a linebacker .
He knew it was stupid , his parents and coach thought it was stupid , but he kept at it and he made all - state .
It was the same in college .
He arrived thinking he would be a star ; instead he started out on the fourth team , but he worked his way up to the first team .
The same in law school .
He was written off as a jock .
And then in his career .
He was a working - class Jew from New Jersey .
He 'd come from nothing , but there was no way some entitled Ivy Leaguer was going to push him around .
He was confrontational , but that 's the way you 've got to be when you 're always pushing a rock uphill .
He 's now talking so fast that the translator has trouble keeping up .
" My grandchildren are turning three next month ...
My son lives in New York ...
My youngest daughter is a teacher in Phoenix . "
And then suddenly , he stops .
It 's been just over an hour .
He takes one more long look around the room , at the cell and the steel bunk and the steel toilet and the O-ring drilled into the floor attached to the man 's ankles .
He looks closely at the man in front of him , Noor Uthman Muhammed , prisoner 707 .
He is from Sudan and is accused of having been an instructor at the Khalden jihadi training camp in Afghanistan from the mid-1990s to 2000 .
According to his combatant - status review , he was a senior member of Al Qaeda , the " 70th Taliban commander , " and " was frequently left in charge of the Khalden camp because he was judged to be good with people and could handle all aspects of the camp . "
He was seized from what the government describes as a safe house owned by a senior Al Qaeda member in Faisalabad , Pakistan , in March 2002 .
He has been held here since , without a lawyer .
In the morning , January 14 , 2009 , he will be brought before a military commission in the courthouse at Guantánamo Bay and formally charged with training Al Qaeda militants in Afghanistan .
It is one of the last war - crimes commissions of the Bush era , a final attempt to advance the commission and the war - crimes process to the point where the new president cannot stop them .
My father takes one more long breath and leans forward in his chair .
Across what seems like an endless gulf between them , he asks the man to think about everything he has said , and he leaves .
We 're having dinner at a Japanese restaurant near my office in New York City when my father , Howard Cabot , tells me about his meeting with the prisoner .
We do these dinners every few months when he passes through town on business , on his way from one hearing or another .
" I did n't know what to do , " he says .
" He just kept looking away , so I just kept talking . "
My father is wearing the same oversized blue jeans he wears whenever he travels , and the same oversized blue Brooks Brothers dress shirt and oversized sweater .
" What do you mean ? " I say .
" You just kept talking about the family ? "
" I did n't know what else to do .
So I just kept going , " he says .
" But Tyler , you have to remember , it 's like talking to a wall . "
He 's sucking edamame out of the shell with one hand , digging through the bowl with the other while he replays the meeting .
He 's always been able to command a table with his stories , like the one about the time he punched out the umpire in high school , or showed up so drunk at my mother 's dorm room that she told him to get lost , or got thrown out of a football game for kneeing the Penn quarterback in the balls over and over again when he was already on the ground .
But those stories , like this one , seem unreal , as if they do n't belong to my father at all .
The father I know is careful and calibrated , always disciplined , always in control of his emotions .
He wears a suit every day .
He rarely drinks .
He gets his hair cut every three weeks , precisely .
He 's a corporate defense litigator , the cleaner brought in to protect corporations like DuPont , Dial , and Merrill Lynch in court .
The cases can be anything from copyright infringement to fraud to defending companies like Brown & Williamson , the makers of Kool cigarettes , in suits brought by the government .
When I was growing up , he'd be gone for days at a time , and if he was trying a case , weeks .
New York , Palo Alto , Chicago , Hartford .
The closest I ever got to my father 's work was when I was eleven , during a case he tried in Maui for a company called United Technologies .
The company was defending against a claim it designed faulty sewer pipes , all of which seemed to fail at basically the same time .
Simple case , big news , and lots of angry people with no doubt who the villains were and what the outcome should be .
The kind of case my father was born to defend .
For months , he commuted , flights from Phoenix to Maui on Sunday night , back again on Friday .
That summer we all flew out to Hawaii to be with him .
I remember him going over documents and briefs late at night .
I remember him swapping his Rolex for his running watch , because he did n't want to come off as too slick for the jury .
I saw him in court once .
There was some city official sitting in the witness box .
The courtroom was full and hot .
But my father looked impervious , as if he were watching the scene from above , seeing every move before it happened .
He began by asking a seemingly innocuous question .
It was probably about pipe fittings or lubricant .
Then , " Do you remember how the foundation was prepared that day ? "
" I 'm not sure , " the guy responded .
He could n't recall , and he did n't know what to say .
My father turned to the jury , then back to the man .
He waited a perfect beat .
And then with practiced mock disbelief , he said , " I do n't understand .
Were you not there ?
Was n't that your job ?
I mean , was there someone else doing your job ? "
The guy was a stammering mess .
" Uh , no , uh , uh ... "
That 's how I think of my father as a lawyer — drilling , drilling , drilling , the poor man stunned to find that he 's been emasculated .
Only once did I ask him about the clients that I came to believe were morally suspect .
I was in high school and we were sitting at the kitchen table in our old house .
My dad was telling my mother about his defense of an asbestos company .
" Dad , has n't it been proved that asbestos causes cancer ? " I asked .
" I mean , how can you take on a case like that ? "
I was a punk .
My father is usually very even - keeled , calm and unbreakable , but if you catch him at a bad moment , he 'll immediately shift into what my three older sisters and I recognize as " lawyer mode , " like he was that day in Maui .
With my impertinence , he was no longer Dad ; he was Howard Cabot , indefatigable advocate for the asbestos industry .
" There is n't one iota of evidence that asbestos alone causes cancer , " he shot back , the vein on his temple bulging .
" All the studies show that there could be numerous factors .
And now we have thousands of people claiming that their cancer had to have been caused by asbestos .
They want to tear down every building in America . "
He was pissed off and very irritated at me .
He had made a good living , an excellent living , and built a life of such comfort for me and my sisters that I now had the luxury to sit in judgment of his chosen field .
But I just could n't understand how he could do that work .
Yeah , everybody deserved a lawyer , but did it have to be my dad ?
There was no good way to bridge this divide .
I decided that some arguments were better avoided .
It was the same with his staunch support for Israel .
When he was n't working or at one of our soccer games , my father was at a meeting for the Jewish Federation or some other Jewish community function .
A few years ago , along with my mother , he was awarded a Jewish National Fund " Tree of Life Award " for lifetime dedication to Israeli causes .
He gave thousands of dollars a year to these groups and helped raise hundreds of thousands more .
" The Jews can not lose their homeland , " he 'd say .
" We need to protect it at all costs . "
" But , Dad , ca n't you see … "
" Look , Tyler , " he 'd say .
" People in that part of the world just do n't understand the West .
They see weakness in compromise .
You have to stand up to them .
Never give an inch . "
It was the same with the invasion of Iraq after 9/11 .
" You have to draw a line in the sand and you have to hold firm , " he 'd tell me .
" We ca n't just let these people push us around . "
I came home a few months into the war and he gave me a book , William Bennett 's Why We Fight .
He agreed with Bennett , he told me .
He wanted me to understand where he was coming from .
Instead of engaging him , I made a crack about Bennett 's compulsive gambling , stuck the book on a shelf , and never picked it up again .
That 's the way my father and I argue .
We make a quick dig —
" He 's your president , " I 'd always remind him when bad news came out of Iraq — then laugh it off and move on .
But it's his stark binary worldview , which he tried with varying degrees of failure to impart to his children , that makes the prospect of my father defending an Al Qaeda figure with the same vigor as he would a pillar of American capitalism almost impossible for me to understand .
And so as the sushi plates are cleared and he 's finishing his story , I am stunned to speechlessness .
" So I told him to think about what I said , and I left . "
His voice is full , and he 's proud of himself , and he 's studying my face for a reaction .
He wants me to be proud of him as well .
I 'm looking straight into his eyes , and I hear his words , but more than anything , I just want to know what this man has done with my father .
This story is just like all the other ones he tells from his days in college , before he was so spit - and - polished , and it 's just as unbelievable .
The father I know would never take out a quarterback when he was down , and the father I know would never represent a Muslim terrorist .
Randall Damm / U.S. Navy
" Tell him I say hello , " my father says to his interpreter .
He waits , not knowing if the prisoner will talk to him today .
" Hello , " the man says .
My father exhales .
Okay , let 's get going .
This arraignment 's in an hour , and we have an impossible list of things to go through .
Of course , now if the prisoner says something that blows up his defense , it will be my father 's fault .
He has thirty minutes , maybe less , to explain the intricacies of military commissions to a man who for the last seven years has been chained in a box on an island , cannot read or write , and does n't trust anyone .
My father pulls out the script on the hearing that was prepared by the court , with detailed highlights and annotations he made the night before .
He drags his chair forward , bends his head toward the prisoner .
" The first thing that will happen is the introduction of the lawyers , " he says .
He 's looking directly at him , focusing on the prisoner 's eyes , as the translator translates .
The prisoner nods .
But who will represent this man ?
Just because the prisoner now recognizes that my father exists does n't mean that he really wants anything to do with him .
You can't force another man to trust you .
He 's got to come to that on his own .
" So when you 're asked by the judge , " I can see my father saying , " say something like this : ' Your Honor , I am not ready to make a decision on my lawyer at this time . ' "
Next , most important , comes the plea .
My father spent hours the night before trying to figure out how to explain this .
He read the prisoner 's combatant - status review from October 2004 .
" I did not see bin Laden , nor did I meet him , " the prisoner told the review board at the time .
" As I previously told you , I have no knowledge of Al Qaeda , and I do n't know anybody from there .
But if you want to say that I'm Muslim and want to make believe I belong to Al Qaeda , then that is something different . "
It will be the same today .
The prisoner will want to deny the charges against him .
And why not ?
But he can't .
It 's one of the peculiarities of the commission system .
If he pleads not guilty , if he accedes to cooperate with the system arrayed against him in any way , he 'll be tacitly accepting the validity of the charges .
He 'll be recognizing the authority of the United States of America to continue to imprison him .
And he 'll forfeit the right to challenge not only the specific charges against him but the validity of the entire proceedings .
But how can I explain so he 'll understand ?
How do I explain that refusing to enter a plea does n't mean that he 's admitting he 's guilty ?
This is the moment of truth for a lawyer :
You , Howard Cabot , have a man 's life in your hands .
Are you up to it ?
Early in his career , my father did a fair amount of criminal and civil - rights work .
He represented conscientious objectors .
He worked for tenants ' rights in Camden , New Jersey .
He had clients who paid him in crops .
" You may remember Mom and I talking about a man named Sy Traister , " he would tell me .
" One of the first criminal trials I ever had .
Went for five weeks .
A mail - fraud case .
The guy was acquitted on all charges .
It was a wonderful experience , got me into upholding people 's rights , but it was extremely stressful to me because I was n't just dealing with moving money from one side of the table over to the other side .
I was dealing with people 's liberty and their life .
And sometimes it was a very ugly environment .
I guess it was primarily the weight of having someone put their life in your hands … and that I might exercise my judgment … mistakenly .
So as my career progressed , I did less and less criminal work .
You guys were getting older .
It was n't lucrative .
The real money work was work I did n't want to do .
I did n't want to do drug cases .
What can I tell you ? "
It was a phone call , he told me .
The Center for Constitutional Rights had gotten his name from one of his partners and asked if my father would consider filing court petitions of habeas corpus on behalf of prisoners being held .
He knew the CCR 's reputation for liberal activism , and he did n't want any part of that .
But as the president he supported prosecuted the war on terror that he also supported , something tectonic shifted in my father .
American justice is based on first principles , he said .
And among these is that we treat prisoners — people in a position of powerlessness — humanely .
And that they can question their imprisonment .
And that we do n't presume guilt .
As an American , the pictures from Abu Ghraib made my father ill .
As a lawyer , they made him ashamed .
He told the CCR he'd do it .
And that 's how he got to be here in this room , with this prisoner .
I never knew my father as an idealist , as someone given to rhapsodizing about the supremacy of the law , but I also never knew him as anything but indomitable and fearless .
Now the prisoner is sitting quietly , locked to the ground , waiting , and my father is unsure .
He continues , leaning in close , maybe as deliberate as he 's ever been .
" What did you say ? " I ask .
" Did he understand ? "
" I can't tell you that , Tyler , " he says .
What passes between a lawyer and his client is a covenant , a secular sacrament , known only to them .
But I can see my father saying , " At arraignment , you are asked whether you are going to enter a plea of innocent or guilty .
But you do n't have to enter a plea .
In fact , it 's important that you do n't enter a plea .
We need to challenge the validity of the order that created these charges .
If you enter a plea , you 'll waive our ability to do that . "
And I can see the prisoner looking at the translator , wondering if he 's heard correctly .
" But I 'm not guilty , " the prisoner says .
" Why can't I just say that ? "
My father is not known for his patience .
He collects his thoughts .
Tries to think about how to explain this .
" It 's a matter of acknowledging the validity — "
No , simpler , simpler .
" Mr. Uthman , " he starts again .
" I know you want to plead not guilty , and you can later . "
His words come out slowly , as he labors to explain the concept .
" But if you do it now , you 'll also be saying that the commission has the right to charge you .
That them holding you here and charging you is legal in the first place .
I want to argue that it is not .
But I can't if you plead not guilty . "
I can see the prisoner leaning forward now , then back .
He hears my father , but he does n't know what to do .
He does n't know if he can trust him .
" Do you understand , Mr. Uthman ? " my father asks .
" But I 'm not guilty . "
" Mr. Uthman , I know it 's hard to understand .
But it 's really important , and I need you to trust me . "
The man looks back at him .
He looks lost .
My father starts again from the beginning .

" I do wonder why none of you ever wanted to be lawyers , " my father says .
His voice is soft , his words carefully considered .
He and I are taking a drive through the California desert .
We both like to drive , and I thought it might be easier to talk about these things in a moving car .
He 's been telling me about some of the cases he is proudest of , the cases that made his life as a lawyer worth living , like the penniless salesmen and merchants he helped as a public defender before I was born , and the Vietnam vet he took on when I was in high school .
The man had been forced to confess to a murder he did n't commit , and my father sued the state to free him .
But my father is at a loss as to why none of us wanted to follow his example .
" And I wonder if it was because of me .
And talking to you now , I guess I do n't know how you guys perceive me .
I mean , what did you think I was doing for all these years and all the hours I was away ? "
This is hard .
I 'm struggling now , grasping for my thoughts .
Even if it was for the good of our family , how could he spend thirty years representing some companies that made people sick ?
He went from defending people like himself — working - class people who started with nothing , people like my grandfather , who fought his way out of the tenements of Yonkers — to siding with morally questionable corporate behemoths .
" I always appreciated that your representing these big corporate clients paid for college and all those things , " I say .
" And I appreciate that everyone should have a lawyer .
But I never really understood how you came to terms with doing that kind of stuff . "
He stops me here .
" Let me help you . "
Lawyer mode .
Now his voice does n't waver : " You view me as doing some of the profitable corporate work to facilitate some of the things we did at home — taking trips , living in a nice house .
But in my world , what the profitable work allowed me to do is the very work we are talking about now — Guantánamo .
" I 've always viewed my ability to take on pro bono cases as one of the rewards of doing some of the work that may not be as interesting to you .
It finances these kinds of cases .
And maybe that 's how I lived with it .
But I also knew one thing :
With four children , I could n't be a public servant the whole time .
I just could n't do it .
" I 'm still wondering , Tyler .
What did you think I did when I left in the morning , came home , or sometimes did n't come home for days at a time ? "
He is wrung out and almost yelling .
" What were you thinking about it ? "
" I did n't know , " I tell him , my voice raised now as well .
" I knew you smoked your pipe late at night and looked at documents .
I knew you only tried cases every couple of years . "
I stop for a moment .
" Remember when you asked me about going to law school ?
Do you remember that ? "
" No . I mean , I try not to pressure you guys . "
" It was about a year after I graduated , and I had been looking for a job for six months .
You said , ' What are you going to do ? '
And I said , ' I 'm not sure . '
And you said , ' Why do n't you be not sure while you get a law degree ? ' "
I remember hanging up the phone in my old Washington , D. C. , apartment pissed off .
When I graduated college , my father told me I was too old for him to tell me what to do .
Instead , I should see him as a reference , like a dictionary or encyclopedia I could pull off the shelf if I needed advice .
This advice was as unwelcome as it was bad .
Becoming a lawyer was the last thing I wanted to do .
" I have so many doctor friends whose kids became doctors , " he says .
" And so many lawyer friends whose kids became lawyers , you know what I mean ?
Well , let 's stop .
The question is whether any of the cases we just talked about — the cases that have made me proud to do what I do — if you had known about those , would it have changed things ? "
The car is silent save for the rhythm of tires on pavement .
We 're heading north toward Los Angeles , and even though the road is jammed , we may as well be alone .
" Talking to you now , " he says quietly , " I have a feeling that I failed .
I never brought home all the wonderful things you can do as a lawyer . "
They do n't know his name .
Nobody knows his name .
He walks slowly , small stuttered steps , the shackles rubbing his ankles raw .
The eyes in the courtroom stare .
Military police , lawyers , officers , journalists .
He looks back out at them , then he sits at the defense table .
It is his first time in a courtroom in his seven years here , probably the first time in his entire life .
He sits down , and a guard proceeds to secure him .
Then the military judge asks his name .
Until now , the government has known him only as detainee 707 .
It believes his name is Noor Uthman Muhammed , or some combination of those words .
But he 's also been listed in documents as Zamir Muhammed , Akrama al Sudani , Abu al Hareth , Farouq al Kamari .
" How would you like to be addressed ? " the military judge asks .
" What is your name ? "
My father is sitting a few feet away from the prisoner at the defense table .
He 's staring at the prisoner , waiting for an answer .
The question is simple , but the prisoner wo n't speak .
" I do n't understand , " the prisoner says at last .
The translator turns to my father .
" Explain it again , " my father says .
" Tell him the judge wants to know what to call him . "
The translator turns to the prisoner , retranslates the question .
" Noor , " the prisoner says at last .
" Noor ? " the judge responds .
" Just Noor ? "
" Yes , " he says meekly .
" Noor . "
My father looks straight ahead , trying to hide his concern .
The hearing continues .
" Trial counsel , please state by whom you have been detailed and your qualifications , " says the military judge .
The prisoner sits quietly .
His eyes roam the room , looking at the judge and the media in the gallery , all sights he 's never seen before .
Then he looks down at the table , as if at the moment the sights and sounds are too much , as if he wants to go back to his cell .
" I have been detailed to this military commission by the chief defense counsel , " says my father 's cocounsel , sitting next to Noor in her dress blues .
She has never spoken directly to the prisoner .
She knows that he is very religious and does n't want to make him uncomfortable .
But she has her orders and has to be here , regardless of the prisoner 's wishes .
" I am qualified under R.M.C. 503 , and I have previously been sworn in accordance with R.M.C. 807 , " she continues , referring to the military commission rules for counsel .
" Thank you , " says the military judge .
And now it 's my father 's turn .
" My name is Howard Cabot , " he says .
" I am from the law firm of Perkins Coie and am licensed to practice law in the state of Arizona . "
" Noor , do you accept Mr. Cabot as your attorney ? " the military judge asks .
The prisoner raises his eyes but does not say anything .
He knows enough from what the lawyer told him to know that in the strange Kabuki theater of American justice , there is a wrong answer to this question .
As my father rises and pushes his chair back , the MPs behind him break their fixed expressions .
They do n't try to get in his way but rather sit back in astonishment at this break in protocol .
My father , in his navy suit , is next to the prisoner now .
He is kneeling on the ground next to him .
His eyes inches away from the prisoner 's eyes , his hand resting on the prisoner 's knee .
" Mr. Uthman , " I can see him saying , " this was n't supposed to happen .
You should n't have to decide that right now .
But now we need to figure out what to do . "
The translator has his hand over the mic now , as if he 's blocking for my father .
And there my father is , the same tough bastard he was back on the football field : Small for his position , but he 'll make you pay for underestimating him .
He huddles with his client , a man with no rights , keeping one eye on the judge from the most powerful country ever conceived , hoping she does n't crush him and his client for this impertinent violation of the rules .
My father gave his adult life to defend companies .
It took him a long time , nearly a lifetime to get here .
But he 's here now , on his knee .
" It felt like an hour , but it was probably only five or ten minutes , " he says now .
" There was no pause .
I was not worried about cadence .
And he 's interacting back and forth with me .
I mean , there is music being made here .
I kept looking at the MPs next to me — young faces , eighteen or nineteen .
They were white - faced . "
My father takes his hand off the prisoner 's knee .
He stands up and walks back to his chair .
" Your Honor , I think he has something to say to you , " my father says .
" Noor , do you accept Mr. Cabot as your attorney ? " the judge asks again .
Noor does not hesitate this time .
" Yes , I will accept Mr. Cabot as my attorney , " he says .
" And if there is a Sudanese attorney , I want him as well . "
There are inflection points in the life of a man , or in the life of a country .
That is , there are points beyond which things will never be the same .
Once you 've taken responsibility for someone 's life and freedom in a challenge to the authority of your own government , torts and contracts and product liability might lose a bit of their urgency .
Once a man has changed , it can be hard to reconcile his old self with the new .
Once a country has changed , it can be unrecognizable to those who thought they knew it best .
Guantánamo has changed Howard Cabot .
And it 's changed the way I see my father .
As we make our way back to Phoenix on the I - 10 , I am trying hard to reorient myself with him .
" Has this changed your worldview ? " I ask .
" It 's hard for me to say yes on this because of Israel , " he says .
" Because of the history there .
So many disappointments , so many times .
But I guess I am coming out of this experience more willing to at least find a point for dialogue than I have before .
But it 's not just from what happened to me at Guantánamo .
It 's all the reading I 've done .
It 's the Lebanon war .
The Gaza war .
All these things are making me think that the foreign policy we 've had has n't been productive in terms of the American image .
" But it 's like life in general for me , Tyler , " my father says .
" You 've seen me all these years .
And I do n't know if you 've seen any changes in me .
But yes , I am a different person today in terms of my values , in terms of my patience , in terms of my tolerance than I was ten years ago .
This experience is just another experience that has supported my transformation . "
Before the hearing ends , before my father says goodbye to the prisoner and begins planning for his trial and looking for a Sudanese attorney to join the defense team , there is one more huddle .
It 's time for Noor to enter a plea .
" Your Honor , " my father says , " my client would like to postpone any plea . "
It 's clear from the expression on Noor 's face that he does n't like this at all .
He looks around the room at the MPs and the journalists and observers in the gallery , and he starts talking angrily to the translator .
My father asks the judge for a moment , and once again drops to a knee beside the prisoner .
This time the conversation does n't go well .
This time the prisoner is insistent .
He can not put off his plea , not in front of all these people .
They 'll think he 's guilty .
There was a time when I would have known how this story was going to end .
My father would have insisted , and he would have drilled , drilled , drilled until he had gotten his way .
Instead , he crouches in closer .
My father is frustrated , but he listens to Noor now , closer and more patiently than he ever has before .
Finally , my father returns to the table and asks the judge if Noor might make a statement .
The judge allows it .
Noor rises , and his voice is defiant .
" I want to say only that I am not guilty , " he says , leveling his gaze at everyone in the room .
" That 's all . "
My father looks over at him and smiles .
Then he leaves the courtroom and packs for his flight home from the island he never supposed he would be on .
*****
The case of prisoner 707 has been held in abeyance , as have all Guantánamo cases , subject to a review ordered by the White House .
My father 's work on the case continues .

Need another reason to spend time on Facebook ?
Or , just getting tired of Mafia Wars , Kidnap ! , or even Willy ’s Sweet Shop ?
Today , Timberland and changents officially launch yet another excuse for playing on FB rather than getting your work done : Earthkeepers Hero : Mission Possible .
I ’ve played around with the app for a couple of days now , and , yes , I see how it could get addictive .
Playing off the spy thriller motif , you ’re presented with “ missions ” that revolve around an action / activism scenario , and give you a green trivia question to answer .
There ’s a definite social media aspect to it : you can recruit “ backers ” from your Facebook friends ( which you ’ll need for higher - level missions ) , and even get clues from real Timberland Earthkeeper Heroes such as Christopher Swain , Cate Trotter , Sami Nerenberg , and Nate Bastien .
[ social_buttons ]
The game is fun , visually appealing ( not always a strong suit with FB apps ) , and provides some great food for thought on real - world actions you could take to lighten your own footprint , and spread the word .
Try it out … and feel free to add me as a backer …
The person who makes decisions quicker and more resolutely flies ahead of the person who is slow and weak in their ways .
Notice that I did n’t point out that the first person was always making the “ right ” decisions .
That point is irrelevant in the longer - term .
Using simple probabilities , the person that makes more decisions in the face of pressure from others will have more options on the table , and having more options is always more advantageous than having less options .
This is true because the person with more options has just as many as the one with the lesser amount , with the advantages that come with them , and also has others that can only add more in terms of value .
Preparation Is A Component Leading To Boldness
Now that this is shown to be the case , how can you become the person who makes decisions quickly and resolutely ?
The idea here is to see what slows you down , or stops you instantly , when decision - making time comes around .
When you go to a store to buy apples , and then see the apples at the store , the decision to pick them up is nearly instant .
On the other hand , if you see oranges you did n’t plan on buying , your decision of whether to buy them or not will be slower .
The difference between the apples and oranges here is the preparation you made before going to the store in planning for what you would want to buy .
Preparation is a key factor in maintaining a bold persona .
Lack of preparation , even if it would n’t actually affect your performance , weakens your decision - making ability because your mind assumes that you are missing something you would have gotten by preparing like an organized individual .
Do n’t Let Others Expectations Weigh You Down
A huge part of becoming a bold decision - maker is understanding how to view others and their perceived expectations of you .
If you are worried you are going to let certain people down by doing this or that , you already have a weight on your shoulders slowing down your decisions .
You ca n’t make decisions boldly if you have to keep processing whether they will make person A or person B happy .
Every second of delay when making a decision is a second you will be disappointed for losing later on .
Others Will Come And Go , But You Will Remain
This means that you have to make the choice to not let others affect your decision - making .
The only guarantee you have is that you will still be communicating with yourself a few years later , which is more than can be said for the chances that you will be dealing with certain people who are currently in your life a few years down the road .
You have to think about your future self , and he / she would want you to do more for yourself ( which then passes on to others as well ) .
Also , we often do things that we think pleases others , when in fact they look at us as weak for spending our time worrying about how we would be perceived .
Check To See If Others Are Really Helping You
One thing that is a definite deterrent to a bold mindset is the assumption that certain people that have helped you slightly have your best interests in mind .
Government welfare is one of the best ways to reduce a person ’s motivation to work , and in the same way , you may be currently chained to a person that you think is helping you , but that is blocking your bold decision - making anytime something of value is up for grabs .
This is not helpful , and is keeping you from a state of progress .
Anyone who would actually want you to live propitiously would challenge you so that you would improve , and would support your own risk - taking and venture - making .
If you have a person like this in your life , spending more time with them will help you maintain a bold mindset .
Being around bold people will make you feel more foolish when you are not bold yourself , so you will adjust to an increased level of hardiness more quickly .
Take Note Of Your Own Weakening Factors
Although I would assume these to be the main issues keeping people from becoming definitive decision - makers , here is how you could find out what the other factors are that you should change to help the cause .
The next few times you are making a decision , and become slowed down or cancel on making the decision , process what it is that slowed you down .
It will probably be the case that the same concept or concepts come up repeatedly , and these should be the target of your energy and vitality ; that same energy is not beneficial to use to attack yourself for procrastinating or backing down .
If you are not harsher ( AKA more direct ) with other people now , you will end up being even more vindictive toward them and yourself later on .
The sooner you are resolute and definitive in your decision - making , the sooner you can build up a strong foundation that protects the integrity of your goals .

The Celtics ' home - court advantage has produced an overtime loss and last night 's last - gasp , 118 - 115 victory over the Chicago Bulls .
That would not seem to be an encouraging sign for Games 3 ( Thursday ) and 4 ( Sunday ) in Chicago .
Or , maybe it is , according to captain Paul Pierce .
" I think we feel very confident , " Pierce said .
" We feel like we have n't played good basketball yet .
I feel like this is pretty much our ' C ' game .
We 've given up 100 points two games in a row , allowed people to shoot 49 , 50 percent .
I think our best is yet to come in this series . "
But it is clear the Celtics ' playoff run is either going to be shorter or rockier than last season , judging by the loss of Leon Powe ( left knee ) and the fact that they had to make a dramatic rally from a 5 - point deficit to pull this one out .
The Celtics were on top of their game at the start , Rajon Rondo jetting his way to a triple - double by early in the third quar ter .
And they closed things out with some excellent execution , Ray Allen breaking out of a shooting slump to score 28 points in the second half , including the deciding 3 - pointer with two seconds remaining .
Until that Allen launch over Joakim Noah , though , the Bulls had matched the Celtics step for step and basket for basket for 95 minutes , 58 seconds .
Ben Gordon scored 42 points although the Bulls did not counter the Celtics ' rebounding intensity ; Boston had a 50 - 36 rebounding edge , scoring 32 points off 21 offensive boards .
The win boosted the spirits of the Celtics , who Thursday morning had absorbed the news that Kevin Garnett ( right knee ) would be out for the playoffs and that president of basketball operations Danny Ainge had sustained a mild heart attack .
That was followed two days later by an upset loss in the playoff opener .
Ainge attended yesterday morning 's shootaround and Garnett joined his teammates on the bench for the entire contest .
But after taking a 12 - point first - quarter lead , the Celtics lost Powe to injury and faced a scare as Rondo went down with a sprained ankle .
" I pray that Danny Ainge did n't watch this game , " coach Doc Rivers said .
" What a great shot by Ray .
We really needed somebody .
" At halftime , you 've got Rondo landing in the training room and Leon injured and guys in foul trouble .
And , you know , basically , at halftime all I said was , I needed a volunteer .
And it was Ray Allen . "
Savior was more like it .
Rondo ( 19 points , 12 rebounds , 16 assists ) healed and outdueled Derrick Rose .
Glen Davis , who played a total of 137 minutes in last year 's playoffs , followed an 18 - point Game 1 with 26 points and 9 rebounds .
Both Kendrick Perkins and Rondo grabbed seven offensive rebounds .
But Pierce had another off night , with 18 points on 19 field goal attempts .
And the Celtic bench produced 9 points .
The outcome was in doubt , and the fact that the Celtics have had to go to the wire at home raises questions about their ability to repeat as NBA champions .
After the Bulls took a 109 - 104 lead , the Celtics closed with a 14 - 6 run , capped by a three by Allen , who had been held to 4 points in Game 1 and was 2 for 16 from the field in the opening six quarters of the series .
The Celtics had taken a 104 -101 lead on Pierce 's second - chancer with 4:35 remaining .
But Rose scored on a follow , then Gordon hit two threes after the Bulls blocked Pierce shots , the Celtics calling timeout with a 5 - point deficit with 3:11 left .
The Celtics failed to score on their next possession , but they capitalized on a Gordon misfire with a Davis layup , igniting an 8 - 2 run .
Rondo converted off a steal to cut the deficit to 109- 108 with 1:54 remaining .
Gordon scored out of a timeout , but Davis hit two foul shots and Rondo hit a jumper over Noah with :02 on the shot clock for a 112 - 111 edge with 1:01 remaining .
Gordon restored the Bulls lead , then Allen converted a second - chance three after Rondo controlled a tipped offensive rebound for a 115 - 113 lead with 25.3 seconds to go .
Gordon 's jumper out of a 20 - second timeout tied it , and the Celtics called timeout with 12.3 remaining .
Allen then fired an off - balance shot off a double pick , Noah stepping out and nearly blocking the attempt .
" I actually thought Ray was going to be wide open , " Rivers said .
" And when he got it , Noah came out of nowhere - that was a hell of a recovery by him . "
And quite a recovery by the Celtics .

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
Two sides .
One is light .
One is dark .
Blah , blah , blah .
I 'm sure we have all read into this metaphor ad nauseum by now , but it seems to be the defining theme of the show - conflicting opposites .
By now we can assume this is a metaphor for Jacob and the temporarily named Esau AKA The Man in Black .
Jacob wears white and appears to be inherently good , while Esau wears black and appears to be inherently bad .
These colours are symbols of good and evil , whilst also representing yin and yang - a metaphor for their polar opposition as well as their co-existence , and even possibly their co-dependency .
But it is not just simple metaphor that I want to discuss .
It is an altogether much more elaborate and larger theory in retrospect of the last five seasons .
We are talking games here .
A game of chess will suffice to begin with .
Two players .
Two sets of pieces on a board .
One is white .
One is black .
The first player makes a move to further their postion on the board whilst enticing their opponent into making a strategic mistake .
The second player makes a move to counteract his opponent ’s first move whilst thinking five to eight moves down the line .
The idea is ;
How will one single move lead to an eventual and inevitable checkmate ?
In the game of chess you could argue that to be good at the game you need to be a good con man .
To lull your opponent into thinking a move they made with one of their pieces was their idea to move it in the first place .
But as Sawyer once said , “ It ’s not their idea , it ’s your idea . ”
Making them believe that was their own choice is the con .
And that is what Esau does so well ; manipulating , deceiving and conning , where as Jacob tries to play more fairly by treating his chessboard pieces with more than just a mind for using them to make tactical moves .
He wants them to make moves on their own , out of their own choice .
Our Losties and indeed the entire Lost ensemble are these pieces .
What Jacob ’s endgame consists of is not entirely certain , but Esau seems to be lusting after power and control over the island .
His endgame seems to be one that does not involve happy endings .
For him , all of his chessboard pieces are pawns to get him where he wants to be in the game ; the last piece standing on the board .
Many people have established that Jacob and Esau , whatever they really may be , are extreme opposites , but peers .
Neither can kill the other .
There are rules to this game , which they seem to be playing and have been engaged in doing so for a very long time .
Now I am going to get into the meat of my theory .
So far , after five very good seasons of storytelling we have discovered that there are TWO main power sources on this island , seemingly made up of “ unique ” properties .
One source of great power is located beneath The Swan , or The Hatch as it is commonly referred to .
The second great power is located beneath The Orchid , behind the frozen wheel .
Both sources of power are located deep beneath the island .
Both powers are electromagnetic in origin , yet both have very different functions and purposes .
Here we go .
Jacob ’s origin as an entity , or his source of power , is from the electromagnetic energy beneath The Swan .
It is more powerful than The Orchid , according to Daniel Faraday anyway .
It draws things to the island such as Oceanic 815 and perhaps even The Black Rock .
It wants people to come to the island .
Esau claims Jacob brought The Black Rock to the island and in a sense he did .
Through the electromagnetic forces he is apart of beneath the surface of The Swan .
The energy , or rather Jacob ’s energy , under The Swan is powerful , unstable even , but ultimately used for good .
The Orchid is where Esau ’s power or indeed Esau himself resides in some form .
If you believe that he is the smoke monster then that explains why the smoke seeps out from a vent in the ground deep beneath the temple .
The power of the Orchid / the wheel is used to keep people AWAY from the island .
It moves the island in space and time to keep the corruption of mankind off its shores .
This fits in with Esau ’s philosophy .
He does not want man to come there .
To him the island is obviously above the worth of human beings and that people as a species are undeserving of it .
The Swan and The Orchid are opposite forces with extremely different intentions just like Jacob and Esau , but both are apart of the same energy .
The same matter .
Neither can destroy or negate the other .
Getting back to the chessboard ; Esau said he needed a loophole in order to kill Jacob , and we assume he found it in John Locke , but really he found it in Ben Linus .
Locke was apart of the con , but he was n’t the primary manipulation .
Ben was .
Ben ’s cancer was not a freak .
It was not given to him by Jacob .
Esau was the one to give Ben cancer so that it would plant the seed of doubt in his faith in Jacob , and because he was thinking six to eight moves ahead of game ; to give Ben a reason to kill Jacob further down the line .
But just like a good opponent Jacob counteracted Esau ’s move by bringing Jack Shepherd the spinal surgeon to the island that ultimately saved Ben ’s life .
He counteracted Esau ’s move , whilst also thinking six to eight moves ahead in terms of Jack ’s function and destiny on the island .
To cure Ben 's cancer was not Jack ’s only purpose of course , but a pattern emerges throughout the show when watched back that all of the more unexplainable island events could be explained by the power struggle between Jacob and Esau , and their struggle for influence over the Losties .
One makes a move , the other makes a move to counteract .
It ’s a game , but with real people as the chess pieces .
Locke is an interesting character to look at now .
Just like any other character he had freedom of choice because that is how Jacob wanted it .
I no longer subscribe to the idea that Locke was conned from the moment he set foot on the island ( pardon the pun ) .
Perhaps it was not Esau ’s power that healed Locke ’s paralysis .
Maybe that was really Jacob .
But Esau found a way to manipulate Jacob ’s chosen pieces .
So he took away Locke ’s feeling in his legs in Deus Ex Machina ( the episode that I believe holds the key to the series ) to get a particular outcome .
Was that outcome Boone ’s death ?
As Locke said himself , Boone 's death set off a chain of events that led them to blow open the hatch , so perhaps that was Esau 's desired consequence from the dream he gave Locke .
However , we must also remember that if it were not for these events then Locke would never have been at the hatch door pounding on it and that in turn would not restore Desmond ’s faith that the outside world still existed .
Without Locke up there to inadvertently get Desmond ’s attention , the world may very well have ended there and then .
The energy beneath the Swan is apart of Jacob , and maybe he drew Locke back to the hatch that night to prevent this .
His counteracting move against Esau who gave Locke the dream of the plane in the first place .
As a side note ; if Esau and the smoke monster are one and the same then I believe people get the dreams or visions on the island through the smoke monster actually being present over them while they dream .
I think the smoke particles actually enter through the mouth or nose when a character is asleep and give the dreams directly in this way .
Could this be one of the final smoke monster reveals ?
Notice how most of the dreams are not actually dreams , but nightmares .
Claire and Locke ’s dreams are disturbing for both of them .
Sounds like Esau ’s work to me .
And speaking of dreams , who was giving Charlie 's dreams in Fire +
Water about Aaron being in danger .
Jacob or Esau ?
And what was the significance of Aaron needing to be baptised ?
Will we ever know the answer to this ?
Possibly not .
Locke represents the idea of fate vs. freewill .
He may have been a pawn , or a piece on a chessboard , but in the end he could have been a pawn for either side .
Light or dark .
Unfortunately , the moment he set foot in the cabin for the first time and heard the words “ Help Me , ” and believed them to be the words of Jacob , he began to be directly led astray by Esau , whose long con was also a very long shot that seems to have paid off .
Yes , Esau may have manipulated Locke from very early on , before this event , but he asked John to help him .
Even Ben believed this is where Jacob resided .
Somehow Esau had convinced Ben that the cabin was still occupied by Jacob , which in turn convinced Locke .
A long con .
Why would a dead man a la Christian Shepherd need to “ speak on Jacob ’s behalf ” ????
I always found that strange and suspected " Christian " to have villainous motives .
There is a theory going around that there are two Christian’s .
Good and Bad .
One is possessed by Jacob and the other is possessed by Esau .
I doubt this is the case .
Christian is and always has been Esau .
Always .
Think of it this way –
Esau possess the dead .
Whether he is the monster or not , it does n’t matter .
Esau is the one making dead men tell tales .
And they are always leading people to their deaths or judgement in some way .
Even the on-island apparitions .
First he was Christian , then he was Yemi ( manipulating Eko to put Locke back on the path he needed him on ) .
All the people who have died on the island , when seen , are most likely Esau using their actual bodies to meet his own ends .
Leading Jack ( the leader ) to the cliff edge and almost to his death in White Rabbit , manifesting as Dave ( Hurley ’s imaginary friend ) to try to lead him to his death , perhaps even Walt ’s appearance to Shannon was Esau leading her to her death .
Yemi spoke the words to Eko “ You speak to me as if I were your brother , ” almost with contempt for Eko .
And Eko ’s response ?
“ Who are YOU ? ”
The very same response that became Michael ’s last words on the freighter – “ Who are you ? ” to Christian .
Both of their deaths mirror the suspicion that they were both used .
Michael in particular served a purpose and as soon as he was done , BOOM , he died .
Whether he had a death wish is besides the point , the point is if Christian is always Esau then Michael died meeting Esau 's ends .
So how does Jacob counteract / match Esau ’s body possessions and manifestations ?
Well , I think all of the ghosts that Hurley sees are Jacob entities .
They are good in nature and intent like the Charlie at Santa Rosa or the Ana Lucia by the roadside , or even the Libby telling Michael not to push the button to blow up the ship .
Jacob manifests “ ghosts ” to give choices to the characters like “ They need you , ” or “ Do n’t do it Michael . ”
Never an order .
Always a choice .
Esau merely possesses corpses and masquerades as their previous identities .
Esau may have their memories ( much like Miles does when he communes with the dead ) but he is not them .
He is merely using their images to futher his own agenda .
The ghosts that appear to Hurley are said to be blessings by Jacob himself .
Perhaps they really are the ghosts of his friends ?
It is unclear whether or not the Walt manifestations can be attributed to either party or even Walt himself .
Whatever happened to that kid anyway ?
He used to be important .
Let 's hope he returns next year ( it was the first Lost season finale ever that did n't feature an appearance by the elusive young man ) .
Anyway , major tangent walking I am going off on .
The point is simple through all of the complexities of the story .
Jacob and Esau have their origins from the two powerful underground caverns –
Jacob – The Swan
Esau – The Orchid
IMPORTANT NOTE :
The smoke monster may not be Esau .
It may have originally been the island ’s security system in that very basic sense , and it was always neutral to the battle between Jacob and Esau , but somehow Esau got it on his side and it became his tool of judgement .
This is just as possible as Esau being the monster himself as we have never psychically seen the monster take the shape of anything other than black smoke .
It has only been suggested OFF - screen .
Perhaps , that is for a reason ?
Perhaps , the writers want us to jump to this as a conclusion .
I do n’t know , I ’m just venting an idea there .
As for this war that Widmore was telling us that would be coming – the war between Jacob and Esau seems a safe bet as to what he was referring to .
But , getting back to the long con idea – I do n't believe Widmore was lying about the island needing Locke , nor was he lying that if Locke did not return to the island the wrong side was going to win .
He meant all of this .
It 's just Widmore is not playing for the same side John was playing for .
Locke wanted to do good ultimately .
He wanted acceptance , recognition and affirmation as a man .
So yes he was used .
Christian told him down in the frozen wheel cavern “ That ’s why they call it sacrifice ” in reference to Locke saying he was told he was going to die , which we know now was by Esau himself ( impostor Locke ) via Richard .
He was not offered the choice to die , he was told YOU ARE GOING TO DIE .
It was a command .
There is a split belief system on the island .
If Jacob commanded so many followers , surely Esau split the vote too .
If they are both peers , then they would both be followed as separate “ entities . ”
Esau is worshipped and followed just as much as Jacob , or perhaps , he USED TO BE worshipped in that way , but lost his following somewhere along the line .
I still find it hard to believe Jacob would sign off on the mass killing of the Dharma folk .
Widmore was still in charge and I believe he was doing Esau 's bidding .
Charles Widmore is a believer in Esau .
Richard Alpert is a believer in Jacob .
Ben was always on the fence , whihc Esau manipuulated to meet his own ends .
The Others have always been split by these two opposing forces .
Widmore wanted Ben to kill a young Rousseau and her new born baby because like Esau ’s philosophy – they do not deserve to be there on the island .
People do not belong there unless they are " chosen . "
But it was not a choice Ben was given to kill Rousseau and Alex .
It was an order .
Finish the job the smoke monster started with her team .
But Ben chose to save them .
I suspect this is what happened to Henry Gale as well .
Only he did n't get so lucky .
Now Widmore was apart of Esau ’s long con , knowingly .
When he said he sent the freighter and the mercenaries to the island to remove Ben Linus so that Locke ’s time could come to pass as leader , he was half telling the truth .
He wanted Ben gone , but he needed to send a boat load of trouble to provide enough of a reason for that frozen wheel to be turned .
MOVING the island was apart of the long con , to make sure the record would come unstuck and that Impostor Locke could manipulate events in time by telling the Locke of the Past that he needed to die .
To make sure Locke followed the pattern Esau wanted him to .
He posed as Christian Shepherd on numerous occasions to ensure this is what would happen .
As long as Locke believed it was Jacob in that cabin he would follow his orders unequivocally .
But as Illana pointed out Jacob had not used the cabin for a long time .
Who else but Esau would want to pose as Jacob ?
“ You have to make them believe that it is their idea , but it ’s not their idea , it ’s your idea . ”
Remember these words .
The Long Con episode set up this concept and continued the con-theme from Deus Ex Machina .
It was not just a filler episode like we once thought .
It was a demonstration of what was going to happen .
It is one of the themes of the show .
Ben is a big part of Esau ’s loophole .
He pushed the wheel that moved the island .
This made it possible for this loophole to be opened by making the record come unstuck .
And since the frozen wheel taps into a large part of Esau ’s power it gave him the freedom to skip the Losties through time to the exact points he chose .
To change the course of events significantly enough to allow himself the chance to win this game , essentially by cheating .
But if Ben , by pushing the wheel , created the loophole or became the loophole Esau needed , then that would lead us to Desmond .
Desmond is Jacob ’s loophole as he turned the key that destroyed the hatch , which unstuck him in time .
This will be important in the final season .
This is why Eloise Hawking told Desmond the island was not done with him .
Because Jacob ’s contingency rests with Old Desmondo just as much as it does with the Oceanic 6 .
I wo n’t make full predictions for Season 6 based on my ramblings here as it is already highly convoluted , but I hope it makes enough sense to people and sheds some light on the details of seasons past .
If any of this is on the right track of course .
Which , knowing Lost , it probably is n't .
I used to believe the smoke monster WAS the island and that the island was made up from its particles .
That idea seems like a looooong time ago now .
For every move Esau made , Jacob counteracted and vice versa .
The evidence for this is clear in retrospect and Locke ’s story has a very interesting new reading when viewed again with all of this in mind .
To summarise best , in the scientific based words we are all probably accustomed to “ For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . ”
Cause and effect .
Decisions and consequences .
Light and dark .
Good and evil .
The Swan and The Orchid .
Two players .
Two potential outcomes .
But there will be only one checkmate come the end because as Jacob said “ It only ends once . "
And what that ending may be is still unclear .
Thanks for reading .
Ah , when we could meet people in person .
This interview is f...
By Don Fitz
May 30 , 2009 --
With millions of jobs lost during the first part of 2009 , who is calling for a shorter work week to spread the work around ?
Not the Republicans .
Not even the Democrats .
But why is there nary a peep from unions ?
In the US , the vehicle industry sets the pace for organised labour .
The only discussion at the top levels of the United Auto Workers Union ( UAW ) is how quickly the gains won during the last 50 years can be given back .
Does the UAW have no memory of the 1930s and 1940s when a shorter work week was at centre of organising demands ?
The gross domestic product is plummeting at the same time that jobs are disappearing .
Why should there be any connection between the two ?
If society produces 10 % less , why do n’t we all just work 10 % less ?
Did n’t things work like that for hundreds of thousands of years of human existence ?
When people figured out easier ways to get what they needed , they spent less time doing it .
It ’s called “ leisure ” .
Leisure is essential for a democratic society involving people in all aspects of self - government .
Instead of working frenetically to produce “ stuff ” that we do n’t have the time to enjoy , would n’t we be better off with less “ stuff ” and more time of our own ?
Research repeatedly shows that , once important needs are met , additional belongings bring no additional happiness .
[ 1 ]
Yet work is strongly related to stress . [ 2 ]
A labour - environment connection ?
It ’s more than stress to the human nervous system .
Manufacturing too much stuff stresses every aspect of the environment .
The voracious appetite of corporate growth destroys homes of the wolf and bear in North America .
Swiftly disappearing are the last refuges of chimpanzees in Africa and orangutans in Borneo and Sumatra .
Mangrove forests give way to beach resorts as long - line fishing kills 100 sea animals for every fish eaten by a human .
Vastly more creatures fall prey to the 80,000 – 100,000 chemicals spewed into the air , water and land .
Countless molecules of chlorine and fluorine go into pesticides and plastics that destroy immune and reproductive systems .
Elemental structures of lead , mercury and , of course , radioactive particles are an enemy to living systems .
The most frequent building block of toxins is oil .
With more than 40 hours of labour contained in each gallon , oil is the closest thing to free energy that humanity has ever discovered . [ 3 ]
A substance that should be used sparingly so that many future generations could use if for medical and other essential products , oil is being squandered at an exponential rate by a corporate culture determined that its descendants will despise it .
The only way that corporate America knows to shield itself from loathing by its progeny is working overtime to prevent those generations from existing .
As climate change changes from “ if / when ” to “ How rapidly is it increasing ? ” corporations befuddle our senses with a dazzling array of green gadgets , each of which pumps more CO2 into the atmosphere during its manufacture and distribution .
Nevertheless , corporate media propagandises non -stop that we must be unhappy from the economic downturn and pray for a quick return to the normal rate of planetary extermination .
So it ’s time to ask why another set of voices is not demanding a shorter work week .
Why do the Nature Conservancy , World Wildlife Federation and a host of other Washington lobby groups fail to point out that an economic slowdown with a fair distribution of jobs would be the treatment of choice for a sick environment ?
Centuries of struggle for the working day
Some of the most insightful writing on hours of labour is in Karl Marx ’s Capital .
While most of it reflects the analytical style of 19th century economic writing , Chapter X on “ The Working - Day ” reveals Marx ’s passionate outrage at what long hours do to workers ’ health .
The problem started as infant capitalism found the hours of labour under feudalism to be insufficient to satisfy its urges for expansion .
In response to a shortage of labour due to the plague , England ’s 1349 Statute of Labourers sought to ensure that the working day was sufficiently long .
An Elizabethan statute of 1562 lengthened the working day by reducing the time for meals .
Emphasising that it took capitalism centuries to lengthen the working day to 12 hours , Marx noted that one of the milestones was the elimination of church holidays by protestantism . [ 4 ]
By the 19th century , some had work weeks of 15 hours per day for six days per week plus 8 – 10 hours on Sunday .
[ 5 ]
At the same time that many were organising to reduce their hours to 12 per day , the Chartist movement made the 10 hour day “ their political , election cry ” . [ 6 , 7 ]
The high point of US labour organising during the 19th century was on May 1 , 1886 , when 300,000 workers went on strike for the eight - hour day .
The brutal repression that came down in Chicago with the Haymarket arrests and executions sparked the international celebration of May Day . [ 8 ]
In his classic description of the fervor for an eight hour day that began in 1884 and increased in pitch through 1886 , Jeremy Brecher made observations that are still relevant .
First , the leadership of the dominant labour organisation of the day , the Knights of Labour , attempted to put brakes on the eight - hour - day movement .
It was often the grassroots that pushed forward , dragging the leaders behind them in city after city .
Second , the 1886 strike wave , far more than previous labour actions , “ became above all strikes for power ” .
[ 9 ]
The 1886 demands were for control over work hours , hiring and firing , and the organisation of work .
Third , and most important , the struggle for the eight - hour day did not wait until the 10 - hour day had been won .
Unbelievably long hours were still common .
Successful strikes meant that , in many industries , workers “ of all kinds have reduced their hours of labor from 15 to 12 and 10 ” . [ 10 ]
Workers who only a few years earlier had 12 – 15 hours per day jobs were now demanding the eight - hour day .
Marx similarly wrote that the Chartist movement for the 10 - hour day was popular amongst those with a work week of up to 100 hours .
Does anyone work for less than 40 hours ?
While interviewing Spanish longshoremen [ wharf labourers ] in 1989 , I spent hours talking to Juan Madrid in Barcelona .
Every summer he and his wife had the problem of making sure that they had the same month for vacation .
“ Do American workers really get off less than a month ? ” , he asked me incredulously .
“ Two weeks is the most common ; some only get one week ; and , many get no paid vacation at all ” , I let him know .
Factoring in longer vacations , he had an average work week considerably shorter than the typical US worker .
This is the rule , and not the exception , in Europe .

Reducing the work week below 40 hours has preoccupied many labour organisations .
In the 1930s , the American Federation of Labour lobbied for a six - hour day . [ 11 ]
In 1990 BMWs plant in Regensburg adopted a 36 hour week .
German Volkswagen employees accepted a 10 % pay cut to achieve a 28.8 hour work week .
The Digital corporation had 530 employees who opted for a 4 - day week with a 7 % pay cut so that 90 jobs could be saved . [ 12 ]
Victories for shorter work weeks may only be temporary .
Tim Kaminski told me that he loved the extra free time he gained from winning a seven - hour day ( with no loss in pay ) at the St. Louis Chrysler mini-van plant in 1992 .
But the contract stipulated that it would last only until another plant reopened , which happened two years later . [ 13 ]
It is not unknown for politicians to champion the cause of fewer hours .
Before joining the Supreme Court , as a US Senator Hugo Black introduced legislation for a 30 - hour work week in 1933 . [ 14 ]
More recently , the French Senate looked into a 33 - hour week . [ 15 ]
One of the least - known flirtations with the 30 - hour work week was by the cereal giant , W.K. Kellogg Company .
In 1930 , the company announced that most of its 1500 employees would go from an eight - hour to a six - hour work day , which would provide 300 new jobs in Battle Creek .
Though the shorter work week involved a pay cut , the overwhelming majority of workers preferred having increased leisure time to spend with their families and community . [ 16 ]
New managers who began running Kellogg had no enthusiasm for the shorter work day .
They polled workers in 1946 and found that 77 % of men and 87 % of women would choose a 30 - hour week even if it meant lower wages .
Disappointed , management began examining which work groups liked money more than leisure and began offering the 40 - hour week on a department - by - department basis .
How long did it take them to get rid of the 30 - hour week ?
Almost 40 years !
The desire to have more time to themselves was so strong that it was not until 1985 that Kellogg was able to eliminate the 30 - hour work week in the last department .
The experience at Kellogg indicates that it is absolutely false to say that all workers all of the time crave more stuff and will sacrifice anything to get it .
Karl Marx made a similar observation when writing about “ The Working - Day ” .
Quoting results of a poll of those who had laboured excruciating hours at a Lancashire factory , “ They would much prefer working 10 hours for less wages … ” [ 17 ]
Why would any progressive criticise a 30 - hour work week ?
Despite all of this , there is something problematic with advocating a 30 - hour work week at the beginning of the 21st century : a 30 - hour work week is not short enough !
There is mushrooming unemployment amidst mountains of useless products .
An hour of labour now produces more goods than has ever been the case in the history of humanity .
Combining these means that there is no reason for anyone to work more than 20 hours per week .
Every year , clever folks figure out how to churn out more stuff with fewer hours of labour .
Jeffrey Kaplan observed that “ By 1991 , the amount for goods and services produced for each hour of labour was double what it had been in 1948 ” . [ 18 ]
This was a doubling of labour productivity in only 43 years .
Jon Bekken calculates a more rapid rate : “ Automation and other innovations result in our productivity ( output per work hour ) doubling every 25 years or so ” . [ 19 ]
In other words , the amount that people produce during an hour of labour doubles every 33 years [ give or take 10 years ] .
We have the ability to produce twice as much during the work day or cut the work day in half and produce the same amount .
Arthur Dahlberg , a consultant to both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations , wrote that capitalism was already capable of satisfying basic human needs with a four - hour work day . [ 20 ]
He maintained that such a drastic cut in working hours “ was necessary to prevent society from becoming disastrously materialistic ” . [ 21 ]
The issue was revisited in 1991 by Harvard economist Juliet Schor , who concluded that it would be possible to have a four - hour work day with no decline in the standard of living . [ 22 ]
Similarly , J.W. Smith argued that “ over 50 % of our industrial capacity has nothing to do with producing for consumer needs ” . [ 23 ]
Years before issues of climate change and peak oil grabbed the public , Smith forecast :
We ’re facing an ecological nightmare as we push to the brink the earth ’s ability to support us .
We could eliminate much industrial pollution and conserve our precious , dwindling resources by eliminating the 50 % of industry that is producing nothing useful for society . [ 24 ]
In a more recent analysis , Smith sifts through the US economy sector by sector to conclude that “ we could all work 2.3 days per week with no drop in our living standard ” . [ 25 ]
It ’s a rare economist who is capable of realising that there is no reason to constantly scramble for the possession of more objects that fall apart more rapidly .
British philosopher Bertrand Russell also thought that four hours of work per day should be plenty to supply the necessities of life . [ 26 ]
Russell was thinking similarly to Benjamin Franklin , who wrote more than 200 years ago :
… if every Man and Woman would work for four Hours each Day on something useful , that Labour would produce sufficient to procure all the Necessities and Comforts of Life , Want and Misery would be banished out of the World , and the rest of the 24 hours might be Leisure and Pleasure . [ 27 ]
Labour has become vastly more productive since Ben Franklin contemplated the work day .
However , total output grows even faster than labour productivity .
By including population growth and people seeking to live the lifestyle of the English - speaking rich , Ted Trainer ciphers that “ by 2070 given 3 % economic growth , total world economic output every year would then be 60 times as great as it is now . [ 28 ]
This would be a 6000 % increase in stuff in 63 years — not exactly healthy for forests , oceans , wildlife and humans .
If we want our children to be able to live on this planet , the single most important environmental legislation may be restricting people from working more than 20 hours per week .
What ’s stopping a shorter work week ?
One factor which is not standing in the way of fewer work hours is “ human nature ” .
Marshall Sahlins estimated that hunter and gatherer societies probably spent 15 – 20 hours per week obtaining the necessities to survive . [ 29 ]
Each of us can look inside of ourselves to see the real obstacles to cutting the work week in half : fear that we will lose medical care , pensions , and related survival necessities .
Virtually every working family in the United States is one medical catastrophe away from bankruptcy .
Countless people would gleefully shift to a 20 - hour work week if it would not cause them to lose their health insurance .
Pensions pose a similar roadblock .
As they approach retirement , millions of Americans become acutely aware that pensions are based on factors like the average salary of the last three years .
Working part time would cut pension payments during uncertain years .
It is not a well kept secret that employers often give workers less than 40 hours to deny them benefits .
A similar effect occurs from forced overtime .
Even though there may be a higher rate of pay for overtime , a company may save money if it does not pay for the health care and pensions that putting more people on the payroll would require .
Every environmentalist who wants to stop coal companies from blowing the top off of sacred mountains should be on those mountains screaming that private health insurance and pension plans must be replaced by single payer health care and a social security system with at least a four - fold expansion of payments .
In case the environmental significance is not clear …
1 . Halting the cancerous growth of useless fall - apart junk production requires a drastic shortening of the work week ; and , 2 .
Cutting the work week can only happen if people are not terrified that fewer hours means they will lose health insurance and pension plans .
These are called “ social wages ” .
Social wages also include mass public transportation , clean water , breathable air , uncontaminated land and something which is becoming increasingly rare : the right to quality free public education which is coordinated by representatives directly elected by citizens .
These social wages are as important environmentally as medical care and pensions .
The right to a home with electricity and heat is part of the same pattern .
People who are not fearful of being thrown out of their home or losing their utilities have much less incentive to work long hours .
There remains an enormous problem that permeates every other barrier to shortening the working day .
As long as production is based on the maximisation of profit , each corporation is pushed to extend working hours as long as possible for fear the competition will do it first .
As Marx described with clarity :
The prolongation of the working - day , beyond the limits of the natural day , into the night , … quenches only in a slight degree the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour .
To appropriate labour during all 24 hours of the day is , therefore , the inherent tendency of capitalist production . [ 30 ]
In the 21st century , we should update this to say that capital feeds with two fangs : one to suck the blood of labour and the other fang to drain life from Mother Earth .
Can the 20 - hour work week become a wooden stake held by the environmental movement as it is pounded by labour ?
Maybe ; but not necessarily .
A stake that is driven too shallow will allow the demon to awaken with renewed strength .
When US workers struck for the eight - hour work day in 1886 , they were going beyond pay issues and demanding that labour have a role in controlling the process of production .
Today , we need a progressive alliance to challenge not only how many hours we work , but the quality , durability and even the necessity of goods we produce .
Drastically cutting the hours we work will help save the Earth ’s ecology only if it is part of an overarching goal to improve the quality of our lives while reducing the grand mass of manufactured objects .

With my feet about 1.5 feet from the wall , I put a small ball ( 16 ″ ) between my knees and I slide down the wall until I am almost in a seated position , making sure that my knees do not go over my toes .
I then hold for a few seconds while squeezing the ball between my knees , then slowly slide back up .
You do n’t necessarily need a ball for this exercise , but it gives my knees greater support .
According to Prevention ( 11/2008 ) , lower body strength translates into good balance , flexibility , and endurance .
As you get older , those are the key attributes to reducing your risk of falls and injuries , particularly hip fractures , which often quickly lead to declining health .
They state that up to 20 % of hip fracture patients die within one year because of complications from the trauma .
I know I would not want to be part of that statistic .
According to Robert N. Butler , MD , president of the International Longevity Center - USA , “ Having weak thigh muscles is the number one predictor of frailty in old age . ”
What a great piece of information to know .
I believe most of us want to remain independent until we depart this life .
For quicker recovery from sore muscles and joint support , consider a regimen of glucosamine / chondroitan .
There are many over - the - counter brands , some with an additional ingredient , MSM , which some believe helps pain and inflammation .
As in all dietary supplements , know your source and remember , this is not medication .
Do not expect instant results .
Your body needs time to absorb over a period ot time .
Here is one to check out which I take called Naturflex .
Here ’s to strong quads !

The leading architect of the international system to stop the trade in blood diamonds has warned that the safety net is close to collapse with governments and the industry failing to act against gross violations .
Ian Smillie , the " grandfather " of the landmark Kimberley Process , that was agreed in response to appalling civil wars in Africa fuelled by illegal gems , said he had " stomped out " on his scheme as it was no longer working .
" It is n't regulating the rough diamond trade , " the Canadian expert said yesterday .
" It is in danger of becoming irrelevant and it 's letting all manner of crooks off the hook . "

The Kimberley safeguards came into effect in 2003 and helped restore consumer confidence in precious stones .
Today they regulate 99.98 per cent of the rough diamond trade , but if the process loses credibility , experts say criminals will re-enter the trade with conflict diamonds quickly reappearing in shops in London , Paris and New York .
Mr Smillie was one of the authors of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme ( KPCS ) , the UN - backed agreement credited with breaking the link between the diamond trade and vicious conflicts , mainly in southern and western Africa .
His comments came as the 49 members of the Kimberley Process – made up of governments , industry and civil society – met in Namibia with a growing list of concerns .
Top of those is Zimbabwe , where hundreds of diamond miners were massacred by the army as the government effectively militarised a key mining area late last year .
Some in the industry have questioned whether Zimbabwe 's gems match the definition of conflict diamonds as they are helping to fund a government , not a rebel army , but Mr Smillie rejected this : " They are blood diamonds , they have blood all over them . "
Zimbabwe is not alone and a host of other cracks have emerged in the system of safeguards meant to " ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence " .
Monitors have pointed to the illegal trade flourishing in Ivory Coast , Guinea , Venezuela and Lebanon .
One - hundred percent of Venezuela 's diamonds are being smuggled , according to the UK - based Global Witness ; Guinea has reported an unfeasible 500 per cent increase in diamond production year on year ; and Lebanon is exporting more rough diamonds than it imports despite having no local deposits .
None of those countries have been suspended from the process and while inspection teams have been dispatched and reports commissioned , no action has been taken .
" The Kimberley Process is always the last to wake up and smell the coffee , " Mr Smillie complained .
It was claimed that he had " retired " from his role as one of the group 's chief monitors earlier this year but the Canadian dismissed this report , saying he had " stomped out " .
" If it was working I would be there in Windhoek arguing with them or celebrating with them ... but governments want to pretend that it is working . "
He said the mantra of KPCS has become " let 's not do anything now " and accused them of " fiddling while Rome burns " .
The KPCS is under strong pressure to act against Zimbabwe .
" Hundreds of miners have been killed by their own government , " said Annie Dunnebacke , lead campaigner from Global Witness .
" How can that country still be part of the Kimberley Process ?
What 's the point of having a stick if the stick is never used ?
Zimbabwe should be suspended . "
The Namibia meeting which ends today has agreed to send an inspection team to the troubled southern African nation next week but it 's unlikely they will be given serious access to the Marange area where the killings occurred .
Inspectors have privately admitted that people they want to interview have been arrested or intimidated already .
Global Witness and Mr Smillie 's Partnership Canada - Africa NGO were among the pressure groups who put blood diamonds on the agenda of the UN Security Council in 2000 .
At that stage rough gems were helping to pay for vicious civil wars in Sierra Leone , Liberia and Angola that cost hundreds of thousands of lives .
A UN resolution in December 2000 launched the Kimberley Process , and it was signed three years later .
On its own website the organisation trumpets its success : " Diamond experts estimate that conflict diamonds now represent a fraction of one per cent of the international trade in diamonds , compared to estimates of up to 15 per cent in the 1990s .
That has been the Kimberley Process 's most remarkable contribution to a peaceful world . "
The key to that success was ensuring that it reached all countries involved in the trade .
Its future depends on ensuring there are no grey areas for blood diamonds to exploit .
" Diamonds travel quickly , " explained Mr Smillie .
The consequences of a collapse of the Kimberley Process would be twofold , he warned .
" The diamond trade would go back to its criminal past and rebel armies would have no problem finding buyers for their blood diamonds .
The potential for diamonds fuelling conflict would be back , " he said .
Church Showered with Stones in Northern Israel Share Tweet
June 24 , 2009
MIGDAL HA -EMEQ , Israel ( Compass Direct News ) – When the congregation at St. Nicolay church in this northern Israeli town gathered on that quiet Friday morning of May 29 , they never expected to be showered with stones .
The Russian Orthodox worshipers , including many women , children and the elderly , had filled the small building to overflow with several outside when they were stunned by the rain of stones .
Some were injured and received medical care .
“ The church was crawling with people – the worshipers stood not only inside the church , but also outside , as the building is very small , when suddenly a few young men started throwing stones at the direction of our courtyard , ” Oleg Usenkov , press secretary of the church told Compass .
“ Young children were crying , everyone was very frightened . ”
The church had also been attacked earlier that week , during a wedding ceremony .
Stones and rotten eggs were thrown from the street , hitting guests as they arrived .
The same night , the Rev. Roman Radwan , priest of St. Nicolay church , filed a complaint at the police station .
An officer issued a document to confirm that he had filed an official complaint and sent him home , promising that measures would be taken .
But within 24 hours , the attackers again appeared at the church ’s doorway and no police were present to deter them – although the police station is located a few dozen meters from the church .
The identity of the assailants is unknown – a police officer said the complaint “ lacked the exact description of the attackers ” – but eye - witnesses claimed they were ultra- orthodox yeshiva students who frequently cursed the church on their way to the school or synagogue .
“ They often assault us verbally , curse and yell at us , although we tried to explain that this is a place of worship , a holy place , ” said a frustrated Usenkov , adding that the police inaction amounts to nonfeasance .
Another member of the congregation identified only as Nina , born in Moscow and now living in Nazeret Ilit , said that she did n’t understand where all the hatred is coming from .
“ They are heading to the yeshiva or going back home after praying at the synagogue – are they inspired to attack us during their prayers ? ” she said .
“ I hope not .
We are all Israeli citizens , we pay taxes , serve in the army and are entitled to freedom of choice when it comes to religion . "
She and other members of the congregation fear hostilities could escalate quickly if measures are not taken soon .
Already the small building , which barely accommodates the worshipers , is surrounded by a stone fence by order of Migdal ha - Emeq officials following a series of arson attempts and other attacks .
Members of the congregation , a few hundred Christians from Migdal ha- Emeq , Afula , Haifa , Nazareth and other Israeli cities still remember how their building was vandalized in June 2006 .
Under cover of darkness , unidentified men broke in and broke icons and modest decorations , smashed windows and stole crosses .
The identity of those responsible remains unknown .
Established in 2005 , the church building was constructed to meet the needs of Christians who do not belong to the Arab Christian minority , mostly Russians who came to Israel from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s .
Besides the Christians , these immigrants included other non-Jews , as well as atheistic Jews and Jewish converts to Christianity .
No official data on religious make - up of the immigrants are available , especially since many fear deportation or persecution for talking openly about their faith , but Usenkov – a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity after immigrating to Israel in the 1990s – said he believes there are at least 300,000 Christians of Russian or Russian - Jewish origin who live in Israel today .
According to Israeli law , non-Jewish relatives of a Jew are also entitled to citizenship , but Jews who have converted to other faiths are denied it .
Most of the Russian and Russian - Jewish Christians in Israel belong to the Russian Orthodox Church and find it difficult to adjust to Greek or Arabic services common in the Greek Orthodox churches of Israel .
Since St. Nicolay ’s church opened its doors , hundreds of worshipers from across Israel have visited it .
“ Many people fear they might pass away without seeing a priest , or they dream of a Christian wedding service , ” said Radwan , an Israeli - Arab whose family once owned the land on which the St. Nicolay church is located .
“ Here we can answer their needs .
We do not want to harm anyone and wish that no one would harm us . ”

Now that Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ali Khamenei , has placed himself shoulder to shoulder with his officially elected president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the very existence of the Islamic regime may now be questioned openly in a nation ever more divided between reformists and those who insist on maintaining the integrity of the 1979 revolution .
Had Khamenei chosen a middle ground , some small compromises towards the countless millions – for in the election , it appears , they were indeed uncounted – who oppose Ahmadinejad , then he might have remained a neutral father - figure .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and his supporters had religiously – in the most literal sense of the word – refused to criticise the Supreme Leader or the existence of the Islamic Republic during last week 's street demonstrations
But reacting as all revolutionaries do even decades after they have come to power – for the spectre of counter - revolution remains with them until death – Khamenei chose to paint Ahmadinejad 's political opponents as potential mercenaries , spies and agents of foreign powers .
Treason in the Islamic Republic is , of course , punishable by death .
But Khamenei 's political alliance with his very odd and hallucinatory president may have sprung from fear as much as anger .
During his Friday prayers address at Tehran University , the Supreme Leader mentioned the dangers of a " velvet " revolution and it is clear that the regime has been deeply concerned by the democratic overthrow of Eastern European and west Asian governments since the fall of the Soviet Union .
People power – through which the 1979 revolution was ultimately successful – is a devastating weapon ( albeit the only one ) in the armoury of a serious but unarmed political opposition .

In the aftermath of the Ahmadinejad " success " at the polls , his supporters were handing out leaflets condemning the secular revolutions of Eastern Europe , and their content says much about the anxieties of Iran 's clerical leadership .
One of them was entitled : " The system of trying to topple an Islamic Republic in a ' velvet revolution ' . "
It then described how it believes Poland , Czechoslovakia , Ukraine and other nations won their freedom .
" ' Velvet ' or ' colourful ' revolutions ... are methods of exchanging power for social unrest .
Colourful and ' velvet ' revolutions occurred in post - communist societies of central and Eastern Europe and central Asia .
Colourful revolutions have always been initiated during an election and its methods are as follows :
" 1. Complete despair in the attitude of people when they are certain to lose an election ...
" 2. Choosing one particular colour which is selected solely for the Western media to identify ( for their readers or viewers ) . "
Mousavi used green as his campaign colour and his supporters still wear this colour on wristbands , scarves and bandannas .
"3) Announcing that there has been advance cheating before an election and repeating it non-stop afterwards ... allowing exaggeration by the Western media , especially in the US .
"4) Writing letters to officials in the government , claiming vote - rigging in the election .
It 's interesting to note that in all such ' colourful ' projects – for example , in Georgia , Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan – the Western - backed movements have warned of fraud before elections by writing to the incumbent governments .
In Islamic Iran , these letters had already been written to the Supreme Leader . "
Another leaflet maintained that a study – which Khamenei 's advisers have obviously undertaken , however inaccurately – demonstrated that vote - rigging will be alleged on the very day of the election and that victory will be claimed by the opposition hours before the counting is finished and before their own defeat is announced .
The results , says the document , will therefore already have a " background " of fraud .
" In the final stages ... supporters gather in front of the regime 's official offices , holding colourful banners and protesting against vote - rigging . "
This part of the demonstration , the leaflet says , " is run by the foreign media who are the opposition movement 's supporters so that they make good pictures and mislead the international community " .
All this shows a unique and obsessive concern among the Supreme Leader 's disciples about just how popular Mousavi 's post-election campaign has become .
Even the cutting of SMS and mobile communications – and in a sophisticated society such as Iran , this must have cost millions of dollars – did not prevent the calling of rallies which always assembled at the same moment and at the same place .
What we are now seeing is a regime which is far more worried than the Supreme Leader suggested when he threatened the opposition so baldly on Friday .
Having refused any serious political dialogue with Mousavi and his opposition comrades – a few district recounts will produce no real change in the result – the Iranian regime , led by a Supreme Leader who is frightened and a president who speaks like a child , is now involved in the battle for control of the streets of Iran .
It is a conflict which will need the kind of miracle in which Khamenei and Ahmadinejad both believe to avoid violence .
Steve Ballmer confirms new Xbox by 2010
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has disclosed in a recent speech in Chicago that there definitely will be a new Xbox console on store shelves by 2010 , despite constant denials by Microsoft execs .
Detailing the new console ’s specifications , Ballmer describes the console to a very similar degree with Project Natal , Microsoft up and coming next - generation controller system , reportedly for the current Xbox 360 .
However , it has been noted that this is the first time where the characteristics of Natal were suggested to be housed within the main Xbox console , as opposed to Natal ’s original design of being an external peripheral .
Project Natal is the industry code name for Microsoft ’s plans of releasing a new controller system that rivals the controller technology that the Nintendo Wii has set .
Natal will have capabilities of recognizing audio and video patterns , in addition to motion detection .
According to Microsoft ’s Aaron Greenberg , Natal will be completely compatible with the current Xbox 360 system , and will not need additional auxiliary support to function .
TEHRAN — Iran ’s 1979 revolution took a full year to gestate .
The uprising of 2009 has now ended its first phase .
But the volatility ushered in by the June 12 ballot - box putsch of Iran ’s New Right is certain to endure over the coming year .
The Islamic Republic has been weakened .
During one of the violent clashes here in recent days , I saw a member of the riot police confront a protester holding a cell phone .
“ Do n’t take a photograph of me ! ” he yelled at the young man .
“ Why ? ” the man shouted back .
“ You ’re not naked . ”
But the Islamic Republic is .
Everyone knows where everyone stands ; it is n’t pretty .
All the fudge that allowed a modern society to coexist with a theocracy inspired by an imam occulted in the 9th century has been swept away , leaving two Irans at war .
One of those Irans , embodied in the 12 - member Guardian Council , the highest legal body , ruled in a preliminary statement on Tuesday that “ no major fraud ” had occurred in the vote and that its annulment was therefore impossible .
Not much surprise there , in that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader , made clear last week that the recount was a waste of time .
I was a bit surprised , albeit pleasantly , to see Jon Stewart nail Harry Truman as a war criminal .
After all , Stewart is a typical Hollywood liberal , whose politics are by now a staple of the corporate , anodyne culture that permeates the airwaves , and this naturally excludes everything that might challenge the liberal groupthink that constitutes the conventional wisdom in the Age of Obama .
Certainly , in " respectable " quarters , criticism of anything or anyone connected to the great liberal " anti-fascist " crusade , the " Good War , " is strictly verboten , and surely an intelligent guy like Stewart knows this .
Yet – contrary to what he said later – this was n’t an argument that arose in the heat of the moment , in the context of a robust discussion with obnoxious neocon Clifford May on the alleged merits of torture .
No , Stewart had apparently thought this one out , at least to some extent , because when May asked him if he thought Truman was a war criminal for nuking two Japanese cities , he did n’t just say " Yes " – he went into a whole riff about how , if we had first demonstrated the power of this new weapon on an uninhabited atoll somewhere , and then informed the Japanese government that they ’d better surrender , or else that would happen in Japan , then and only then would it be okay to drop the Big One .
The audience cheered him on , as he took apart the frenetically hysterical May , whose ferret - like features and organizational affiliations make him the perfect spokesman for a policy described by Stewart as " temporary insanity . "
Yet , a few days later , Stewart was back to the same subject , minus the rabid ferret , this time reversing his stance – and apologizing for calling the little haberdasher a war criminal .
My , that was quick .
Alas , apparently not quick enough for the executives at whatever network Stewart appears on – yes , I know , I have to be the only person in America who does n’t watch his show – who no doubt would have preferred that he never said it at all .
It was clearly the execs who reined in the freethinking Stewart and laid down the law , and the first law of " controversial , " " provocative , " and indubitably " edgy " television commentary is to never – ever , ever !
– allow a deviation from the conventional wisdom that falls outside the contemporary Left / Right paradigm .
Rule number one in this game is that everybody must play their assigned role .
You ’ve always got to be " in character . "
If you ’re on the Left , you can take on George W. Bush , murderer of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis – but not Harry Truman , killer of even larger numbers of innocent Japanese civilians .
Rightists regularly excoriate the crimes of Stalin , yet they are expected to remain silent when it comes to war crimes committed by the U.S. , such as the " Phoenix program " during the Vietnam conflict – and they rarely disappoint .
This enforcement of a dubious double standard , by the way , goes beyond the issue of war crimes and mass murder .
If you ’re on the Right , you ’re allowed to express unlimited disdain for the thuggish Hugo Chavez – indeed , it ’s a veritable obligation – but even a hint of contempt for the equally thuggish Benjamin Netanyahu and his neo - fascist foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , will earn you enough brickbats to build a Wall of Separation between your ideological comrades and yourself .
Likewise , lefties are allowed to cuddle up to Fidel Castro while inveighing against Augusto Pinochet .
In any case , Stewart ’s apology was embarrassing : for him , for the studio audience ( which giggled nervously , and inappropriately , at awkward intervals ) , and for me .
As he looked into the camera and babbled about how wrong he was – without giving a single reason , never mind a good one – you could almost see his strings being pulled by his corporate masters .
So let ’s see if I get this straight : it is not okay to torture a member of al - Qaeda , who no doubt has information we need in order to stop terrorist attacks .
Instead , we have to treat him as a prisoner of war according to the rules laid down by the Geneva Conventions .
On the other hand , it is okay to murder hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in cold blood , to incinerate entire cities and poison the land for generations to come , as long as your name is Harry Truman .
Am I getting this right so far ?
I have stayed away from the torture " debate " for a number of reasons , because , after all , the issue is n’t debatable .
Not in a civilized country , that is .
We might as well debate the merits and demerits of infanticide or coprophagia .
Normal people do n’t argue about these things ; they simply turn away in revulsion .
Another reason for my abstention from this ongoing brouhaha – which seems to have consumed the left wing of the blogosphere ever since Obama took office – is that there is something remarkably phony about the high moral dudgeon of the liberals when it comes to this non-question .
How much moral moxie does it really take to come out , guns blazing , against torture ?
I mean , you do n’t have to be a saint or anything to enlist in a campaign to ban pulling off the fingernails of defenseless prisoners , you just have to be halfway normal .
Furthermore , there is another reason to be suspicious of the liberals - against - torture campaign that now monopolizes the capacity of certain pundits for outrage : the amount of noise being generated about this issue very effectively – and conveniently – drowns out opposition to the rest of Bush ’s ugly legacy , principally the ongoing occupation of Iraq and Obama ’s escalation of the " war on terrorism " in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Exhausted by their 24/7 calls to expunge the stain of torture from America ’s conscience – which is to be accomplished , supposedly , by trying Bush , Cheney , and the Republican gang for war crimes – the liberals have no moral energy to take on Obama ’s wars .
Thus what passes for the Left in the America of 2009 is perfectly happy to make demands they know will never be met and rail against a practice that even those who advocate it in certain circumstances seem uneasy about .
It ’s so much easier than coming out against the foreign policy of a popular president whom liberals regard as the second coming of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King combined .
It does n’t seem to matter that those policies are murderous , just as Bush ’s were , and potentially even more disastrous for the U.S. in terms of " blowback . "
If we are signing on to an occupation of Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan that will make our activities in Iraq seem like the briefest of episodes , then liberals of the Kossack / Huffington Post / Jon Stewart sort do n’t want to hear about it .
That ’s because they ’re okay with it – as long as we do n’t torture people individually , you see , by making them think they ’re drowning or throwing them against a wall .
Obama ’s in the White House , and all ’s right with the world !
Once Dear Leader has determined that it ’s imperative we actually kill people en masse , for reasons that have little or nothing to do with the defense of the United States , as we are doing in Afghanistan and Pakistan – well , then , it ’s nothing to get too excited about .
Indeed , it ’s actually praiseworthy , positively Truman - esque – and we all know what a heroic figure the gnome - like machine politician Truman was !
Cliff May and his ilk know what side they ’re on , they know what they believe and what they want , and they are quick to home in on the many contradictions of ostensibly antiwar liberals like Stewart , whose instincts are good , but who do n’t know anything but the permitted pieties about America ’s role and actions during World War II .
That ’s why liberals are rendered practically speechless by ritualized neocon invocations of " Hitler " and " Munich " every time a supposedly deadly threat to the U.S. arises somewhere in the world .
For a moment , however , Stewart saw through the veil of myth and prejudice ( yes , racial prejudice ) that obscures the truth about what we did to Japan , which was ready to make peace on reasonable terms .
Roosevelt ’s insistence on unconditional surrender , upheld by Truman , rationalized mass murder on a scale never before seen , and at the time the liberals fell right into line , with nary a pip or a squeak from any of them .
It was inside the military and the U.S. government that dissent raised its head .
Truman ’s decision went against the advice of Generals Douglas MacArthur and Dwight David Eisenhower , not to mention his own secretaries of state and the Navy .
In 1963 , Eisenhower told Newsweek : " The Japanese were ready to surrender , and it was n’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing . "
Oh , but please do n’t confuse us with the introduction of needless facts .
What are you , one of those obstructionist Republican extremists ?
In the wake of Stewart ’s faux pas and subsequent Soviet - style self - criticism , one thing is clear : measures must be taken .
It is necessary – in this , the Age of Obama – to establish a firm doctrine from which no one , no matter how popular , how " provocative , " or how " edgy " they might be , is allowed to dissent , and it is this : no Democratic president can ever be guilty of a war crime .
No , not even Lyndon " Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? " Johnson .
Which means Obama has a license to obliterate Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iran ( as his secretary of state said she would like to do ) , and we can get on with the important business of conducting political show trials of our favorite Republican villains .
And all ’s right with the world …
To conclude : yes , Stewart is a wimp , a wuss , and a moral coward – but he ’s very far from alone .
How I Avoided Joining the Army

DOSE :
oral Datura ( liquid )
BODY WEIGHT : 70 kg
Until the mid nineties in France one could buy those anti asthma cigarettes called ' Louis Legras ' .
The main ingredient was Datura leaves but they also contained other plants such as belladonna .
I was 19 at the time and was called to the compulsory French army test , which I really wanted to fail in order to avoid serving one year .
A lot of people were pretending to be psychologically ill so the army people were very tough on fake psychos .
A friend I was hanging out with the night before handed me 5 of these cigarettes saying ,  With those you wo n't need to pretend being deranged because you 'll really be deranged I went back home and started to make an infusion with the 5 ciggies , looked like a really dark tea , then I went to bed .
I woke up late the next morning , just had to time to jump into my trousers , grab a shirt and hit the kitchen to drink the ' Magic Potion ' .
It was so sour I had to add loads of honey to it .
I drunk 2 mugs and got out to catch the bus .
Within 5 minutes , I was on that bus , my hands started to grip a bar and my head starting to move around ; with a slight paranoia like feeling .
I hoped some other guys were going to the military camp were on that bus ( 5 min ride ) , so I just followed them .
As I entered the camp the effects were kicking hard but I was still able to talk .
I met an officer that I knew from school who laughed at me saying .
 Ah ah Weirdo you do n't want to do it , the army We were all in line , going thru the medical tests , first thing they ask you is to drop some urine in a small glass .
Impossible .
My mouth was also very dry and from that moment I realised it was gonna be a hard trip .
They carried on with the tests , some funny results came out as I noticed I could read the smallest letters on the eyesight test and hear the slightest noise they would throw in the earphones for the hearing test , but I miserably failed the contrast / colours test .
I was supposed to see letters , numbers or symbols .
I remember talking about devils , witches and a goat dancing around a bonfire .
I had to go through a lot of stairs and corridors to see various doctors ( eyes , ears , etc. . ) and one thing that was really crazy is that I could n't tell if the stairs were going up or down , sometimes I would want to lean against a wall and the wall I expected just was n't there .
During lunch I chocked on a small sardine filet I was trying to eat .
Army guys had to grab my legs and turn me upside down , then a doc came and asked me if I wanted to see a psychologist , I said I was alright and I did n't want to but he insistedSo there I was in the psych office , being asked all sorts of questions while eyes are popping out of the table ( I try to poke them but they move too fast ) : ' Are your parents divorced ' ?
( yes ) ' Are you afraid of snakes ' ?
( no spiders ) ' If I say red you think what '?
( blood , of course )
In a way I was still aware I should act within my own trip , though I still wonder if the psych decided to evict me because he thought I was deranged or if he knew what kind of stuff I had taken and thought ' if this guy is up to this in order to avoid the army then we do n't wanna take any risks ' .
So he declared me p4 + ( means asocial and near to dangerous but not enough to put me in the psychic ward ) so I went out with my paper secretly happy and still very fucked up .
I jumped in an army bus that took all the ' retards ' back to the downtown train station , and jumped into the next train to my dad 's home in a nearby village .
The thing is I took the wrong train and ended up somewhere else ( still wonder where ) I walked around in that other city all night , talked with mates that were in a tree for a few hours and also made friend with a stray dog that could also speak .
I got back to the station in the morning after walking many miles and I made it back to my hometown .
I had lost nearly everything , wallet , vest , keys even that important Army paper , so I crawled to my girlfriend 's apartment .
She was very worried as no one had had news from me since morning before .
I collapsed in her bedroom and woke up 30 hours later .
Felt like shit for at least a week .
I guess the dose was n't that bad .
Still a little too strong for my taste .

The remote Pacific island nation of Palau said today that it would accept 17 Chinese Muslims currently held in Guantánamo Bay , opening the way for the biggest transfer of inmates since President Barack Obama promised to close the prison .
The US has yet to confirm the decision , but the president of Palau , Johnson Toribiong , said in a statement that his country had " agreed to accommodate the United States of America 's request to temporarily resettle in Palau up to 17 ethnic Uighur detainees " .
The US envoy Dan Fried visited the islands last week to arrange the relocation to Palau , which was a UN Trust territory under US administration before becoming independent in 1994 .
Washington remains a major aid donor , but Toribiong said the decision was made on humanitarian grounds so that the men could start their lives anew in as normal a fashion as possible .
" I am honoured and proud that the United States has asked Palau to assist with such a critical task , " he said .
Two US officials , however , told the Associated Press that Washington was prepared to give Palau up to $ 200 m in development , budget support and other assistance in return for accepting the detainees .
Life on the islands will be far from normal for the 17 Uighurs , most of whom were mostly born in Xinjiang , a region of China that is further from the ocean than anywhere else on earth .
Their homeland is predominantly Muslim , close to the Silk Road with an ancient history of culture and conquest by Ghengis Khan and Tamberlaine the Great .
Palau , by contrast , is one of the world 's newest nations , with a population of 20,000 .
It consists of eight main islands and more than 250 islets about 500 miles east of the Philippines .
The Obama administration has faced intense political pressure since the president announced shortly after his inauguration that he would close Guantánamo Bay by January .
Yesterday , the first Guantánamo detainee to be tried in a civilian US court pleaded not guilty at a hearing in New York .
Ahmed Ghailani faces several charges arising from his alleged role in helping to organise the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa .
The 17 Uighur men , however , were cleared of charges of being combatants last year , and a federal district court ordered that they should be released in the United States .
But an appeals court overturned that decision and Republican politicians argue that they pose too much of a threat to be given liberty to reside in the US .
The US justice department has blocked moves to resettle them on the US mainland , where they had been offered a home by refugee and Christian organisations .
The men have remained in legal limbo ever since .
China seeks the extradition of the men , who the government in Beijing views as suspected members of illegal Xinjiang independence groups .
Human rights groups have opposed extradition on the grounds that the men may be sentenced to prison , tortured or executed .
Critics accuse Obama of dumping a sensitive problem in the middle of nowhere rather than accepting that the US should take responsibility for prisoners it has abused .
According to the Associated Press , the United States has contacted about 100 governments , but has not been able to persuade any country to take the 50 detainees cleared for transfer .
Britain and France have accepted one each .
In February , arrived in Britain after four years incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay .
IBM is planning to roll out about 30 enhancements to a variety of software offerings for its System z platform in 2009 , the latest move to extend the reach of IBM 's mainframe systems .
IBM already has launched the first 12 of the enhancements , touching on Rational development tools , InfoSphere and Cognos data management products , WebSphere transaction management offerings , and Tivoli IT services management software .
IBM officials for several years have touted a resurgence of the mainframe , pointing to the new workloads running on the platform and the growth not only of the MIPS that are shipping but also the increase in interest from ISVs .
IBM said it estimates that over the past year , another 150 ISVs have turned to the System z platform , adding more than 1,000 applications that can run on the mainframes .
Analysts have said much of the credit for the mainframe revival can be attributed to specialty processor engines that IBM has built to make it easier to run such loads as Linux and Java on the System z platform .
Other vendors also are pushing the mainframe 's growth .
Software makers such as CA and BMC Software are adding more capabilities to their mainframe management software , and Unisys late in May launched new ClearPath mainframes and specialty engines .
IBM also has offered new services and financing plans in hopes of enticing businesses that use Unix - based systems from Hewlett - Packard and Sun Microsystems to migrate to the System z platform , though HP officials have begun to fight back , attacking the mainframe for being less efficient and pricier than HP 's own Intel - based Integrity and ProLiant server families .
In its latest rollout of new capabilities , IBM June 4 unveiled enhancements to Rational System Architect v11.3 and Rational Focal Point for Product and Portfolio Management v6.4 , which are designed to improve IT budgeting and resource management through the use of strategy and IT blueprints .
Rational Developer for System z v7.6 integrates with other Rational System z tools and third - party software to help speed up the development of new workloads on the mainframe platform , lower training costs and reduce MIPS consumption .
Rational Team Concert for System z v 2.0 is based on IBM's Jazz technology and integrates with Rational Developer for System z to better support the building of cross-platform applications .
WebSphere Business Events v6.2.1 for the z / OS operating system aims to make it easier for users to handle business events using CICS applications , and CICS Transaction Server v4.1 is designed to let users better handle regulatory compliance and changing demographics .
Enhancements to Tivoli products touch on Tivoli Omegamon monitoring software , Tivoli Security Management for z / OS , Tivoli Key Lifecycle Management for z /OS and Tivoli Workload Scheduler v8.5 .

The Pakistani military claims to have completely taken over the city of Mingora , the largest in Swat , and says that the campaign in Malakand Division will be completed within three days .
ITN has video :
This upload from CCTV gives some of the Pakistani military ’s press conference :
There is an urgent need for the fighting to end soon , so that people can return to their homes and aid can reach the dispossessed .
The monsoon , or rainy season , is coming , and with impromptu rivulets springing up , there will be danger of cholera and other water - borne diseases among the refugees living in tent cities with no proper sewage .
Aljazeera English reports on the condition of the 3000 Sikhs who have been displaced from Swat by the fighting .
There is speculation that the Pakistani military may turn next to Taliban strongholds in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas .
The Taliban are not sitting on their hands waiting .
They attacked a government military outpost in South Waziristan on Saturday .
The military claims to have driven them off and to have killed 40 of them in the process .
Meanwhile , trouble is brewing to the west .
Iran summoned Pakistan ’s ambassador over evidence that a Sunni rebel group , Jundullah , was responsible for bombing a Shiite mosque in Zahidan .
Zahidan is largely Baluch in ethnicity , not Persian , and most Baluch are Sunnis .
They often chafe under Shiite rule .
The small province of Sistan and Baluchistan has a population of 2.2 million ( Iran ’s population is over 70 million ) , and is one of the poorest and least developed in the country .
Small separatist groups , which seek safe haven on the Pakistan side of the border , have operated for some time .
Iranian leaders are hinting that they think the United States was behind the mosque bombing .
Aljazeera English has video on the mosque bombing :
Iranian fears of US meddling in its ethnic relations are not completely unfounded .
Representative Jane Harman ( D - Cal ) has called for the break - up of Iran , apparently influenced by the thinking of Israeli hawks on this issue .
Harman has been accused of trying to get the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee by intervening to stop the prosecution of two men accused of espionage on behalf of Israel , for which she was to be rewarded by wealthy backers of the Israel lobbies .
Pakistan itself has a problem with its Baluch minority , which feels it does not get its fair share of the country ’s resources .
The government is pledging more aid .

It seems that some more details on the capabilities of the newly launched Palm Pre and on its webOS platform have made it into the wild , and among them the fact that the handset can easily run unsigned firmware , a piece of information coming from the iPhone developer Steven Troughton - Smith .
A wide range of other things that the handset is capable of have made it into the wild as well , though it seems that some hacking skills are required to be able to access some of them .
A lot of details on the Pre can be found on Pre dev wiki , and one of them is that original NES Nintendo emulation is possible on the device .
According to a guy over at the Pre / webOS dev wiki , there are a few steps that need to be followed , a few recompile and configuration instructions , an all will be there on the handset .
It all starts with the installation of a native Linux version of the FCEUltra NES emulator from within a Debian chroot , and continues as described here .
At the same time , the Palm Pre seems to hide other functionalities that have not been unveiled just yet , at least not officially , and among them we have a call duration labeling system for the call log , a feature that has been fully developed and installed on the mobile phone , though it seems that it comes disabled right from the start .
For what it 's worth , it might not come as a surprise if Sprint decided to turn it off on purpose , so that people used more minutes as they did n't have a specific counter to show how much they had left .
Another hidden feature that Palm Pre seems to come to the market with is the capability to add and delete pages in the launcher .
Again , this seems to be another feature that has been completely developed and included with the device , though it is rather uncertain why it has been disabled as well .
For what it 's worth , Palm might prep some further enhancements of the launcher as it was supposed to come along with them , yet these are just suppositions at the moment .
More on these features of the Pre , and not only , can be found here .
TEHRAN  Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , sternly cut off any compromise over the nation ’s disputed elections on Friday .
In a long and hard - line sermon , he declared the elections valid and warned of violence if demonstrators continue , as they have pledged , to flood the streets in defiance of the government .
Opposition leaders who failed to halt the protests , he said , “ would be responsible for bloodshed and chaos . ”
The tough words seemed to dash hopes for a peaceful solution to what defeated candidates and protesters call a fraudulent election last week , plunging Iran into its gravest crisis since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 .
“ Flexing muscles on the streets after the election is not right , ” he said , before tens of thousands of angry supporters at Tehran University .
“ It means challenging the elections and democracy .
If they do n’t stop , the consequences of the chaos would be their responsibility . ”
But opposition leaders , who stayed home Friday , called for yet another huge rally on Saturday afternoon , setting the stage for a possible showdown between protesters and security forces , perhaps a violent one .

' The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness .
This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs ; when he first appears he is a protector . '

' Wherever is found what is called a paternal government , there is found state education .

A recurring theme among some of the libertarians with whom I interact is :
How can we bring freedom and liberty to pass more quickly ?
How can we mobilize our efforts to topple the coercive state , starting now ?
One might also ask why these pleas always have an inherent collectivist bent .
Why must ' we ' do anything ?
I 've written about this quest before , although contrary to popular belief , I am under no illusion that a fully - anarchic , i.e. , stateless , society would be a utopia .
That 's not even the point !
In fact , I do n't even care one way or the other .
( I am not an advocate of freedom for utilitarian reasons . )
The unspoken belief seems to be that freedom and liberty arise from strategic planning .
( After pretty much every essay I get published , I receive a note from some well - meaning soul who has the next can 't - miss new strategy that will topple the State by the end of the week . )
While one could argue that much of the prose on Internet sites such as this one is similarly intended , I would disagree .
What I attempt to do here , and what I see others doing here , is exploring the fullness of the libertarian paradigm .
That paradigm is based upon individual choices made without aggression upon others .
It is only when one 's choices infringe directly upon others that anyone should have a genuine concern .
Generally speaking then , the focus is within , not without .
Education is a primary goal .
Philosophy is the primary focus .
Borrowing from Stephen Covey , many people seem overly concerned with changing and / or fixing the world , despite the fact that their bedroom closet might more urgently need attention .
As an aside , I wo n't venture into the fallacy of the commons ( or even the tragedy of the commons ) right now , because this essay wo n't be long enough .
Suffice it to say that the bleeding - heart tendency to impose one 's beliefs on everyone else in the name of a third party ' the children , the poor , the homeless , the environment , etc . ' got old for me years ago .
( The subject does deserve some analysis , though .
Maybe I 'll attempt to address it in a subsequent essay . )
During a recent long run , I got to thinking about this issue : Getting to ' real freedom ' and all that .
Amidst my own pondering , something I 'd heard my market anarchist friend and colleague Stefan Molyneux say over and over rang in my thoughts : Freedom begins at home , with you , with that over which you ultimately have the most control .
If you are tied to positive obligations that were thrust upon you coercively , from friends , or from family , or dating back to poor childhood lessons , then worrying about the State is a huge waste of time .
The vital point :
The lessons one uses in direct interaction with those closest to him are reflected back by the society he inhabits , often by the authority paradigm of that society .
Stop , in the Name of the Law !
While I 'm relatively certain that most people were appalled when they read , quite some time ago now , about the 8th grader who was strip - searched for Ibuprofen in California , I fear that if we were to share parenting tactics , our uneasiness with such behavior as that of the vice principal in the story would be more a matter of degree than of morality .
More pointedly :
Have you ever humiliated one of your children or a supposedly close friend to make a point ?
Do you remember ever being humiliated by your parents as they strove to establish dominance and authority over you ?
Have you ever seen an adult humiliated by another adult ?
Agents of the State act in exactly this way , almost universally .
The actions of that police officer in Dallas are but the latest example in long line of repeated scenes form the same shitty movie .
Visit almost any airport and you too can ' enjoy ' similar treatment .
There is a reason why people like Manadel al - Jamadi are treated like sub-humans .
The belief system that informs people like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld ( and all the thugs who have replaced them ) also convinces them that they can take any step , no matter how heinous , to maintain the authority they think they 've been given ' morals and ethics be damned .
The same could be said of Officer Robert Powell , the Dallas cop noted in the story linked above .
According to Business Daily 's Mark Weisenmiller , quoting from Jane Mayer 's ' Dark Side , ' Jamidi 's last few minutes on Earth were not pleasant :
Jamadi was driven first to an Army base for debriefing , where the US Navy SEALs punched , kicked , and struck him with their rifle muzzles for some 20 minutes .
Weisenmiller goes on to say :
Jamadi was later interrogated by CIA operatives at Abu Ghraib prison , where he was hung up by his wrists , and subsequently killed .
This is an extreme example , but it points to what I believe is a general trend .
How can one protect freedom by taking it away from someone else , without regard for basic morality ?
Here 's a video of a sheriff 's deputy ' laying the wood ' to a suspect in an undercover drug bust .
While most freedom advocates would label such behavior as both heinous and dastardly , I would be willing to bet that there are people reading this column who feel , conversely , that punishment such as spanking , slapping , or other physical infringements are sometimes appropriate .
( A relative of mine told me that Plaxico Burress deserves whatever he gets , for the heinous infraction of carrying a gun without the state - mandated paperwork . )
My question : How does one decide ?
Here 's the thing :
If you can punish a slave to your heart 's content when he's ' yours , ' why would n't he take the same approach when he gets the chance , if and when the tables are turned ?
It is this psychological phenomenon that made ' straw bosses ' so effective during the times of chattel slavery in the U.S. Similarly , it is this psychological phenomenon that supports putting the child who is the biggest behavior problem in charge while the teacher is out of the room .
Further , and maybe more worrisome is this :
At what point does the type of heinous behavior and treatment of prisoners at places like Abu Ghraib become commonplace in detention centers in the U.S. ?
( Hell , for all I know , it 's already happening . )
At what point will the punishment for previously - minor offenses migrate up towards the death penalty , like some episode of Star Trek gone terribly off - track ?
We already have people in the U.S. serving prison time for the offense of lying .
When an agent of the State believes that his orders justify the most basic mistreatment of his fellow man , it 's only a hop , skip , and jump to enemy combatants on home soil ' and I 'm not talking about only people who look like Muslims ' being treated the same way .
If the Milgram Experiments and the Stanford Prison Experiments taught us anything , it 's that people will follow orders ' naked authority ' to almost any end , despite data and indications ( and even signals from conscience ) to the contrary .
It is this seminal truth that guarantees that the State , any state , no matter how constructed , no matter who is ' elected ' to run it , no matter what documents supposedly justify its creation and protect those under its control , will , in time , become a bubbling cesspool of rights infringement and totalitarian conduct .
He That Treats Others as a Child Will Himself Be Treated Like a Child ?
Do lessons learned early in one 's life , both in the home and at school , drastically negatively affect the ability of a society to embrace liberty and freedom ?
Examining childhood lessons , some would say we over - protect our children .
I tend to agree .
Says one pundit :
Fears regarding safety and litigation have resulted in playgrounds that are unchallenging and unappealing to young people .
Parents are obsessively concerned with protecting their children and this is leading to their offspring not developing the resilience and physical skills that they need .
While one might argue about how much actual resilience is developed on the playground , and I do n't care to do so , few would argue ( I hope ) with the negative effect of the creeping sheep - like treatment the State gives its citizenry .
The State systematically over - protects its citizens , to very negative effect .
The State is composed of people with beliefs .
How much of this penchant toward over - protection stems from ideas developed during childhood only later to be implemented ?
One could certainly blame public education for much of this problem , but that might also be a convenient scapegoat .
One could also suggest that such behavior ' protectionism versus freedom 'is endemic in humans .
No matter how one learns such lessons , one thing is undeniable : the State treats each of us as children because too many of us believe that such behavior is appropriate .
More troubling , we ourselves practice this behavior .
For example , focusing on one specific area , and returning again to children and family , almost everyone has heard the phrase : ' Spare the rod , spoil the child . '
I 've heard it more times than I care to remember .
( In full disclosure , I also believed it , or so I thought , for far longer than I 'd care to admit . )
I do n't intend to debate the morality of corporal punishment .
Instead , I wish to place it in the same moral context as similar punishments meted out by agents of the State .
Ironically , while getting my periodic dose of The Blog of Tim Ferriss , of ' The 4 - Hour Work Week ' fame , I came across a fascinating post from a woman who ' escaped ' from her Amish sect .
In the comments of response to her story one can find , among several interesting musings , a discussion of this supposedly Biblically - derived phrase which is generally used to justify physical punishment of children .
The fascinating tidbit was this :
The Bible does n't actually contain that phrase .
The sentiment is apparently a paraphrase of Proverbs 13:24 , which says :
He that spareth his rod hateth his son : but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes .
While I 'm certainly no Biblical scholar , it seems to me a bit of a self - fulfilling prophesy to use that single verse as a justification for physical abuse .
Back on Ferriss 's blog , a poster simply shown as ' Betsy ' offered what I believe is the most humane ( and libertarian ) translation of that verse :
' Spare the rod and spoil the child ' is actually analogous to the rod of the shepherd .
It 's really a beautiful , sentimental teaching that has been totally perverted by some .
The poster went on :
A good shepherd never beats the sheep , but uses the rod to guide them with a gentle touch .
That this homily should justify child abuse is the exact opposite of its intended meaning , which is 'by failing to guide your child with love and instilling discipline ( not punishment ) in a consistent and gentle way , you ruin the child 's chances of successfully functioning in relationships and society as a whole . '
Indeed !
This sentiment seems to resonate with the non-aggression axiom .
How can the thugs with whom so many of us deal claim to be protecting anyone from anything ?
( They certainly are n't gently guiding anyone , either . )
Here 's the real irony :
The people who take actions such as those police officers or that vice principal , on behalf of the State , very likely learned those lessons at home or at school , as children themselves .
Each time one teaches those closest to him from this playbook , he deepens the chasm between freedom and the routine acceptance of the State 's naked authority .
He also lengthens the time it will take to fill that chasm .
Frank Herbert , the author of Dune , is credited with saying :
If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual , it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master .
The wise despot , therefore , maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual .
There is an important corollary to this insight .
If you think of others as helpless and ineffectual , you will erect systems ' often despotic systems ' designed , so you think , to help those people overcome their helplessness .
As a result , you will only enslave them .
In the effort , you will eventually enslave yourself as well .
Please note that this is true no matter the supposedly objective evidence one uses to justify the treatment , be it age , race , gender , culture or something else .
Conclusion
One of the most interesting theories I have ever heard regarding freedom came from Molyneux during one of many discussions .
He asserted that much of the damage to the fabric of voluntary interaction in society stemmed from violent , coercive behavior in the family unit .
I admit that this hypothesis initially took me aback .
( With apologies to Dune , I guess my imperial conditioning was strong . )
Honestly though , the assertion that family violence is all too common is not worthy of much debate .
If one can't see the similarity among how a TSA screener treats an airline passenger ; how a teacher or principal treats a student ; and how far too many parents treat their children ' well , freedom and liberty are much further away than I could ever hope .
( Of course , the parent who really wants to prepare his children for well - practiced performance during airport screening can obtain a Playmobil Security Check Point toy .
Start them young ! )
C.S. Lewis was prescient when he said :
Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive .
It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies .
The robber baron 's cruelty may sometimes sleep , his cupidity may at some point be satiated ; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience .
While it 's neither my place nor my goal to advise anyone about how to raise their children , several observations seem reasonable .
These observations seem particularly germane to the statist authority paradigm and from where it seems to emanate .
Whether it 's letting a child out of the house without prior written permission and accompanying signed documents , selecting the foods your son or daughter can eat , without discussion or education , or ( my personal favorite ) slapping your child in the mouth for being sassy , the similarities remain clear .
Anyone who thinks such practices make sense probably should n't be too aghast if the State seeks to forcibly protect them from transfats .
Neither should they be surprised when somebody gets tased for not kowtowing to some random person wearing a uniform .
These examples occupy different social contexts but exemplify strikingly similar moral content .
Krishnamurti pointed out the truth when he said :
Your parents are frightened , your educators are frightened , the governments and religions are frightened of your becoming a total individual , because they all want you to remain safely within the prison of environmental and cultural influences .
I 'd say it 's about time we each break out of that prison .
Sure , the State is a huge problem , but the State is just people .
The treatment we practice , the treatment we allow , and the treatments we will receive are inexorably linked .
Maybe liberty is a learned behavior and maybe we all need to change the lessons we allow and practice ?
And now , if you 'll excuse me , my bedroom closet needs attention .
The British Humanist Association ( BHA ) has today commented on a Court of Appeal judgment that has found the admissions criteria of the Jewish Free School ( JFS ) in breach of the Race Relations Act 1976 .
The Court of Appeal found that the qualification for admission to the school is a test of ethnicity and not religion and therefore that JFS has discriminated on racial grounds in its admissions .
The BHA , which intervened in the High Court case against the school in 2008 and in the Court of Appeal , says the case illuminates the wide discrimination in admissions that state - funded ‘ faith schools ’ believe they are permitted to employ .
Andrew Copson , BHA Director of Education and Public Affairs , said , ‘JFS will admit pupils that are not religiously Jewish – they can be atheists or Muslims or Christians – as long as their mother is Jewish .
It is that criterion of ethnicity that is contrary to the Race Relations Act .
The judgment makes clear that even though there may be a religious motivation for doing so , discrimination against children in admissions on racial grounds is illegal under any circumstances . ’
‘ It is our position that there can be no justification for discrimination on racial or religious grounds in admissions to any state - maintained school .
Even where schools do legally discriminate on religious grounds , this can lead to ethnic , socio-economic and religious segregation of pupils in practice and create wider problems for social cohesion and equality .
All state - maintained schools should be held to the same standards of equality and non-discrimination in the way they operate as each other and be inclusive , and that means an end to religious discrimination in admissions , in the curriculum and in the staffing of our schools . ’

Nitric oxide may play a key role in helping brain cells communicate Scientists believe a molecule which controls blood pressure and male erections may also have a profound impact on the brain .
The University of Leicester team believe nitric oxide may change the way we think and hear .
They hope studying it could potentially lead to new treatments for migraine , epilepsy , Alzheimer 's disease and chronic pain .
The research is funded by the Medical Research Council .
This prompts the question ' Why is a molecule that can produce penile erections necessary in the brain ? '

The role of nitric oxide in erections was made famous by the discovery that its effect can be increased by anti-impotence drugs such as Viagra .
It is thought that it functions as a " signalling " molecule , helping the body 's cells to communicate with each other .
And it is known that enzymes which aid the synthesis of nitric oxide are active in the brain cells .
Complex communication Researcher Adam Tozer said : " This prompts the question ' Why is a molecule that can produce penile erections necessary in the brain ? '
" It is hoped that this research will go some way to solving the complexity of communication between brain cells , and therefore provide openings for therapeutic strategies against debilitating conditions .
" It will also help to shed light on communication in the healthy brain and this will enable a greater understanding of how we think . "
The Leicester team will focus on the junctions - or synapses - between cells that enable them to " talk " to each other .
They will examine how nitric oxide can influence this communication .
There is evidence to suggest that high levels of nitric oxide have a toxic effect , and may trigger serious brain diseases , such as Alzheimer's .
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust said : " It will be interesting to find out what nitric oxide does in the brain , and if it has any role in Alzheimer's .
" This study may help researchers understand how the brain works and how nerve cells communicate with each other .
" Understanding our thought processes and the brain is crucial to understanding and defeating diseases that affect it . "

Introduction
Welcome to part 2 of the Essential Firefox Extensions And Tips – A Comprehensive Guide series .
In this article I ’m going to describe a number of time saving pragmatic extensions that make me a better , faster , more efficient browser user ( browserer ? ) .
Pragmatic Extensions
All - in - One Gestures introduces customizable gestures for all kinds of actions .
To perform a gesture , hold the right ( by default ) button and move the mouse in the specified direction , drawing the needed shape .
Btw , I believe Opera has gestures without any extensions , so Opera users should feel right at home using All - in - One Gestures .
I use it mostly for 3 things : history back / forward and close tab ( see below ) .
Once you start using gestures , there is no going back .
Download Statusbar is a handy extension that will show your downloads on a dedicated bar right above the status bar .
It also adds a much needed “ Delete from system ” option to each download ( why , Firefox , would you not give me an option to delete my downloads at all ? ) .
The Download Statusbar only shows up if there ’s at least one download not dismissed yet .
Double clicking on a finished file will both launch and remove it from the bar .
Running downloaded files without saving them is probably the only Internet Explorer feature I actually missed , until I found OpenDownload that is .
This extension will give you an option to launch a download upon completion in addition to just saving it .
I do n’t have to worry about finding and deleting it from my system later as it goes to Firefox ’s temporary folder .
This extension is very powerful and versatile .
It controls various aspects of the browser tabs , windows , session , and mouse .
Here are the settings I find useful :
open links that open in a new window in a new tab instead
open all javascript popups in tabs ( I hate popups )
in fact , I enable the single window mode , in which all attempts to open a new window – by webpages or by you , including starting a new Firefox – will be redirected to a new tab
highlight unread tabs , which would italicize the tab titles of pages that had something new loaded since you last opened them
show progress meter on tabs
close tab button on all tabs ( instead of a single one on the right side )
hide the new tab button that occupies extra space
customize the tab menu options
Here are some option screens :
The google toolbar is historically sort of a must for me .
It adds a couple of nice features on top of the default search box and frees the latter , so that I can set it to another search engine ( IMDB in my case ) .
With the amount of searching one does on google daily , the sheer number of clicks and keystrokes saved will be in the thousands .
Daily .
I search a lot , OK ?
In addition to providing an always present search bar , the toolbar carries a number of useful features , such as live search suggest , instant PageRank ( unneeded if you install SEO Toolbar or SearchStatus ) , search Gmail and News buttons ( and many others ) , clickable search terms good for in - page search , highlighting of the said terms , a simple autofill ( though I use an irreplaceable AI Roboform instead ) , spell check ( Firefox has one built - in now ) , translate ( I use the gTranslate extension instead ) .
All in all , one can do without google toolbar , depending on the needed functionality .
Do n’t be afraid to install more toolbars than you need at any given time as you can always hide the ones you do n’t want to see by right clicking the top menu bar :
Linkification is a really pragmatic extension .
It hyperlinks any url - looking strings that are n’t already hyperlinked .
Take a look .
Linkification off :
Linkification on :
The extension has a variety of options to satisfy even savvy users but I found that defaults work really well .
If for some reason you want to momentarily turn off linkification , just tap the button in the tray and the page will revert to its original form .
By the way , if you really want to put it to the test , install it and head over to the comprehensive test case list .
Greasemonkey is the most versatile extension available for Firefox , as it ’s essentially a whole framework for scripts that can manipulate any aspect of any page .
Head over to userscripts.org and take a look at the myriads of scripts written and submitted by other Greasemonkey users .
Still not clear what these can do ?
Let me list some that I use and their brief functionality :
Digg Top 10 Direct – automatically rewrites the digg ’s top 10 links to go straight to the articles , instead of the digg comment page .
Clicking on the digg icon still goes to the comments page though , and I think this is the ideal functionality .
Google Image Relinker – rewrites google image search urls to go directly to the corresponding images rather than the page they were found on .
YousableTubeFix – adds a small smart menu that dynamically shows which qualities a given youtube video is available in and automatically picks the best one , adds download links to the each quality ( FLV and MP4 ) , resizes the player to your liking , and a few other things .
It is also quite customizable .
The now world famous Troy 's Twitter Script that I reviewed a few week ago – it does everything Twitter currently does n't , including Autocomplete , Auto URL Expansion , Auto URL Shortener , RT Button , Nested Replies , Inline Media Embed , Search Tabs , and more .
AideRSS Google Reader Integration – adds AideRSS feed rank to each entry in Google Reader , which allows eyeballing more important articles within a few seconds of seeing a feed .
Also available as a separate extension for those not using Greasemonkey .
Show MyIP does exactly what it says : it displays your current IP .
What I like about it is that it queries for it on demand , after you left or right click the icon .
This approach avoids unnecessary queries going around .
-> ->
What I do n’t like about it is that there seems to be no way to copy this IP to clipboard .
Ideally , a right click option would work great ( that ’s the way the next extension ShowIP does it ) .
I left a comment about this fact on the extension ’s page , so hopefully the author will implement it shortly .
Also , if an error occurs , be prepared for some good old German cursing :
ShowIP , in contrast to Show MyIP , actually displays the IP(s ) of the website I ’m currently on .
It then allows me to copy it ( or all of them ) into clipboard and provides quick information links , such as whois , ip2country , and traceroute .
ShowIP is useful for both developers who want to know which dev server they ’re currently working on as well as regular users who are interested in the location or whois of a site they ’re visiting .
If only the country where a site is hosted is needed , then you are probably better off using Flagfox , described in part 3 of the series .
iimmgg.com is a picture hosting site similar to tinypic.com and photobucket.com .
Generally , it allows quick picture uploading with thumbnail creation .
This extension makes this process insanely simple , I ca n’t say enough praise how good my user experience was with this extension .
Check this out .
The extension has 2 modes :
1 . If you right click on a picture , there ’s a single option to upload it to iimmgg.com :
As soon as you click Upload , you are almost immediately redirected to a page on iimmgg.com with your picture and thumbnails already generated .
Swoosh , that was fast .
Internally , the extension sends the user to something like http://www.iimmgg.com/upload.php?u=http%3A//beerpla.net/wp-content/uploads/BenefitsofMUNI_1E7D/image.png&r=about:blank&s=1&t=, which then redirects to the final picture .
2 . If you right click anywhere else on the page , there are now 3 ways to capture an image to iimmgg.com :
Select either of the 3 options : Visible Page , Full Page , or Select Area .
Let ’s say I select Select Area .
A resizable overlay that I can drag it around to select the area I want shows up .
Brilliant .
After I figure out what I want to capture , I click on the Capture Selected Area button in a bar that just showed up ( btw , the styling of both the bar and the selector are very reminiscent of the Web Developer extension ) :
The next and final prompt shows up with the Image Format selection ( PNG – High Quality , JPEG – High Quality , JPEG – Medium Quality , and JPEG – Low Quality ) , SFW selection , and capture name :
Click Capture and upload ( or save to disk , which is not as fun but also useful ) :
Voila – the picture is ready for sharing .
Remove Cookie(s ) for Site does exactly what it says – removes all cookies that belong to a domain and all subdomains of the site you ’re currently on .
Right click anywhere on the page , click Remove Cookie(s ) for Site and the taskbar will update with the number of cookies removed .
->
You can also pull out a nice little button to a location of your choosing , like so :
Oftentimes I do n’t even bother looking for a logout button – deleting all cookies is a lot faster .
Signature , as you probably guessed , inserts a signature into a text form .
It supports as many signatures as you want .
The uses can be versatile , here are just some :
the obvious “ first and last name ” signature
a full signature with your site link which can help in site promotion .
Mine , for example , is Artem
http://beerpla.net
http://twitter.com/ArtemR
disclaimers
coined replies to emails
various addresses
repetitive urls
any other frequently used set of strings that you have to continuously copy - paste
Do n’t use a mouse when inserting a signature .
Due to the fact that Insert Signature conveniently places itself at the top of the menu , it ’s much quicker to use the keyboard button that simulates right click ( most laptops and keyboards have it ) , click down , then right , then select signature , and press Enter .
QuickRestart adds a Restart Firefox option to the File menu .
This is quite handy , especially when you have a lot of extensions and it may take Firefox 30 seconds to shut down .
The only downside of this is that it seems to lose the protected and locked tab properties set by Tab Mix Plus .
Shutting down Firefox and starting it manually does not lose such properties .
This is no longer a problem in the latest Tab Mix Plus version .
Ever seen a comment box this big and got annoyed by the idiot who designed it ?
Fear not , as Resizeable Textarea adds resize capabilities to any text area .
Move the cursor to the bottom or right borders , or the bottom - right corner , and drag all you want :
TryAgain is a great and very simple extension .
It retries loading a failed page up to 5 times instead of just sitting there .
This screenshot explains everything :
View Cookies is a simple extension that adds a Cookies tab to the VIew Page Info box .
The tab allows viewing , removing , and copying cookie info for the site you ’re currently visiting .
There is a number of extensions that do similar things , like Firebug and Remove Cookie(s ) for Site , but I install View Cookies anyway because its functionality makes sense .
Google Gears is a very useful extension , and it ’s a shame that a lot of people do n’t seem to understand what it does .
Think of it as simply a secure local cache ( developed by Google ) .
Quite a few popular websites support Gears , and I think it is best to just give a few examples of actual usage .
One limitation of Gears that I am not sure can be overcome yet is you have to open a Gears - enabled site while you still have Internet connection .
Once it is open , you are free to lose your Internet connection , and Gears will kick in .
This is why I always keep a page with Google Calendar and rememberthemilk open .
gmail.com – gmail rolled out offline email support quite recently , which is the most useful implementation of Gears to date .
wordpress – if you host a wordpress blog , you can opt in to cache a few hundred files in Gears that will speed up the wordpress admin interface .
WordPress calls this Turbo mode .
rememberthemilk.com – RTM , the most advanced and functional TODO list site , offers an excellent implementation of Gears .
If you lose your connection , you are free to create , modify , and delete any tasks you want – all the changes will be synchronized when you go back online .
google reader – the reader can download feed items for offline viewing but the implementation is not very good – you have to explicitly go offline by clicking a button , at which point Gears will download 2000 items .
Installing Gears on its own will technically not do anything for you .
You will need to enable support for each site individually .
For example , Offline gmail is available from the gmail Labs by clicking on in the top right corner .
From a technical standpoint , Gears uses a local SQLite database for storage .
The Gears security model is described here .
GTranslate translates selected text into a language of your choice .
It can be set to autodetect the source language or forced to a specific one .
I must say so far it worked very well and detected the source language automatically without flaw .
Once the translation is received , gTranslate shows it and links to the google translate page :
Additionally , if the selected text is in an editable field , gTranslate will offer an option to replace the selection with its translation :
SearchStatus is a useful and relatively simple SEO extension .
It shows a quick roundup of page rankings for the current page from Google ( PageRank ) , Alexa , and Compete .
This lets me quickly check how popular [ or lame ] the site I ’m on is and keep tabs on my own online properties .
Right clicking each metric grants access to a few useful shortcuts and for the lazy pragmatic , right clicking the little symbol has such links as Show Whois , Show robots .
txt , Show sitemap.xml , and others .
Another not so obvious but useful feature of this extension is the ability to mark rel= ’ nofollow ’ links .
You rightfully obsessed SEO junkies can quickly see which parts of your site leak the valuable link juice and which ones do n’t .
Take a look at these nofollow links that SearchStatus marked with light red background :
This toolbar is probably going to be useful for relatively hardcore SEO fiends as most people would do just fine with the above SearchStatus extension .
The toolbar seems a bit bulky and slow but has a ton of SEO related functionality .
It is , of course , free .
It shows Google PageRank , Yahoo linkdomain , Yahoo page links , DMOZ directory , Yahoo directory , Best of the web directory , Archive.org , Compete uniques , and SEMRush traffic value :
It also links to a bunch of tools , like quantcast analysis , google trends , and alexa :
For a quick , more in - depth , exportable overview , press the info button :
However , the 2 most useful to me features are probably the Rank Checker :
and Compare Sites :
I customized the toolbar and removed the useless search box and a few pointless buttons by dragging them out :
End of Part 2
This marks the end of part 2 in the series .
I expect this page to update pretty often , whenever I find new extensions , so bookmark it using your favorite method by clicking the button below .
The next part in the series ( available soon ) will describe a number of useful web development extensions .
IMPORTANT : Please post comments for this article at the new CYCLELICIOUS 2.0 version of this page .
Glyn sez ,
The UK government 's official anti-terror law watchdog says that the thousands of people are being stopped and searched by the police under counter - terrorism powers simply to provide a racial balance in official statistics .
" I can well understand the concerns of the police that they should be free from allegations of prejudice , " he said .
" But it is not a good use of precious resources if they waste them on self - evidently unmerited searches …
Carlile uses his annual report to endorse complaints from professional and amateur photographers that counter - terror powers are being used to threaten prosecution if pictures are taken of officers on duty .
He said the power was only intended to cover images likely to be of use to a terrorist :
" It is inexcusable for police officers ever to use this provision to interfere with the rights of individuals to take photographs . "
The police had to come to terms with the increased scrutiny of their activities by the public , afforded by equipment such as video - enabled mobile phones .
" Police officers who use force or threaten force in this context run the real risk of being prosecuted themselves for one or more of several possible criminal and disciplinary offences , " he warned .
Any early novelty is long gone .
Time drags and insecurity weighs heavily .
For many of the 11,000 residents of the Sheik Yaseen displacement camp , six weeks in with untold more to go , homesickness and a sense of dislocation are quickly intensifying .
On a breezy day , as the wind whipped up garbage and dirt , a fine dust settling on tents and in eyes , thoughts turned to home .
For most in Sheik Yaseen , that ’s the Swat Valley , a former tourist haven once dubbed “ the Switzerland of Pakistan , ” which they fled when the army launched its offensive against Taliban militants .
Now , as the army prepares to launch a new offensive in the tribal area of South Waziristan , 200,000 temporarily displaced Pakistanis may be added to the estimated 2 million already forced to leave their homes .
Those in this camp say they wish their fate on no one else .
“ Everybody loves their own land , ” says Mian Sedi Jan , a retired driver from Mingora in Swat who does n’t know his exact age -- eightysomething -- but remembers driving to Bombay before Pakistan and India split in 1947 .
As children huddle around him , he whacks at them with a stick for getting too close to his spot on the floor of the tent he shares with his wife .
“ We just want to go home .
It ’s the sweetest place on Earth . ”
The Pakistani government , under pressure from the U.S. and a growing number of its own citizens , sees the human cost as necessary for driving out the Islamic militants who have increasingly threatened state authority , destroyed girls schools and beheaded critics .
At the camp , however , people seem divided on whether the Swat offensive has been worth the huge price in property , lives and inconvenience .
For Mursleen Khan , a 34 - year - old Swat resident , it ’s the peaches that weigh most heavily on his mind .
This is peak harvest time , when the boughs groan under the weight of the sweet fruit , and sharecropper Khan is distraught that fighting has kept him from his orchard , which provides the bulk of his livelihood .
“ I ’m here and they ’re there , ” he says .
“ It ’s about all I can focus on right now . ”
With no work , little distraction and no place to go , many camp dwellers find little to focus on but the unpleasant conditions , and tempers can easily flare .
“ The tent ’s too hot , the kids are uncomfortable , there ’s not enough water , and I have no work , ” says Fazal Rabi , 45 , living in one of the long rows of look - alike tents with his wife , eight daughters and two sons .
“ We want to go home soon , God willing . ”
An ambulance pulls into the camp loaded with three wailing women and the body of a 70 - year - old woman .
The arrival draws a crowd of bored camp dwellers to watch six men carry the corpse to an area behind a plastic tarp .
It takes some shouting and scuffles with the crowd for relatives to gain some privacy in which to grieve .
Even the souls of the dead -- the deceased woman had developed stomach problems and a high fever after her family was forced to flee Mingora -- want to return to Swat , says Sahib Zada , a relative who blamed the death on an overtaxed medical system and move - related stress .
“ We want to bury her in her home village , but the government has blocked the road , ” Zada says .
“ Now we ’ll have to bury her here in the camp .
Ideally , she should enjoy her final rest at home , and it is very disturbing not to see that . ”
Government officials struggling to address the huge humanitarian crisis have announced that displaced people should be able to return to Swat within a week or so .
Those living in tents , however , note that new arrivals daily from Swat speak of continued fighting , hardly ideal conditions for going home .
“ All this uncertainty and confusion creates real mental tension , ” says Sher Ali , 19 , a photocopy shop employee from Mingora .
“ And when we do finally go back , who knows whether we ’ll find our house destroyed by all the fighting . ”
People will return when they feel secure , but that involves more than an end to armed conflict , says Manuel Bessler , Pakistan director of the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
Necessary conditions include the resumption of electricity , water , reliable healthcare and law and order .
“ We ’re not there yet in a lot of places , ” Bessler says .
Given the army ’s use of bombs and the employment of artillery by both sides , people dread the reconstruction needs that may greet their return .
One humanitarian group recently held classes at the camp on carpentry , mixing concrete and other basic building skills .
“ The first thing I ’ll do after getting back is check that my house is n’t wrecked , ” says Fazal Wahel , 37 , a furniture salesman from Mingora , whose family members attended the classes .
“ The second thing I ’ll do is go see my friends .
“ It ’s such a tragedy that our beautiful Swat has suffered so much .
We do n’t want the army .
We do n’t want the Taliban .
All we want is peace . ”

storytelling , technology , website innovation
Sometimes a really cool application comes along that can help an organization tell its story , and you just have to write about it .
This one is a multimedia application for your website and blog called Apture .
I ’ve never seen anything like it , and I think it has enormous possibilities for engaging stakeholders , telling your organization ’s story , conveying information visually , and keeping visitors on your site .
I want to know how your organization will use Apture to its benefit .
What is it ?
I ’ll begin by integrating Apture ’s application right now :
It is an application that you install on your website or blog .
Using Apture , hyperlinks pop up inside the website story or blog post .
You may have already experienced Apture while reading one of the New York Times ’ blogs .
Besides visitors staying on - site , they will experience – right at the moment of clicking – what you are trying to convey .
Apture integrates text , slideshows , maps , video , audio , photos , and the like into your story .
Flightblogger conveys stories using Apture , and I think the application adds levels of understanding to each blog post .
The possibilities of using this application are limited only by one ’s imagination , and I ’d love to hear your ideas .
Here ’s one example :
You are a community arts center .
Your students are about to put on a show , so you post a news story on the website about the upcoming show and also write a blog post about the show .
You link to photos of student artwork , audio and video of the teacher in action , a student ’s video story about taking the class , and the news story about the show that was featured in the local paper .
At the end of the story , you give the address of the show which pops up the location on Google maps .
You ’ve told a story , powerfully , about the impact your organization has had on the teacher , students and community , and asked them to act on it by attending the opening .
And you ’ve done it in one paragraph .
There is an art to storytelling , but I ’m not here to write about that .
What I want to know is – how will you tell your story differently using Apture ?
The UK today condemned al Qaida's " barbaric " murder of a British man kidnapped in Mali over four months ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Edwin Dyer was one of four European tourists taken hostage on January 22 as they returned from a cultural festival .
They were held by the terror movement 's North African wing , known as Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) .
Despite intense behind - the - scenes negotiations by UK and local officials , the hostage - takers claimed today that they had carried out their threat to kill Mr Dyer .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there was " strong reason " to believe this was true .
He said : " I utterly condemn this appalling and barbaric act of terrorism .
My thoughts are with Edwin Dyer 's family .
I offer them the condolences of the whole country . "
Mr Dyer , who had been working in Austria and spoke fluent German , was on holiday in West Africa with German travel operator Oase Reisen .
He was abducted , along with a Swiss couple and a German woman , near the border with Niger after attending a festival of nomad culture at Anderamboukane in Mali .
At first it was believed that the hostage - takers were Tuareg rebels , who have regularly clashed with Mali 's army , but in February AQIM claimed responsibility .
Two of the captives were released in mid-April but days later the terrorists issued an ultimatum , warning they would kill Mr Dyer unless the UK freed radical cleric Abu Qatada within 20 days .

The deadline was extended by 15 days to May 30 , but in the end frantic efforts to secure the safe release of the Briton failed .
In a statement issued today AQIM said : " The British captive was killed so that he , and with him the British state , may taste a tiny portion of what innocent Muslims taste every day at the hands of the Crusader and Jewish coalition to the east and to the west . "
Mr Brown said : " This tragedy reinforces our commitment to confront terrorism .
" It strengthens our determination never to concede to the demands of terrorists , nor to pay ransoms .
" I want those who would use terror against British citizens to know beyond doubt that we and our allies will pursue them relentlessly , and that they will meet the justice they deserve .
" I have regularly discussed this case with the President of Mali - he knows that he will have every support in rooting out al Qaida from his country . "
Foreign Secretary David Miliband pledged that Britain would continue working to secure the release of the Swiss man still being held by the group .
He said : " Hostage - taking and murder can never be justified whatever the cause .
This tragic news is despite the strenuous efforts of the UK team in the UK and Mali , with valuable help from international partners . "
Qatada is currently being held in prison in the UK as he fights a bid to extradite him to Jordan , where he faces terror charges .
The Law Lords ruled in February that he can be deported , but his lawyers are appealing against the verdict , claiming he faces torture if he is returned to the Middle East country .
He was first arrested in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks on America and has been described as " al Qaida 's spiritual leader in Europe " .

“ We see value in combining their local knowledge and distribution with our product expertise , technology and experience with size and scale , ” Bank of America ’s chief executive , Ken Lewis , said as he consummated the deal to purchase a piece of Construction Bank in June 2005 .
Chinese leaders spoke of their great fortune in gaining Wall Street ’s tutelage .
“ We have much to learn from our partner in serving customers and creating shareholder value , ” said Construction Bank ’s chairman , Guo Shuqing .
These days , of course , talk of Bank of America and shareholder value centers on how much of the company its newest shareholder 
Uncle Sam  is destined to own , and whether the bank ’s shares retain any value .
Bank of America ’s expertise with size and scale has expanded to encompass the management of $ 45 billion in bailout funds .
For much of Wall Street , the expertise that once was expected to elevate China ’s financial system increasingly looks like sorcery , or a vast Ponzi scheme in which banks borrowed vast sums , lent to virtually anyone , and used incomprehensible models to convince markets that all was fine .
They scattered low - interest credit cards and home equity loan offers like takeout menus , creating the illusion of prosperity by driving up home values .
In effect , American banks operated not unlike the Chinese banks they were supposed to modernize .
They extracted profits by following a variation of the principle long pursued by their Chinese counterparts : lend without hesitation while extracting your cut , confident that the government is on the hook for the losses .

In China , ventures may be spectacularly unprofitable , yet enrich everyone lucky enough to get a piece .
Developers , for example , construct vacant office buildings as an excuse to borrow from state banks .
They rake off a cut for themselves , pay bribes to the party officials who deliver the land and reward bank functionaries with sumptuous banquets and trips to Macao .
Soon enough , the trophy skyscraper descends into financial disaster , but the developers , bankers and party officials have already extracted their riches , and for long afterward they will still enjoy them .
Kendall Craig Farris ’ website is filled with influential endorsements for the drug prevention program he founded .
Los Angeles City Councilman Bill Rosendahl called them “ amazing tools which our schools and communities desperately need ” and thanked Farris for meeting with him and his staff .
Something went wrong , however , and Farris was arrested Thursday at a Starbucks in El Segundo after Redondo Beach police set up a drug buy over the phone .
Farris , 47 , arrived at the coffeehouse in a taxi , police said .
An undercover officer gave him an envelope containing $ 480 in exchange for methamphetamine and ecstasy tablets , which turned out to be fake , authorities said .
Farris was arrested at 3:40 p.m .
Farris was arraigned Friday on charges of selling a substance that he alleged was drugs .
He is being held on $ 106,500 bail and could not be reached for comment .

Farris , according to his website , was founder of the Over the Wall Foundation in Marina del Rey and a recovering alcoholic and addict .
His mission , he says , is “ to help youth , schools , and families prevent drug and alcohol abuse before it starts , and intervene in any drug abuse which may already have begun . ”
He is the author of “ Drugs , Kids and Crime : Surviving Our Drug Obsessed Culture . ”

UPDATE !
I have it on very good authority that it may have looked a little something like this .
So um , you might notice that I took the week to redesign the site !
I tried to simplify and make the site look more fun .
The old site did n't really scream " FUN TIMES PARTY CENTRAL " , but this new site does it so every way but literally .
One big change is that these here posts are now kept archived .
I went through the old RSSPECT RSS archives to recover a few year 's worth of posts , so if you go back through the archives it 's like they never left !
Also , the T - Rex head at the top now says random phrases from the newer comics too , instead of just the older ones .
THE FUTURE IS NOW .
There may still be some problems on the site : if you notice anything screwy , let me know !
One year ago today : i started this comic with a ghost / android dichotomy , before realizing that zombies fit better .
androids are artificial bodies with artificial souls , and i guess we are all very concerned with whether or not the sheep they dream of are electric ?

House prices dropped further around the world during the year to end - Q1 2009 , as personal consumption expenditure decreased , consumer confidence remained low , credit remained tight and the unemployment rate worsened .
Source : Various series , data descriptions and sources here
The housing crisis contagion reached more countries .
Among the 32 countries in the Global Property Guideâ€™s survey of house prices , 27 recorded price falls during the year to the end of the first quarter of 2009 , in real terms .
The Global Property Guide uses price - changes after inflation , giving a more realistic picture than the ( more upbeat ) nominal figures usually preferred by real estate agents .
During the year to end - Q1 2009 , price falls of more than 10 % occurred in 12 countries , worse than the previously worst - ever year to end of last quarter of 2008 ( 8 price falls above 10 % ) .
However , only 7 countries saw price falls of above 5 % during the single quarter ( i.e. , Q1 2009 ) , versus 8 countries during the previous quarter ( though some individual price declines were much higher during this quarter than in the previous quarter ) .
AMAZING PRICE DECLINES IN LATVIA , DUBAI , AND SINGAPORE
Latvia is in surprisingly deep trouble .
Average apartment prices in Riga declined an astonishing 50 % over a year earlier , to â‚ ¬747 per square metre , with a 30 % drop during the quarter .
Â Â Latvia is in deep recession , with its economy contracting 18 % in Q1 2009 .
Dubaiâ€™s house prices dropped 35 % over a year earlier , and 42 % over a quarter earlier .
Â
Dubaiâ€™s economy is closely tied to the global market .
As uncertainties piled up , demand for properties collapsed .
Â
Many developers have delayed or postponed construction of projects .
Credit has also been tight .
Interest rates have increased , and loan - to - value ratio reductions have been imposed .
Among Asian countries , Singaporeâ€™s housing market suffered the most .
House prices plunged 23 % in real terms over a year earlier , and 13 % over a quarter earlier .
This is the biggest decline since 2000 .
Singapore is heavily dependent on exports .
When the global financial crisis began , demand waned .
In Q1 2009 , Singaporeâ€™s economy contracted by 10.1 % , mainly due to a decline in manufacturing production .

Only four states  Alabama , Alaska , Massachusetts and Oklahoma  do not have laws in place specifically dealing with postconviction DNA testing , and Alabama recently enacted one limited to death row inmates that will become effective soon .
Many states that do allow postconviction testing impose conditions on who may seek it .
Prosecutors often fight hard to deny access to DNA evidence even in states that nominally allow it , saying the prisoner in question had not met the statutory conditions .
Some laws , for instance , do not allow prisoners who have confessed to seek DNA evidence , though false confessions have been common among exonerated inmates .
Other states allow testing only if it was unavailable at the time of trial .
Mr. Neufeld said the logic of Thursday ’s decision might allow constitutional challenges to some of those laws .
In the case from Alaska , District Attorney ’s Office v. Osborne , No. 08 - 6 , Mr. Osborne sought to test biological evidence on a condom found at the crime scene , a snowbank near Anchorage International Airport .
The victim was raped , beaten with an ax handle , shot in the head and left for dead .
But the bullet only grazed her head , and she survived .
Rudimentary DNA testing on the condom in preparation for trial excluded two other suspects and included Mr. Osborne among those who might have committed the crime .
The kind of testing used at the time , Chief Justice Roberts wrote , “ generally cannot narrow the perpetrator down to less than 5 percent of the population . ”

Mr. Osborne ’s trial lawyer decided not to pursue a second kind of DNA testing that was more discriminating .
The lawyer said she feared that the results might further incriminate her client .
After his conviction , Mr. Osborne sued state officials in federal court seeking access to the DNA evidence for a third kind of yet - more - discriminating testing .

TEHRAN , June 27 ( UPI ) --
The troubles for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may not be over even though street protests have been effectively silenced , analysts say .
With opposition leaders saying they will no longer stage rallies without government permission , the direct threat to Ahmadinejad from bloody civil disturbances appears to have passed .
But the president 's foes have been emboldened by the Tehran protests and his road to a second term may be a rough one , The New York Times reported Saturday .

" There has been too much violence to forget about it , " said an expatriate Iranian analyst whom the Times did not identify because he has relatives in Iran and is afraid of reprisals against them .
" There are quite a few people sitting on the fence watching to see which way the wind will blow , " added Ali Ansari , a professor of Iranian history at St. Andrews University in Scotland .
The newspaper said Ahmadinejad 's legitimacy may rest with a third Iranian interest group situated halfway between his camp and that of opposition leader Mir Hussein Mousavi : Pragmatic military and security figures who have competed with Ahmadinejad but are believed to remain close to his chief backer , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Use capital letters for proper nouns .
Avoid them for common nouns .
Proper nouns are the names of things .
That means you use capitals for the names of people , places , months , days of the week , companies and so on .
Do n’t use capitals for common nouns .
People run into difficulty with capitals because there ’s a temptation to use them for important words .
In business writing people often use capitals as a way of avoiding offending someone or something by implying he or it is n’t important .
There is also the question of narcissistic capitals .
Some people think capitals adds authority to the words on a page .
Nothing could be less true .
Writing interesting , flowing prose is the way to win readers .
Another difficulty with capitals is when you write job titles .
Newspapers typically use a capital letter when the title comes directly before a person ’s name but not otherwise .
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key is correct , but it would be the prime minister ’s desk .
This even applies to the queen .
No title gets capitals when it is not used as a proper noun .
In his book Newsman ’s English British newspaper editor Harold Evans says ;
“ Avoid using them unnecessarily .
The Parks Committee , but subsequently the committee .
The South West Regional Hospital Board , but then the hospital board . ”
One piece of advice I had early in my career as a journalist is : “ If in doubt , use lower case unless it looks wrong ” .
Lastly , do not use capital letters for emphasis and avoid writing words in all capitals .
Barbaric companies insist their brand name is always in capitals .
There ’s a good , logical reason why print publishers would limit capitals .
As your eye travels along a line of text , those capitals distract you .
It ’s harder to immediately understand the copy .
This applies as much on - line as in traditional print .

Sorry !
This strip has been sold .
Gotta pay the bills somehow .
A few days ago I was relating the cans - in - a - blanket problem , and retelling the vacuum joke and story to someone who had not yet heard them .
One of my colleagues commented on a problem he had been given during an interview , also involving cans of soda :
You have two cans , one filled with ice and the other with liquid , but otherwise identical .
The cans are rolled down an incline .
Which one reaches the bottom first ?
Much like the previous problem , I think there is a common misconception at play here for some people who get the answer wrong , and I ’ll get to the explanation below .
One of the people in the conversation said his first impulse was the wrong answer , but when we discussed the physics , we all agreed on the solution .
I set up to do a demonstration , though my first attempt was thwarted — I filled up a can with water and popped it in the freezer , hoping the can would be strong enough to hold together and have the ice expand vertically .
It was n’t .
I think the problem being that since ice will freeze from the top down and outside - in , the ice adhered to the can too well to let it expand upward as much as I hoped .
( BTW — Black Cherry Citrus ?
Blecch .
I bought it by accident when they redesigned their color scheme and introduced the flavor )
So I did it again , adding a little bit of water and letting that freeze , repeating the process several times until it was full , and it worked .
Here is the experiment to investigate the problem given above :
You need to a flashplayer enabled browser to view this YouTube video
For those who think that the liquid - filled can will roll more slowly , I think I know what the misconception is : most of us have seen or done the experiment with spinning an egg , and a hard - boiled egg spins readily while the unboiled egg does n’t .
So the intuition is that since liquids do n’t spin readily , the liquid - filled can wo n’t want to roll very fast .
And , as we can see , that ’s wrong .
The reason the intuition is wrong is from a misinterpretation of the reason the unboiled egg does n’t spin — it ’s because it ’s difficult to transfer energy and angular momentum to the liquid by spinning the container ; the coupling between them is weak .
And angular momentum tells you the tendency for something to spin — it only changes when you apply a torque .
With the soda cans it means that the work being done , adding energy ( gravity acts on it , and there is a torque from the friction of the treadmill causing rotation ) but this energy is n’t being added to the liquid , so it must be going into the can itself , which is n’t very massive — almost all of the energy goes into translational kinetic energy .
The frozen water , though , does rotate with the can , so the gravitational potential energy has to be shared between translation and rotation of the can + ice system , so the translational kinetic energy ( and therefore speed ) is smaller .
// MIT Tech TV Countless hours are lost in traffic jams every year .
Most frustrating of all are those jams with no apparent cause — no accident , no stalled vehicle , no lanes closed for construction .
Such phantom jams can form when there is a heavy volume of cars on the road .
In that high density of traffic , small disturbances ( a driver hitting the brake too hard , or getting too close to another car ) can quickly become amplified into a full - blown , self - sustaining traffic jam .
A team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes how and under what conditions such jams form , which could help road designers minimize the odds of their formation .
The researchers reported their findings May 26 in the online edition of Physical Review E. Key to the new study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams , which the researchers call " jamitons , " are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions , says Aslan Kasimov , lecturer in MIT 's Department of Mathematics .
That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s .
The equations , similar to those used to describe fluid mechanics , model traffic jams as a self - sustaining wave .
Variables such as traffic speed and traffic density are used to calculate the conditions under which a jamiton will form and how fast it will spread .
Once such a jam is formed , it 's almost impossible to break up — drivers just have to wait it out , says Morris Flynn , lead author of the paper .
However , the model could help engineers design roads with enough capacity to keep traffic density low enough to minimize the occurrence of such jams , says Flynn , a former MIT math instructor now at the University of Alberta .
The model can also help determine safe speed limits and identify stretches of road where high densities of traffic — hot spots for accidents — are likely to form .
Flynn and Kasimov worked with MIT math instructors Jean - Christophe Nave and Benjamin Seibold and professor of applied mathematics Rodolfo Rosales on this study .
The team tackled the problem last year after a group of Japanese researchers experimentally demonstrated the formation of jamitons on a circular roadway .
Drivers were told to travel 30 kilometers per hour and maintain a constant distance from other cars .
Very quickly , disturbances appeared and a phantom jam formed .
The denser the traffic , the faster the jams formed .
" We wanted to describe this using a mathematical model similar to that of fluid flow , " said Kasimov , whose main research focus is detonation waves .
He and his co-authors found that , like detonation waves , jamitons have a " sonic point , " which separates the traffic flow into upstream and downstream components .
Much like the event horizon of a black hole , the sonic point precludes communication between these distinct components so that , for example , information about free - flowing conditions just beyond the front of the jam can't reach drivers behind the sonic point .
As a result , drivers stuck in dense traffic may have no idea that the jam has no external cause , such as an accident or other bottleneck .
Correspondingly , they do n't appreciate that traffic conditions are soon to improve and drive accordingly .
" You 're stuck in traffic until all of the sudden it just clears , " says Morris .
In future studies , the team plans to look more detailed aspects of jamiton formation , including how the number of lanes affects the phantom traffic jams .
The research was funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research , the National Science Foundation and the ( Canadian ) Natural Science and Engineering Research Council .
The French Constitutional Council has ripped into the new Cr?ation et Internet law which would disconnect repeat online copyright infringers , calling the basic premise unconstitutional .
" Innocent until proven guilty " remains a central principle of French law , and it cannot be bypassed simply by creating a new nonjudicial authority .
Better known as the " three strikes " law , Cr?ation et Internet set up a High Authority in France that would oversee a graduated response program designed to curb online piracy .
Rightsholders would investigate , submit complaints to the High Authority ( called HADOPI , after its French acronym ) , and the Authority would take action .
Warnings would be passed to ISPs , who would forward them to customers ; after two such warnings , the subscriber could be disconnected and placed on a nationwide " no Internet " blacklist .
The law passed on its second attempt — the first was foiled by a few Socialists who staged a bit of parliamentary theater to vote down the bill .
But the Sarkozy government would not be denied , and it got its way a few weeks later .
The law still had to pass muster before the Constitutional Council , however , and this was a potential problem .
The graduated response program was nonjudicial , setting up a separate " administrative " authority , but it performed an essentially judicial function ( not just warning and monitoring , but sanctioning ) .
And the sanction proceedings had a presupposition of guilt ; sure , there was an appeal mechanism , but the burden of proof was on the Internet user to show that she had not been uploading those Stephan Eicher tracks .
In its ruling , this was precisely the issue that the Council zeroed in upon , going all the way back to the French Revolution to stress the wrongheadedness of the HADOPI approach .
" Moreover , whereas under section nine of the Declaration of 1789 , every man is presumed innocent until has has been proven guilty , it follows that in principle the legislature does not establish a presumption of guilt in criminal matters , " wrote the Council .
This basic principle applies " to any sanction in the nature of punishment , even if the legislature has left the decision to an authority that is nonjudicial in nature . "
The court also made a strong statement about freedom of speech : " Freedom of expression and communication is so valuable that its exercise is a prerequisite for democracy and one of the guarantees of respect for other rights and freedoms and attacks on the exercise of this freedom must be necessary , appropriate and proportionate to the aim pursued . "
Disconnection would appear to be a disproportionate penalty — a claim often made by MEPs at the European Parliament who have repeatedly voted to make such sanctions illegal unless overseen by a judge .
To call the decision a " bombshell " is to do a grave disservice to bombshells everywhere .
The French law has been a showpiece for the recording industry 's worldwide graduated response campaign , and it 's been one of the toughtest such laws proposed anywhere .
The Council 's censure appears to mean that disconnections — a penalty that the industry says is essential — must be treated like court cases , not " you 're probably guilty " administrative proceedings .
That , of course , was precisely what such systems were set up to avoid , since suing individual file - swappers has n't worked so well and costs unbelievable amounts of time and money .
With MEPs and its own Consitutional Council condemning the law , the Sarkozy government may need to drop its full - throated support for the approach found in Cr?ation et Internet — support that has been seen both on the national and European level .
It could also mean the resignation of French Culture Minister Christine Albanel , who was responsible for pushing the bill through the National Assembly and who threatened to resign if it did n't pass .
She will hold a press conference in Paris this afternoon to discuss the decision .
There was no grieving from open Internet groups like La Quadrature du Net , which posted its response in the form of a picture .

China stepped up its war on Internet censorship Thursday , slamming Google China for allowing pornographic content to seep into the nation and threatening to punish the search engine .
" Google China 's website has not installed filters to block pornography in accordance with the laws and regulations of our nation , " the China Internet Illegal Information Reporting Centre ( CIIRC ) said in a statement .
" A lot of overseas Internet pornographic information has spread into our nation by way of this website , seriously violating laws and regulations . "
The statement was read on state - run broadcaster China Central Television 's evening news bulletin .
The issue was also the main item on the " Focus " current events programme that follows the news .
" CIIRC strongly condemns Google China and demands that it thoroughly clean up the pornographic and vulgar content on its sites , " the centre said .
" CIIRC calls on concerned departments in charge of implementing the law to punish ( Google China ) in accordance with the law . "
The reporting centre was jointly set up in 2004 by the State Council , China 's cabinet , the Ministry of Police and the Ministry of Information Industry , the nation 's Internet watchdog .
No Google representative was immediately available to give comment on the accusations .
The move comes after China vowed to crack down on Internet content that it deems unhealthy , including pornography and anti-government information .
In recent days , computer makers were told by the government that all personal computers sold from July 1 must be shipped with anti-pornography software , a move that has led to widespread concern both in and outside China .
China has the world 's largest online population at nearly 300 million web users .
Authorities have a history of blocking websites they deem politically unacceptable or offensive , a censorship system that has been dubbed the " Great firewall of China " .

Although the Suns initially held out for a better package , they settled for a deal that gives them little more than financial relief .
Phoenix will receive two marginal rotation players , the past - his - prime center Ben Wallace and the swingman Sasha Pavlovic , as well as $ 500,000 and a future second - round pick .
If the Suns waive Pavlovic , whose contract is only partly guaranteed , they can save about $ 9 million in salary and luxury - tax payments .
They could save millions more if Wallace decides to retire and accept a buyout , a possibility he has entertained .
“ We felt it was important to make a move to gain financial flexibility so that we can make this transition to re-establish ourselves as a basketball team , ” Steve Kerr , the Suns ’ general manager , said on the team ’s Web site .
“ We have to get to a point where we can make basketball decisions rather than financial ones . ”
Where this leaves the Suns is unclear .
They have been dangling Amar’e Stoudemire , their other All - Star big man , in trade discussions all year .
Their All - Star point guard , Steve Nash , is entering the last year of his contract and has been notably disconcerted by the team ’s direction .
Once a perennial contender in the West , Phoenix has traded away three essential players  O’Neal , Boris Diaw and Raja Bell  since December .
They traded Shawn Marion , once a core player , 16 months ago , in the deal for O’Neal .
If the Suns embark on a wholesale rebuilding effort , Stoudemire and Nash could be the next to go .
Nash has openly entertained the idea of reuniting with Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni  with whom he had his best years in Phoenix  if not via trade then as a free agent in 2010 .
The trade also has implications for Orlando and the Boston Celtics , the last two Eastern Conference champions , who will now be revisiting their defensive schemes to cope with O’Neal , the most dominant big man of his era , and James , perhaps the best all - around player in the league .
Enlarge By David McNew , Getty Images Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said she regrets that some people took offense over an agency intelligence report warning that returning war veterans could be susceptible to recruitment by right - wing extremists .
OKLAHOMA CITY ( AP )  Top Department of Homeland Security officials on Sunday defended an agency intelligence assessment warning that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan could be susceptible to recruitment by right - wing extremists , though one said it should have been " more tightly written and presented . "
Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said on CNN's State of the Union that she regrets that some people took offense over the report , but added that " a number of groups far too numerous to mention " were targeting returning veterans to carry out domestic terrorism attacks .
She said the warning report , which went out to American law enforcement agencies two weeks ago , was consistent with earlier reports .
The report , which also warned of veterans engaging in lone acts of violence , was criticized by conservatives who called it offensive and said the agency should apologize to veterans .
Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute , in Oklahoma City for ceremonies marking the 14th anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , said it is wrong to characterize the report 's distribution as an attempt to insult veterans but acknowledged that " it should have been more tightly written and presented . "
Lute , an Army veteran and former assistant secretary - general of the United Nations in charge of peacekeeping operations , said the agency was taking " very seriously " the threat that right - wing domestic extremists could use the lagging U.S. economy and the election of the country 's first black president to recruit members .
Lute said the agency did n't focus on any one group because of its members ' beliefs or backgrounds but that it was more interested in the likelihood that a group might turn to violence .
The report mentioned Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Timothy McVeigh , a decorated Army veteran convicted of detonating an explosives - laden truck in front of the federal building , killing 168 people and injuring hundreds .
McVeigh was executed in 2001 , and his former Army buddy Terry Nichols is serving multiple life prison terms for his role in the attack .
Lute said her agency assesses all potential hazards and that the Oklahoma City bombing was " a reminder to the country that we can't be complacent . "

Robert Worth and Nazili Fathi of the New York Times write :
The developments followed a weekend of growing tension .
On Sunday , word spread that more than 100 prominent opposition members had been detained ; riots erupted in Tehran and other cities ; and the triumphant incumbent hinted that his top challenger risks punishment for questioning the result .
At the same time , two of the three opposition candidates and a clerical group issued fresh statements requesting an annulment of Friday 's ballot , which gave a lopsided victory to Mr. Ahmadinejad , a conservative who has become a polarizing figure at home and abroad .
It was unclear how much further Mr. Ahmadinejad 's adversaries were willing or able to go in challenging the result .
But supporters of the opposition candidates skirmished with baton - wielding riot police officers on the edges of a government - organized victory rally in Tehran .
There were also reports of riots in other Iranian cities , and the protests were echoed by Iranians demonstrating against the election results in Washington and in several European capitals .
Mr. Ahmadinejad dismissed the opposition 's allegations of fraud , saying that the victory had given him a bigger mandate than ever .
He criticized Mr. Moussavi , the main opposition candidate - who remained at home on Sunday with security forces closely monitoring his movements - in a veiled statement that many here saw as a threat .
" He ran a red light , and he got a traffic ticket , " Mr. Ahmadinejad said of his rival during a news conference at the presidential palace .
The hard core anti-choice forces are a determined lot .
They seem to think they have complete control over Republican Senators ( and that ’s probably true in some cases ) .
But the GOP Senators are letting down these single issue zealots by not blocking the nomination of Kathleen Sebelius for Secretary of Health and Human Services :
Conservative groups that oppose Sebelius ’s confirmation are displeased with their erstwhile allies in the Senate – and say they will make their voices heard while lawmakers are in their home states for the current two - week recess .
“ I think it ’s appalling , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , the president of the Susan B. Anthony List , a fundraising operation for candidates who oppose abortion .
“ I think this is why Republicans are in the minority . ”
“ They know we care and still there was nothing said , ” Dannenfesler said .
“ Mum was the word . ” Wendy Wright , president of Concerned Women for America , described the GOP ’s silence on Sebelius ’s pro-abortion - rights record as “ baffling ” and said senators have shown they have a “ tin ear ” to concerns of the anti-abortion movement .
“ We ’ve not gotten a good answer about why they ’re being negligent , ” Wright said .
“ What I hate more than anything is pretending an issue does n’t exist , ” said Dannenfelser .
Interestingly , another GOP puppet master , Grover Norquist disses the anti-choice activists by throwing a little reality on the situation :
Republican senators may be keeping their powder dry because Democrats have enough votes in the Senate to confirm Sebelius regardless of their opposition , Norquist said .
Moreover , Norquist said , the GOP knows that the Department of Health and Human services commands vast sums of money senators want spent in their states .
“ If you ’re a Republican , why throw a punch at her when she has all the funding to throw around ? ”
That sounds like the anti-tax Republicans are n’t too keen on the social issue conservatives .
Grover ’s quotes make the anti-choicers sound like naive nitwits who really do n’t get it .
A battle between those two factions in the Republican party would be a battle worth watching .
President Obama is facing complaints from big-city mayors and county politicians that parts of the economic stimulus package are shortchanging their constituents .
Vice President Joe Biden has been holding private conference calls on the stimulus with elected officials from around the country , some of whom have been telling him that metropolitan regions are losing out to rural areas in the competition for stimulus money .
That argument tracks a report released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors that concluded that cities have gotten a disproportionately small share of stimulus money set aside for road and other transportation improvements .
Harry Montoya , a commissioner in Santa Fe County , N.M. , took part in a phone call with Biden earlier in the month and said he told the vice president that “ the dollars are not trickling down to the local county governments regarding spending for projects that we have that are shovel - ready : road , water and wastewater projects . ”

Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels , newly installed president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors , gave a speech to the association on June 15 saying he would ask his fellow mayors to “ critically review every aspect ” of the $ 787 - billion stimulus package .
“ In an effort to jump - start the economy , the federal government relied on old formulas that left behind our metropolitan areas , ” said Nickels , a Democrat .
“ That was a mistake . ”
The mayors commissioned a report looking at a pot of $ 18 billion set aside for transportation .
When the report was released this month , the 85 most populous metropolitan areas had received $ 8.8 billion -- or 48 % of the total .
Yet those same areas account for 63 % of the U.S. population and 73 % of the gross domestic product , the report said .
Chicago would need to get another $ 250 million in stimulus transportation funds to reach a level that reflects its contribution to the Illinois economy , the report calculated .
In Ohio , Cleveland and Cincinnati account for 40 % of the total economy yet received less than 5 % of the transportation stimulus funds earmarked for the state .

Mayors contend the stimulus relies too heavily on long - standing government formulas that make states the primary conduit for the cash .
Once the money is funneled to states , governors and legislatures dole it out disproportionately to rural areas that have amassed political clout , mayors say .
“ Funding went directly to states , ” said Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper , a Democrat .
“ And many , many states have a bias toward funding rural projects .
That has to do with the political makeup of state legislatures and governors . ”
Steve Ellis , vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense , said that “ across the board , the stimulus is not a smart program .
Essentially , we ’re shoveling cash out , using the same old shovels we ’ve had in the past .
It does n’t surprise me that some urban communities that may have a greater need are disadvantaged simply because the playing field is tilted toward benefiting more states and the largest number of congressional districts . ”
Asked about the mayors ’ study , a senior White House official cautioned against placing too much focus on any one slice of stimulus .

“ It ’s a fallacy to look at only one program , ” said Edward DeSeve , special advisor to the president .
“ That represents about $ 18 billion of a $ 787 - billion program .
And although it ’s an important project , it certainly is n’t a large one -- not the predominant program along the way . ”
Stimulus money is flowing into cities in the form of healthcare benefits , tax relief and other programs not reflected in the mayors ’ report , he said .
The complaints come as surveys show that much of the public is skeptical about the stimulus package , which President Obama had made his top legislative priority when taking office this year .
A poll released by the Wall Street Journal last week showed that 39 % considered the stimulus a “ bad idea , ” compared to 37 % who thought the opposite .
More broadly , 58 % of those who responded said the president and Congress needed to make deficit reduction a priority , an implicit criticism of the stimulus .

The White House is aggressively making the case that the program is necessary .
Cabinet secretaries have been crisscrossing the country touting the stimulus ’ merits .
And Biden , through regular conference calls with elected officials , is attempting to allay concerns from the grass roots .
Some mayors believe the Obama administration ’s repeated calls for accountability have had a chilling effect .
Because the administration has warned “ that if you ’re doing something wrong we ’re going to call you out on that , people are being very cautious about dotting the I ’s and crossing the Ts , ” said Durham , N.C. , Mayor Bill Bell , a Democrat .
On a conference call with elected officials Friday , Biden fielded a complaint about stimulus money flowing to states rather than to cities .
Some of the local elected officials on the call said Biden seemed to take their side .
But DeSeve , who also was on the call , said the vice president was merely trying to show empathy .

With the economy in a slump , some lawmakers believe a second stimulus is necessary .
If Congress were to take up a second stimulus , mayors said they would press hard for new rules routing money straight to cities .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said he was satisfied with the transportation dollars the city has received .
He said he increased Los Angeles ’ share by lobbying state officials .
If a second bill comes around , however , the mayor said he wanted some changes .
“ The money should have been distributed more proportionately , ” Villaraigosa said , “ based on population and congestion . ”

( Reuters ) - Chief executives of some banks that received federal money , including Bank of America Corp , Morgan Stanley and Regions Financial Corp , used company jets for their personal use , the Wall Street Journal reported on its website .
Flight records showed many occasions when banks receiving federal money flew their planes to destinations near resorts or executives ’ vacation homes in Europe , Mexico , the Caribbean , south Florida and Aspen , according to the paper .
“ We are implementing a new policy in 2009 , under which personal use of aircraft will not be permitted , ” a Bank of America spokesman told the paper , but declined to comment on specific trips .
In some cases , it was clear that bank executives were traveling for personal reasons ; for other flights , many of which were over weekends or holidays , the passengers and purpose could n’t be established , the paper added .
A spokesman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment to the paper on individual flights , but said its policy was to allow CEO John Mack personal use of corporate jets , with the cost “ fully disclosed ” in annual proxy filings .
A Regions spokesman also declined to comment to the paper on the trip or the cost estimate , but said all travel on company jets “ either for personal or business was within our policy . ”
The banks could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .
Sometime , as developers , we 're really the ones to blame for the problems that we see .
But that does n't stop us from complaining when someone points out an issue with our code later .
We developers sometime have an arrogance about how we would never click buttons in that sequence or never enter an ampersand in that field .
But sometimes , users will do those things , and we should be ready to accept the fact that we did n't account for every instance .
I know that sometimes a time crunch is in place , and that can be the primary reason for some of these types of errors .
But , honestly , sometimes , it 's just a goof on the programmer .
It is annoying , however , to continually get ticket after ticket for the same problem .
We know we screwed up the first time you entered the ticket .
We get it .
If you keep hitting us over the head with the problem , it really is n't going to solve anything faster .
If anything , the developer gets more frustrated with the continual beat down and either will try to put off completing the ticket or wo n't do as good of a fix since now he has to waste his time answering all of the status updates that users want .

Last week was a milestone for US treasury secretary Tim Geithner .
He finally got to play the hero .
The morning of June 9 , Treasury notified 10 financial institutions , including JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , US Bancorp , and Capital One Financial , that they were “ eligible to complete the repayment process ” for the capital they received under the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
In other words , they would be allowed to pay back $ 68.3 billion .
Even though they really owe $ 229.7 billion .
That we know of .
But Geithner did n’t mention that last bit .
Instead , he professed that “ these repayments are an encouraging sign of financial repair , ” with the caveat that “ we still have work to do . ”
The “ we ” he refers to is himself and Wall Street , both of whom are getting a good deal out of this fractional payback scheme .
The agreement frees the banks from restrictions on executive pay or , worse , their general practices , but it still allows them to keep the cash they ’ve received through non-TARP venues like the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program — or the massive sums the banks recovered from AIG ( thanks to its own federal bailout ) to cover their losses on credit derivatives .
Not to mention any cash provided by the mother of all cheap loan programs — the Federal Reserve .
Geithner , for his part , gets to convey the message that things are looking up .
“ These repayments follow a period in which many banks have successfully raised equity capital from private investors , ” stated the press release .
“ Also , for the first time in many months , these banks have issued long - term debt that is not guaranteed by the government . ”
Well , of course certain banks have raised some money on their own :
Firms have a tendency to look a whole lot better when they ’re backed by government capital and have cheap federal loans sitting on their books .
Private investors notice that sort of thing .
But more troubling than the misplaced praise is the fine print that accompanied the announcement : “ These repayments , ” the department noted , “ help to reduce Treasury ’s borrowing and national debt .
The repayments also increase Treasury ’s cushion to respond to any future financial instability that might otherwise jeopardize economic recovery . ”
This statement belies some accounting sleight of hand .
First off , it conveniently ignores the fact that TARP accounts for a fraction — about $ 700 billion — of the government ’s $ 13 trillion banking stabilization scheme .
At some point , investors are going to balk at buying up federal debt ( Treasury bonds ) , thereby forcing the government to pay higher interest rates , which will wipe out much of the TARP payback benefit .
The second sentence is more ominous :
It suggests that if banks need that money back , it ’ll be waiting for them right there at the Treasury Department .
On the day of his announcement , Geithner acknowledged to the Senate Appropriations Committee that “ while we see some initial signs of economic improvement and the financial system is beginning to heal , our country faces very substantial economic and financial challenges . ”
Indeed , the banking sector has not gotten substantially better lately .
According to a report compiled by the Investigative Reporting Workshop and MSNBC , the number of delinquent or defaulting bank loans grew by 22 percent during the first quarter of 2009 — six out of ten banks were , in fact , even less prepared to absorb further losses than they had been during the last , abysmal quarter of 2008 .
While the treasury secretary conveyed to the senators some understanding of the plight of the rest of us , this show was all about Treasury and the banking sector .
Geithner praised the government for pulling off stress tests of the 19 largest financial institutions last month .
“ The clarity and transparency provided by the tests , ” he said , “ has helped improve market confidence in the banks , making it possible for them to collectively raise nearly $ 90 billion through private equity offerings , bond issuances without government guarantees and sales of business units . ”
But Tim ’s not playing it straight .
The fact that most of these banks passed their stress tests would only have mattered if the tests had any value .
As I discussed when the tests were first unveiled , these tests were designed in tandem with the banks , the evaluations were provided by the banks , and some of the assumptions they were based upon — such as where unemployment would be — had been exceeded before the test results were released .
In fact , the stress tests have little to do with anything , but two other sources of capital for banks do .
The main one is the Fed , which loans money to banks at stupidly low rates through a variety of facilities and loan - guarantee programs that total $ 7.9 trillion .
In return , the banks can post as collateral an assortment of complex assets that no one but the Fed has any record of .
Banks can also borrow cheaply if they have an FDIC guarantee — and then use that cheap money to do things like pay TARP back , which explains why their stocks have gone up .
The government opened this door on October 14 , 2008 , with the FDIC ’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program .
The idea was that it would prompt banks to start lending to their customers again .
But that did n’t happen .
Instead , cunning institutions used the new program to raise cheap capital for their own needs .
By changing its status to a bank holding company , Goldman Sachs was able to secure $ 29 billion of that FDIC - backed debt ; Morgan Stanley raised nearly $ 24 billion .
The banks paying back the TARP funds are n’t doing any better than their peers .
In the first quarter of 2009 , JPMorgan Chase ’s troubled asset ratio — the ratio of bad loans to the cash a bank has set aside to cover them — increased by nearly 16 percent , US Bancorp ’s by 21 percent , and Capital One ’s by 17 percent , numbers that put them in the same ballpark as many banks that are holding their TARP money .
In the meantime , average Americans , who do n’t have a $ 13 trillion federal insurance policy to fall back upon , have fared poorly .
Over the past three months , unemployment has hopped a full point , to 9.4 percent — nearly double what it was one year earlier .
For the third straight month , home foreclosures have broken the 300,000 mark , with the defaults reaching well into the prime loan turf , and home prices are still falling .
Considering the true size of the bailout , the continued loan deterioration , and the weakness in the overall economy and job market , the economic signs simply are n’t that positive .
For Geithner to pretend that a few banks paying back federal money with other federal money is an encouraging sign is to miss all of them .
Judging from his book ’s dedication to Delmore Schwartz and from the sheer number of poems where he ’s mentioned , Delmore ’s death must have been devastating to Berryman .
Perhaps that ’s merely because Schwartz was once his teacher .
If so , Schwartz must have had a powerful influence on him .
Interestingly , a Berryman interview from the the Paris Review touches both on Berryman ’s view of fame , another major theme , and his relationship to Schwartz — not to mention a million other things .
As the interviewer points out , this one sounds a little Shakesperian :
147
Henry ’s mind grew blacker the more he thought .
He looked onto the world like the act of an aged whore .
Delmore , Delmore .
He flung to pieces and they hit the floor .
Nothing was true but what Marcus Aurelius taught ,
‘ All that is foul smell and blood in a bag . ’
He lookt on the world like the leavings of a hag .
Almost his love died from him , any more .
His mother & William
were vivid in the same mail Delmore died .
The world is lunatic .
This is the last ride .
Delmore , Delmore .
High in the summer branches the poet sang .
His throat ached , and he could sing no more .
All ears closed
across the heights where Delmore and Gertrude sprang
so long ago , in the goodness of which it was composed .
Delmore , Delmore !
There ’s certainly a point at which thinking becomes counterproductive , where one needs to just experience life directly if one is to function , as most of us have probably experienced at one point or another .
Which is not to say that it is possible to quit thinking once you ’ve reached that point .
The Marcus Aurelius quotation comes from this section of his meditations :
“ Does Panthea or Pergamus now sit by the tomb of Verus ?
Does Chaurias or Diotimus sit by the tomb of Hadrianus ?
That would be ridiculous .
Well , suppose they did sit there , would the dead be conscious of it ?
and if the dead were conscious , would they be pleased ?
and if they were pleased , would that make them immortal ?
Was it not in the order of destiny that these persons too should first become old women and old men and then die ?
What then would those do after these were dead ?
All this is foul smell and blood in a bag . ”
I wonder if Berryman purposely drew a quotation from a section that begins :
THIS reflection also tends to the removal of the desire of empty fame , that it is no longer in thy power to have lived the whole of thy life , or at least thy life from thy youth upwards , like a philosopher ; but both to many others and to thyself it is plain that thou art far from philosophy .
Thou hast fallen into disorder then , so that it is no longer easy for thee to get the reputation of a philosopher ; and thy plan of life also opposes it
Some have argued that tragedy is no longer possible in the 20th Century , but it certainly seems tragic to me when a poet with a beautiful voice descends into madness , “ flung to pieces and they hit the floor . ”
This poems suggests that Schwartz played a much more powerful role than merely teacher for Berryman , Henry :
149
This world is gradually becoming a place
where I do not care to be any more .
Can Delmore die ?
I do n’t suppose
in all them years a day went ever by
without a loving thought for him .
Welladay .
In the brightness of his promise ,
unstained , I saw him thro ’ the mist of the actual
blazing with insight , warm with gossip
thro ’ all our Harvard years
when both of us were just becoming known
I got him out of a police - station once , in Washington , the world is tref
and grief too astray for tears .
I imagine you have heard the terrible news ,
that Delmore Schwartz is dead , miserably & alone ,
in New York : he sang me a song
‘ I am the Brooklyn poet Delmore Schwartz
Harms & the child I sing , two parents ’ torts ’
when he was young & gift - strong .
I really do n’t know why Schwartz was so important to him , but it ’s clear that his loss affected “ Henry ” in the same way that the father ’s suicide haunts these poems .
Perhaps it ’s the “ miserably ” and “ alone , ” despite his fame and talent , that so terrifies Henry .

Welcome to the Procedural Content Generation Wiki
The PCG Wiki is a central knowledge - base for everything related to Procedural Content Generation , as well as a detailed directory of games using Procedural Content Generation .
What is Procedural Content Generation ?
Procedural content generation ( PCG ) is the programmatic generation of game content using a random or pseudo - random process that results in an unpredictable range of possible game play spaces .
This wiki uses the term procedural content generation as opposed to procedural generation : the wikipedia definition of procedural generation includes using dynamic as opposed to precomputed light maps , and procedurally generated textures , which while procedural in scope , do not affect game play in a meaningful way .
The concept of randomness is also key : procedural content generation should ensure that from a few parameters , a large number of possible types of content can be generated .
What should I do from here ?
Have a look around the wiki .
Most people visiting here seem to want to check out the lists of PCG games .
But you may find you get more of an insight into procedural generation by downloading or trying online some of the freely available PCG software and having a play , or by looking at some of the code examples ( such as map generation ) on the wiki or reading some of the articles this wiki links to .
At the very early stages of this wiki , most of the pages on this wiki are link place holders to external websites .

PCG Games
Many games use procedural content generation to increase the length of game play , some of which are free to download and play .
The most common category of PCG games is roguelikes , which have a long tradition of using procedural content generation techniques .

Jews jailed at the Tombs were welcomed in the chaplain ’s office , where they would shoot craps , use his secure phone line to place sports bets and eat “ like kings , ” former inmates told The Post yesterday .
‘ BAR MITZVAH ’ JAILBIRD PERK AN OUTRAGE : DETECTIVE
Rabbi Leib Glanz also would throw parties several times each year for Jewish prisoners on Rikers Island , where they dined on tasty kosher meals , were entertained by clowns , played basketball and ducked into bathrooms to have sex with female prisoners .
“ It was like a party every day .
It was great , ” one ex-con — a Manhattan man who was awaiting trial in 2005 for a financial scam — said about Glanz ’s office in the Tombs in lower Manhattan .
Glanz has been suspended for two weeks for organizing an elaborate bar mitzvah — complete with 60 non-inmate guests , a catered dinner and a band — last December for the son of a Tombs inmate .
The Department of Investigation is probing the case , and four other top correction officials have been stripped of their vacation time for permitting the shocking security breach .
The Post yesterday revealed how Glanz routinely coddled Jewish inmates at the Tombs .
“ Some of us would use his desk as a craps table and shoot craps for commissary items , ” the ex-con said .
Jewish inmates also would take advantage of Glanz ’s office phone — which was not monitored by correction officers , the ex-con said .
“ Guys are fighting with their wives , guys are calling up saying , ‘ I want to lay $ 600 down on this game , that game , I want to bet this horse ’ . . . guys are calling girls for a little phone sex , ” the ex-con said .
One inmate , trying to raise bail money , called a friend and “ told someone he had a secret stash of money ” he wanted to access , while other inmates called pals to ask for help hiding evidence , the ex-con said .
After Tyco execs Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz were sentenced to prison for looting their company , they were jailed at the Tombs , where Glanz “ took care of them , ” the ex-con said .
Kozlowski and Swartz are now serving up to 25 years in upstate prisons and could not be reached for comment .
Another ex-con , Jason Itzler — a former high - end Manhattan pimp — said Glanz ’s office “ ran like a little sanctuary within the Tombs ” when he was jailed there in 2005 , before being sent to Rikers for 2½ years .
Itzler and the other ex-con said that during their stints on Rikers , Glanz several times a year would host parties where male and female Jewish inmates — and those who falsely claimed to be Jewish to get the perk — would socialize during Jewish holidays .
The ex-con and Itzler said male and female inmates pretending to be Jewish would go into bathrooms to have sex .
“ I remember people bragging about it , ” Itzler said .

Today Steve Harvey was on Good Morning America to promote his bestselling dating book Act Like A Lady , Think Like A Man .
Apparently , dudes want to mark us as their territory and pay our bills .
We 've never had a problem with opening the car door ourselves , having sex before the 90 - day mark , or paying for our own movie tickets , especially after we offer to go dutch .
Guys did n't seem to mind either , but Steve Harvey has informed us of our grave error .
In the clip at left , Steve explains that if a guy really loves you , he 'll show it through what he calls the three Ps : " We profess , we provide , and we protect .
We will give you a title if we love you .
We 're gonna make you our something .
That 's how we mark our territory . "
And in return , we puke !
President Obama is outlining his “ scaled back ” plan to reshape the financial system Wednesday , said Declan McCullagh in CBS News Econwatch .
Thanks to “ assiduously ” leaked details , we know that he wants the Federal Reserve to have more power , the Office of Thrift Supervision to disappear , and a new Consumer Finance Protection Agency to sprout up among the poorly weeded “ crop of regulatory agencies ” in Washington .
If , like me , you were hoping that Obama would downsize and rationalize the “ alphabet soup of regulators , ” said Felix Salmon in Reuters , this plan is “ a bust . ”
There are some good ideas tucked in the proposed overhaul , but the gist of it is that there ’s nothing wrong with our financial oversight that ca n’t be fixed by another layer of bureaucracy .
Obama could be tamping down expectations before he unveils better - than - expected policy proposals , said Ezra Klein in The Washington Post , but “ I ’m increasingly pessimistic on the success of the whole endeavor . ”
If Congress passes anything , much less anything worthwhile , it reportedly wo n’t be until sometime next year .
With the economy recovering , and the banking lobby batting 1,000 , any momentum for reform will be long gone in 12 months .
Good , said Tony Blankley in RealClearPolitics .
If the financial system is the brain of the economy , “ heavy regulation is its lobotomy . ”
In trying to design a system to fight the last war — in which “ ‘ greedy ’ and impetus - excessive financial risk takers ” were the enemy — Obama risks worsening the next one , where the main problem will be stagnant lending in an overly risk - averse market .

I made this cake almost a month ago , but that does n’t make it any less awesome .
As most of you know , I ’m a huge Lost fan ( as is my fiancee ) and when the season finale aired last month , it was an emotional night , as you might imagine .
Knowing that we ’re going to have to wait until January 2010 for the next ( and last ) season is heartbreaking !
So , I decided to make this Dharma Initiative Swan Station cake to try to ease the pain , as well as to celebrate the finale .
I might like Lost a little too much .
Hey , it ’s not the worst thing in the world !
Kramer , my brothers , and our friend Morgan are all going to Comic - Con in San Diego in July , so that ’s the next time we ’ll be able to get our Lost fix .
Until then , I ’ll have to remember the glory that was this cake .
Not only is it shaped like the Swan Station , but this is a really easy to make chocolate layer cake .
You can do the whole thing in one bowl !
The cake itself has a really tender crumb and a rich chocolate taste , and the layers are made with the amazingly delicious leftover Nutella frosting I had from Kramer ’s birthday cupcakes .
The outside is vanilla frosting that …came from a can ( as did the black frosting ) .
I know !
So sue me !
But I wanted to make sure that I had the whitest white frosting that I could find and I did n’t want to end up with off - white frosting and have to start again ( finals were also happening during this week ) .
I hope you ’re all inspired to make your own Dharma Initiative cakes , or at least this chocolate layer cake , sometime soon !
Recipe after the jump .
Combine your flour , sugar , cocoa powder , baking soda , and salt .
Add in the oil and sour cream and beat until blended .
Gradually beat in the water , then the vinegar , vanilla , and eggs .
Scrape down the sides .
If you have parchment paper , cut out liners for the cake pans by placing the cake pan over a piece of parchment and cut around it with a serrated knife .
Place the liner cut - out in the pan and spray it with Pam .
This will help your cake to easily slip out of the pan without breaking .
You just flip it upside down and peel the parchment paper off when you ’re done !
Divide the batter evenly amongst your 3 8 - inch round cake pans .
Bake at 350 degrees F for about 35 minutes , or until set .
Allow to cool completely before removing from the pans .
Our little diagram for the cake .
We cut around the cake about 2 inches inward to make 8 sides .
This is a picture of the Swan logo .
I did n’t attempt to write “ Dharma ” on the inside because I knew that would end in disaster .
This is called a crumb layer .
What you do is go around the cake once with a very thin layer of frosting , then refrigerate the cake to let it set .
This will allow you to have a much smoother and cleaner surface when you finish frosting the cake .
I had my brother draw the swan logo on it because I did n’t trust myself .
The cake , almost completed .
And there it is , all finished !
I think it looked better in real life , but I still think it ’s awesome and I ’m proud of it !
This was the last remaining slice of cake after we watched Lost .
A success ( both the cake and the finale ) , I ’d say !
For this article I ’d like to take a different direction concerning Linux .
Is it all too typical on the internet to hear a Linux user go full - on zealot style and say , " YEAH !
I use Linux !
F**k Microsoft !
You people are sheeple !
Down with the status quo ! "
Blah , blah , blah , frickin’ blah .
Nobody cares .
It ’s as if a Linux user can’t possibly say anything about the operating system he or she uses without mentioning Microsoft and / or what most people use for their personal computing and how it ’s " wrong/bad/evil " , etc .
To those zealots , I say unto thee : Shaddup .
You ’re not helping .
Truly happy Linux people could n’t care less about Microsoft whatsoever .
Instead , they just get down to business and make things work .
Whether it ’s for desktop , laptop , media center use or what - have - you , instead of bickering about Microsoft they ’re getting things done , which of course is what matters the most .
The good Linux users I know do n’t even talk about Microsoft .
Never will you see a " windoze " , " winblows " , " M$ " or " Micro$oft " in anything they blog about .
To note , those that do write those childish things are morons because as said above , nobody cares .
You do n’t see me calling Linux users tux turds , penguin poopers or GUI - challenged , do you ?
Good Linux users tell good stories about the things they ’re doing now , such as :
" On my 32 - bit system I can now access all 4GB of my RAM .
Now I do n’t have to buy a new computer ! "
" I ’ve been able to keep my computer running for two solid weeks straight without a single reboot . "
" I really like the Evolution mail client .
I really like the iCalShare connectivity too ! "
" I love the games I ’m playing .
Great stuff ! "
These are the types of stories I like to hear .
And yes , they ’re out there on the internet .
Sometimes it takes a little time to seek them out but they do exist .
You can find happy Linux users that say nothing of Microsoft because it simply does n’t matter .
At no time from these folks will you see , " Well I was using Outlook .. what a PIECE OF CRAP THAT WAS ..
I HATE MICRO$OFT !
Evolution rulez !!11!1 KDE ! GNOME ! ( penguins .. tux .. uh .. no mouse .. yeah ! ) "
No , no , no .. stop .
Just stop .
I suggest a new line of thinking for fervent Linux users :
Cut the anti-Microsoft crap .
Cut it completely out of your conversation .
Cut it out of your spoken word , your blogs , your videos and so on .
Why are you giving Microsoft free advertising ?
People do n’t care about your anti-Microsoft opinions because they ’ve already heard them a million times by at least a million other people , so you are not adding anything new or helpful to the conversation .
Tell us what you do with Linux .
Tell us the apps you use .
Tell us why you prefer specific Linux apps over others .
Give us useful information .
Computer use as far as operating systems is concerned is to the point where people will use what they use because that ’s what they ’re used to .
Windows people will continue to use Windows .
Mac people will continue to use OS X. Linux folks their distro o’ choice .
Yes , very obvious , but that ’s the way it is .
Those who are interested in Linux want to hear about ( duh ) Linux , and not your anti-Microsoft point of view .
So please , try and be helpful , because after all , all computers are sh*t .
And to Linux zealots , fsck you .

ONCE A YEAR OR SO , it ’s my turn to run recycling day for our tiny town .
Saturday morning , 9 to 12 , a steady stream of people show up to sort out their plastics ( No. 1 , No. 2 , etc. ) , their corrugated cardboard ( flattened , please ) , their glass ( and their returnable glass , which goes to benefit the elementary school ) , their Styrofoam peanuts , their paper , their cans .
It ’s quite satisfying — everything in its place .
But it ’s also kind of disturbing , this waste stream .
For one , a town of 550 sure generates a lot — a trailer load every couple of weeks .
Sometimes you have to put a kid into the bin and tell her to jump up and down so the lid can close .
More than that , though , so much of it seems utterly unnecessary .
Not just waste , but wasteful .
Plastic water bottles , one after another — 80 million of them get tossed every day .
The ones I ’m stomping down are being “ recycled , ” but so what ?
In a country where almost everyone has access to clean drinking water , they define waste to begin with .
I mean , you do n’t have a mug ?
In fact , once you start thinking about it , the category of “ waste ” begins to expand , until it includes an alarming percentage of our economy .
Let ’s do some intellectual sorting :
There ’s old - fashioned waste , the dangerous , sooty kind .
You ’re making something useful , but you ’re not using the latest technology , and so you ’re spewing : particulates into the air , or maybe sewage into the water .
You wish to keep doing it , because it ’s cheap , and you block any regulation that might interfere with your right to spew .
This is the kind of waste that ’s easy to attack ; it ’s obvious and obnoxious and a lot of it falls under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and so on .
There ’s actually less of this kind of waste than there used to be — that ’s why we can swim in most of our rivers again .
There ’s waste that comes from everything operating as it should , only too much so .
If carbon monoxide ( carbon with one oxygen atom ) exemplifies pollution of the first type , then carbon dioxide ( carbon with two oxygen atoms ) typifies the second .
Carbon monoxide poisons you in your garage and turns Beijing ’s air brown , but if you put a catalytic converter on your tailpipe it all but disappears .
Carbon dioxide does n’t do anything to you directly — a clean - burning engine used to be defined as one that released only CO 2 and water vapor — but in sufficient quantity it melts the ice caps , converts grassland into desert , and turns every coastal city into New Orleans .
There ’s waste that comes from doing something that manifestly does n’t need doing .
A hundred million trees are cut every year just to satisfy the junk - mail industry .
You can argue about cutting trees for newspapers , or magazines , or Bibles , or symphony scores — but the cascade of stuffporn that arrives daily in our mailboxes ?
It wastes forests , and also our time .
Which , actually , is precious — we each get about 30,000 days , and it makes one a little sick to calculate how many of them have been spent opening credit card offers .
Or think about what we ’ve done with cars .
From 1975 to 1985 , fuel efficiency for the average new car improved from 14 to 28 miles per gallon .
Then we stopped worrying about oil and put all that engineering talent to work on torque .
In the mid-1980s , the typical car accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 14.5 seconds .
Today ’s average ( even though vehicles are much heavier ) is 9.5 seconds .
But it ’s barely legal to accelerate like that , and it makes you look like an idiot , or a teenager .
Then there ’s the waste that comes with doing something maybe perhaps vaguely useful when you could be doing something actually useful instead .
For instance : Congress is being lobbied really , really hard to fork over billions of dollars to the nuclear industry , on the premise that it will fight global warming .
There is , of course , that little matter of nuclear waste — but lay that aside ( in Nevada or someplace ) .
The greater problem is the wasted opportunity :
That money could go to improving efficiency , which can produce the same carbon reductions for about a fifth of the price .
Our wasteful habits would n’t matter much if there were just a few of us — a
Neanderthal hunting band could have discarded six plastic water bottles apiece every day with no real effect except someday puzzling anthropologists .
But the volumes we manage are something else .
Chris Jordan is the photographer laureate of waste — his most recent project , “ Running the Numbers , ” uses exquisite images to show the 106,000 aluminum cans Americans toss every 30 seconds , or the 1 million plastic cups distributed on US airline flights every 6 hours , or the 2 million plastic beverage bottles we run through every 5 minutes , or the 426,000 cell phones we discard every day , or the 1.14 million brown paper supermarket bags we use each hour , or the 60,000 plastic bags we use every 5 seconds , or the 15 million sheets of office paper we use every 5 minutes , or the 170,000 Energizer batteries produced every 15 minutes .
The simple amount of stuff it takes — energy especially — to manage this kind of throughput makes it daunting to even think about our waste problem .
( Meanwhile , the next time someone tells you that population is at the root of our troubles , remind them that the average American uses more energy between the stroke of midnight on New Year ’s Eve and dinner on January 2 than the average , say , Tanzanian consumes in a year .
Population matters , but it really matters when you multiply it by proximity to Costco . )
Would you like me to go on ?
Americans discard enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial air fleet every three months — and aluminum represents less than 1 percent of our solid waste stream .
We toss 14 percent of the food we buy at the store .
More than 46,000 pieces of plastic debris float on each square mile of ocean .
And — oh , forget it .
These kinds of numbers get in the way of figuring out how much we really waste .
In recent years , for instance , 40 percent of Harvard graduates have gone into finance , consulting , and business .
They had just spent four years with the world ’s greatest library , some of its finest museum collections , an unparalleled assemblage of Nobel - quality scholars , and all they wanted to do was go to lower Manhattan and stare into computer screens .
What a waste !
And when they got to Wall Street , of course , they figured out extravagant ways to waste the life savings of millions of Americans , which in turn required the waste of taxpayer dollars to bail them out , money that could have been spent on completely useful things : trains to get us where we want to go — say , new national parks .
Perhaps the only kind of waste we ’ve gotten good at cutting is the kind we least needed to eliminate :
An entire industry of consultants survives on telling companies how to get rid of inefficiencies — which generally means people .
And an entire class of politicians survives by railing about government waste , which also ends up meaning programs for people :
Health care for poor children , what a boondoggle .
Want to talk about government waste ?
We ’re going to end up spending north of a trillion dollars on the war in Iraq , which will go down as one of the larger wastes of money — and lives — in our history .
But we spend more than half a trillion a year on the military anyway , more than the next 10 nations combined .
That almost defines profligacy .
We ’ve gotten away with all of this for a long time because we had margin , all kinds of margin .
Money , for sure — we were the richest nation on Earth , and when we wanted more we just borrowed it from China .
But margin in other ways as well :
We landed on a continent with topsoil more than a foot thick across its vast interior , so the fact that we immediately started to waste it with inefficient plowing hardly mattered .
We inherited an atmosphere that could buffer our emissions for the first 150 years of the Industrial Revolution .
We somehow got away with wasting the talents of black people and women and gay folks .
But our margin is gone .
We ’re out of cash , we ’re out of atmosphere , we ’re out of luck .
The current economic carnage is what happens when you waste — when the CEO of Merrill Lynch thinks he needs a $ 35,000 commode , when the CEO of Tyco thinks it would be fun to spend a million dollars on his wife ’s birthday party , complete with an ice sculpture of Michelangelo ’s David peeing vodka .
The melted Arctic ice cap is what you get when everyone in America thinks he requires the kind of vehicle that might make sense for a forest ranger .
Getting out of the fix we ’re in — if it ’s still possible — requires in part that we relearn some very old lessons .
We were once famously thrifty : Yankee frugality , straightening bent nails , saving string .
We used to have a holiday , Thrift Week , which began on Ben Franklin ’s birthday : “ Beware of little expenses ; a small leak will sink a great ship , ” said he .
We disapproved of frippery , could n’t imagine wasting money on ourselves , made do or did without .
It took a mighty effort to make us what we are today — in fact , it took a mighty industry , advertising , which soaks up plenty more of those Harvard grads and represents an almost total waste .
In the end , we built an economy that depended on waste , and boundless waste is what it has produced .
And the really sad part is , it felt that way , too .
Making enough money to build houses with rooms we never used , and cars with engines we had no need of , meant wasting endless hours at work .
Which meant that we had , on average , one - third fewer friends than our parents ’ generation .
What waste that !
“ Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers , ” wrote Wordsworth .
We ca n’t say we were n’t warned .
The economic mess now transfixing us will mean some kind of change .
We can try to hang on to the status quo—living a Wal - Mart life so we can buy cheaply enough to keep the stream of stuff coming .
Or we can say uncle .
There are all kinds of experiments in postwaste living springing up : Freecycling , and Craigslisting , and dumpster diving , and car sharing ( those unoccupied seats in your vehicle — what a waste ! ) , and open sourcing .
We ’re sharing buses , and going to the library in greater numbers .
Economists keep hoping we ’ll figure out a way to revert — that we ’ll waste a little more , and pull us out of the economic doldrums .
But the psychological tide suddenly runs the other way .
We may have waited too long — we may have wasted our last good chance .
It ’s possible the planet will keep warming and the economy keep sinking no matter what .
But perhaps not — and we seem ready to shoot for something nobler than the hyperconsumerism that ’s wasted so much of the last few decades .
Barack Obama said he would “ call out ” the nation ’s mayors if they wasted their stimulus money .
That ’s the mood we ’re in , and it ’s about time .
Two of my favorite people to interview – ever - are Fritz Grobe and Stephen Yoltz of Eepybird.com , a performance troupe based in Maine .
If you ’re anything like 40 million other people in the world , you know these guys from “ The Diet Coke & Mentos Experiments ” – a recreation of the Bellagio Fountains using nothing but Diet Coke & Mentos .
And while watching the Diet Coke & Mentos fountain is cool , cooler still are the minds behind the viral video sensation .
I first interviewed them at a show they produced at Maker Faire Austin 2007 – which is when the first part of this two - part video was filmed , and then again at Maker Faire Austin 2008 , which is when the second half was filmed .
In it they talk about the process behind both “ Mentos ” and the newer “ Post - It ” projects , including when 3 M ( the maker of Post - it notes ) showed up at their house in the woods of Maine with two tons of post - it notes , when they went to Castile , Spain to set a world record – and about their rivalry with a business school in Riva , Latvia .
All from Diet Coke & Mentos .
If you ’re just interested in skipping the interviews and seeing a high definition , live - before - an - audience version of Diet Coke & Mentos , you ’ll find two opportunities to skip ahead , one at 2:40 of the first video , and the other at 7:32 of the second video .
But really – these guys are insane geniuses , and little , to date , has been asked about the methods to their madness .
Hopefully , you ’ll be inspired by it .
Or entertained , at least .
If you ’d like to see the videos in full HD resolution ( well worth it ! ) , just hit this link for part 1 , and this one for part 2 .
The links will take you to the videos ’ high - def pages on YouTube .

http://d.hatena.ne.jp/yaneurao/20081222 )に出てきたH君が中学生の私に教えてくれたゲームは、「タイムギャル」以外にも「ドルアーガの塔」というのがある。
「 ドルアーガの塔 」は、「ゼビウス」を作った遠藤雅伸氏の作ったゲームで、60階のダンジョンから構成されるゲームである。それぞれのフロアには宝箱が出現するのだが、その宝箱の出現にはフロアごとに条件が定められており、その条件を満たさないと宝箱は出現しない。
ゲーム発売当時、宝箱の出現条件は知られていなかったのだが、H君は独自に調べ上げ、一覧表にして大事に持っていた。
ある日、 「これ覚えておくとええで」と彼はその大事な表を私に貸してくれた。私は、「凄いものを貸してもらった！」と大喜びで、さっそくその表を覚えることにした。本当は、ゲームの進行上不要な(取る必要のない)宝箱もあるのだが、その表からはわからないので、ともかく全部覚えることにした。
遠藤氏によると、フロアが60階で構成されているのは、サンシャイン60(当時日本で一番高いビル)にちなんであるそうなのだが、私にとってその60という数字は1分間の秒数でもあった。
だから、学校で教室の黒板の左につり下げられている丸い時計を見ながら秒針が1秒1秒を刻むごとにそのフロアの宝物の出現条件を心の中で復唱した。「緑スライム3匹倒す。黒スライム2匹倒す。ブルーナイトどちらか倒す。…」
それは私にとってのドルアーガ遊びだった。
興味のない授業の時間はずっとその遊びをしていた。時計の秒針さえあれば、私は何時間でもドルアーガ遊びが出来たのである。
そのあと、ファミコン版のドルアーガが発売された。ファミコン版のドルアーガには、裏ドルアーガという、宝箱の出現法則が異なるモードがあった。ファミコンは持ってないし、ファミコンのドルアーガをやる予定もなかったけど、H君は「これも覚えておくといいよ」とまたもや出現法則を書いた表を私に貸してくれた。私は、それも60階分すべて同じようにして時計の秒針を見ながら復唱できるまで覚えたのである。
その後遺症で、いまだに時計を見ると自然とこの宝物の出現条件が頭に浮かぶ。時計どころか数字を見てもそうだ。
例えば、私は143783という数字を見ると「時間5000まで待つ、ゴーストを全滅させローパーと交差、スライム・ウィザードを交互に倒し全滅させる」と思い浮かぶ。(83は83 - 60 = 23なので、裏ドルアーガのフロア23の宝物の出現条件が頭に浮かぶ)
これは生活する上で困ることもあるのだが、結局、その症状はなおらないままいまに至る。
まあ、長い数字の列が簡単に覚えられて便利なこともあるのだが。
ちなみに、私はアーケード版のドルアーガはいつもH君がプレイしているのを見ているだけだったので自分では一度もやったことはないし、ましてファミコン版は見たこともない。私にとって、「ドルアーガの塔」とは時計の秒針を見ながら宝物の出現条件を復唱するゲームであり、それこそが「ドルアーガの塔」のすべてだったのだ。

TOKYO , June 12 ( Reuters ) - Asia ca n’t rely on exports to the United States for long - term economic growth , because U.S. consumers will buy less as they increase savings and pay down debt , Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said on Friday .
“ I ’m optimistic on Asia ’s short - term outlook but pessimistic on the long term , ” Kuroda said in a speech in Tokyo .
“ The U.S. savings rate could rise to as high as 10 percent and suppress consumption .
It ’s becoming impossible for Asia to rely on the U.S. consumer . ” ( Reporting by Stanley White )
On Fareed Zakaria ’s show this morning , former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski drew a fascinating parallel between American Neocons and the Iranian regime :
In Iran , we have two different forces at work .
You have those who are for more democracy but who are also nationalistic and you have those who are supporting the regime who in many respects are … very similar to our Neocons .
They are Manichean , they look at the world as divided into Good and Evil and many of them see America as the personification of Evil …
[ Obama ] has struck exactly the right note .
He ’s offering moral sympathy , he ’s identifying himself morally and historically with what is happening in Iran but he ’s not engaging himself politically , he ’s not interfering , because that would turn out badly and it could be exploited by the Neocons in Iran to crush the revolution , to wipe it out .
I do n’t know if the revolution will prevail , it may take time , but the longer it lasts the better are its chances .
But we do n’t want it to escalate into a total showdown because if there ’s a total showdown now , the chances are that the worst elements , the Iranian Neocons , will prevail .
Think making your own stock is a drag ?
Not so , says Tim Hayward , it 's an easy , thrifty and pleasurable process - and your cooking will taste better for it
The British have an odd attitude to stock .
Many of us regard the mention of it in a recipe as an excuse to reach for a cube or an example of ridiculous restaurant - style pretension , which is a shame because making stock is a simple , rewarding and incredibly efficient way of cutting waste and improving your cooking .
Vegetable and fish stocks ( sometimes referred to as fumets ) will add breadth to your recipe repertoire ; lamb and pork both make terrific stocks but usually work best served with their own meat .
Beef or veal are the favourites of classical French cooking , full of distinctive rich flavour , but chicken or fowl - based stock has an astonishing versatility - a way of enhancing almost any meat or vegetable without interfering with their own flavours .
A good stock can be used to make very fast soups and to enrich stews , it can be reduced as a base for sauces or used as a glaze for meat .
In short , there are few things , short of dessert , that are n't improved by a splash of stock .
Chicken stock can begin with either a raw or cooked chicken carcass or trimmings .
The flavour comes from the meat left on the bones , but the vital gelatin that adds the luxuriant mouthfeel to stews and sauces derives from cartilage and connective tissue .
For a classic haute cuisine clear stock , you could start with raw carcasses and chicken wing tips , both of which should be available cheaply or even free from your butcher .
However , starting with the leftovers from a family roast is probably a more practical solution for most home kitchens and produces just as useful a result .
Put the leftover meat and bones into a large pot , cover with cold water and bring gently up to the faintest simmer .
After half an hour or so , add any and preferably all of the following : carrots , onions , leeks , turnips and celery , chopped roughly .
Here you can be really thrifty because the trimmings you will generate are almost as valuable in stock as the vegetables themselves .
Leaves , stems , trimmed - off ends , rooty stumps , skins and peelings can all be kept in the fridge or freezer until your next stock - making session .
( A vegetable stock can be made in the same way , but will be richer if you roast the veg first . )
Add a few peppercorns and a bay leaf too if you fancy , but avoid any other seasoning - particularly salt - as it will become unpleasantly concentrated as the stock simmers down .
After a couple of hours , strain off the liquid .
The remaining veg and meat can be discarded if you 're feeling flush , or topped back up with more water and perhaps a few more veg for remouillage - a second go - which produces a still worthwhile grade - two stock .
Cool the liquid in a covered dish in the fridge , preferably overnight , which will allow the fat to float to the surface and solidify , making it easier to lift off with a spoon ( either throw it away or use it as delicious cooking fat ) .
Then the stock is ready to use , although it can be gently reduced by another half if you want it thick and jellified .
Either way , it will store in the fridge for a week or two ; better still , freeze it .
If you pour smallish quantities flat in Ziploc plastic bags , you will have " sheets " of frozen stock which defrost quickly and can be snapped into smaller portions .
Or you can use ice trays .
Making stock at home , a little like bread - making , requires discipline , a mindset and a regime .
Unlike bread - making , it 's simple and effortless .
And once you know you have stock in the freezer , it will transform the way you cook .
A bag of veg , cheap because of a seasonal glut , or those mystery objects at the bottom of the organic veg box become amazing soups after a swift poaching in stock , a blitz in the blender and perhaps a dot of butter or cream .
After grilling meat , chicken or fish , you can deglaze the pan with a splash of wine and a shard or cube of frozen stock to create an instant and sophisticated sauce .
A proportion of stock in the cooking liquid of any stew , tagine , hotpot or casserole gives a remarkable extra depth of flavour , sometimes transforming quite unprepossessing cuts ( no wonder restaurants love this stuff ) .
But perhaps my favourite use is to make gravy for meat or sausages , by adding stock to the pan juices and then gussying it up with port and a couple of cubes of butter - and thickening with a little cornflour if that is your way .
Ask your foodie friends and I guarantee you 'll discover a few secret stock - nuts .
The pleasing routine , accompanied by the almost religious feeling of self - righteousness that all that thriftiness engenders , makes otherwise sensible cooks oddly obsessive about their stock habits .
They 'll wax nostalgic about the brace of pheasant they had last Christmas and the carcass from the Peking duck - and if you sound suitably sympathetic , they 'll lead you to the kitchen and point out , like some morally ambiguous morgue attendant , the carefully labelled bag in the freezer .
When the FBI uses a national security letter ( NSL ) to force the cooperation of an ISP or phone company in the surveillance of a suspect , the agency typically slaps a gag order on the service provider to prevent it from revealing the existence of the NSL .
Civil liberties groups have successfully challenged the DOJ on these gag orders in the ongoing Doe v. Holder , and last month the Obama administration decided not to appeal a federal court ruling that the FBI must justify these gag orders by meeting a relatively high First Amendment standard .
The implication of the court 's ruling was that the FBI would finally have to justify the gag order that it had placed on the John Doe in the Doe v. Holder case , so that the plaintiff could talk about the NSL .
The FBI has now cooperated , and has given the court a justification of the gag order , in secret .
The classified declaration that justifies the gag order can't even be seen by Doe 's attorneys at the ACLU .
In a statement , the ACLU elaborated on the move : " The government did not even file a redacted version of its secret affidavit or even an unclassified summary of what the secret affidavit says .
Basically , the government is asking us just to trust that the gag is justified . "
The group further explained that its attorneys " obviously ca n’t respond meaningfully to arguments that we ’re not even allowed to see , " so they 're trying to get some form of access to the document .
This would come in the form of either limited attorney access , or a summary of the filing 's contents .
To add insult to injury , it 's not even clear that the investigation that sparked the five - year legal battle is still going on .
The FBI quit asking Doe for records over two years ago , but it still maintains that revealing the identify of the ISP would result in various harms .
Clearly , the FBI is n't ready to give up its Bush - era secrecy addition just yet .
As we reported earlier , the EFF is also on the Bureau 's case over fact that the internal guidelines that govern its domestic surveillance practices are also secret .
So in the case of Doe v. Holder , the FBI is carrying out a secret investigation using secret guidelines on what is and is not constitutional , and as part of that investigation they 've compelled the secrecy of a service provider and are using a secret justification to argue that nobody 's First Amendment rights are being violated .
" Just trust us , " indeed .
For more information on the Holder case , and on the ACLU 's ongoing legal battle against the FBI 's , see this page .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Loophole - laden laws in the United States are hampering efforts to stop the gun smuggling that fuels Mexico ’s drug - related violence , according to a congressional report released on Thursday .
A Eubank 7.69x39 sits in front of AK - 47s confiscated in crimes , some that have been smuggled into Mexico , are stored in one of the " vaults " at the local office of the ATF ( Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ) as evidence for trial or waiting to be melted down in Phoenix , Arizona , July 6 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jeff Topping
Efforts to trace firearms seized in Mexico are delayed by an average of two weeks due to the absence of a national U.S. firearms registry , the Government Accountability Office said .
The report was released as the Obama administration tries to step up efforts to intercept the flow of cash and guns south to Mexico as part of its anti-drug strategy .
Drug -related violence killed more than 6,300 in Mexico last year , and authorities say that 90 percent of the guns seized from drug cartels in the past three years that could be traced came from the United States .
“ It is simply unacceptable that the United States not only consumes the majority of the drugs flowing from Mexico , but also arms the very cartels that contribute to the daily violence that is devastating Mexico , ” said Democratic Representative Eliot Engel , who chairs the congressional subcommittee that commissioned the report .
The report also found that the lack of a paper trail for firearms sold at gun shows and pawn shops slowed down investigators as they tried to crack gun-smuggling networks .
When investigators finally establish where a gun was purchased the trail has often gone cold because smuggling networks shift personnel frequently , congressional researchers wrote .
The U.S. Homeland Security Department in April announced plans to spend $ 400 million on scanners and other equipment to detect arms shipments headed south .
U.S. border guards in recent years have not made weapons inspections a priority , with only 35 southbound weapons seizures involving a total of 70 weapons in fiscal 2008 , the report said .
The administration ’s new border strategy also emphasizes cooperation among different law enforcement agencies , but the report said the two agencies primarily responsible for fighting gun-running -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) -- had not consistently coordinated their efforts .
The Homeland Security Department , which oversees ICE , disputed that assessment but said the two agencies are working on an agreement that will allow them to work more closely together .
ATF falls under the Justice Department .
Homeland Security also announced Thursday that its customs agency had reached an agreement with the Drug Enforcement Administration that will allow more customs agents to target drug smugglers .

Yes , the president of Iran 's own election monitoring commission has declared the result invalid and called for a do - over .
That is huge news : when a regime 's own electoral monitors beak ranks , what chance does the regime have of persuading anyone in the world or Iran that it has democratic legitimacy ?
Second :
Stratfor is reporting that Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi -Rafsanjani , head of the Expediency Council , has resigned .
Though unconfirmed , the report is saying that Rafsanjani is resigning from his position as head of the Expediencey Council , NOT his position as the leader of the Assembly of Experts , which has oversight responsibility over the office of the Supreme Leader and would be responsible for naming Ayatollah Khamenei ’s successor .

Changing religion is widespread in the US , according to new research , but why ?
The BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent Robert Pigott investigates .
Also this week - nuns surfing on the wave of eco-sustainability , and why you CAN find some atheists in ( Afghan ) foxholes .
PICK 'N MIX RELIGION
As secularism continues to become more deeply established in Western Europe , religious leaders look with wonder at the apparent success of Christianity in the United States .
A new study suggests that Americans are shopping around for their faith
Now there is fresh evidence that the pick - and - choose attitude to religion that is sometimes blamed by church leaders for emptying pews in Europe , could be the mechanism by which religion has flourished in America .
A study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life suggests that the " free market " in faith in the US is more active than ever with almost one in every two adults in the country changing their religious affiliation at least once in their lives .
Instead of the relatively few denominations - and large dominant churches - found in much of Europe , the US has a profusion of churches catering for a wide range of spiritual needs and beliefs .
The competition between them - and therefore the wish to please - is arguably far greater than that between different Anglican parish churches .
But the Pew study also suggests that the increasingly restless movement between denominations is feeding an exodus from religion altogether in America .
A lot of the unaffiliated seem to be OK with religion in the abstract ...
John Green , Pew Forum
In a study of 35,000 people in 2007 , Pew found only 7 % reporting being brought up without a faith .
However , more than double that number said they currently belonged to no religion .
But even the leavers are susceptible to religious marketing it seems .
John Green , who teaches at the University of Akron and speaks for the Pew Forum described them as " dissatisfied consumers " .
He said only four percent had become had become atheist or agnostic .
" A lot of the unaffiliated seem to be OK with religion in the abstract , it 's just the religion they were involved in bothered them or they disagreed with it . "
So the market might contain lessons for European churches competing against the attractions of a purely secular lifestyle .
The Pew study suggests that many who leave their childhood faith return to it later on , and a slim majority of those brought up without a faith eventually join one .
ATHEISTS IN FOXHOLES
Despite the apparent weakening of church membership in the United States , the American government is probably some way from following the Netherlands in appointing army chaplains who do n't believe in God .
Dutch troops have an atheist chaplain , unlike British soldiers
There are thirty humanists serving in the Dutch armed forces .
It is a relatively small military served nevertheless by 90 Protestant and Roman Catholic clergy , two Hindu pandits , two imams and two rabbis .
Eline , a thirty year old air force captain , is serving in southern Afghanistan with 2,000 Dutch soldiers .
She is clear about her atheism .
" I definitely do not believe in a Christian or Muslim god or that it was a great spirit that has created this world .
I do n't know how we got here . "
There are no humanists among the British padres serving in southern Afghanistan .
The Ministry of Defence says there is no demand .
People are invited to say what religion they belong to when they sign up , but a tiny number - a press officer suggested about ten - had said they were atheists .
I am looking for meaning in things , but not necessarily a plan or a solution
Eline Eline - whose family name cannot be published by Dutch military regulations - completed a four year university course in " God Science " .
She tackles similar themes to her religious counterparts at the weekly meetings she holds at the base in Kandahar .
They include forgiveness and how to cope with being parted from families at home in Holland .
Eline - who also presides over memorial services for soldiers who have died - helps troops cope with being part of a war , and teaches them how to let go .
She says she and other chaplains differ mostly in their use of ritual , but otherwise it 's a very similar job , talking to soldiers about everything that happens to them .
" I am looking for meaning in things , but not necessarily a plan or a solution .
Just meaning . "
NUNS GET THE GREEN HABIT
The Dutch and British military might be well supplied with priests to minister to the troops , but churches in these secular societies are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit priests .
The Roman Catholic Church has also seen a steady decline in the number of monks and nuns , and not just in Western Europe .
Worldwide approximately a quarter of the total number of what the Church calls " religious " were lost during the papacy of John Paul II , and more recent figures indicate that the decline has continued briskly under Pope Benedict .
Handfuls of monks and nuns occupy large rambling monasteries and other religious houses with little prospect of new recruits .
But later this month one religious community will leave the draughty Victorian Stanbrook Abbey in Worcestershire for a newly - built convent in Yorkshire , designed as a model of ecological sustainability .
The nuns will soon be swapping Worcestershire for Wass .
The new Stanbrook Abbey will be at Wass , reputed to be a chilly spot .
However the elegant modern building will be equipped with solar panels , a wood chip boiler , and high - quality insulation .
Religious groups have become steadily more aware of a duty to preserve the environment .
Stanbrook Abbey in Callow End is a huge gothic pile , including a church designed by Edward Pugin , which was built by the community before any notion of carbon induced climate change .
The community - the Conventus of Our Lady of Consolation - has a history of taking resolute action to change its address .
Their predecessors resorted to subterfuge to buy Stanbrook Abbey in the 1830s .
Protestant property owners would at the time have been unlikely knowingly to sell to a Catholic religious order .
The nuns recruited a Catholic priest to pose as the buyer .
He rode over to Callow End to ask misleading questions about the standard of country sports and the mansion 's wine cellar .
The ruse worked , and was reported to have left the previous owner in " a great rage " .
But the community had another ambitious plan .
The nuns had lost seven of their number during the 37 years the community lived at Salford Hall near Evesham , and they were determined not to leave their remains behind .
So they broke the law by employing a party of men to dig up the bodies and ferry them secretly in a large lead case on a four - wheeled cart to Callow End .
But this time departed sisters will have to be left behind .
The community says that its dwindling size means its survival depends on transferring to Yorkshire .
So far the Abbey remains unsold , but moving day is set for May 21st .

Mozilla has announced the official release of Firefox 3.5 , the next major version of its popular open source Web browser .
The new version boosts performance , introduces useful new features , and delivers strong support for emerging Web standards .
Mozilla aims to " upgrade the Web " by improving the Firefox user experience and expanding the range of tools that are available to Web developers .
The company boasts that Firefox 3.5 includes over 5,000 enhancements that span nearly every aspect of the browser 's functionality and behavior .
Among the most compelling advancements in this release is support for the HTML 5 video element , which enables native video playback in the browser without requiring proprietary plugins such as Flash .
We got our earliest insight into the roadmap for the new version shortly before the release of Firefox 3.0 last June .
Mozilla was planning to adopt a more incremental development model and tentatively aimed to have a 3.1 release ready to ship in late 2008 .
As the roadmap increased in complexity and more sophisticated features began to land , they pushed the planned release date back into mid-2009 and changed the target version number to 3.5 .
That version arrived this morning , after 12 months of intensive development .
Although it is not as radical as the broad architectural overhaul that was undertaken for the 3.0 release , the development effort for 3.5 has brought many important changes to the browser .
It includes a lot of features that leverage the 3.0 architectural enhancements and it also includes a lot of features that were originally planned for 3.0 but were deferred for various reasons .
Privacy improvements
Firefox 3.5 includes a new private browsing mode that allows users to traverse the Web without leaving behind a trail that can be recalled later in the browser 's history , cache , and cookies .
This feature is becoming nearly ubiquitous in mainstream browsers as it is already included in Safari , Chrome , and Internet Explorer 8 .
Mozilla 's implementation is reasonably reliable and appears comparable to its competitors .
We first looked at the private browsing feature when it landed in beta 2 .
With a stroke at the keyboard , users can erect stiff privacy barriers that will prevent their Web surfing habits from penetrating the browser history and defiling the sensitive auto - completion system with incriminating data where it might arouse the suspicions of subsequent users .
Thanks to Private Browsing in Firefox 3.5 , your friends and coworkers will never discover your unwholesome obsession with the hot pussies in the Cats - n - Racks section at CuteOverload.com .
When the user enables private browsing mode from the browser 's Tools menu , the browser will end the current session and start in private browsing mode .
While it is in this mode , the browser will function normally but the data that it tracks will not persist .
When the private browsing mode is disabled , the user 's previous session will be reloaded and there will be no sign of the activity that transpired during private browsing .
This feature is typically referred to as pr0n mode , but Mozilla points out that it has broader uses and can also function well as a " guest " mode in situations where users allow their friends to make use of their browser .
One downside is that the browser does n't provide a convenient way to perform private browsing alongside a regular browsing session .
Google 's Incognito mode , which enforces privacy on a per- window basis , does n't suffer that particular limitation .
If you have a lot of tabs open , waiting for your regular session to reload at the end of private browsing in Firefox 3.5 can be a bit painful .
There are also several other features that give the user more control over privacy , such as support for clearing recent history and a " Forget This Site " capability that allow users to purge history and data pertaining to specific fetish porn websites .
User interface improvements
Mozilla was planning a few highly ambitious user interface changes for this release , but they were discarded as development progressed .
Tab switching , activated with ctrl+tab , was going to be altered dramatically , both in behavior and appearance .
The first alpha release included an experimental visual tab switcher that displayed thumbnails .
It also changed the tab switching order so that it was based on last use .
Both of these changes were dropped in later prereleases and are not included in the final 3.5 release .
Mozilla designer Atul Varma wrote a blog entry last year in which he described some of the usability failings of the experimental tab switcher and acknowledged that it was harder to use in many cases .
It 's possible that we could see some of the underlying concepts resurrected in future releases with a better approach .
The plans for major tab changes were dropped , but the new release does include a few subtle tab improvements .
By default , the browser will now display the tab bar when there is only one tab .
This change will improve the discoverability of tabbed browsing and will also be welcomed by users who find it jarring when the tab bar pops into view after the addition of a second tab .
Another subtle change is the inclusion of a button in the tab bar that can be used to create a new tab .
Support for moving tabs between windows is better in this release .
In Firefox 3.0 , dragging a tab from one window to another would cause the associated page to reload itself upon arrival in the new window .
In Firefox 3.5 , you can now drag tabs between windows without disrupting page state or suffering a forced refresh .
The 3.5 release also adds support for snapping tabs out of the browser to create a new window .
Dragged tabs are accompanied by a translucent page thumbnail that makes it easier for those of us with short attention spans to remember exactly what they are dragging .
Session management is better in 3.5 , too .
The 3.0 release introduced support for reopening closed tabs .
The developers have expanded on that in 3.5 by adding the ability to reopen a closed window .
Crash recovery is also handled better now .
When the browser is restarted after a crash , the user will be presented with a session restore screen that will show them the contents of their session and allow them to select which tabs should be restored .

Almost exactly 25 years after Prince Charles began his personal battle against modern architecture , condemning a planned - and swiftly abandoned - new wing to the National Gallery as a " monstrous carbuncle " , he has received his sternest ticking - off yet from the profession , with some of the world 's leading architects warning that he is abusing his position to unfairly influence planning decisions .
The prince 's private efforts to scupper a development of glass and steel housing blocks by Richard Rogers ' practice at the site of the former Chelsea Barracks in west London amounts to an attempt to " skew the course " of an open planning process already under way , the architects , including Lord Norman Foster and Zaha Hadid from the UK , as well as Frank Gehry , who created Bilbao 's Guggenheim museum , wrote in a letter .
Such interference undermined developers ' confidence in the UK 's planning system and might even deter some from investing in London , one of the other signatories , a leading urban planning expert , Professor Richard Burdett , warned .
" We have here a very established , very clear , open and democratic process , with all its strengths and weaknesses , " said Burdett , who headed the Venice architecture biennale on cities in 2006 .
" We know how it works .
It has the possibility of an appeal and then the possibility of a public inquiry .
The fact that suddenly a voice which is somehow unequal comes into it does create a risk of destabilisation .
" In this delicate moment of post - credit crunch economic frailty , developers could feel that their money is at risk , or made more at risk , by powers that are not very clear .
We could end up in a situation where people end up saying , ' Why invest here ? ' "
The 10 senders of the letter to yesterday 's Sunday Times , among them six winners of the Pritzker award , often viewed as architecture 's equivalent of a Nobel prize , were prompted to act after it was reported that Charles had written privately to the head of a firm owned by Qatar 's royal family which bought the 5.2 - hectare site for more than £ 950 m last year .
It is understood that the prince called Rogers ' proposed flats , to be located opposite Sir Christopher Wren 's Royal Hospital , " unsympathetic " .
Charles is believed to favour an alternative design by the architect Quinlan Terry , which mimics
Wren 's building and has been condemned by critics as a weak pastiche .
Backers of the Rogers design also point out that about half the 552 units in his scheme would comprise affordable housing .
Charles 's " private comments and behind - the - scenes lobbying " were anomalous in a modern , democratic system , said the letter writers , who also included Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron , the Swiss duo whose practice turned the former Bankside power station into the Tate Modern , and Italy 's Renzo Piano , the co-designer with Rogers of the Pompidou Centre in Paris .
Rogers ' proposals for the Chelsea site had already been adapted following local objections and were now in the hands of Westminster council planners , they noted .
" If the prince wants to comment on the design of this , or any other , project , we urge him to do so through the established planning consultation process .
Rather than use his privileged position to intervene in one of the most significant residential projects likely to be built in London in the next five years , he should engage in an open and transparent debate . "
" This is not really about a style , or an argument about how buildings look , but how we go about things , " said Deyan Sudjic , the director of the Design Museum in London , who also signed the letter .
" What 's slightly depressing is that this is kind of an old argument which began 25 years ago in quite a similar way , with the Prince of Wales ' no doubt quite well - intentioned attempt to interfere with a process which does have certain clearly laid - out legal steps .
This is an unaccountable additional layer to that process . "
While Charles 's views on modern architecture have remained trenchant and regularly aired , in recent years he has repaired some bridges with the profession .
Next month , he is due to present a lecture marking the 175th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects .
" I think it 's all come as a bit of a surprise , " said Sudjic .
" With the Prince of Wales due to be addressing Riba shortly , there was a sense that sweetness and light had broken out and that there was n't quite the stylistic polarisation that there had been .
Now it seems to be the prince , again , targeting a particular architect in a way which is returning to the way that he behaved previously . "
A day after Riba announced that Charles was to make his address , the organisation 's president , Sunand Prasad , criticised the prince 's intervention , saying he should " allow the properly constituted and conducted planning process to take place unhindered " .
A spokeswoman for the prince 's Clarence House office said she had no comment about " a private letter that may or may not have been sent " .
Charles v the architects
Prince Charles 's views on modern architecture are well known .
In May 1984 , he used a speech marking the 150th anniversary of Riba to lambast the National Gallery 's planned extension .
The design was dropped .
Charles also agitated successfully against a modern scheme devised by Rogers for Paternoster Square adjoining St Paul 's Cathedral in London .
The prince has for some years largely avoided criticising specific buildings still at the planning stage , although this rarely stopped him airing displeasure at existing buildings or the modern architectural establishment in general - in February last year he labelled a highly praised new university lecture hall in Essex " a dustbin " .
The prince 's own foray into urban design , Poundbury in Dorset , has been received with equal sniffiness by many architects .
The village 's new mock - Classical fire station was described by one critic as " the Parthenon meets Brookside " .
The paradox of his latest intervention is that when Wren built the Royal Hospital in the 1680s it was modelled on the then new Hôpital des Invalides in Paris , and was thus deemed modern itself .
California manufacturing jobs cross state lines MANUFACTURING
California has been losing manufacturing jobs faster than comparable states , according to a new report that argues it is possible and necessary to arrest the decline of a sector that pays an average wage of $ 66,200 a year .
" There is hope for California , but we do n't have too much time , " said Perry Wong of the Milken Institute , which was commissioned to conduct the report by the California Manufacturers and Technology Association .
Wong said the study found that the state lost nearly 26 percent of its total manufacturing employment from 1990 to 2007 , and 35 percent of its high - tech jobs .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The 96 - page report said that competition from cheap foreign factories cannot solely explain California 's losses .
The analysis found that seven other states - Arizona , Indiana , Kansas , Minnesota , Oregon , Texas and Washington - lost just 3.6 percent of their total manufacturing employment from 1990 to 2007 , and 13 percent of their high - tech jobs .
Wong said state policies and incentives have to explain at least part of the differences in job losses between California and its U.S. competitors .
" Everyone says the regulatory burden in California is too much , " said Gino DiCaro , spokesman for the Manufacturers Association .
" Over time , we 're dropping off the list of states that companies are willing to consider . "
The report is not specifically connected to any bill , but manufacturers ultimately want lawmakers to change state policies that , they say , kill jobs .
For instance , DiCaro said , California makes companies pay sales tax on new factory equipment , a practice followed by only two other states : Wyoming and South Carolina .
About 1.3 million Californians still hold manufacturing jobs , or 9.1 percent of total payroll employment , according to current state figures .
As recently as 2000 , manufacturing accounted for 12.8 percent of all payroll jobs in the state , according to the Milken Institute report .
Wong said factory jobs are worth special attention in the creation of state policy because they command higher - than - average wages .
Based on 2007 data , the average California factory worker earned $ 66,200 versus an overall statewide average wage of $ 54,500 .
The report , which is available at milkeninstitute.org , found the steepest declines occurring in high - tech manufacturing , which paid an even higher average wage of $ 115,000 in 2007 .
Wong said the state is gaining some manufacturing jobs , but these are mainly in lower - value industries like beverage , food , dairy and cement .
The report praised some steps competing states had used to boost factory jobs .
Kansas provides tax credits and other assistance to help employers train workers .
Washington has created an Office of Regulatory Assistance to streamline the approval of big projects .
Arizona has created a unique tax credit to reward angel investors in high - tech startups .
Somewhere in Eastern - Europe back in the 70’s , these were the actual album record covers of pop stars .
I ’m not sure how “ good ” that was for their album sales / charts .
Some of the guys back then had their own unique styles , one of them was over 60 years old with “ I am on top of the world ” attitude riding a satellite in space .
“ Milance ” is a big Casanova , a lady killer with Prince wannabe look .
Then we found out that George Michael stole the outlook image from the big star “ Zlatko ” , “ Bajo ” with stylish suit , hair and old “ Tozovac ” riding a cannon in a very funny FAIL position .
Now I am actually thinking that Bajo and Saveta , the lady from the first picture , were dating back in the days .
Chinese firm behind ambitious plan to breed microalgae in greenhouse with the potential to absorb carbon emissions
The garish gunk coursing through a greenhouse filled with transparent pipes appears to belong on the set of a particularly slimy episode of Star Trek .
Multiplying rapidly as it flows through tubes , stacked 14 high in four long rows , the organism thickens and darkens like the bioweapon of a deranged scientist .
But this is not a science fiction horror story , it is one of humankind 's most ambitious attempts to recruit algae in the fight against climate change .
Developed by a groundbreaking Chinese firm , ENN , the greenhouse is a bioreactor that breeds microalgae , one of the fastest growing organisms on the planet , with carbon captured from gasified coal .
China is the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , largely because it relies on coal for 70 per cent of its power .
Almost none of the carbon dioxide is captured , partly because there is no profitable way of using it .
Algae may be the answer .
The organism can absorb carbon far more quickly than trees , a quality that has long attracted international scientists seeking a natural method of capturing the most dominant greenhouse gas .
At ENN 's research campus in Langfang , an hour 's drive from Beijing , scientists are testing microalgae to clean up the back - end of a uniquely integrated process to extract and use coal more efficiently and cleanly than is possible today .
Coal is first gasified in a simulated underground environment .
The carbon dioxide is extracted with the help of solar and wind power , then " fed " to algae , which can be then used to make biofuel , fertiliser or animal feed .
Foreign experts are enthusiastic .
" Algae biofuels and sequestration are being tried in a bunch of places , but never with such an innovative energy mix , " said Deborah Seligsohn , of the World Resources Institute , who visited ENN recently with a group of international energy executives .
" It is really interesting and ambitious . "
Researchers at the algae greenhouse plan to scale up the trial to a 100 hectare ( 247 acre ) site over the next three years .
If it proves commercially feasible , coal plants around the world could one day be flanked by carbon - cleaning algae greenhouses or ponds .
" Algae 's promise is that its population can double every few hours .
It makes far more efficient use of sunlight than plants , " said Zhu Zhenqi , a senior advisor on the project .
" The biology has been proven in the lab .
The challenge now is an engineering one :
We need to increase production and reduce cost .
If we can solve this challenge , we can deal with carbon . "
The algae must be harvested every day .
Extracting the oily components and removing the water is expensive and energy intensive .
ENN is experimenting with different algae to find a hybrid that has an ideal balance of oil content and growth speed .
It is testing cultivation techniques using varying temperatures and acidity levels .
Algae tests are also being carried out at the University of Ohio .
In Japan , algae is farmed at sea where it absorbs carbon from the air .
Elsewhere carbon is sprayed or bubbled into algae ponds .
But ENN is focusing on a direct approach .
" Here we can control it , like in a reactor , " said Gu Junjie , a senior advisor .
" Theoretically we can absorb 100 % of carbon dioxide emissions through a mix of microalgae and chemical fixing with hydrogen . "
This might work on a large scale in the northern deserts of Inner Mongolia , where land is cheap , plentiful and in need of fertiliser .
But elsewhere , application may be limited because of the large areas of land or water needed for cultivation .
" Algae is not likely to be the main solution for the carbon problem because of the amount of CO2 that needs to be consumed , " said Ming Sung , Chief Representative for Asia Pacific of Clean Air Task Force .
But , he said : " Algae is part of the solution and is closer to what nature intends .
Being one of the simplest forms of life , all it takes is light and CO2 in salt water , "
The advanced algae , solar and coal gasification technology is the latest stage in the rise of ENN , which has been spectacular even by modern Chinese standards .
Founded in 1989 as a small taxi company , it has branched successfully into the natural gas industry and now into the field of renewable energy .
The private company now employs about 20,000 people , and owns a golf course and hotel near its headquarters in Hebei province , where a new research campus is under construction .
In the short term , ENN 's advanced underground coal gasification technology is likely to prove more significant than its algae work .
This technique enables extraction of fuel from small , difficult - to - access coal seams , and could double the world 's current coal reserves .
It also avoids the release of the pollutants sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide .
The company is also one of only a small handful in the world capable of mass producing thin - film solar panels , which can be manufactured with less water and energy than conventional photovoltaic materials .
Late last year , the World Bank 's International Financing Corporation announced a US $ 136 m loan for ENN 's solar business .
ENN executives have talked to the US department of energy about joint research , a sign that the transfer of low - carbon technologies is no longer a one - way street from west to east .
The development of the algae technology trails the others , but Zhu says the results from the 10,000 litre algae greenhouse have been sufficiently encouraging to move ahead .
For the 100 hectare test facility , ENN is looking at sites near the company 's 600,000 tonne - a- year coal mine in Ordos , Inner Mongolia , where the cold winters will require a heated greenhouse , and a location on Hainan Island , where the hot weather would allow the algae to be grown more cheaply in open ponds , but further away from China 's main coal deposits .
With China building the equivalent of more than one new 500MW coal - fired plant every week and likely to be dependent on coal for at least two decades , the further studies planned by ENN could be crucial .
Recognising the continued role of the fossil fuel in China , the European Commission proposed a plan this week to co-finance a demonstration coal plant that aims to have near zero emissions through the use of carbon capture and storage technology .
If members states and the European parliament agree on the € 50 m plan , the facility would be operational by 2020 .
• This article was amended on 1 July 2009 .
The original said that carbon was the most abundant greenhouse gas .
That volume status is held by water vapour .
THERE is an awful lot of it about but what it is remains the " most profound mystery in science " , says the man who gave it its name : dark energy .
This weird , invisible force that is pushing the galaxies apart at a faster and faster rate accounts for almost three - quarters of the universe , the University of Chicago cosmologist Michael Turner said yesterday .
" It 's very different than anything else we know , " Professor Turner , who was attending a conference in Canberra , said .
" Until we understand what dark energy is , we do n't understand the destiny of the universe . "
The mystery is no surprise .
The existence of dark energy was revealed 11 years ago by two teams , one led by the Australian astronomer Brian Schmidt , who discovered the expansion of the universe was accelerating .
Australian astronomers are also now leading the way in throwing light on this dark side of the cosmos .
Las redes de traficantes de mujeres emplean a México como un puente , y en ocasiones como destino , para trasladar hacia Estados Unidos y Canadá a adolescentes que serán prostituidas
SAN JOSÉ .—
Las redes de traficantes de mujeres emplean a México como un puente , y en ocasiones como destino , para trasladar hacia Estados Unidos y Canadá a adolescentes que serán prostituidas , según un informe de la Oficina de Naciones Unidas contra la Droga y el Delito ( ONUDD ) .
El reporte menciona que la trata de personas se ha convertido en “ una actividad de la delincuencia organizada transnacional muy lucrativa , asociándose y/o compitiendo con el tráfico de drogas y de armas ” .
En entrevista con EL UNIVERSAL , la viceministra costarricense de Gobernación , Ana Durán , señala que “ en el tráfico de personas la víctima no requiere una gran inversión , como la necesitan las drogas , y la ganancia casi es completa para los tratantes ” .
Por su parte , el fiscal general , Francisco Dall ’Anese , reconoció que las mafias “ corrompen a funcionarios ” , ya que tienen presupuestos que “ sobrepasan los de países centroamericanos ” .
Organismos no gubernamentales refieren que la frontera entre México y Guatemala es una de las áreas donde más se comete la trata de personas , y de ahí parte la ruta de la venta , hacia el centro del territorio mexicano , hasta llegar a Estados Unidos .
La semana pasada dos migrantes centroamericanas fueron rescatadas en Mérida y denunciaron que un funcionario de Migración las obligaba a prostituirse .
La Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos señaló que autoridades municipales , estatales y federales están coludidas con el tráfico de migrantes .
Terrified that invisibles zombies will attack you in your home ?
Sure , we all are .
Now , thanks to the insightful people at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta ( SCAD ) , you can use augmented reality ( AR ) technology to see otherwise invisible zombies on your handheld device .
Their newest video game , ARhrrr , is a first person shooter ( FPS ) that allows you to turn a table - top map into a zombie - filled city scape using a nVidia phone .
Look for the amazing tech demo video after the break .
For those of you new to AR technology , a camera records your environment while a computer mixes this image with pre-recorded 3D designs and then displays them in real - time on your screen .
The result is an illusion that you are looking into a hybrid world .
Another company , Total Immersion , created interactive baseball and pokemon cards , not to mention a tour of the new Star Trek movie ’s starship Enterprise .
SCAD , however , has upped the ante by leaping head - first into the realm of video games .
This is where the technology can really thrive .
Third - party developers , a dedicated consumer base , and sympathetic technologies could push AR as the next big thing .
Several devices , such as the PSP , nintendo DSi , and the iPhone are capable of supporting the technology and are already popular enough to carry the AR video game revolution .
That being said , I ’m not sure how dependent ARhrr is on the nVidia phone and its new Tegra processor .
The game itself looks fun , if a little shallow .
From the safety of your nVidia , you can explore your AR city world , hunting zombies and shooting them by tapping the screen .
Save some humans , watch out for zombies throwing stuff at you — pretty standard FPS fare .
A real innovation comes with the use of skittles ( yes , the real - life candy ) as markers on the map for bombs .
This is something I might have imagined as a child .
It ’s a cool twist to the game , and I hope other AR game developers pick up on this synergistic mix of product - placement and AR game - play possibility .
It ’s been less than a year since AR really started becoming a noted phenomenon .
Now we have a video game .
As the progression continues , AR is posed to become a wide - spread industry standard for entertainment and advertising .
It ’s hard to know , however , if AR will make that leap , or fade into yet another fad .
Personally , I hope that augmented reality becomes more realistic , more accessible , and a valuable tool for all kinds of art and communications developers .
In the end , it would be great for AR to become something more than just another way for video games to rot our braaaaaaaaiiinnnsss .

There are fears of a possible incident between North and South Korean ships " Actions must have consequences . "
That was US President Barack Obama 's cry in the wake of North Korea 's second underground nuclear test at the end of last month .
Accordingly , the unanimous adoption of this resolution containing tougher sanctions against North Korea represents a significant rebuff for the Pyongyang government .
Russia and China backed the agreed text .
North Korea can be in no doubt about the concerted international disapproval for its actions .
Tough words have been accompanied by tougher actions - up to a point .
A battery of measures are set to reinforce the sanctions regime against Pyongyang .
There is a total embargo on exports of weaponry from North Korea and significantly expanded controls on arms exports to it .
A new framework is being established for international co-operation to inspect North Korean cargoes for anything associated with weapons of mass destruction .
There are additional financial sanctions too , along with strengthened measures to monitor the whole sanctions regime .
However , much of this still depends upon the actions of individual governments and none more so than North Korea 's giant neighbour - China .
' Complex and sensitive ' China 's UN ambassador Zhang Yesui took a more nuanced approach to the resolution insisting that it was " an appropriate and balanced response " and that it sent a positive signal to Pyongyang that its nuclear problems had to be resolved by negotiation .
All eyes now will be on Pyongyang 's reaction with many analysts fearing it may respond with more bangs - in the form of missile tests - and more bluster .
It is clear that China remains deeply uneasy about the whole business of cargo inspections .
This was , he said , a " complex and sensitive " matter .
China is urging countries to approach this in a legal and reasonable way and that there should be no question of using force .
Russia too stressed that this resolution was not offering an opportunity for military action against Pyongyang and that the measures outlined on stopping and searching ships were circumscribed and narrow in scope .
None of this suggests that the new sanctions regime is necessarily going to bite .
But the US and its allies like Japan and South Korea will want to bank the fact that Russia and China are on board .
The diplomatic front at least against Pyongyang is reasonably solid with a clear message for North Korea to return to the negotiating table .
Dangerous times
What is not yet clear is what additional unilateral steps the Obama administration might take against Pyongyang .
It could seek to toughen financial restrictions and it might even restore North Korea to the list of countries sponsoring terrorism .
North Korea 's actions are clear but its motivation is much less so .
Some analysts argue that North Korea is trying to attract the attention of the new US president to push the whole issue of its nuclear programme higher up Washington 's agenda .
Others argue that North Korea 's nuclear and missile tests relate more to internal developments , bolstering the public image of the regime and possibly preparing the way for a transfer of power from the ailing , elderly Kim Jong - il to one of his sons .
But these are dangerous and uncertain times .
There are growing fears of a possible incident between North and South Korean ships along the Northern Limit Line - the disputed western maritime extension of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas .
All eyes now will be on Pyongyang 's reaction with many analysts fearing it may respond with more bangs - in the form of missile tests - and more bluster .

Israeli soldier shot American activist in face with tear gas can David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday March 14 , 2009
Print This Email This An American activist who participated in a Palestinian ' solidarity ' demonstration is in serious condition Saturday after an Israeli soldier shot him in the face with a high - velocity tear gas canister .
He underwent surgery early Saturday .
Even as the rescue operation commenced , more tear gas rained down on the demonstrators as soldiers allegedly delayed ambulance access .
" Tristan Anderson , 38 , of Oakland , Calif. , was wounded Friday in the West Bank village of Naalin , during a protest against Israel 's separation barrier , " reported the Associated Press .
" In the past year , four Palestinians have been killed and scores injured by Israeli troops putting down weekly stone - throwing protests against the barrier , which cuts off Naalin from 300 acres of olive groves . "
" The Israeli soldiers were standing on the hill looking over us firing tear - gas canisters " Ulrike Anderson , who was with Tristan when he was hit , told the International Herald - Tribune .
" Tristan was hit and fell to the ground .
He had a large hole in the front of his head .
I tried to stop the bleeding .
He was bleeding heavily from the nose . "
" Tristan was shot by the new tear - gas canisters that can be shot up to 500 meters , " said Teah Lunqvist with the International Solidarity Movement , according to California 's IndyBay .
" I ran over as I saw someone had been shot , while the Israeli forces continued to fire tear - gas at us .
When an ambulance came , the Israeli soldiers refused to allow the ambulance through the checkpoint just outside the village .
After 5 minutes of arguing with the soldiers , the ambulance passed . "
" Other ISM activists killed or injured by Israeli forces : Rachel Corrie , killed by a bulldozer in 2003 ; Brian Avery , shot in the face in 2003 ; and Tom Hurndall , shot to death in 2004 , " the site notes .
At the Berkeley Daily Planet , Tristan first became known as an environmentalist by sitting in trees to prevent their removal .
 He has worked extensively with Food Not Bombs ,  Marcus Kryshka , one of Tristan 's long - time friends , told the paper .
 He was also heavily involved with the tree - sit . 
" Kryshka said one of the reasons for his trip to Israel ' was to engage in solidarity with the Palestinian protesters . ' "
The Israeli army claimed protesters were throwing rocks at the troops .
" Anderson could very well die from his injuries , " reported ABC .
" And even if he does recover , his friends doubt he 'll ever be the same , physically and mentally . "

Ontological Argument for the Non-Existence of God by Francois Tremblay
Ontological arguments , which seek to deduce
God ’s existence logically from its perfection , are generally considered to be the weakest of the classical arguments for theism , and tend to be seen as nothing more then sleight of hand .
There is some merit to that assertion .
The common flaw to all ontological arguments is that they assume that “ X is defined as existing ” is the same as “ x exists ” .
The answer to this assertion is that , on one hand , we do say that things defined cannot exist because they contain contradictions : we know ( as much as we know anything ) that contradictions cannot exist .
We cannot , on the other hand , define things into existence , because there is no corresponding metaphysical necessity .
The relation is necessarily asymmetrical .
A simpler answer would be to point out that we can define contradictions as necessarily existing , but that does n’t mean they exist .
For instance , I can declare : zorglub=Df ( the x such that Bx & ~ Bx ) Where Bx represents “ x is a ball ” , or whatever other property you want .
Either way , Bx & ~ Bx is a contradiction , and no zorglub can exist .
I can declare that zorglubs exist necessarily all I want , but all I ’ve done is define them as necessarily existing .
It can never be the case that zorglub exists .
In section 3 of the book “ The Impossibility of God ” , called “ Proving the Non-Existence of God ” , John L. Pollock succinctly presents his own version of the ontological arguments .
When I say “ succinctly ” , I am not kidding : the whole discussion holds on three pages .
But since his argument is a straightforward modal presentation , no great expanse of discussion is necessary .
Either one accepts the logic , or one does not .
Like the modal arguments presented by theists , Pollock starts with the premise that God is defined as perfect , and that perfection implies necessary existence .
He does not , however , assume that one can jump immediately to Pg , because , as we have seen , definition cannot directly imply instantiation .
Rather , he uses the only logical conclusion that we can draw from the definition , that N ( Eg - > Pg ) .
Modal arguments tend to be more arduous for the casual reader , so I will try to explain each step as much as possible .
Let me go through the first half of the argument and explain what it means : g=Df ( the x such that Px ) God is defined as a perfect being .
( premise ) N ( Eg->
Pg )
We reformulate ( 1 ) by saying that God ’s existence necessarily entails its perfection .
All we did here was explain in terms of existence what ( 1 ) means .
( from 1 ) N( x ) ( Px -> NEx )
Let us assume , as the Ontological arguments do , that the perfection of x necessarily implies the existence of x , for all x. ( premise ) N ( Pg->NEg )
Instantiating the principle in ( 3 ) for God. ( from 3 ) N ( Eg->NEg )
We now see that ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) can be combined into one proposition .
If Eg implies Pg , and Pg implies NEg , then Eg implies NEg – the existence of God implies the necessary existence of God. ( from 2 and 4 ) We have to take a break here .
As Pollock explains in his development , this is the furthest that we can take ( 1 ) by logical means .
Even assuming the truth of the premise of the ontological arguments in ( 3 ) , it is impossible to arrive at Eg , the proposition that God exists .
Rather , the best we can do is the proposition that IF God exists , then NEg necessarily obtains .
This is important for two reasons : one because it shows that we cannot arrive at Eg , and two because we will use this conclusion again at the end of our argument .
( g=Df the x such that Px ) -> N( Eg->NEg )
Here we simplify the first half of our argument in one proposition .
( from 1 to 5 )
~ [( g=Df the x such that Px ) -> Eg ]
We can explain this proposition in two ways .
The first is to remember , as I discussed before , that a definition cannot entail actual existence .
The other is to point out that we already showed that we cannot logically obtain Eg from ( 1 ) .
Either way , it is a fact that Eg is unattainable from the definition alone .
( premise )
NEg iif [ ( g=Df the x such that Px ) -> Eg ]
This is obtained from the definition of logical necessity .
Something is logically necessary iif it follows logically from its definition .
( premise )
~NEg
If something is only logically necessary iif it follows logically from its definition , and God ’s existence does not follow logically from its definition , then God ’s existence is not logically necessary .
( from 7 and 8 )
N( ~Eg )
But we saw in ( 5 ) that it is necessary that if God exists , he exists necessarily : N ( Eg -> NEg ) .
Since it is not the case that NEg , it is logically necessary that God does not exist .
( from 5 and 9 ) Our conclusion in ( 10 ) proves the strongest form of strong - atheism ( “ God cannot exist ” ) , but also implies the weaker claim that ~ Eg ( “ God does not exist ” ) .
After developing his argument , Pollock does not address any substantial objection , except briefly addressing the point that some theists may not equal necessity with logical necessity , but some other form of necessity .
It is hard to argue with his brevity , however , given that the argument is logically ironclad .
The only problem with the argument is the use of “ x such as Px ” .
Perfection can only be defined relatively , and to posit such a definition without explaining what this “ perfection ” contains seems to lead to meaninglessness .
However , while this objection applies to the theistic ontological arguments , it does not apply here since Pollock is demonstrating a contradiction between the theological framework of perfection , its consequence N ( Eg -> NEg ) , and the criteria of logical necessity .
From this perspective , we can classify the Ontological Argument for the Non-Existence of God as an incoherency argument , since it shows a contradiction between a theological premise and the “ real world ” .
Is it possible to reformulate the argument without using perfection at all ?
I can see only one way to do so : define g as the x such that NEx .
In such a case , we can skip right to ( 5 ) , since we can directly expand this definition to N ( Eg -> NEg ) .
So is it possible to claim that God is defined as a being that necessarily exists ?
One modal argument does propose that Pg - > NEg , as Pollock points out in his introduction .
Therefore , some theologians would agree with such a definition .
Or if we transpose this in possible worlds language , most ( if not all ) theologians would agree that God , if he exists , exists in all possible worlds .
Finally , does the argument apply to the god -concept in general ?
Since any hypothetical god would be logically necessary , N ( Eg -> NEg ) would hold true for any god also .
Of course , it is hard to make sense of the claim that a god is logically necessary , but that is a semantic flaw of the god-concept , which is addressed by non-cognitivism .
If we presuppose that the god - concept is coherent in total and in parts , then N ( Eg - > NEg ) must hold true .
Therefore I see no reason not to apply the Ontological Argument to the god-concept .

CLEVELAND -- LeBron James ' off - season started with a surgery .
James underwent a procedure Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic to remove a benign growth along his right jaw line .
The five - hour surgery was performed by Dr. Frank Papay to remove the tissue from the parotid gland , which produces saliva .
In a statement , the Cavaliers said the doctors were " pleased with the outcome of the procedure , and at this time , are confident that no further treatment will be needed as LeBron is expected to make a full and complete recovery . "
Operations in that region often take such time because the parotid is located in a delicate area of the head that is surrounded by many nerves and blood vessels .
Over the last couple of months fans may have noticed a growth along James ' right jaw line .
It became more pronounced as the season and playoffs progressed .
James was being treated by team doctors it was decided to wait until the end of the season to have the growth removed .
James will spend the night in the hospital , and the team said he is expected to be released " soon . "
What we really need is a complete , honest , side - side comparison of all proposals , including single payer .
That comparison must NOT bee limited to just the costs to the Federal government , but also the total costs ( e.g. , currently about 2.5 trillion and 17 % of GNP ) as well as the costs to State government , employers , and individuals and household of different income levels .
The closest we have is the analysis and report done by the liberal leaning pro-reform Commonwealth Fund think tank , which supports the Obama " Building Blocks " approach , with both individual and employer mandates and a moderately strong public option ( essentially the same as Jacob Hacker , HCAN , Campaign for America , Edwards and Clinton from the campaign , etc ) .
Their partner in analysis is the industry gold - standard Lewin Group ( which is actually owned by United Health and so if biased , certainly is biased against single payer as well as strong public option .
Key to the tables and charts below :
Building Blocks = the mainstream Democratic Party Consensus
Stark = Single Payer
Wyden = Wyden - Bennett plan emphasizing eliminating employer health tax deduction .
The others can be pretty much ignored , as you will see .
Here is overall summary .
Number of the Uninsured Who Would Become Newly Covered :
Looking first at how many of the currently uninsured will become covered ?
Out of the estimated total number of 48.9 million , only the Stark Plan , like the Conyers HR - 676 plan , would automatically assure that everybody is covered .
Commonwealth / Lewin finds that the Wyden and Building Blocks ( including Obama and Baucus to lesser extents ) come relatively close but do n't actually acheive universal coverage .
The other plans , including all the ones from Republicans do not come close and mostly do n't really even try .
So , what about costs ?
Change in Spending Just of the Federal Government :
The graph below shows just the direct costs to the Federal government , not the total cost .
In other words , not the additional costs by individual and families such as premiums , deductibles co-pays , out - of - pocket due to refusals of insurance company to pay .
It does not include additional costs by employers .
It does not include the additional costs by state or local government .
The above is what those inside the beltway will mostly try to report on !
Not surprisingly , the Wyden Plan , which like the McCain plan from the campaign , takes away the tax corporate deduction for providing insurance and does little to offer pay directly for coverage , saves the Federal Government the most .
While the proposals from Stark , Enzi , Burr and the Building Blocks plan cost the Federal Government the most .
When the Congressional Budget Office comes out with favorable analyses of the Wyden plan , this is what they mean .
But as we shall see , this is a very incomplete and essentially dishonest view .
Total Change in National Expenditures on Health Care :
This table shows the change in total costs , the total national expenditure on health care .
This is the one that corresponds with Percent of GNP spent on health care , that infamous statistic that shows that U.S. spends twice as much as other developed industrialized nations , but is the only one not covering everybody and the only one bankrupting families if they get sick ... and the only one dependent on for - profit private insurance companies .
Notice the complete turn - around compared to the JUST federal government view in the prior table .
While the Wyden plan saves the Federal Government money , it actually increases total costs and dumps those cost onto others .
Indeed most of the other plans ...
Enzi , Baldwin , Burr and alas even Building Blocks ( including Obama and Baucus ) amount to huge giveaways and supports for the private for - profit insurance companies .
Only the Stark Plan ( like Conyers HR - 676 ) actually saves money for the overall system , the country as a whole .
Only Single - Payer like plans can actually control overall total costs .
And this from an organization that does not support single payer , and supports Obama / Baucus / Building Blocks .
Who Pays by Stakeholder Under the Different Plans :
This is the real story , typically ignored by proponents of the other plans including the Wyden plan , the various variations of mandate plans ( Obama , Baucus , Clinton , Edwards , Building Blocks , etc. ) and the Republican proposals .
The Building Blocks plan , like the Obama and Baucus plan , would increase costs overall , and to the federal government and for employers .
The Wyden plan dumps even heavier on employers .
Regardless of what the CBO or GAO or beltway mainstream may say , being " revenue neutral " and saving the Federal government money is not the most important goal of health care reform .
We do need to control costs , but it is overall total costs that are what really count .
And , we also need to provide coverage that is truly Universal for all people , Comprehensive in covering all health needs , and does not bankrupt you if you get sick .
What that table is showing is that all those other proposals -- not only those of Republicans Enzi , Baldwin and Burr , but alas even Building Blocks ( aka : Obama and Baucus ) and Wyden 's -- amount to huge giveaways and bailouts for the private insurance companies .
The mainstream Democrat " Building Blocks " plan increases costs overall , and to the federal government and for employers .
So when they talk about cost control they know they are lying .
Indeed , while the bipartisan Wyden plan saves the Federal Government money , it actually increases total costs even more and dumps those cost onto everybody else : states , employers , families and individuals .
So when somebody talks about the CBO analysis showing a plan is somehow good ( revenue neutral or saving the Federal government money ) , ask them if they know how it effects total costs and who pays more instead .
They are all being at best completely disingenuous .
Or just lying .
By the way , such analyses were done back in the early 1990s , including for single payer even though it too was off the table back then .
And they have also been done for various State reforms proposals through recent years .
You can find them here ( click and scroll down ) .
Now that the various plans are getting more specific , the CBO and / or GAO and / or OMB could do such an analyses :
" There must be a complete , honest , side - by - side comparison of all proposals , including HR - 676 , by the Congressional Budget Office .
The side - by - side comparison should include projected costs to state governments , employers and to households of different income levels .
For 2010 and beyond . "
Cat got your tongue ?
What happened to a male lion when he angered his jealous mate
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned .
And when that woman also happens to be a lioness , the male who scorned her should really keep out of the way .
Unfortunately for him , this male lion got a little to close to his angry mate - and suffered the consequences .
Do n't you dare :
The lioness catches the lion by his tongue as he tries to make his way to visit a neighbouring lioness in Botswana
You can almost see the hairs of the male 's mane being blown back as the lioness roars her displeasure at him
Wildlife photographer Lee Whittam was observing lions last December in the Okavango Delta in Botswana , when he captured the incredible moment the lioness clawed the lion 's tongue .
She had been whipping into a jealous rage after a neighbouring in - season lioness called to the lion , and was trying to stop him from crossing over to her .
But the male shook off her desperate attempts , crossing a channel of water to find the other female that was calling him .
For a brief moment , the male almost appears contrite - but he quickly got over that , succeeding in his efforts to reach the other female
Mr Whittam said an attack of this ferocity was unusual .
' I have n't personally seen such a vicious attack by a lioness in order to try and stop a male accessing another female , ' he said .
' Usually such intensity is reserved for protecting her cubs from a particular male . '
Described as ' the jewel of the Kalahari ' , the Okavango Delta is a widely considered one of Africa 's best safari destinations .
Encompassing deserts , rivers and lakes , the delta is teeming with lions , elephants , hyenas , wild dog , buffalo , hippo and crocodiles to name but a few .
One more time :
The lioness 's claw can actually be seen ripping at the lion 's tongue
' It was clear that the female that called to the male was in season and they started the pre-mating sequence , ' Mr Whittam said .
' This is where the female flirts with the male and then repels his advances .
' This can go on for several hours or several days and is basically the way the female tests if the male is really interested in her , and has the stamina to keep up with her and if so she will allow him to mate with her .

A knife - wielding burglar had a shock when he attacked a pensioner in his home - and discovered his victim was a retired boxer .
Senior citizen Frank Corti , 72 , a former junior boxing champion is still a bit handy with his dukes .
And when he spotted the aforementioned intruder , Gregory McCalium , in his hallway he sprang into action and delivered two right hooks .

Reluctant hero : Frank Corti , pictured here with his boxing trophies , is pleased with the sentence and has insisted that ' most people would have acted the same way '
The blows were so powerful that McCalium , who had just lunged at Mr Corti with the knife , was left looking like he had been in ' a car accident ' .
The pensioner then restrained him until police arrived .
He was jailed for four and a half years yesterday after a judge told him he had ' got what he deserved ' .
Glory days : Mr Corti pictured outside the Baliol Boys Club at the age of 16
After sentencing , Mr Corti said : ' I was scared when he first drew the knife but most people would have acted in the same way .
If you can't defend what 's yours , where are we at ? '
Oxford Crown
Court heard the break - in was the culmination of a long - running dispute over noise between the neighbours , who live in Botley , Oxford .
McCalium , a barman , was having a rowdy party at his house on August 18 last year when police turned up after a complaint from a neighbour .
McCalium assumed it had been made by Mr Corti - who won the National Association of Boys ' Clubs Championship in Birmingham when he was 16 - and broke into his neighbour 's home at 8 am the following day .
Mr Corti , who was with his wife Margaret at the time , dodged out of the way of his attacker 's lunge and punched him , giving him a black eye and a split lip , before subduing him .
McCalium was found guilty of aggravated burglary at a trial in March , during which he had claimed he could not remember the incident .
John Simmons , defending , said Mr Corti , who served with the Royal Engineers in North Africa from 1956 - 58 , had received minor injuries during the confrontation .
He added : ' Photographs of the defendant showed what looked like a car accident and photos of the scene looked more like a murder scene . '
Recorder Angela Morris said : ' Luckily , Mr Corti was an able - bodied 72 - year - old who was able to defend himself .
' The jury might well have concluded you got what you deserved when you entered that property and took a swipe at him with that weapon .
' The elderly and vulnerable people are entitled to demand the protection of courts from people like you who decide to take matters into your own hands and enter a property with a weapon . '
Mr Corti , a retired car worker , added : ' If needed to , I would do it again . '
During sentencing at Oxford Crown Court , Brian Payne , prosecuting , said : ' There was a struggle and it was clear Mr McCalium was intoxicated because his reactions were slow .
' It seems Mr McCalium ended up with far more serious injuries . '
Jailed : McCalium pictured partying on his Facebook page
After the sentencing , Detective Constable Jon Shaw said : ' Fortunately no - one was more injured in this incident but this was still a terrifying situation and McCalium must now pay for his actions .
' I hope that the victim , and his wife , might now be able to put this ordeal behind them and get on with their lives . '
During the trial , Mr Corti described how he had been woken during the night by noise from next door for several months before the incident .
Gregory McCalium had become involved in a long - running dispute with Mr Corti about noise
He told the court : ' They would slam the doors , then they would start partying .
You could hear shouting , screaming and music . '
Mr Corti said he called police when he found McCalium banging on the front door of his house at about 6.30 am .
Two hours later , he said , he came downstairs and saw bar worker McCalium in his hallway .
Mr Corti said : ' The accused produced a knife .
It was no ordinary knife , it was more like a six - bladed knuckle duster .
' He made a slashing movement at me .
I stepped back .
He missed me , fortunately . '
Mr Corti said that while McCalium was off balance , he grabbed both of his wrists and managed to pin his arms against the wall .
He added he asked McCalium to drop the knife but he would n’t .
Mr Corti said : ' I shouted to my wife to ring the police .
' I was absolutely petrified .
' As I saw it , it was a matter of do or die so I let his wrists go .
Fortunately the element of surprise was with me , so I adjusted my position and hit him with my right hand .
It was just below the eye .
' I did not knock him out , but he was stunned .
I heard the knife drop .
We grappled .
I was trying to drag him out of the back door .
We both fell to the floor .
I had to subdue him by punching him , which I did not take a great deal of pleasure in . ”
The jury heard he then lay on top of McCalium until the police arrived .

I hate to keep saying “ I told you so ” about Fourth Edition D&D , but there ’s a thread on TheRPGSite that talks about the new Rust Monster in the MMII .
I really ca n’t believe what I ’m reading .
As most of you know , in D&D the Rust Monster is a weird - looking mostly harmless critter feared by adventurers because of its diet .
It touches metal with its feathery antennae and cause it to rust into bits , then it eats the rust .
Well , apparently the thought of anyone losing a magic item is no longer tolerable to the Wizards designers .
Check it out :
Attack Mode : Dissolve Metal ( standard action ; per encounter ) •
Targets a creature wearing or wielding a rusting magic item of 10th level or lower or any non-magic rusting item ; +9 vs. Reflex ; the rusting item is destroyed .
Residuum Recovery •
A rust monster consumes any item it destroys .
The residuum from any magic items the monster has destroyed can be retrieved from its stomach .
The residuum is worth the market value of the item ( not one - fifth the value ) .
“ Residuum ” is the magic dust that you can disenchant 4e magic items into .
Normally , as part of their ridiculous and sad economic rules , it ’s only worth 20 % of the item ’s cost .
However , the Rust Monster now kindly keeps it at full price for you in its gullet .
There ’s an explicit rationale for this in the “ A Guide to Using Rust Monsters ” section in the MM2 which boils down to “ do n’t make any nine year olds cry ” …
Eventually , though , the PCs should have an opportunity to regain their lost equipment by using the residuum found in the monster .
Although a PC might lose an item , it is intended that the loss be only temporary , which is why the residuum recovered from a rust monster is equal to the full value of the destroyed item .
How the PCs deal with the loss is what makes the rust monster fun .
Be wary of PCs who try to abuse a rust monster ’s powers to their advantage by using rust monsters to consume items the PCs would otherwise sell for one - fifth value .
In such cases , you should reduce the resulting residuum to one - fifth value , effectively making the rust monster a free Disenchant Magic Item ritual .
What , they did n’t bother rule - izing that last part by giving it a “ Detect Intent ” power that would formally change the residuum value based on its reading of the character ’s mind ?
Seriously , come the fuck on .
Realism and consequences are not “ fun ” , according to Mearls and the other 4e writers .
All those people who have enjoyed playing any other edition of D&D must be confused .
Why not just take that small additional step and have characters respawn close to the dungeon with all their gear ?
God forbid a dead party member gets left behind or some other factor causes them to lose their stuff .
Or have un -fun trips to get raised or otherwise be out of the action for more than five minutes .
Some of the 4e community is dismissive of “ these tired comparisons of 4e to MMORPGs ” but – the truth ’s the truth .
This is a pure computer game move .
Heck , put spawn points in the dungeon .
I was amused recently when I got Unreal Tournament 3 on the XBox 360 and in the cutscenes they actually refer to the respawn points as real , in - world things .
Most games have the courtesy to pretend they do n’t really exist ( I know , it actually makes some sense in the UT universe …
But this is n’t XCrawl , it ’s D&D. ) .
Time for D&D to do the same thing !
Dying , gear loss , etc. should all be only moments of delay from getting back in the melee !
I mean , I ’m honestly not averse to that in some fringe take - off of the genre like XCrawl .
But in D&D ?
In a core world that supposedly might make some sense , like the fantasy worlds from those things called books people used to read ?
Really ?
On May 15 , workers inspecting a 52 - year - old machine in a small Ontario town discovered a slight water leak caused by corroded metal .
The machine 's owner announced it would be out of service until the problem could be identified and repairs made .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
That would not be national news except that the machine in question is the NRU nuclear reactor in Chalk River , owned by federal Crown corporation Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ( AECL ) .
And that reactor is the largest source in the world of a radioactive isotope important to medical imaging and diagnosis .
In the wake of the shutdown of the NRU reactor , the medical world is adapting as best it can by switching to tests that use other isotopes where possible , and by better coordinating to make the most of what isotope is available .
But those measures cannot change the fact that doctors will be making decisions without a tool they regularly use for more than 20,000 Canadian patients each week .
In the midst of the crisis , Federal Minister of Natural Resources Lisa Raitt announced an as - yet unnamed group of experts will advise the government on a plan for the long term supply of medical isotopes .
Ten years ago , Canada had a plan for a long term isotope supply .
It went by a name resonant with national pride , borrowing -- for better or worse -- Canada 's own brand identity .
It was a nuclear reactor technology called MAPLE .
As recently as last spring , AECL was planning to replace the problematic NRU reactor with twin MAPLE reactors already built at Chalk River .
That was supposed to ensure an uninterruptible supply of isotopes to Canada and the world at large .
But one year ago , AECL gave up hope of that ever happening .
And though today the private company that was supposed to own the MAPLE reactors wants the project restarted , there is no reliable estimate of when such a project could be operational .
What happened ?
Why is Canada , for so long the world 's top supplier of medical isotopes , now scrambling for new ideas at the same time as doctors worldwide are scrambling for isotopes ?
The troubled story of the MAPLE reactors is a case study in what can go wrong when government funding , private business interests , and new nuclear technology mix .
What could go wrong , for example , was a project resulting in three lawsuits against the federal government by its private partner , the latest of which is still not resolved .
And no one has ever precisely tallied the hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer 's money poured into pursuing the MAPLE solution that has n't solved anything .
Seeds of MAPLE
The MAPLE project originated at AECL in the 1980s .
In 1991 , when the Mulroney government sold AECL 's isotope processing division -- Nordion -- to health products company MDS Inc. , the plan was to build a single , small reactor dedicated to the production of medical isotopes .
In 1993 , with the federal government slashing budgets across the board , MAPLE was cancelled .
Even before the announcement was made , MDS had launched a lawsuit , seeking $ 300 million in compensation for the loss in value of Nordion .
Without a guaranteed source of isotopes from a reactor , what good is an isotope processing company ?
The lawsuit was resolved out of court in 1996 , and resulted in a much grander plan for MAPLE .
MDS Nordion would hire AECL to build and operate not one , but two MAPLE reactors , plus a new processing facility , which would all be owned by MDS .
The federal government kicked in some up - front funding and a $ 100 - million interest - free loan to MDS Nordion .
Either one of the MAPLE reactors would be able to fill the entire global demand of the most commonly used isotope , Molybdenum - 99 ( the one at the centre of the recent shortages ) .
The second reactor would operate as a back up -- when one was shut down for maintenance or repairs , the other would be running , ensuring a continuous supply .
The first MAPLE reactor was supposed to be operational in 2000 , but problems with quality control caused delays while parts were replaced .
It was n't until 2003 that the reactor was tested at high power .
And that 's when the real problems began .
To operate a nuclear reactor in Canada ( or any other Western country ) , the people in charge must convince the nuclear regulator that the reactor will safely shut down if anything goes wrong .
To do this , physicists and engineers develop complicated models of how the reactor will behave under any condition .
The MAPLE reactors were not behaving the way the model predicted , and no one knew why .
In 2005 , with the project grossly over budget and no solution in sight , MDS Nordion launched another lawsuit .
The result was another out - of - court agreement , settled in 2006 .
Under the 2006 agreement , AECL bought the MAPLE reactors and associated facilities from MDS for $ 25 million and the liability for all future costs .
In return , the companies signed a 40 - year isotope supply contract , with an increase in price scheduled for whenever the MAPLEs started producing .
In May 2008 , after a few more disappointing tests on the MAPLE -- and with the entire Crown corporation under review by the government -- AECL announced the project was ( once again ) cancelled .
Shortly thereafter , MDS Nordion announced they would ( once again ) sue .
Still chasing the dream
In 2007 , just six months before the cancellation of the MAPLE project , the NRU reactor was shut down for a month when regulators realized that promised safety upgrades had never been implemented .
AECL argued that the missing equipment was not required by their operating licence .
But they still did not turn the reactor back on until Parliament passed emergency legislation suspending the licensing requirement .
The incident caused a global shortage of isotopes , and political uproar here in Canada .
In the aftermath , health professionals in Canada and internationally emphasized the importance of getting new isotope supplies as soon as possible .
So when the project that was closest to being able to do that was cancelled , it raised serious concerns among many in the nuclear medicine community .
A United States National Academy of Sciences report on medical isotope supplies ( published in January 2009 ) described the decision to end MAPLE as " a blow to worldwide supply reliability . "
A year after that decision , with another -- likely much more serious -- isotope shortage starting , MDS Nordion decided to remind Canadians of the reactors that should have prevented the problem .
" MDS Nordion urges Government of Canada to complete MAPLE project to address current medical isotope supply shortage " was the headline on their press release .
To support their argument , the company distributed an article written by a former member of the MAPLE testing team .
In it , Harold J. Smith argued that " The MAPLE reactor operated like a dream , and was fully capable of meeting all objectives " if testing and modifications had been continued .
MDS Nordion also pointed to the American report on isotope supply , which argued that the cost of fixing the MAPLE reactors -- even if it meant completely replacing the reactor core with a different design -- would still be less than building a new reactor somewhere else .
Executives at MDS Nordion clearly have strong financial reasons for wanting the MAPLE project revived -- but that does not mean they are wrong .
The President of AECL , Hugh MacDiarmid , recently told federal MPs that it would take " many years and many millions of dollars " to get the reactors operational , dismissing the suggestion that the MAPLEs could be a short term solution .
MDS Nordion spokesperson Jill Chitra disagrees .
" If you look at some of the international experts ' opinions , they believe there are ways to solve the problem so the reactors can operate intrinsically safely , " she said , suggesting this could happen in a matter of months .
Given the long history of technical problems with MAPLE , the most difficult part of that plan might be convincing the independent members of the regulatory board that safety could be guaranteed without fully understanding why the reactor was not responding as it had been designed to do .
In the longer term , technical solutions could surely be found .
The real question is who would be willing to accept the financial risk to invest in the reactors ?
MDS Nordion would " look at all angles " and " would be open to those kinds of discussions , " said Chitra when asked by The Tyee if the company would be willing to pay for a revived MAPLE project .
But Chitra also pointed to the large sums of money that AECL ( and therefore taxpayers ) will be paying to fix up the NRU reactor .
" Maybe it 's a better idea to make modifications to the MAPLEs -- invest money in a brand new reactor , to have it operate safely -- than to invest money in a 50 year old reactor ... that has an inherently short life . "
Others might argue that it makes more sense to invest in a proven technology than in something that has never worked quite as it should .
Looking to the future
The government has not completely dismissed the possibility of reviving MAPLE .
Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt has said the MDS proposal would be considered by the expert panel that will advise the government on long - term isotope supply .
The government has so far made no commitments about what it will do with the panel 's advice -- only that it will " provide a solid factual basis to support sound decision making " .
But there are at least three other projects that would happily receive federal funding to develop new sources of isotopes .
As the current isotope shortage was getting underway , the federal and Ontario governments announced funding support for upgrades to a research reactor at McMaster University in Hamilton .
One of the intended uses is isotope production , although the reactor would have limited capacity .
Here in British Columbia , TRIUMF laboratories , which operate particle accelerators , are investigating a new approach to making Molybdenum - 99 which would not require a nuclear reactor or enriched uranium .
In April , they finalized a partnership agreement with MDS Nordion .
Then there 's the Canadian Neutron Centre , the long delayed proposal for a research reactor to replace the NRU 's experimental functions .
After MAPLE was cancelled , scientists advocating for the project revised the design to include isotope production .
And that 's only in Canada .
Internationally , there are a number of options for new isotope sources that could start producing in the next five to ten years .
In the United States , the University of Missouri is pushing for funding to upgrade its research reactor to manufacture isotopes .
Other American companies are pursuing an accelerator - based technique and a novel design for an isotopes - only reactor .
In Australia , the recently built OPAL reactor is scheduled to start producing medical isotopes later this year .
The agency that operates OPAL has said they may be able to ramp up production sooner than planned to assist with an extended global shortage .
In France , a research reactor currently under construction should supplement supplies starting in 2016 .
European partners are also planning to replace the Dutch reactor that currently matches the NRU in isotope production .
Regardless of whether the MAPLEs are replanted , or the NRU reactor refurbished , or whether TRIUMF succeeds with its made - in - B.C. accelerator isotopes , Canada 's dominance of the medical isotope industry is going to fade .
For over a decade , the MAPLE reactors were promoted as a way to create a reliable isotope supply .
Instead , their back - and - forth saga demonstrated the risks of relying on any one solution .
It 's a lesson the international medical community is embracing .
The more sources of isotopes , the less likely there will be shortages .
The world is no longer expecting Canada to supply medical isotopes in the long term .
Any new project here will be competing against the projects being planned internationally .
But if the Canadian government is going to partner in any of these projects , citizens need to know what the economic prospects are .
We also need to know who will foot the bill if we end up part - owners of another over - budget , under - performing technology .

Recently Spokane Landscaping was nominated as one of the best landscaping companies in Spokane Washington .
Being nominated is an awesome achievement because it lets everyone know that you are a company worth hiring .
Not all landscapers will come out on top , in fact doing a quick Google search for local Spokane landscapers you will see that many have horrible reviews , while others have great reviews .
We wo n’t point out names or business names , but a simple search will quickly tell you who is the best of the best and who you should avoid , if looking for a lawn care company .
Spokane Landscaping has been in business since 1997 which gives them veteran status .
Growing a business over the years especially in tough economic times takes a lot of work .
Work that should be recognized .
Jesse , the owner of Spokane Landscaping currently employes 12 full time staff including one full time office administrator .
“ If the crew is n’t working a job then we are out actively looking for business , either by posting signs or talking to other local business owners ” , says Jesse .
“ We found that most of our business is either repeat customers , they were referred to us from a current customer or they saw us working in their local neighborhood and called us from our phone number on the side of the truck ” .
We spoke with Jesse about how he came out on top , here is a break down of some of his responses .
To be one of the better landscaping companies in a city , you have to step up your game .
You have to market yourself and make sure as many people know about you and can recognize you later .
Its all about being in the front of their mind on a weekly basis .
If you see a company working in your local area on a constant basis you are going to remember their name .
So when you actually need their services they will be the first company you call , because they are the ones you actually remember .
Referrals are and will always be the biggest boost to any business .
It ’s vital that any business owner manages their reputation as best as possible .
Obviously if you did a bad job , then expect to get a bad rating , but as a business owner you can always try to make things better .
Always be looking for those opportunities to over deliver .
Most people will leave a bad review because they were over promised and under delivered , either on service and / or quality of work performed .
Its can be a challenge building a landscaping business in Spokane .
Half of the year its extremely hot so most people want their sprinkler systems serviced or they are shopping for a new sprinkler system .
If they do n’t have a sprinkler system then most likely their grass is dead and wo n’t come back to life until late fall .
By then we are starting to get snow so our season ends .
That is why Spokane Landscaping will be expanding out to other ‘ seasonal ’ jobs such as snow plowing , de-icing , etc .

The gluten - free food market was worth almost $ 1.6 bn last year , according to Packaged Facts , and saw a compound annual growth rate of 28 per cent over four years .
Sufferers of celiac disease have to avoid all gluten in their diet , but diagnosis is not the only factor .
Other sectors of the population , such as those who have self - diagnosed wheat or gluten intolerance or who believe gluten - free to be a healthier way of eating , are strong drivers .
But against this backdrop of popularity , there have been concerns that some gluten - free products on the market made with rice , corn and potato flour and xanthan or guar gum to improve texture have sub-optimal levels of essential nutrients .
ConAgra Mills set out to develop flour that has good nutritional properties by tapping its portfolio of naturally gluten - free ancient grains , like amaranth , quinoa , sorghum , millet and teff .
A spokesperson told FoodNavigator - USA.com at IFT in Anaheim last week that the individual ancient grain flours can be used to make gluten - free products , but the product quality tends to be lower .
The company therefore developed a proprietary blend of grains and tapioca starch , intended to provide both good nutrition and good product characteristics .
The result , called Eagle Mills gluten - free all - purpose multigrain flour , was launched at IFT .
Also containing tapioca starch , it can be used in products including pan bread , tortillas , muffins , snacks , coatings and extruded cereals .
Ancient grains ​
The unveiling of the new flour is timely since the Harvard Health Letter drew attention to the nutritional issues of gluten - free eating just this month , and criticising manufacturers for profiting from making good tasting gluten - free products that were nutritionally poor .
Melinda Dennis , nutrition coordinator at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Celiac Center , said people should look to “ unconventional but nutritionally well - rounded substitutes ” ​ for gluten - containing grains .
Dennis dubbed the ancient grains amaranth , buckwheat , teff , millet , quinoa and sorghum the “ super six ” ​ because of their high nutritional value .
Even outside the gluten - free niche , ancient grains have been attracting attention amongst healthy eaters .
While they have been staples for civilizations around the world for millennia , in the West , they have fallen off the menu in favour of wheat and barley .
Amaranth , for example , has been eaten in Mexico since the time of the Aztecs ; and in Ethiopia , teff is the main ingredient in the stable fermented flatbread injera .
In its recent report The US Market for Whole and Other Grains , ​ Datamonitor said ancient grains have become more popular recently due to more attention to their nutritional value – but more education is needed on how to cook them properly .
Tired of paying $ 50 a year or more for anti-malware software ?
Then this will likely appeal to you : Microsoft is about to release the beta for its highly - anticipated and free Microsoft Security Essentials ( MSE ) .
Codenamed ' Morro , ' the anti-malware product will eclipse its mostly unpopular Live OneCare suite with a new , simplified alternative .
Microsoft Security Essentials beta will be available next Tuesday , and will run on the company 's most popular operating systems , including Windows XP , Windows Vista , and the upcoming Windows 7 .
A number of versions will be available for international users , including residents of the U.S. , Brazil , and Israel .
A public beta for Chinese users will be available sometime later this year .
( Source : reuters.com )
The Usual Treatment -- For a Lot Less
The software works like most any other anti-malware program : it constantly monitors the status of a PC and alerts the user if something changes on the computer , including the downloading or modification of files .
Microsoft Security Essentials is programmed to check these changes against malware signatures to verify whether or not the threat is known malware .
If that 's the case , then the threat is blocked .
There are even security measures built in to help identify new malware and update the system to protect against it .
" The hope is that people who install Security Essentials and enable auto updates in their Windows configuration will be protected , " said Alan Packer , GM of Microsoft 's anti-malware group .
( Source : cnet.com )
MS Security Essentials : Versus Competitors
Competitors like Grisoft AVG ( freeware antivirus ) argue that they have similar software that costs nothing and protects just as much as MSE .
However , Microsoft counters that unlike other companies it wo n't constantly natter users to upgrade -- something which is definitely worth considering .
Biologists long thought they understood how genetic mutations cause disease .
But recent work has revealed an important twist in the tale and uncovered surprising — even counterintuitive — ways that alterations in DNA can make people sick .
The classic view assumed that what are termed “ silent ” mutations were inconsequential to health , because such changes in DNA would not alter the composition of the proteins encoded by genes .
Proteins function in virtually every process carried out by cells , from catalyzing biochemical reactions to recognizing foreign invaders .
Hence , the thinking went , if a protein ’s makeup ends up being correct , any small glitches in the process leading to its construction could not do a body harm .

Risk Analysis Approach to Rainwater Harvesting Systems - Urban rainwater reuse preserves water resources and promotes sustainable development in rapidly growing urban areas .
The efficiency of a large number of urban water reuse systems , operating under different climate and demand conditions , is evaluated here on the base of a new risk analysis approach .
Results obtained by probability analysis ( PA ) indicate that maximum efficiency in low demanding scenarios is above 0.5 and a threshold , distinguishing low from high demanding scenarios , indicates that in low demanding scenarios no significant improvement in performance may be attained by increasing the storage capacity of rainwater harvesting tanks . >>

Impressive Property Rains Down with Green Water Tech -
However , what ’s most fascinating is the property ’s use of additional green features such as multi-zoned radiant heat , graywater distribution system and a 6,000 - gallon storm water collection system .
Let the rainwater harvesting commence - For many years , Coloradans have been banned from using rain barrels to collect and store rainwater at their homes .
Things are changing now , thanks to Gov. Hickenlooper signing House Bill 16-1005 , which allows 110 gallons of rainwater to be stored and used on residential properties .
This measure takes effect on Wednesday .
Here are some important facts to help you understand this new law .
June 2016
Codes are the Last Obstacle to Wider Use of Graywater in Homes - Today , the technology and know - how exists to take graywater from washing machines and showers — as well as rainwater collected from roofs — and use that water to flush toilets and irrigate landscapes .
That same water can be brought back into the house , treated , and used yet again .
It makes a lot of sense and saves a lot of water , so why is n't it happening , or even mandated , everywhere ?
Time has come to care for water like it ’s precious - Even in a spring dry by Maine standards , it ’s hard to envision how parched some places can become .
Water scarcity is increasingly coming to define landscapes and lives .
By the start of 2015 , NASA calculated that California had reached a water deficit of 11 trillion gallons ( roughly 93 times all the water used annually by Maine households ) .
Global thirst will only grow as the world warms .
A new World Bank report , High and Dry , warns that water scarcity – aggravated by climate change – could lead to economic losses and heightened conflicts .
Potential of Rainwater Harvesting and Greywater Reuse for Water Consumption Reduction and Wastewater Minimization - Northeastern Mexico is a semiarid region with water scarcity and a strong pressure on water sources caused by the rapid increase of population and industrialization .
In this region , rainwater harvesting alone is not enough to meet water supply demands due to the irregular distribution of rainfall in time and space .
Thus , in this study the reliability of integrating rainwater harvesting with greywater reuse to reduce water consumption and minimize wastewater generation .
How capturing rain could save Mexico City from a water crisis - More than 10 million Mexicans lack access to safe water and its capital , Mexico City , is ranked third on the list of cities facing an extreme water crisis .
But this is not because of natural water scarcity .
In fact , Mexico City receives roughly five months of rain a year and is notorious for flooding .
The problem is due to the the city ’s infrastructure and mismanagement of water .
In Mexico City , around 70 % of water is extracted by aquifers , more than the amount that can be naturally recharged .
This is where Isla Urbana comes in .
In 2009 , the founding team of engineers , designers and sociologists designed a rainwater harvesting system to enable communities to catch rain , filter it and use it for the greater part of the year , without having to depend on an unsustainable system .

It 's Official : Eating Food Watered by ( Treated ) Greywater is Fine -
In dry or arid areas , from Israel to California , water use can be tightly regulated , especially for gardens .
But there 's another source of water that 's going unused , and a new study suggests we should take a closer look at it .
Water conservation types like to talk about the three basic types of water for use in agriculture : blue , green , and grey .
Blue water is clean , withdrawn from reservoirs , groundwater , and rivers .
Green water is rain .
And grey water is used , or dirty water , but not so used that it has no possible reuses .
So that disqualifies toilet water , which has to be treated more intensely ( sewage is known as “ black water ” ) , but the leftovers from your sink or bathtub has a lot of possibilities . >>

Why it makes little sense to regulate rainwater barrels in the dry western U.S. - Western water law means collecting rainwater was legal only a few years ago in some states .
Many of us never think about who gets to use the drops of rain that fall from the sky .
But it ’s an increasingly pertinent question as more people look to collect rainwater as a way to conserve water , live off the grid or save money on water bills .
As a result , many states in the arid West are now asking whether rain barrels are allowed under existing law and policy and , in some cases , are setting limits on the practice of rainwater catchment . >> more

“ Just make sure it ’s covered .
And the container should be black and not emit light .
Otherwise , algae can grow in there . ”
One of the benefits of using rainwater for watering plants is that it contains no salt , which can deter plant growth .
Using gray water is another way to make the most of every drop .
“ Gray water includes water from the bathroom sink , tub , and washing machine , ” Anderson said .

Rainfall variability in terms of coefficient of variation ranges from 24 - 39 % and 26 - 41 % for the seasons and months .
Domestic rainwater harvesting has the potential to meet 27.51 % - 54.91 % of non-potable household water demand as well as 78.34 % - 156.38 % of household potable water demand for a six - member household .
It is highly encouraged as a supplementary water source especially in rural and peri-urban areas to reduce their vulnerability to acute shortage of water infrastructure . >>

Saving Water : Simple ways to hold on to the rain - With El Niño - related storms providing much - needed rain , why let it go down the drain ?
Angelenos can tap into the age - old practice of rainwater harvesting , a process that saves both water and money .
The idea is to keep as much water in places where it is needed .
Collecting and recycling rainwater minimizes the amount of water lost in storm drains and offers plants water that is naturally soft and free of chemicals . >> more

How hands on is he with the project : “ Oh , massively .
The first film I did , Wanted , I just dropped by for a few meetings , talked to the guys about the script , dropped by the set to shake everyone ’s hands and then went home .
But with Kick - Ass , it ’s been unbelievable .
Matthew did the same thing with Neil Gaiman on Stardust , where basically Matthew and I spent weeks and weeks on the phone every day for a couple of hours while he was writing the screenplay .
Then I would get out to his house , and we ’d spend days blocking it all out and so on and changing stuff and nailing it down .
Then there was the casting process , where , every day , we were looking at actors and actresses , and that took weeks and weeks and weeks .
We almost could n’t find our lead , because there was nobody we liked , and then Aaron just came in at the last minute .
I was involved in the costume design , set design and then just on set for , I do n’t know , three days a week for the whole shoot .
And now I ’m involved with the editing .
So Matthew has been brilliant .
I got paid to be a producer on Wanted , and it was n’t a great deal of work , but Matthew has actually had me really involved at each stage , which I appreciate a lot .
It ’s very satisfying to see it coming together the way you want to . ”
On Wanted vs. Kick Ass : “ Wanted made $ 350 million .
So that was the thing that opened the doors .
I did n’t expect that .
For some reason I just assumed , “ Oh , yeah , this will come out and do OK .
If I get another movie at some point , wonderful . ”
But what happened very quickly was that several of the titles got picked up to be made into movies .
Kick - Ass. War Heroes .
I ’m doing American Jesus .
Kick - Ass 2 is already being plotted out .
We ’re planning it , because all the actors are quite young and we have to make it relatively quickly .
So we ’ll definitely do that inside the next 18 to 24 months .
Wanted made a fortune .
It made a ton of money , and it was a property nobody had ever heard of .
And I think Kick - Ass is going to be even bigger .
Everybody who ’s seen bits of it were rubbing their hands together with excitement because they think they ’ve stumbled onto something very big .
So I ca n’t complain .
It ’s not been a genius plan of mine or anything .
It ’s just been a bunch of happy accidents that led to this . ”
recently spoke with SCI FI Wire about the adaptation of “ “ , which follows a 16 - year - old who decides to become a superhero , and revealed that the development for “ ” is happening .
Millar is motivated by the fact that “ Wanted ” made tons of money and the prediction that the upcoming adaptation “ Kick - Ass ” will be just as successful .

Friday Q&A 2009 - 06-05 : Introduction to Valgrind
Welcome back to another late Friday Q&A .
My apologies to all of my readers for missing last week 's edition .
Some family events beyond the scope of this blog prevented me from writing one .
And I should probably point out right now that WWDC is almost certainly going to prevent me from writing one next week .
This week , however , I do have a post , and I 'm going to be talking about Valgrind as suggested by Landon Fuller .
What It Is
A few months ago I talked about the Clang Static Analyzer and how it could help you find bugs in your code .
Valgrind is a similar sort of program except it checks for errors at runtime instead .
There 's an entire class of bugs which are easy to write and difficult to track down in C - based languages , such as reading from uninitialized memory or writing past the end of an array .
Reading from uninitialized memory just gives junk values and a lot of times those junk values actually work .
Writing past the end of an array is frequently harmless since arrays are generally backed by storage that 's larger than what was requested .
Because of this , these code bugs might only show up as crashes rarely .
For really bad ones , they never crash , but just cause bad behavior .
Figuring out what piece of code is causing the misbehavior can be extremely difficult .
Thus Valgrind .
The way it works is it essentially runs your program inside an emulator .
By doing this , it has total control over everything your program does .
Something that 's undetectable when running on the processor , like reading from a memory location that was never initialized , suddenly becomes easy to see .
There are some downsides to this approach .
The most obvious one is that the target program runs about an order of magnitude slower than it normally would , due to being run under emulation .
A less obvious downside is that Valgrind needs to know the behavior of every syscall in order to make everything work properly , and right now on the Mac there are some missing ones .
For example , QuickTime uses the aio family of functions which are n't currently supported by Valgrind , so QuickTime wo n't work .
Still , lots of things do work , and you can run an entire Cocoa application under Valgrind .
How to Get It
Valgrind 's Mac support has only recently been merged into their main code repository , and is not yet available as an official release .
This means that , for now , the only way to get it is by pulling down their subversion repository :
$ svn co svn : //svn.valgrind.org/valgrind/trunk valgrind
README
$ cd valgrind $ . / autogen . sh $ . / configure $ make $ sudo make install
valgrind
From there , building it is like any other UNIX program .
Read theor just do this :
At this point you should be able to run Valgrind .
You can give it a quick test by just typingin the shell .
Note that as far as I know , Valgrind for Mac only works on Intel machines .
If you have a PowerPC Mac you 're probably out of luck , although there 's no harm in trying .
$ sudo / usr / local / hermes / bin / hermesctl unload $ sudo / usr / local / hermes / bin / hermesctl load Note : in the course of preparing this post I discovered an unfortunate incompatibility between Valgrind and Rogue Amoeba 's Instant Hijack .
We 're looking into a fix but for now , if you have Instant Hijack installed , you 'll need to temporarily disable it before using Valgrind .
( You 'll know this is happening to you if Valgrind immediately crashes with a SIGTRAP . )
You can do this like so :
And when you 're done using Valgrind , you can re-enable it like so :
Finding Bugs
Let 's take a look at this example program :
#include < stdlib.h > # include < stdio.h > # include < string.h > char * bad_strdup ( char * s ) { char * ret = malloc ( strlen ( s ) ) ; strcpy ( ret , s ) ; return ret ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { char * str = " hello world " ; char * str2 = bad_strdup ( str ) ; int i ; printf ( " %s
" , str2 ) ; printf ( " %d
" , i ) ; free ( str2 ) ; return 0 ; }
i
bad_strdup
NUL
This program contains two bugs .
One of them is really obvious : it prints the value ofat the end , even though that variable was never initialized .
One of them is more subtle : does n't allocate enough memory to hold thebyte at the end of the string .
This would normally go undetected , because memory allocations are padded , and that extra byte is often available .
It would only fail when the string length were a nice round number , and even then it might simply fail by overwriting something else and causing corrupted data far later .
Let 's compile and run with Valgrind :
$ gcc - g valgrind .
c $ valgrind . / a . out == 4296 == Memcheck , a memory error detector . == 4296 == Copyright ( C ) 2002 - 2009 , and GNU GPL ' d , by Julian Seward et al . == 4296 == Using LibVEX rev 1899 , a library for dynamic binary translation .

B . dylib ) == 4296 == by 0x1FD9 : main ( valgrind . c : 18 ) ...
I 've snipped off the report here even though it goes on quite a bit longer .
The important stuff is here .
First , we see an invalid write past the end of the memory block .
It says how big the write is , the exact stack trace where it happened , the address where it happened , how big the block really was , and where it was allocated .
This is all incredibly useful stuff .
Following that we get an invalid read because we then print that string and it ends up reading this same memory location .
After that you can see it successfully printing " hello world " , then it tries to print the uninitialized i , which it immediately catches and complains about .
Valgrind appears to cascade the uninitialized state of memory as that memory moves around , as it complains about uninitialized memory access many , many times during the course of printing ( most of which I cut out for the sake of brevity ) .
This bug manifests in an obvious way here , but it 's not uncommon to have uninitialized variable reads which cause much more subtle bugs than this .
Conclusion
It 's easy to write extremely difficult bugs in C and C - based languages , and Valgrind is an incredibly useful tool for discovering and tracking down these bugs , and we 're fortunate to have a tool of this caliber available on the Mac .
That wraps up this edition of Friday Q&A .

No one can watch everything all the time in the fast - paced IT sector .
But it 's pretty hard to do something - or not do it - and get it past the readers of El Reg .
Recently , a reader told us that server maker Hewlett - Packard was no longer offering support for the Debian distribution of Linux on its servers .
And according to HP 's website , that appeared to be the case .
But as it turns out , HP is still supporting Debian ( in a sense ) .
What it does n't offer is formal support for Ubuntu .
And it has no plans to .
Back in August 2006 , HP made a big stink about providing full support for the Debian variant of Linux on ProLiant rack and tower servers and its BladeSystem blade servers , giving Debian equally billing alongside Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Novell SUSE Linux .
By support , I do n't mean testing and certification for compatibility between the server and the operating system , but installation and follow - on tech support .
HP had been using Debian internally on its own clusters as well as in telecommunications and HPC customer engagements since 1995 , the dawning of the commercial Linux age .
HP 's support for Debian distributions on its servers came just a month after Canonical - arguably the dominant commercial Linux distro based on Debian code - launched its first server variant , Ubuntu 7.10 .
With Ubuntu growing in popularity , you might think that HP would be inclined - particularly in emerging markets in Africa and Asia - to enthusiastically support Ubuntu on the server as its preferred Debian .
HP will for a fee install any operating system you can provide media for if it does n't have a reseller agreement of its own .
So if you want to have any Debian release or Ubuntu in particular on your server , HP will do that for you for a fee .
But that is not the same thing as offering full tech support through the same CarePack support contracts that Microsoft Windows , Red Hat Enterprise Linux , and Novell SUSE Linux enjoy on x64 boxes .
An intrepid reader sent El Reg an email saying that Debian had disappeared from the official server operating system support matrix , and when I looked to verify this on the list , it was indeed gone .
( I printed the page out , so I know I am not misremembering ) .
And , lo and behold , just as I was writing this story and getting ready to call HP , not only did Debian Linux reappear on the support matrix , but so did Asianux for the Asian server space , Mandriva Linux for the French market , CentOS as an alternative to RHEL , and the Fedora and openSUSE development releases .
Now , do n't get too excited .
Debian support by HP when it comes to servers is a lot less enthusiastic than for RHEL or SLES , or even Oracle 's clone of RHEL , Oracle Enterprise Linux .
HP 's Debian support consists of HP working with the Debian community when a bug arises to get a fix , which is slightly less tight loop than for RHEL , SLES , and OEL .
If there are defects in the iron or in HP systems software relating to Debian , HP steps up and provides a fix .
It seems odd that HP would support OEL but put Ubuntu in the same category as CentOS , Fedora , and openSUSE .
But according to an email received by this reader from HP 's support organization , you can forget about official Ubuntu support unless more server buyers make some noise .
HP might do well to listen to its own end users :
" A number of us at HP run Ubuntu on our systems , " said this HP support staffer in response to a question about Ubuntu support in an email exchange .
" In fact , I 'm writing this reply using an HP nc2400 running Ubuntu 9.04 .
However , HP does n't plan to support Ubuntu on any of its products at this time .
As the global enterprise and open source leader who supports Linux as a tier 1 operating system , HP is continually evaluating which products can be Linux certified or supported .
We appreciate your business and value your partnership with us . "
But not enough to cut a deal with Canonical and share some Ubuntu support contract money .
Somebody has to go first among the tier one server makers and put the server horse in front of the Ubuntu cart .
And it used to be that it was Compaq HP that often did . ®
The army in Sri Lanka said yesterday that two prominent members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) had surrendered , as the military advanced on the shrinking patch of territory the rebels still hold on the island 's north - east coast .
With the number of Tamil civilians fleeing the conflict zone surpassing 100,000 in three days , according to army estimates , President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the LTTE 's supreme leader Velupillai Prabhakaran had lost any chance of being pardoned .
The men the military says have surrendered are Daya Master , a one - time schoolteacher who for years was the Tamil Tigers ' voice to the English - speaking world , and a translator named George , who worked for the late head of their political wing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The two came out with civilians and surrendered to the army , " said Sri Lanka 's military spokesman , Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara , " They were not trying to escape . "
Nor had they tried to commit suicide using cyanide vials around their neck as loyal followers of Mr Prabhakaran , the group 's founder - leader , are famously schooled to do .
The brigadier said there might be rehabilitation processes available to the two men , but it was for the government to decide .
Meanwhile President Rajapaksa said the reclusive Mr Prabhakaran had spurned the possibility of pardon and " must now face the consequences of his acts " .
The government believes it is within days of delivering a final blow to the LTTE and ending 25 years of civil war , which has pitted the Sinhalese - dominated army against the feared guerrilla group which calls itself the sole legitimate representative of the island 's Tamil minority .
Many observers point out , however , that whatever the successes of the current military campaign , ceasefires have failed in the past , and this is an island still plagued by a bitter ethnic divide which will eventually need a political solution .
The rebels have now been pushed back into a tiny , sweltering coastal pocket , into which the military says it has just made further , sweeping inroads .
It is thought that perhaps 100,000 civilians remain cramped in makeshift shelters completely exposed to the crossfire of what the government believes is the endgame of Asia 's longest running conflict .
Independent verification of events in the conflict zone is difficult to come by as journalists have been prevented from having access .
However aid workers say that many of the people who have escaped since the army blasted through a rebel fortification early on Monday are in a wretched state , sick and badly wounded .
Staff of the Médecins sans Frontières ( MSF ) charity working at one of the hospitals treating the refugees , in the town of Vavuniya , say most of their injuries come from landmines , shrapnel and shellfire .
Vavuniya lies about 65 miles inland from the conflict zone , but MSF quoted its mental health worker , Karen Stewart , as saying the shelling could be heard even from there .
" Almost everyone has left someone behind in the conflict area , " she said .
" Probably 85 per cent of the people I 've talked to have witnessed horrific things , like being in a bunker , and suddenly a shell goes and it's killed half the people in the bunker .
Someone else I spoke to told me how she went out to find some water and when she came back everyone in her bunker was dead . "
Ms Stewart described the situation in the main hospital as chaotic , with 1,200 patients but a bed capacity of just over 400 , and many lying on the floor .
Near Vavuniya , the authorities are using schools to accommodate refugees newly bused in from the war zone .
They are building what are called relief villages to house them but are struggling to allocate enough shelter with proper sanitation .

As concern for those left behind mounts , governments including Britain and India have urged Sri Lanka to allow a further pause in their offensive and let more civilians out .
But the authorities in Colombo say there is now no going back , and insist that the mass exodus of civilians – in far greater numbers than they had ever acknowledged were trapped inside – means another cessation of their campaign is unnecessary .
Yesterday more criticism came from Washington .
The Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , said : " I think that the Sri Lankan government knows that the entire world is very disappointed that , in its efforts to end what it sees as 25 years of conflict , it is causing such untold suffering . "
The UN Security Council was last night expected to hold an informal meeting on Sri Lanka .
China and Russia so far have opposed attempts to bring up Sri Lanka officially at the council .
Dead or alive ?
The head of the Tamil Tigers
Will the leader of the Tamil Tigers go down with his troops ?
Is he still alive ?
For more than 30 years Velupillai Prabhakaran has evaded capture in the jungles of northern Sri Lanka where he has waged a brutal military campaign to create a Tamil homeland .
The 54 - year - old founder of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) has ordered his bodyguards to kill him if he is cornered .
Like members of his infamous Black Tiger suicide squad , Prabhakaran also wears cyanide capsules around his neck at all times .
Critics describe a ruthless terrorist leader who brutally suppressed any Tamil opposition to the Tigers .
But to millions of Tamils he is lionised as a freedom fighter and lovingly referred to as " Thamby " ( little brother ) .
But whether he is still leading the Tigers ' last stand , or is even alive , remains to be seen .
Both the military and the LTTE insist that he is on the front lines but some speculate he fled weeks ago in a boat during heavy fighting and is in hiding in south India , Malaysia or Cambodia .

ENTER the main cardiac operating - room at Bangalore 's Wockhardt hospital on a typical morning , and you will find a patient on the operating table with a screen hanging between his head and chest .
On a recent visit the table was occupied by a middle - aged Indian man whose serene look suggested that he was ready for the operation to come .
Asked how he was , he smiled and answered in Kannada that he felt fine .
Only when you stand on a stool to look over the screen do you realise that his chest cavity has already been cut open .
As the patient was chatting away , Vivek Jawali and his team had nearly completed his complex heart bypass .
Because such “ beating heart ” surgery causes little pain and does not require general anaesthesia or blood thinners , patients are back on their feet much faster than usual .
This approach , pioneered by Wockhardt , an Indian hospital chain , has proved so safe and successful that medical tourists come to Bangalore from all over the world .
This is just one of many innovations in health care that have been devised in India .
Its entrepreneurs are channelling the country 's rich technological and medical talent towards frugal approaches that have much to teach the rich world 's bloated health - care systems .
Dr Jawali is feted today as a pioneer , but he remembers how Western colleagues ridiculed him for years for advocating his inventive “ awake surgery ” .
He thinks that snub reflects an innate cultural advantage enjoyed by India .
Unlike the hidebound health systems of the rich world , he says , “ in our country 's patient - centric health system you must innovate . ”
This does not mean adopting every fancy new piece of equipment .
Over the years he has rejected surgical robots and “ keyhole surgery ” kit because the costs did not justify the benefits .
Instead , he has looked for tools and techniques that spare resources and improve outcomes .
Shivinder Singh , head of Fortis , a rival hospital chain based in New Delhi , says that most of the new , expensive imaging machines are only a little better than older models .
Meanwhile , vast markets for poorer patients go unserved .
“ We got out of this arms race a few years ago , ” he says .
Fortis now promises only that its scanners are “ world class ” , not the newest .
Mr Singh is not alone in thinking that many firms in the rich world are looking at innovation the wrong way .
Paul Yock , head of the bio-design laboratory at Stanford University , which develops medical devices , argues that medical - technology giants have “ looked at need , but been blind to cost . ”
Amid growing concern about runaway health spending , he thinks the industry can find inspiration in India .
Poverty , geography and poor infrastructure mean that India faces perhaps the world 's heaviest disease burden , ranging from infectious diseases , the traditional scourge of the poor , to diseases of affluence such as diabetes and hypertension .
The public sector has been overwhelmed , which is not surprising considering how little India 's government spends on health as a share of national income ( see chart ) .
Accordingly , nearly four - fifths of all health services are supplied by private firms and charities — a higher share than in any other big country .
In the past that was more a reflection of the state 's failure than the dynamism of entrepreneurs , but this is changing fast .
Technopak Healthcare , a consulting firm , expects spending on health care in India to grow from $ 40 billion in 2008 to $ 323 billion in 2023 .
In part , that is the result of the growing affluence of India 's emerging middle classes .
Another cause is the nascent boom in health insurance , now offered both by private firms and , in some cases , by the state .
In addition , the government has recently liberalised the industry , easing restrictions on lending and foreign investment in health care , encouraging public - private partnerships and offering tax breaks for health investments in smaller cities and rural areas .
Cheaper and smarter
This has attracted a wave of investment from some of India 's biggest corporate groups , including Ranbaxy ( the generic - drugs pioneer behind Fortis ) and Reliance ( one of India 's biggest conglomerates ) .
The happy collision of need and greed has produced a cauldron of innovation , as Indian entrepreneurs have devised new business models .
Some just set out to do things cheaply , but others are more radical , and have helped India leapfrog the rich world .
For years India 's private - health providers , such as Apollo Hospitals , focused on the affluent upper classes , but they are now racing down the pyramid .
Vishal Bali , Wockhardt 's boss , plans to take advantage of tax breaks to build hospitals in small and medium - sized cities ( which , in India , means those with up to 3 m inhabitants ) .
Prathap Reddy , Apollo 's founder , plans to do the same .
He thinks he can cut costs in half for patients : a quarter saved through lower overheads , and another quarter by eliminating travel to bigger cities .
Columbia Asia , a privately held American firm with over a dozen hospitals across Asia , is also making a big push into India .
Rick Evans , its boss , says his investors left America to escape over - regulation and the political power of the medical lobby .
His model involves building no -frills hospitals using standardised designs , connected like spokes to a hub that can handle more complex ailments .
His firm offers modestly priced services to those earning $ 10,000 - 20,000 a year within wealthy cities , thereby going after customers overlooked by fancier chains .
Its small hospital on the fringes of Bangalore lacks a marble foyer and expensive imaging machines — but it does have fully integrated health information - technology ( HIT ) systems , including electronic health records ( EHRs ) .
New competitors are also emerging .
A recent report from Monitor , a consultancy , points to LifeSpring Hospitals , a chain of small maternity hospitals around Hyderabad .
This for - profit outfit offers normal deliveries attended by private doctors for just $ 40 in its general ward , and Caesarean sections for about $ 140 — as little as one - fifth of the price at the big private hospitals .
It has cut costs with a basic approach : it has no canteens and outsources laboratory tests and pharmacy services .
It also achieves economies of scale by attracting large numbers of patients using marketing .
Monitor estimates that its operating theatres accommodate 22 - 27 procedures a week , compared with four to six in other private clinics .
LifeSpring 's doctors perform four times as many operations a month as their counterparts do elsewhere — and , crucially , get better results as a result of high volumes and specialisation .
Cheap and cheerful really can mean better .
But there is more to India 's approach than cutting costs .
Its health - care providers also make better use of HIT .
According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association , fewer than 20 % of doctors ' surgeries in America use HIT .
In contrast , according to Technopak , nearly 60 % of Indian hospitals do so .
And instead of grafting technology onto existing , inefficient processes , as often happens in America , Indian providers build their model around it .
Apollo's integrated approach to HIT has enabled the chain to increase efficiency while cutting medical errors and labour .
EHRs and drug records zip between hospitals , clinics and pharmacies , and its systems also handle patient registration and billing .
Apollo is already selling its expertise to American hospitals .
Eye on the prize
A casual visitor to Madurai , a vibrant medieval - temple town in southern India , would not think it was a hotbed of innovation .
And yet that is exactly what you will find at Aravind , the world 's biggest eye - hospital chain , based in the town .
There are perhaps 12 m blind people in India , with most cases arising from treatable or preventable causes such as cataracts .
Rather than rely on government handouts or charity , Aravind 's founders use a tiered pricing structure that charges wealthier patients more ( for example , for fancy meals or air - conditioned rooms ) , letting the firm cross -subsidise free care for the poorest .
Aravind also benefits from its scale .
Its staff screen over 2.7 m patients a year via clinics in remote areas , referring 285,000 of them for surgery at its hospitals .
International experts vouch that the care is good , not least because Aravind 's doctors perform so many more operations than they would in the West that they become expert .
Furthermore , the staff are rotated to deal with both paying and non-paying patients so there is no difference in quality .
Monitor 's new report argues that Aravind 's model does not just depend on pricing , scale , technology or process , but on a clever combination of all of them .
C.K. Prahalad and other management gurus trumpet examples like Aravind , but do the rich countries accept that they could learn from India ?
Unsurprisingly , some reject the notion that America 's model is broken .
William Tauzin , head of America 's pharmaceutical lobby , warns that regulatory efforts to cut costs could stifle life - saving innovation .
Sandra Peterson of Bayer , a German drugs and devices giant , stoutly defends the industry 's record .
She argues that overall cost increases mask how medical devices , “ like cars or personal computers , give better value for the money over time . ”
Diabetes monitors and pacemakers have improved dramatically in the past 20 years and have fallen in price — but costs have gone up because they are now being used by more patients .
But those examples are exceptions .
Many studies show that America 's spending on health care is soaring , yet its medical outcomes remain mediocre .
Mark McClellen of the Brookings Institution , an American think - tank , says that a big problem is the overuse of technology .
Whether or not a scan is needed , the system usually pays if a doctor orders it — and the scan might help defend the doctor against a malpractice claim .
“ The root cause is not greed , but tremendous technological progress imposed upon a fractured health system , ” says Thomas Lee of Partners Community HealthCare , a health provider in Boston .
Dr McClellen , a former head of America 's Food and Drug Administration , points out that other innovative industries often sell new products at a loss , and recoup their investments later .
In genuinely competitive industries , innovators are rarely rewarded with the “ cost plus ” reimbursements demanded by medical - device makers for their gold - plated gizmos .
That is why Stanford 's Dr Yock wants to turn innovation upside down .
He has extended his bio -design programme to India , in part to instil an understanding of the benefits of frugality in his students .
He believes that India 's combination of poverty and outstanding medical and engineering talents will produce a world - class medical - devices industry .
Tim Brown , the head of Ideo , a design consultancy , agrees .
In the past , he notes , health bosses thought all devices had to be Rolls - Royces or Ferraris .
But cost matters , too .
Pointing to another recent example of India 's frugal engineering , he says : “ In health care , as in life , there is need for both Ferraris and Tata Nanos . ”
I 'm not sure Pollock used quite the same technique in his work .
It 's possible the soul trapped in this robot is actually that of a poo-flinging monkey .

SO HUNGRY
Once a certain sufi of Basra began to consume hashish regularly ; his shaykh realized this meant he had reached the ultimate degree of perfection and no longer stood in need of guidance .
This , says the Turkish sufi poet Fuzuli , " proves that hashish is the perfect being , sought after by mankind with great eagerness .
It may not be the perfect being for everybody , but it most certainly is for the seeker of mystical experience . "
P.L. Wilson Majoun According to Peter Lamborn Wilson , the Heddawiyya Sufi order of Morocco is entirely devoted to the ritual , meditational and magical uses of cannabis Majoun is , perhaps , the most legendary of all psychoactive confections  a potent blend of dried fruits , nuts , spices , honey and cannabis .
Hunters , whittlers and Boy Scouts , beware - your knives may soon be on the government ’s chopping block .
The Obama administration wants to expand the 50 - year - old ban on importing “ switchblades ” to include folding knives that can be opened with one hand , stirring fears the government may on the path to outlawing most pocket knives .
Critics , including U.S. knife manufacturers and collectors , the National Rifle Association , sportsmen ’s groups and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill , say the rule change proposed by Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) would rewrite U.S. law defining what constitutes a switchblade and potentially make de facto criminals of the estimated 35 million Americans who use folding knives .
“ Boy Scout knives , Swiss Army knives - the most basic of knives can be opened one - handed if you know what you are doing , ” said Doug Ritter , executive director of Knife Rights , an advocacy group fighting to defeat the measure .
“ The outrage is gaining steam , ” he said .
Customs officials dismiss fears that the new language will outlaw ordinary pocket knives , saying the change was issued to clear up conflicting guidelines for border agents about what constitutes an illegal switchblade that cannot be imported into the United States .
The rule could be imposed within 30 days if not blocked .
A review of case law and “ in consideration of the health and public safety concerns raised by such importations ” prompted the agency to revoke the ruling that allowed the importing of knives with spring - and release - assisted opening mechanisms , CBP spokeswoman Jenny L. Burke said .
Customs officials argue the rule deals only with imported merchandise , and thus does not affect knives already in the country or that are manufactured domestically .
The rule change would affect the interpretation of the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958 , which defined a “ switchblade ” as any knife having a blade that opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button or other device in the handle , or by operation of inertia or gravity .
The new definition would include any spring - assisted or one - handed - opening knife .
The 1958 law bans the possession of switchblades on federal lands and prohibits the mailing or sale of switchblades across state lines .
It does not mandate prohibition within states and localities , though a number of states , including Maryland , have passed their own statutes banning or limiting the possession and carrying of switchblades .
Possession of switchblades is legal in Virginia if not intended for sale .
Critics of the rule say that broadening the definition of switchblades in federal law would instantly make previously permitted knives illegal in states that have adopted the ban .
Hunters and hikers who cross state lines with their knives in tow may find themselves guilty of a federal felony , they warn .
The bipartisan Congressional Sportsmen ’s Caucus , boasting one of the largest memberships on Capitol Hill , last week sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who oversees CBP , urging her to quash the proposed rule change .
The letter was signed by 61 Republican and 18 Democratic lawmakers .
“ This classification could render millions of law - abiding knife owners in violation of the law and expose major market retailers , manufacturers , dealers and importers to possible federal felony charges , and could drive domestic manufacturers and importers out of business , potentially costing thousands of jobs , ” said caucus member Rep. Robert E. Latta , Ohio Republican .
In much the same way that gun rights issues have cut across the partisan divide in Congress , the threat of a government knife grab has especially rankled members from Western and Southern states , regardless of their party .
Miss Napolitano has not responded , according to congressional staffers .
The knife lobby does not believe the agency ’s assurances that the rule has only a narrow application .
“ The language used … is so broad and uses virtually every term ever applied to any knife that opens with one hand .
We fear that they are attempting to bypass the will of Congress and that once they succeed in getting assisted - openers defined as switchblades , they could move against all folding knives , ” said the American Knife and Tool Institute , which represents knife manufacturers , distributors , retailers and custom - knife artisans .
Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith said he did not want to comment because he was not familiar with the details of the proposed rule .
But he said the Boy Scout Handbook does include many references to pocket knives .
“ Knives are a part of the scouting program , ” Mr. Smith said .
“ We primarily stress safe knife usage and maintenance of knives . …
We will just continue to stick to what ’s in the handbook . ”
The relatively quick pace of the rule - making process - a 30 - day comment period that ended Monday , followed by a 30 - day implementation schedule - has opponents looking to head off the measure in Congress .
Mr. Latta and Rep. Walt Minnick , Idaho Democrat , introduced legislation Tuesday that would block CBP from broadening the definition of switchblades .
The legislation was offered as an amendment to the appropriations bill for the Homeland Security Department , which is expected to come to the House floor soon .

PLANNING THE STEPS TO WORLD GOVERNMENT
By Joan Veon
April 3 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
In the book of Jeremiah , the prophet tells of the pending invasion of Judah by the Babylonian king , Nebuchadnezzar .
He records , “ the snorting of horses was heard in Dan . ”
Can you imagine an invasion of that kind ?
You have been warned by reports that there is an invading army on the way .
As they get closer you can feel the ground move as the multitude of well - trained soldiers and galloping horses get closer to your city .
You are strangely aware that your world is going to change forever as you hear the snorting get louder .
That is how I felt fourteen years ago when I read the 1994 United Nations Development Report .
I was absolutely shocked to read the Special Contribution entitled “ Global Governance for the 21st Century ” by the 1969 Nobel Prize for Economics , Jan Tinbergen .
He wrote , Mankind ’s problems can no longer be solved by national governments .
What is needed is a World Government .
This can best be achieved by strengthening the United Nations system .
In some cases , this would mean changing the role of UN agencies from advice - giving to implementation .
But some of the most important new institutions would be financial — a World Treasury and a World Central Bank .
Just as each nation has a system of income redistribution , so there should be a corresponding ‘ World Financial Policy ’ to be implemented by the World Bank and the World Central Bank .
Some of these proposals are , no doubt , far - fetched and beyond the horizon of today ’s political possibilities .
But the idealist of today often turns out to be the realists of tomorrow .
In that report , it also laid out the changes to be made to the international level of government in order to complete the necessary powers :
They included : A World Central Bank which should have five functions : ( 1 ) stabilize global economic activity , ( 2 ) lender of last resort to financial institutions , ( 3 ) calm jittery financial markets , ( 4 ) regulate financial institutions and ( 5 ) create and regulate new international liquidity .
The institution named to be the successor organization was the International Monetary Fund .
This new central bank would float a new issue of Special Drawing Rights - SDRs and it would have “ Global Macroeconomic Management ” worldwide .
It would also acquire some regular control of international banking activities .
A World Trade Organization to be the successor to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs .
An Economic Security Council to “ review the threats to global human security and agree on required action . ”
It would have 11 permanent members and another 11 rotating members .
They would not have any veto and it would “ coordinate activities of the UN agencies and watch over the policy direction of all international and regional financial institutions . ”
Other components mentioned included a World Anti-Monopoly Authority , a World Bank International Investment Trust and a World Bank Intermediate Assistance Facility . ”
The report also called for a World Police force , an International Court of Justice and a World Treasury .
The report stated , “ It will probably take some time and probably some international financial crisis — before a full - scare World Central Bank can be created . ”
It appears we are there .
For most people , the things that I wrote about were ridiculous .
Why ?
Because they were not reading the same documents I was reading .
At the 101 global meetings I have covered around the world , these kinds .
of ideas were considered exciting and were being actively discussed , as they are now .
Also in 1994 , The Bretton Woods Commission which was convened by Paul Volcker , former Federal Reserve Chairman and James D. Wolfensohn who was the Director of the World Bank met .
Their report confirmed the 1994 Human Development Report and called for “ greater economic convergence among countries . ”
With regard to a world monetary system , the Commission stated , Any future international monetary system should focus on the major international currencies which dominate trade and global capital markets .
For some time to come these will be the dollar , the yen and the Deutsch mark [ or its successor European currency ) .
The alternative to a new global system is to continue the present non-system of loose ad hoc cooperation , dominated by the G7 process ( pages 4 - 5 ) .
Furthermore the Bretton Woods Commission said the IMF “ should be given a central role to play in coordinating macroeconomic policies and in developing and implementing monetary reforms . ”
They said that the IMF should be given surveillance in order to secure a more stable exchange rate system and that the Special Drawing Rights are needed — but not now , and should be considered at some other time . ”
Interestingly enough the Bretton Woods Commission was supported by numerous foreign and American Banks which included , J.P. Morgan , Kidder Peabody International , Inc. , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley Group , Salomon Brothers , The Ford Foundation , The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , The German Marshall Fund and S. G. Warburg Group .
Some of these banks no longer exist and some even had trouble earlier in our current banking crisis .
I was seeing the plan for a future world governmental structure .
I used the 1994 Human Development Report as my blueprint for the future and what I should look for .
Then in February , 2004 , I interviewed U.S. Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs , Tony Fratto at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Boca Raton , Florida .
Part of our discussion follows : Veon : Given the drop in economic , financial , and trade barriers and as America moves into a global economy what else needs to be done to complete this global economy ?
Advertisement Fratto :
There is still a lot more that needs to be done .
There are many countries around the world with trade barriers affecting financial services , affecting capital flows , allowing for financial service firms to invest and be welcomed into their countries and we are going to see a lot more of that and it is part of the Free Trade Agreements and negotiations , regionally and at the Doha Round [ WTO level ] .
Treasury plays a major role in negotiating the investment chapters [ of the WTO Agreement ] and the chapters that concern financial flow and we will see more of that .
Veon : The Bank for International Settlements set up the Financial Stability Forum - FSF — how important is that in today ’s economy to manage a global system without borders ?
Fratto :
It is very important .
We participate in the FSF regularly and it is very important to help ensure that markets across the world are operating properly and that financial services firms are coping with regulation and changing landscape and financial services .
So it is very , very important .
Veon :
Given the fact that the economic , trade , financial , political and information barriers between the nation - states have fallen , is there a deadline — 2014 or 2020 for the completion of the global financial architecture ?
Fratto :
No one has put a specific date on it .
From our perspective , we do n’t want to be bound by deadlines , but we want to see progress — steady and every day on these issues .
Things like Basel II , we are moving that forward .
The liberalization of rules for capital flows — you will see more of that .
Veon : Foreigners have been willing to hold U.S. debt because it is a reserve currency , is there any discussion of a shift to the dollar sharing the reserve currency with the euro ?
Fratto : I will not comment .
Veon : If 65 % of central bank foreign exchange reserves are in dollars , will you be discussing how much more they will be willing to hold of dollars ?
Fratto : I will let the ministers address those kinds of questions .
As you can see , the U.S. Treasury was actively working to expand a global economic infrastructure .
The things that I was hearing on the international level , along with the ideas of the 1994 Human Development Report , were common knowledge to everyone except the American people .
Later on in November , I interviewed Paul Volcker and specifically asked him about what he saw for the future .
He told me , “ What the world needs is a global currency . ”
I asked if he meant “ the Special Drawing Right . ”
He refused to answer .
Then in 2007 , I interviewed him again and asked about the Special Drawing Right .
He told me that it had not been on his lips for years .
His actions and words are not the same .
As a result of the 2008 Credit Crisis which continues in 2009 , Congress has been trying to understand the agenda behind the actions of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
In an exchange between Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) and Paul Volcker on February 24 , 2009 , Ron Paul specifically asked him about his opening statement to the House Banking Committee in which he talked about “ strong coordination among national authorities , unifying accounting standards , liquidity requirements , and ‘ internationally agreed to ’ arrangements . ”
Congressman Paul wanted to know if Volcker was referring to “ a super IMF or if we were going to revive the SDRs ?
What kinds of discussion are going on internationally right now to devise a standard and are you a participant in these international negotiations to come up with this new system ? ”
Paul Volcker told him , “ No , No . I do n’t know of any coherent or regular discussion going on officially and there are very few going on unofficially in terms of construction of the monetary system . ”
As they bantered back and forth with Volcker refusing to give forthright answers , Volcker said , “ I ca n’t tell you the answers — they are not apparent .
Make no mistake .
This is a unique moment in economic history where the world is going on the basis of fiat currencies . ”
It was apparent by his answers , his laughter at Ron Paul ’s forthrightness , and his body language that he had no desire to be honest in his global involvement .
In short , we have the global crisis which the 1994 Human Development Report said would probably need to happen in order to shift to a global system of government .
It is also glaringly noticeable that the report was right on the money in terms of where the world needed to move to complete a global integration of countries .
Without the continuous move to drop the barriers between nation - states that began with the birth of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1944 and continued into the 1990s with the birth of the World Trade Organization in 1994 , it would not be possible to have the global financial integration through common regulatory laws that the leaders of the G20 are calling for .
Furthermore , a world central bank , the Special Drawing Rights , and an Economic Security Council would not be possible .
However in a world where there are no longer any barriers between nation - states , total integration and a world government structure is possible .
The newly empowered G20 is actively pursuing greater powers and responsibilities for the IMF .
The IMF already has power over all countries , including the U.S. , as it does country financial assessments .
Furthermore , the Special Drawing Right was adopted by the Bank for International Settlements in 2004 when they switched “ for bookkeeping entries ” as I was told from the Swiss franc to the SDR .
In 1999 , when the Financial Stability Forum while set up , was never given much public attention , now it is at the center of the G20 discussions .
Lastly , in conjunction with the G20 meetings , a special commission at the United Nations headed up by Dr. Joseph Stiglitz is calling for the G20 to become a fully recognized Economic Security Council on par with the Security Council .

The report stated , “ It will probably take some time and probably some international financial crisis — before a full - scare World Central Bank can be created . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The CIA destroyed 92 videotapes of terror - suspect interrogations , according to a court document filed by the government on Monday .
The disclosure marks the first time the specific number of tapes has been made public .
A former CIA officer says the destroyed tapes showed harsh interrogations , including the use of waterboarding .
The tapes were made in 2002 and showed the interrogations of two suspected al Qaeda leaders , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
According to former CIA officer John Kiriakou , some of the videos showed harsh interrogations , including the use of waterboarding , which is said to simulate drowning and is considered by most people to be a form of torture .
Government officials have said the tapes were destroyed in November 2005 at the orders of Jose Rodriguez , then head of the CIA 's National Clandestine Service , with the approval of NCS lawyers .
The tape destruction is under investigation by John Durham , a federal prosecutor .
The disclosure of the number of tapes involved came as part of a federal court proceeding in New York involving an American Civil Liberties Union motion to hold the CIA in contempt of court for destroying the tapes .
Durham had requested and received a stay on the ACLU motion while his investigation was under way .
Acting U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin wrote in a letter to Judge Alvin Hellerstein that Durham had not requested a continuation of the stay after it expired February 28 .
" The CIA can now identify ... 92 videotapes were destroyed , " wrote Dassin .
He also told the court the CIA is collecting information describing each of the destroyed tapes , as well as written accounts of the tapes and the identities of the people who viewed or possessed the recordings .
" The CIA intends to produce all of the information requested to the court and to produce as much information as possible on the public record to the plaintiffs , Dassin wrote .
But the ACLU , in a written statement , said the government 's letter proves the CIA is in contempt .
" The large number of videotapes confirms the agency engaged in a systemic attempt to hide evidence of its illegal interrogations and to evade the court 's order . "
CIA spokesman George Little said the agency has cooperated with the Justice Department investigation .
" If anyone thinks it 's agency policy to impede the enforcement of American law , they simply do n't know the facts , " he said in response to the ACLU .
Then - CIA Director Mike Hayden wrote in a December 2007 memo to staff that the tapes were made as " an internal check " on the CIA 's use of harsh interrogation techniques and the decision to destroy them was made " only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and relevant to any internal , legislative or judicial inquires . "
Hayden said there were detailed written notes on the interrogations .
The prosecutor 's spokesman would not comment on the status of Durham 's criminal investigation into the tape destruction .
" That investigation is ongoing so we are not commenting on any specific aspects of it , " spokesman Tom Carson said .

While reading the latest ReadWriteWeb article “ Google News May Add Wikipedia as a Source ” , the question of news integrity crossed my mind .
After conducting some research , I came up with the following rationalizations :
The “ too many eyes ” theory :
When a service is constantly being monitored by many concerned parties , excellence in performance is a must !
The more the number of eyes watching , the better the content ; this applies to Wikipedia .
Try visiting Wikipedia , choosing any topic and editing its content to something useless like “ bla , bla , bla ! ” , wait for a few minutes and then recheck .
You will find that the useless content has been removed and replaced with the original content by one of the readers .
This is a great example of data integrity on Wikipedia .
The “ reliable news sources ” assumption :
Why do we always assume that NYT is more reliable that Techcruch , for example ?
Is it the reputation of credibility that NYT has built throughout the years ?
And if so , is that enough to believe everything the NYT publishes or broadcasts ?
I think not .
On the same grounds , why trust NYT more than Wikipedia as a news source , and so on ?
The “ big whales make mistakes too ” reality :
Yes it ’s a fact – very important news sources such as Britannica also have a certain percentage of errors in the content they offer and the studies they release to the public and since “ no one is perfect ” , Wikipedia included , that is absolutely natural .
To conclude , I believe in Wikipedia since it essentially gathers the knowledge and brain power of thousands , nay millions , of people out there into a collaborative space which could , in no way , be as biased or commercial as many other news sources .
Therefore , in the debate of whether or not Wikipedia should be a source in Google News , I vote : “ Yes ” !
How about you , what ’s your vote ?
Do you think Wikipedia is credible enough for Google News ?

The Copenhagen conference could be " make or break time for the climate " .
The prime minister is to pledge UK leadership in the international battle against climate change .
He is due to launch a document showing what the UK will offer to the Copenhagen conference tasked with forging a new global climate agreement .
Climate Secretary Ed Miliband described the conference as " make or break time for the climate " .
The Road to Copenhagen document will outline plans for ongoing emissions cuts in the UK .
It will also contain practical advice to people on how they can cut emissions and often save money too .
The document will focus on UK ambitions for the Copenhagen conference and also for the G8 meeting , soon to take place in Italy .
At that summit , leaders of the world 's top polluting nations - including emerging economies - will attempt to clear a path for a global deal .
The UK plays a leading role in international negotiations and is on track to exceed the targets for emissions cuts agreed under the current Kyoto Protocol .
But new figures from the Stockholm Institute - a respected research body - throw a different light on the UK 's performance .
The climate department DECC says , for instance , that although China 's total emissions are immense , the average European is responsible for emitting twice as much greenhouse gases as the average person in China .
But the official tally of emissions does not include aviation and shipping , and it takes no account of emissions embedded in imported goods .
When these are taken into account , the institute calculates that the average UK resident pollutes 15 tonnes a year - almost five times more than the average Chinese person at 3.1 tonnes a year .
This implies that the UK should be making much deeper cuts in emissions than are already planned .
The Scottish Parliament voted this week to cut Scottish emissions by 42 % by 2020 , compared with a UK target of 34 % .
The Scottish cuts will include aviation and shipping , but not embedded emissions .
The failure to calculate embedded emissions has damaged the reputation of countries such as China that are making goods for export to the West but are then blamed for the pollution that results .

A dark , dark day for America .
“ They were only following orders . ”
This is the opinion of Eric Holder , as offered in his statement today , describing the decision to release four Bush - era Office of Legal Counsel memos .
( The memos have just been posted , and link is here . )
And so the United States government , 64 years after the end of World War II , adopts the infamous slogan of “ Befehl ist Befehl ” ( literally “ orders are orders ” ) , otherwise known as the Nuremberg Defense .
Furthermore , Holder pledges the U.S. government will defend any CIA torturers before any tribunal , domestic or international , pay any fines , and make every effort to assert “ any available immunities and other defenses ” .
“ It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department , ” Holder said .
No matter how you try to spin it .
No matter how enraged you are at my making a comparison to of U.S. governmental leaders to Nazi war criminals , there is no getting around it .
Torturers are absolved by this administration .
And the way they did was by using the defense made popular by the Nazis at their war crimes trials , and thoroughly rejected by the United States at that time .
In taking this position formally , the Obama administration has discarded the principles enumerated in the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg , where Articles 7 and 8 state ( emphasis added ) :
Article 7 .
The official position of defendants , whether as Heads of State or responsible officials in Government Departments , shall not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating punishment .
Article 8 .
The fact that the Defendant acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility , but may be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines that justice so requires .
“ Mitigation of punishment ” sounds a hell of a lot different than what Holder is proposing , which is an all - out defense of those who claim who were “ only following orders ” ( quotes for irony , not Holder ’s ) .
Perhaps Holder should consider this statement , from the Nuremberg IMT ’s Trial of the Major War Criminals :
Crimes against international law are committed by men , not by abstract entities , and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced .
Or both Holder and Obama can consider what the U.S. , as a High Contracting Party , or signatory , to the Geneva Conventions says about the duty to prosecute war crimes , such as torture ( emphasis added ) :
“ Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed , or to have ordered to be committed , such grave breaches , and shall bring such persons , regardless of their nationality , before its own courts .
It may also , if it prefers , and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation , hand such persons over for trial to another High Contracting Party concerned , provided such High Contracting Party has made out a prima facie case .
Geneva III POWs , art .
129 , Geneva IV Civilians , art .
146 ; see also 18 USC 2441 ( c ) ( 1 ) .
Evidence of the crimes committed by CIA officers , agents and / or contractors in perpetuating torture are documented in a number of sources , but none as authoritative as the recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross on CIA abuse and torture of “ high - value detainees ” in its custody .
The failure to seek prosecutions of war criminals , and now by formal pronouncement , puts high officials of the U.S. government in violation of the Geneva Conventions .
Additionally , and no less outrageously , when Eric Holder or Barack Obama tell you the U.S. government does not condone torture , they do not tell you the truth .
The government maintains a classic form of torture within the current Army Field Manual , combining partial sensory deprivation , isolation , sleep deprivation , harsh use of fear and dread , all while instilling a sense of hopelessness in prisoners , which is the same sort of psychological torture perfected by the Stalinists of various countries , and advocated in the CIA ’s own counter - intelligence interrogation manual from the early 1960s , known as the KUBARK Manual .
Those who are so inclined may wish to watch this concluding section of the famous film , “ Judgement at Nuremberg . ”
The quote that follows is from Spencer Tracy ’s speech .
As you watch , consider how far subservience to the military and intelligence agencies has acted as an acid to undermine all that this nation once believed and fought for .
The principle of criminal law in every civilized society as this in common : any person who sways another to commit murder , any person who furnishes the lethal weapon for the purpose of the crime , any person who is an accessory to the crime , is guilty … .
Before the people of the world let it now be noted in our decision that this is what we stand for : justice , truth , and the value of a single human being .
UPDATE
The release of the memos by OLC justifying torture are up for anyone to view .
The link is at the top of the diary .
I ’ve looked at the Aug. 1 , 2002 memo from Jay Bybee ( and any helpers ) to John Rizzo at CIA .
It ’s an extraordinary document , and everyone should take a look .
It authorizes the use of ten abusive interrogation techniques : attention grasp , walling , facial hold , facial slap ( insult slap ) , cramped confinement , wall standing ( should be called slamming ) , stress positions , sleep deprivation , insects placed in a confinement box (! ) , and the waterboard .
The connections between SERE techniques and use CIA operational use of same is made clear throughout , as is the collaboration with medical professionals and SERE military psychologists .
Notably , Bybee claims the OLC decision was vetted with interrogation experts , SERE experts , and “ outside psychologists ” .
One wonders who the latter were , and I would like to see the American Psychological Association ask for an immediate investigation of who these “ outside psychologists ” were .
Throughout the document there are blacked - out sections , mostly those that obviously relate to names and identities .
But not entirely , as there are whole paragraphs blocked out in sections that evidently go into more details than DoJ wished to release .
As you read these documents and their bogus claims of authority to torture , imagine you are one of the interrogators getting these orders ( place insects in a confinement box ! waterboard ! ) .
And remember , finally , that the CIA and / or military used torture prior to the authoring of these memos ( also see this link ) , so Holder ’s “ they were only following orders ” defense is pure BS from top to bottom .

Excellent
This is definitively of the adventure film genre , and superbly well done .
Also , it is neither overly violent , but balanced in almost every way -- idea , technique , composition to name a few .
This form is not common to Newgrounds , and is a pleasant more artistically minded animation .
Congratulations on a job well done .
As web design and design in general have evolved , rules have been established to ensure consistent and usable designs .
Some of these rules were created simply because website creators abused certain principles without regard for their users .
But these rules are not enforced by anyone and should be broken when necessary , especially when breaking them would lead to a stunning design .
In this article , we present 10 rules that you can break if it suits your design needs .
Rule # 1 : Do Not Display the Horizontal Scroll Bar
A significant number of mice do n’t have a horizontal mouse wheel .
This makes it awkward to scroll left or right when a web page ’s content extends past the sides of the browser .
It can be annoying to have to bring the mouse cursor down to the bottom of the window and drag the scroll bar over just to see a word or two that lies beyond the viewable area of the page .
That said , here are some well - designed sites that put the scroll bar to work in effective ways .
Benek
Benek uses JavaScript to change the scroll direction of the mouse wheel from vertical to horizontal .
Each item in Benek ’s portfolio is separated into its own column .
The site has a surprisingly fresh feel and flows smoothly .
Shoe Guru
Shoe Guru gets away with horizontal scrolling because it takes advantage of the way people look at shoes .
People look at most products from top to bottom , but shoes are different .
People ’s eyes usually move across the length of the shoe .
Using this habit to its advantage , Shoe Guru makes its website ’s design flow in the same direction , making the motion feel natural .
Stephane Tartelin
Stephane Tartelin uses the horizontal scroll bar to make his artwork look like it ’s in an art gallery .
Although the vertical mouse wheel does n’t function like it does in the examples above , the effect works surprisingly well .
You could even argue that the effect would be diminished if the mouse wheel were re-coded to scroll horizontally .
Graphic Therapy
While Graphic
Therapy does n’t display a horizontal scroll bar on its page , it still allows horizontal scrolling by clicking and dragging around the screen .
Graphic
Theory used horizontal navigation because all of its images are the same height but not the same width .
The horizontal navigation helps the site flow smoothly .
The Horizontal Way
The Horizontal Way is a showcase of websites that use horizontal scrolling .
The grungy graphics are beautiful , and this site is unique as far as CSS galleries go .
Rule # 2 : Use a Minimal Number of Font Faces
Too many fonts usually conflict with each other and overwhelm the viewer .
Each font has a personality , and too many personalities can create disorder .
To effectively use more than just a couple of fonts , a design has to be very text - oriented , and the rest of the design needs to be relatively quiet .
Here are some examples of sites that use this sense of conflict and disorder to engage the user .
Links LA
Links LA uses many fonts in a non-linear layout to create a sense of energy .
The page is difficult to read quickly but draws the user in .
It ’s also worth noting that none of the fonts are overly decorative ; each word is legible , keeping the design crisp and clean .
Geo Elements Design Studio
Using a variety of fonts usually conveys a sense of energy and chaos , but Geo Elements Design Studio ‘s website is very open and clean .
Each font is given its own space so that the viewer does n’t associate it with another font .
The image of the sky in the background helps reinforce the sense of openness .
Richard Stelmach
Unlike the last example , Richard Stelmach pushes his different fonts close together .
The design works because only one font does n’t look hand - drawn , and the other two work well with the illustration .
Hand - drawn fonts usually work well together , even when there are many different font faces .
Satsu
Satsu seems to have a lot of different fonts but actually only has three ( not including the Sports Council portfolio item ) .
By spacing everything carefully , Satsu associates certain lines of text with each other , even though the text may be in different fonts .
The logo title is in one font , and the two sub - titles each have their own font , but the viewer naturally groups these three text items together .
Satsu is able to create energy without overwhelming the page with personalities .
Rule # 3 : Do Not Use Too Many Colors
The fear of going too far with a design is what separates professionals from rookies and rookies from the oblivious .
The oblivious try to make their designs as extreme as possible , with words on fire , blinking text , and as many colors as possible .
Rookies want to keep their designs subtle and easy on the eye , but in the end their designs can sometimes look lifeless .
The following eye - pleasing designs are by some true professionals who are pushing boundaries .
Matt Mullenweg
Matt Mullenweg ’s beautifully colored design looks like a watercolor painting ( site has been updated since this article was written ) .
All of the colors in the background would grab anyone ’s attention .
Generally , good designs with a ton of colors will have these colors in the background , with a simpler palette up front .
Reading text is very difficult when too many things are going on .
Travic Isaacs
Travis Isaacs ’s design has a colorful vertical gradient in the background that makes the design seem colorful throughout .
This website has bright pink as its link color , which is a great choice for designers who want to create a colorful effect .
James De Angelis
James De Angelis ’ website shows that text can be colorful without coming across as rookie - like .
The design is very spare , and the tagline is certainly given center stage .
Rule # 4 : Make Your Site ’s Goal Obvious
Something that really gets crammed in the ears of young designers is that a design should instantly tell viewers what they are looking at before they read any text .
Brand recognition is important for large corporations , but sometimes the smaller guys need to be a bit more clever to get the viewer ’s attention .
Holding back information can intrigue the viewer and “ tease ” people into wanting to learn more .
Applying this technique to web design can greatly increase the time that users stay on your site .
Cetrotrees
On most portfolios today , the freelancer or company usually introduces themselves and explains their work .
Cerotreees instead puts some vaguely labeled links on the left and samples of its work on the right , but nothing explains the idea or person behind it .
The air of mystery surrounding the site entices the user to stay .
The Last Mixtape
The Last Mixtape is another portfolio that shows its work and nothing more .
Such designs exude a feeling of extreme confidence .
They never try to sell themselves ; they just expect the user to be blown away and come begging for a contract .
Peter Pearson
Using a splash screen is a good way to slow the user ’s thought process and inspire them to dig deeper .
The splash page ’s goal is usually to explain the site quickly with photos or a short bit of text .
But in Peter Pearson ’s case , its goal is to evoke a feeling .
The big sky and splattered text effect do a great job at evoking curiosity because these things do n’t usually appear together .
This site also does a great job at continuing the emotion created by the splash page into the actual content .
The side - scrolling motion and animated lines that follow the user are really effective .
Piepmatzel
A great way to get around the language barrier is to not use any words .
Piepmatzel is a CSS gallery , and people who have seen a CSS gallery before will likely recognize it as one right away .
Those who have n’t may be intrigued enough to give a few of the thumbnails a click in the hope of figuring out the pattern .
The small amount of text at the bottom of the page helps with sorting and is superfluous .
Rule # 5 : Navigation Should Be Easy To Figure Out
Navigation should not be the bottleneck of a site .
Users should be able to find what they want quickly .
Sometimes , though , unintuitive yet engaging navigation can help the user feel connected to the site and what it is promoting .
Alvin Tang
As mentioned in the previous section , an air of confidence is conveyed when a portfolio does n’t spell itself out .
This is the case in Alvin Tang ’s photography portfolio .
When first arriving on the site , the user does not immediately recognize the words they see as links .
This uncertainty should prompt them to poke around a bit .
Moving the mouse over a word reveals that it is indeed a link , and upon clicking it , a gorgeous photo loads .
The photo will entice users to continue browsing .
To see more photos , users have to click the “ Back ” button on their browser ( something most people understand to do ) and then click another link .
There is no hand - holding in the design , and it works extremely well .
This is n’t a conventionally “ gorgeous design , ” but it delivers exactly what it needs to .
Kasulo
Kasulo ‘s navigation is n’t terribly hard to figure out , but the average user may not know exactly what to do upon arriving on the site .
After the first click , though , everything becomes obvious .
The user navigates the portfolio pieces in 3 - D style , and the latest items appear closest to the beginning .
Using the mouse wheel is even more fun .
Marcio Kogan
Marcio Kogan ’s site is another example of great navigation that is n’t immediately obvious .
The instruction “ Drag me ” is hard to resist , and once the user does that , they ’re on their way to cruising the portfolio items .
The mouse - over previews are a small detail but really impressive .
Ceranco
If a client were to ask a designer to make their site in 3 - D , like a first - person shooter video game , most designers would silently laugh to themselves , take a deep breath , and then slowly explain why that would be a bad idea .
While the website for Ceranco is n’t exactly a 3 - D shooter , it could easily be confused for some sort of indie computer game .
Sites like this are great at engaging users .
While the long loading time and poor search engine optimization make this less than ideal for most projects , it ’s definitely worth a second thought .
Rule # 6 : Use Different Colors for the Text and Background
This rule perhaps is n’t written all over the place , but many rookies are so afraid of making text unreadable that they do n’t consider using the same base color for both the background and font itself .
You can follow some simple techniques to make the similar colors work .
Linksys
The Linksys site is neat because of how it has one blue for all of its links , even though the background color is various shades of blue .
While a risk and maybe not the greatest color decision , it does work .
Brad Colbow
Brad Colbow ’s design is similar to Linksys ’ because of the blue text on blue background .
Blue on blue is difficult to pull off nicely , especially with so many different blues throughout the site .
Powerset
So far in this section we ’ve seen only blue websites , because blue text is hardest for the human eye to read , and so legible blue type is always impressive .
If a text effect works in blue , it will most likely work in any color .
Powerset uses a letterpress style for its font to create a 3 - D effect that effectively separates the text from the background .
Artist In Design
Artist
In Design not only has green text on a green background and yellow / beige text on a yellow background but has text directly on top of a photo .
While some individual letters may be hard to read , the words as a whole remain legible .
This type of effect should almost always be center stage in a design .
Horacio Bella
Horacio Bella uses another 3 - D effect on his portfolio .
In this case , the letters appear to pop out rather than be dented inwards .
Without this effect , legibility would have been greatly reduced .
Another good effect used here is the tight kerning of letters , which further improves legibility .
Rule # 7 : Do n’t Put Animation in the Way of Your Content
Seriously , do n’t pop up little Flash ads right where the user is reading .
Same goes for those survey boxes that show up whenever the user is in the middle of a sentence .
Users do not enjoy being distracted when they ’re halfway through a sentence .
Unless …
It ’s really hard to not be enthralled by the little spider on ABA ‘s site .
The design is clean , and although the spider is a distraction , it ’s okay .
So far , this site I think is the only exception to the rule .
Rule # 8 : Stick to Web - Safe Fonts
Although font face replacement techniques are still young , they ’re already making a big splash .
sIFR was the first , and recently Cufón and Typefasce .js have emerged .
Diseñorama
On the Diseñorama website , the red “ Recientemente ” text is selectable .
One downside is that if the site does n’t load instantly , the user will see the original plain font briefly .
Another downside is that if the user has either JavaScript or Flash disabled , they would only see the original font .
All things considered , it ’s still pretty cool .
Hopefully it ’s a preview of what ’s to come in the next few years .
Cactuslab
Cactuslab also uses sIFR for the blue sub-headers ( such as “ Winter Work ” ) .
Although sIFR is the most complicated of the font - replacement techniques , text can be copied and pasted , giving it a big advantage over the two other techniques .
Rule # 9 : Do n’t Have a Splash / Landing Page
Many designers have had that same old discussion with their clients about why a splash page is not a good idea .
Google tends to rank such pages lower , and they slow down the user from getting the content that they ’re after .
But they can be incredibly beautiful and inspiring if done right .
Gloss Postproduction
The purpose of the portfolio sample that appears on the splash page of Gloss Postproduction ‘s website is to elicit an emotional reaction from the user .
Upon each visit , a random photo from the portfolio is loaded .
Clicking on the photo scales it down and puts it in its place among the other portfolio pieces on the site .
The scaling and motion effect provides continuation and helps carry over the user ’s emotion to the rest of the company ’s work .
Issa London
When a site is completely done in Flash , the loading bar can serve as a splash page .
When a user sees a loading bar , they will either close the page and go somewhere else or switch to another tab and browse elsewhere while they wait .
Once the page loads , it ’s best to wait for the user to return before starting up .
In Issa London ‘s case , the gate is a perfect metaphor to say that the site is ready and the user may enter .
When the user clicks on the gate , the gate opens and various illustrated models appear .
Using the gate on the splash page is a great design idea because upon entering , the user feels engaged .
Rule # 10 : Do n’t use Tables
Any web designer who uses tables in their designs will instantly be called a rookie by experienced designers .
Tables do n’t display the same in all browsers , and they can make the source code look messy , but at the very least you ’ll know what you ’re getting with them .
Here are some examples of designs that incorporate tables .
This table is slightly hard to see but is tucked in there between the two chairs .
It ’s a nice little side table but sadly does n’t contribute much to this site ’s design .
Tables are way in the background of this design on Work at Play , but they keep the workers ’ laptops and other items within easy reach .
Without these tables , the room would feel much emptier , and the background photo would n’t have the same effect .
Although this design mostly features chairs , a nice little table appears in the top - right of the thumbnail .
Looks like a pot is sitting on it .
As far as designs with tables go , this is one of the best .
With two tables featured in this Flash animation , the design gives them a lot of attention .
This site should be on every designer ’s list of great designs that use tables .
Break the Rules !
Breaking the rules is okay when a design calls for it .
Many of the design choices reviewed here would not be considered by the average designer .
This is what separates great designers from average ones .
Those brave enough to go against what they ’ve been taught always stand out .

Piezoelectric energy–energy produced when stress is applied to an object–is already used to produce power for roads , subways , and nightclubs .
Now a Sainsbury supermarket in Gloucester , England , is using kinetic plates to keep checkout lines moving .
Sainsbury ’s road plates , which are similar to those seen on London streets , produce 30 kWh of energy every hour from cars passing over the bumps in the store parking lot .
The Highway Energy Systems - designed road plates are pushed down by the weight of the vehicles , creating a rocking motion that turns generators .
Energy from the generators is captured and used inside the supermarket .
The system , which generates more than enough energy to power the store ’s checkout lines , supposedly does n’t affect vehicle fuel efficiency .
That ’s a sore spot for existing piezoelectric projects , as detractors claim that they are “ energy thieves ” that suck up energy from gasoline and convert it into forward motion .
But if the Sainsbury road plates are in an area where cars are slowing down anyway ( i.e. a downward ramp ) , then the energy is clean .
Piezoelectric road plates are just one of Sainsbury ’s sustainable initiatives .
The Gloucester Quays store also uses rainwater to flush toilets and solar thermal panels to heat 100 % of the water used during the summer .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Navy is monitoring a North Korean ship at sea under new U.N. sanctions that bar Pyongyang from exporting weapons , including missile parts and nuclear materials , U.S. officials said on Thursday .
South Korean navy vessels conduct a drill against possible attacks by North Korea in the East Sea off Donghae , east of Seoul , June 17 , 2009 .
REUTERS / South Korean Navy / Handout
Officials said the vessel , called Kang Nam , is based in North Korea and became “ a subject of interest ” after leaving a North Korean port on Wednesday .
They could not confirm media reports describing the vessel as North Korean flagged .
The officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , could not say what the ship , now in international waters , might be carrying .
One official said the Kang Nam would be the first North Korean ship to be monitored under the authority of the U.N. sanctions adopted last week after Pyongyang raised tensions by test - firing missiles , restarting a plant to produce arms - grade plutonium and conducting a May 25 nuclear test .
The Navy and the Pentagon both declined to comment on the vessel .
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution last Friday that banned all weapons exports from North Korea and most arms imports into the country .
It authorized U.N. member states to inspect North Korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy shipped goods that violate the sanctions .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , declined to discuss specifics when asked about the ship at a briefing on Thursday .
“ I would n’t go into any kind of details at this particular point in time , except to say that it ’s very clear that the resolution prohibits North Korea from shipping these kinds of materials ... from conventional weapons up to fissile material or nuclear weapons , ” Mullen said .
Mullen , the highest - ranking officer in the U.S. military , stressed the U.N. resolution would allow the Navy to search a ship only with permission .
If a vessel refused to allow a search , Mullen said the home country of any port where the vessel docks would be required to search its cargo .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Obama administration was also concerned about the possibility of North Korea firing off more missiles , possibly in the direction of Hawaii .
“ We ’re obviously watching the situation in the North with respect to missile launches very closely , and we do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the West in the direction of Hawaii , ” he said .
“ Without telegraphing what we will do , I would just say we are in a good position -- should it become necessary -- to protect American territory . ”
Gates said he had directed the redeployment of anti-missile assets in the Pacific region , including advanced radar and other defensive systems capable of bringing down medium - range ballistic missiles as a precaution .
" It also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone .
There were also tiny fragments of bone , which , when subjected to Carbon 14 tests by experts , turned out to belong to someone who lived in the first or second century . "

Our minds and bodies are intimately connected .
Everything in our minds is dependent on what we perceive through our bodies , and specifically – our senses and perceptual systems .
Our biological bodies have been evolutionarily designed to experience the environment in a distinct and adaptive way .
Every sense ( sight , hearing , taste smell , touch ) has developed because it ’s helped us to better understand our world and navigate it successfully .
Humans have an incredibly complex perceptual system compared to most animals ; our sensory modalities include sight , hearing , taste , smell , balance , temperature , kinesthetic ( awareness of our 3D - orientation in space ) , pain , and a variety of other internal body sensations .
Senses are the building block to our experiences and “ map of reality . ”
If we did not sense our environment , where would our experiences come from ?
Although our senses are where our experiences begin , it is often not where our experiences end .
Instead , the mind chooses to cognize and conceptualize what it perceives .
It takes in information through the senses , thinks about it and analyzes it , then creates useful concepts , meaning , and “ mental content . ”
Let ’s explore the nature of “ body awareness ” and how it influences our perceptions of reality .
In particular , I want to focus on something I call “ expanded awareness ” and the “ car body phenomenon , ” which is when our self - awareness expands to include things outside of ourselves , such as when we drive a car .
Let me explain .
Your Body Sensations and Expanded Awareness
The goal of mindfulness meditation is to not judge our senses or observations ; but to accept them as is .
We can start cultivating this awareness by shifting our focus to our bodies .
For example , we can tune into the sensations of our breathing – how air feels coming in through our mouth and out through our nostrils , the feeling of our chest rising and falling with each breath .
Then we can expand our awareness further – perhaps we begin scanning our bodies and see what we find .
An itch on your foot , or ache in your back , or feeling tension in your joints .
You observe your awareness expanding and contrasting .
At times you zoom in to something as little as the pain of a small splinter on your toe .
Other times , you are aware of your whole body at once like during a huge gush of wind .
Our awareness is our window into experience .
It is always being shaped and reshaped , shifting and moving through time and space from moment to moment depending on what we choose to focus on .
If you pay attention , you begin to notice your awareness even extends outside of your body at times .
This can happen if you remain still for a long enough period of time , especially when your eyes are closed and you are in a silent environment – like falling asleep and entering into a dream .
Or simple daydreaming during a boring class or business meeting .
Our awareness “ leaves ” our bodies .
When one becomes skilled enough at mindfulness , one begins to become aware of the “ mental boundaries ” of the body .
It begins with the sensation of awareness on the brink of your body – the outermost edge .
And as you continually pay attention to this border , you notice it begins to drift off of your skin , maybe only an inch or two away from your body .
More and more , we begin to notice our preconceptions of the body are n’t as rigid as we first thought . *
(* This is n’t meant to be “ supernatural ” or “ mystical , ” it ’s just an actual experience one can have if they pay attention to it .
One could simply think of it as a “ mental trick . ” )
Expanded Awareness and the “ Car Body ” Phenomena
One does n’t need to be a disciplined student of meditation or in a dream state to experience a real - life example of “ expanded awareness ” outside the body .
It happens all of the time .
One of the best examples I have noticed throughout my daily experience is what I would call the “ Car Body ” phenomena .
After years of experience as a passenger in a car , when you first take up the role of the “ driver ” the experience is very different .
Up until this point , you may have only had experience with mobilizing your natural body but this is one of the first times you step into the position of being the mind for a new and ultimately different body .
You are now in the position to choose where the car goes – the direction of is completely dependent on your will .
The car can also be said to have different “ physiological ” states : it may be at rest , or parked , moving forward or in reverse , accelerating or decelerating .
You are the mind of the car , and thus all the mental states of the car are contained within you and your perception as well .
You have awareness about where the car is leaving from , how it will get to its destination , and where it will ultimately end up .
By now you may be starting to see the similarities between driving your “ car body ” and driving your “ natural body . ”
The interesting phenomena I wish to illustrate however is the mind ’s awareness to inhabit the car body in the same way we can become aware of our natural bodies during meditation .
Once one gets comfortable with driving it becomes second nature .
We no longer need to consciously think out every action .
This is evident in a phenomenon known as highway hypnosis – the experience of driving from point A to point B but having no recollection of having done so .
This is especially true when we drive long distances , or even when we carry out commonplace daily actions such as driving to work everyday ( especially when in a half - sleepy state after waking up ) .
Almost all drivers have had some sort of experience with highway hypnosis .
If one remains mindful while driving you may come to the some of the same conclusions that I have regarding the car body .
What I have discovered is that my mind seems to – at a subconscious level – inhabit the body of the car in the same way it inhabits my natural shell .
To do this , my mind seems to extend its awareness to the edges of the car so that my awareness encompasses the full body of the car while I am navigating on the road .
Specifically , one may intensify this experience when trying to fit into a tight parking spot or change lanes with the presence of many cars .
When doing this , I do not believe that we just use our visual senses and then make a computational judgment on how close we are to other objects , but instead , we have a kinesthetic feeling of our orientation in space as if we are the body of the car .
Try to recall a memory when you drove a friend or family member ’s car that is significantly different in shape or size to what you are typically used to driving .
It takes time to familiarize yourself with not only the mechanics of the car , and how rigid or smooth it operates , but also it ’s specific orientation in space .
You will notice when driving a bigger car that you may overcompensate for avoiding objects because you are so unfamiliar with the feeling or presence of the car on the street .
It takes time for awareness to adjust to our new “ car body ” until eventually it too becomes second nature .
Our Mind Takes the Shape of the Things We Interact With
After I experienced and conceptualized this “ car body ” phenomenon , I came across some research that seems to support these beliefs .
One fascinating study published in Current Biology discovered that our brains represents tools that we use as temporary body parts .
“ In other words , the tool becomes a part of what is known in psychology as our body schema ..
It ’s a phenomenon each of us unconsciously experiences every day …
The reason you were able to brush your teeth this morning without necessarily looking at your mouth or arm is because your toothbrush was integrated into your brain ’s representation of your arm . ”
The leading researcher of the study , Patrick Haggard , tells BBC News :
“ Neuroscientists have known for a long time that the brain ’s map of the body is not static : in fact , the brain needs to adjust to the changes in our body that occur with growth , ageing , and traumas such as amputation or injury .
But this paper shows how rapid these adjustments are . ”
Our minds seem to take the shape of what we interact with .
When it comes to using a hammer , or playing musical instrument , or driving a car , our bodies seem to take the object and integrate it into our concept of “ body ” and “ self . ”
So the next time you are using a tool or object , think about your relationship with it .
And how it seems to become a part of you .

If secularist opponents of faith schools think religion is “ a busted flush ” they should stop being afraid of its influence , writes the editor of the Times Educational Supplement ( TES ) .
Instead of fearing faith schools , secular liberals who believe in diversity should support parents ’ “ right to educate their children in an ethos of their choosing ” , says Gerard Kelly in his editorial .
“ One can not celebrate diversity by restricting choice ” , he argues .
Mr Kelly ’s article follows a series of attacks on faith schools by secular groups and think - tanks who say they undermine social cohesion .
The British Humanist Association earlier this month called for the Government ’s new Equality Bill to strip faith schools of their right to choose some staff and pupils who share their religion .
But Mr Kelly points out that most faith schools offer their communities “ excellent teaching and support ” .
“ To blame them for the actions of sectarian fanatics , as some critics do , is unfair and glib ” , he adds .
“ Are those outrages the result of over - exposure to church fetes and nativity plays or do they have their roots in something more fundamental – poverty , say ? ”
Secular liberals who oppose faith schools are “ inconsistent ” , he continues .
“ Most people would accept that parents have a right to educate their children in an ethos of their choosing , however wrong it may seem to others , as long as the law is observed .
“ That is the nature of a tolerant , democratic society . ”
Earlier this month the Revd Janina Ainsworth , Chief Education Officer for the Church of England , defended faith schools ’ right to maintain their ethos by choosing some staff and pupils who share their religion .
“ Their proposals to strip faith schools of the right to use any faith - based admissions criteria would dilute a key ingredient that can help to make these schools distinctive , popular and successful ” , she argued .
“ The thousands of staff , governors and parents involved in creating inclusive , distinctively Christian learning environments in voluntary - aided church schools will say with one voice that their motivation is to provide the best possible place for children to learn and develop , spiritually , socially and academically . ”
Commenting on the issue last year , Revd Ainsworth said : “ Some seem to believe that the Christian ethos , which is so valued by parents , is like a sort of magic dust that is sprinkled on church schools simply by association .
“ But it is , in fact , achieved through the hard work of staff and governors in building a learning community that is underpinned with Christian values . ”
Voices from Iran

By Kamin Mohammadi ( first published by Open Democracy )
Iranians abroad are using every means available to follow events in their homeland and stand alongside their compatriots .
One of them , Kamin Mohammadi , reports .
If my experience is any guide , Iranians outside Iran are living some of the most intense days of their lives .
Since the first , disputed results of the presidential election were announced soon after the polls closed on 12 June 2009 and the protests almost immediately started , my waking hours are absorbed - hour - by - hour , even minute - by - minute - in gathering computer - delivered news about what is happening in my homeland .
Martial Law - by Nikahang Kowsar
It is compulsive , and also complicated .
The intense emotional engagement brings with it far more unease than satisfaction .
The process of digesting the news from family and friends in Iran that clogs my inbox , of following multiple links to blogs , of watching sometimes horrific videos , leaves me at once outraged and energised yet also sickened and paralysed into inaction and silence .
If there is a pattern to these feelings , it lies in an often wild pendulum - swing between a vague sense of hope and elation , and deep shame and depression .
The shame is hard : that even while people were being beaten and shot in Tehran on 20 June , police were waiting at the hospitals to arrest or take down the names of the injured - the foretaste of a midnight visit to their homes from the basij militias ; that while the regime was killing its own people , it was the foreign embassies that opened their doors to the wounded to help us .
But the pride too is profound : in the fearlessness of my compatriots ; in the humanity and solidarity that binds us , a reminder of the Persian poet Sa'adi 's words - as true today as when they were written in the 13th - century - " The children of Adam are limbs to each other , having been created of one essence " ; and in the defiant night - time chants of allahu akbar ( God is great ) that arise from the Tehran rooftops , at once an echo of the 1979 revolution , an eerie act of resistance , and a desperate call for mercy and strength .
In 1978 - 79 , these cries were symbolic of opposition to the Shah 's tyranny and the much - proclaimed gharbzadegi ( westoxification ) of Iranian society , and of the call for a returnto the core Shi'a Muslim values that a vast majority of Iranians held dear .
Now , they are being raised against the architects of the Islamic Republic themselves , the very men who helped Ayatollah Khomeini shape the regime that he called " God 's government " .
An epic struggle for the soul of this government is now being waged in the regime 's upper echelons .
The people of Iran - voters , citizens , students , protestors , women and men , exiles , those resident abroad - are looking on , seeking to make their voices heard .
Amid the storm
A friend who works for the provincial governor of one of Iran 's remoter provinces tells me : " The people know that this is not about regime change .
Most people want Iran to remain an Islamic Republic .
But they feel that perhaps there is a way open to them now to improve things a little from within the system .
At least to keep alive the republican elements of the system that [ Mahmoud ] Ahmadinejad 's years in power have been eroding . "
The leading opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Moussavi may be depicted in the west as an outsider to the regime but Iranians know that he is part of the religious establishment and hardly a radical .
" We voted for him because he is the only one who spoke even a little to our concerns " , says a 30 - year - old , Bijan .
" We thought that perhaps , being so well - established in the regime would give him the ability to really change things . "
Bijan belongs to that burgeoning majority of Iranians ( upwards of 70 % ) who were born since the revolution of 1979 or were then small children .
These young people barely remember the events of thirty years ago , and they are not demanding a change to the system of Islamic rule .
Above all else they are pragmatic , sharing little of the idealism of their parents who took part in the revolution ; and this pragmatism makes them shy away from anything but a gradual loosening of the regime 's tight grip on their civil liberties .
" People are angry and they have had enough " , says Sara , a journalist in Tehran , " The last four years have been really difficult but we have all sat quietly like good children and waited for a legal opportunity to vote for change .
Then with this cheating they have really insulted our intelligence .
It was too obvious .
People are really fed up .
It sticks in our throats . "
Sara herself was arrested and hit with batons during the post-election protests in Tehran .
She tells me that Tehran is quiet now because there are police and militia everywhere .
" It 's like martial law .
The plainclothes guys " - a reference to the basij -" are everywhere on their motorbikes , with batons in their hands .
They are patrolling the streets , hiding themselves in each corner .
They do what they like .
The university is quiet today - I think they have postponed exams - but I do n't think it means the protests are over .
The flames are still alive under the ashes of Saturday ... "

Bijan informs me that state television - the only kind available now that satellite channels have been scrambled - has been laying the groundwork for the regime 's violence , which is consciously planned .
" They broadcast nationalistic programmes and in between , they have phone - ins in which people support Ahmadinejad and say the protestors are vandals and destroying their livelihoods .
These people asking for more force from the government , for the army to be called in to protect them .
I do n't know if they are real opinions or just planted by the regime , but in any case , they are preparing people for what might still come - massive bloodshed . "
Another friend in Tehran says : " The demonstrations now are happening in complete silence , and on the pavements instead of the roads - to give the basij no reason to retaliate .
Also to stop the regime being able to blame the unrest on ' terrorists ' , which is what they have been doing . "
Sara tells me that state television 's portrayal of the terrible confrontations of 20 June - when live rounds were fired on protestors and teargas was used - highlights scenes in which protestors chased and beat members of the security forces .
The narrative implies that they are terrorists from groups such as the Mujahideen - e - Khalq ( MEK ) supposedly backed by the west .
" People are getting their news from each other , although most mobiles stop working in the late afternoons and evenings .
Since the election we have n't been able to send text - messages .
The internet is censored and getting online is very difficult .
The connection speed is down , and skype was scrambled too .
But we find our ways , we are used to working around the system . "
Ahmad , a university student from Shiraz - where , as in Tehran and other cities , there have been bloody attacks on campuses - is both elated and apprehensive by what has been happening .
" There will be plenty more bloodshed before any further developments take place .
The basij are not shooting , but they are hitting young people on the head with the end of their rifles , and they have been attacking dormitories . "
In face of power
What of the titanic political struggle behind the scenes ?
Bijan says : " Everyone is looking at [ former president , Hashemi ] Rafsanjani to see what he will do .
The rumour is that he is in Qom rallying support from the ayatollahs .
The public 's opinion of Moussavi has massively improved since the supreme leader 's speech on Friday .
People feel that now he will go down in history , and they are willing to forget his past .
He has a clean slate now ... "
I tell Bijan that Rafsanjani is being called a reformist in the west .
We laugh at the absurdity of a situation in which one of the richest and ( it is commonly believed ) most corrupt conservatives in the land - the man whose unpopularity in 2005 was a key to Ahmadinejad 's ascent to power - is now viewed as a figurehead of rebels .
The power of social networks like Facebook and Twitter comes from their ability to quickly share information about your life with other people .
But along with that ability comes the risk of sharing sensitive information with the wrong people , and that risk increases as your network grows well beyond your core circle of friends .
Using Twitter and Facebook effectively takes more than discretion ; you should know how to tweak the settings for these services so that you have full control over who sees what on your Facebook page or on Twitter .
In the two stories linked below , and in others to come , we 'll cover both sides of the coin : how to use the tools at your disposal to keep your profiles in check , and how to handle the etiquette side of the equation , as well .
The garden - variety freshman may not have much to worry about , but it 's a different story if you -- as many people are increasingly doing -- are using Facebook and Twitter not for updates about your meals , pets , and drinking binges , but for professional purposes .
So we 've outlined here a handful of common disastrous scenarios in which one ( or both ) of these social networks was misused , as well as the best way to prevent or remedy the problem .
But in the end you 'll find that the fundamental lesson is invariably the same , and that 's to remember the golden rule of all social networks :
Never forget that the whole world is watching .

pThe story behind the letter below is that there is this nutball in Newport , Rhode Island named Scott Williams who digs things out of his backyard and sends the stuff he finds to the Smithsonian Institute , labelling them with scientific names , insisting that they are actual archaeological finds .
This man really exists and does this in his spare time !
Anyway ... here 's the actual response from the Smithsonian Institution .
Bear this in mind next time you think you are challenged in your duty to respond to a difficult situation in writing .
Smithsonian Institute 207 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington , DC 20078 Dear Mr. Williams :
Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute , labelled ' 93211 - D , layer seven , next to the clothesline post ...
Hominid skull .
'We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination , and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it represents conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in Charleston County two million years ago .
Rather , it appears that what you have found is the head of a Barbie doll , of the variety that one of our staff , who has small children , believes to be ' Malibu Barbie . '
It is evident that you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this specimen , and you may be quite certain that those of us who are familiar with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to contradict your findings .
However , we do feel that there are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off to its modern origin : 1 . The material is moulded plastic .
Ancient hominid remains are typically fossilised bone .
2 . The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9 cubic centimetres , well below the threshold of even the earliest identified proto - hominids .
3 . The dentition pattern evident on the skull is more consistent with the common domesticated dog than it is with the ravenous man-eating Pliocene clams you speculate roamed the wetlands during that time .
This latter finding is certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses you have submitted in your history with this institution , but the evidence seems to weigh rather heavily against it .
Without going into too much detail , let us say that : 1 . The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a dog has chewed on .
2 . Clams do n't have teeth .
It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny your request to have the specimen carbon - dated .
This is partially due to the heavy load our lab must bear in its normal operation , and partly due to carbon - datings notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record .
To the best of our knowledge , no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD , and carbon - dating is likely to produce wildly inaccurate results .
Sadly , we must also deny your request that we approach the National Science Foundation Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning your specimen the scientific name Australopithecus spiff - arino .
Speaking personally , I , for one , fought tenaciously for the acceptance of your proposed taxonomy , but was ultimately voted down because the species name you selected was hyphenated , and did n't really sound like it might be Latin .
However , we gladly accept your generous donation of this fascinating specimen to the museum .
While it is undoubtedly not a Hominid fossil , it is , nonetheless , yet another riveting example of the great body of work you seem to accumulate here so effortlessly .
You should know that our Director has reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens you have previously submitted to the Institution , and the entire staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your digs at the site you have discovered in your Newport back yard .
We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation 's capital that you proposed in your last letter , and several of us are pressing the Director to pay for it .
We are particularly interested in hearing you expand on your theories surrounding the trans - positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a structural matrix that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex femur you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty 9 - mm Sears Craftsman automotive crescent wrench .
Yours in Science , Harvey Rowe Chief Curator - Antiquities
Where did the A ( H1N1 ) flu come from ?
Residents of the Mexican town where the first case was diagnosed say that a US - owned factory just a few miles down the road , which produces 950,000 pigs a year , is to blame .
A blogger from the area went to the factory to look into the conditions .
Only a week after the deadly virus hit the headlines , what we first knew as swine flu , and is now called influenza A ( H1N1 ) , remains quite some mystery to both scientists and the public .
Where this pig / bird / human flu super virus came from remains unknown .
But what we do know , is that around a month ago , a five - year - old boy , Edgar Hernandez , fell ill with what has now been diagnosed as the A ( H1N1 ) virus , and is thought to be the first known victim .
The boy survived , but following his illness , around 800 people in his tiny town , La Gloria , southwest Mexico , also fell ill with a mysterious flu .
What we also know , is that a few miles down the road lies " Granjas Carroll " , an enormous hog producer , majority - owned by multinational Smithfield Foods , and the United States 's biggest pork supplier .
The factory has long been the target of protests by locals , who have complained of contamination for over half a decade .
Now , they 're making the link between the pollution which comes from the farm and the origins of influenza A ( H1N1 ) .
They say that around half the townspeople work in Mexico City during the week , which is how the virus was transmitted to the capital .
Smithfield , however , denies the link .
The company says no pig in the factory has been diagnosed with the flu and therefore no infection can have emerged from it .
Mr Geithner is on a two - day visit to Beijing , America 's biggest creditor US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has told the Chinese government its investments in the US are " very safe " , despite a growing budget deficit .
Mr Geithner is on his first official visit to China , the biggest foreign investor in US treasury bonds .
Ahead of meetings with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao , he said the US and China must work together to fix the global economic system .
Mr Geithner said the US would move swiftly to get its debt under control .
In a speech at Beijing University at the start of his two - day visit , Mr Geithner reassured his Chinese hosts that they need not worry about the estimated $ 770 bn ( £ 475 bn ) they have invested in US treasuries , a class of US government debt .
" Chinese financial assets are very safe , " he said , drawing laughter from the audience .
He will be hoping that China 's president and premier take his reassurance more seriously , because America needs China 's confidence , and its money , says the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Beijing .
' Better shape '
Mr Geithner said the global recession was losing force , and the world 's financial system was starting to heal .
" We are seeing more durable stability in the economy and the financial system is in substantially better shape , " he said .
" But we have a ways to go and we need to keep working in the United States and with the other major economies to restore conditions for a sustainable recovery , " he said .
He made only the briefest reference to a topic of sharp disagreement - China 's currency .
America says it is undervalued , making Chinese exports cheaper and costing US jobs .
But he did not push the point too hard , perhaps because , as he said , global problems would not be solved without the US and China working together , our correspondent says .

To many people , including Ron Owens , the word " some " refers to a relatively small amount in between " none " and " most " .
But To Ron 's employer , and especially in the context of " job responsibly include ... some maintenance of legacy VB6 applications " , the word " some " tends to mean " pretty much all day long for the indefinite future . "
Because legacy application maintenance is one of the torments found in the outer circles of hell , Ron had hoped to find catharsis by sending in examples of his day - to - day .
But alas , because the application was so large and had been maintained by so many people , there was no single , concise snippet that faithfully represented what he was dealing with .
That is , until recently , where he uncovered a snippet that not only illustrated the ( over ) complexity of the application but offers glimpse into what the UI looks like .

Introduction
If you 're trying to get into game development for the iPhone , or some other platforms , you might have heard of Chipmunk as a 2D physics engine .
Chipmunk is very fast , easy and independent of the graphics engine of your choosing .
Personally , I use Cocos2D as a game engine but Chipmunk can be used with everything or even nothing ( i.e. no graphics ) provided you want to work with 2D physics and rigid bodies .
Chipmunk features are many and flexible , in this article I 'll try to teach the basics to a point where you can continue on your own .
I 'll be using Objective C , C and XCode during the article , and while I wo n't be using Cocos2d or other game engines for the sake of keeping things simple , it will only be understandable if you at least have some experience with iPhone development .
What will we do and learn during this tutorial ?
We 'll begin by learning the basics of Chipmunk and by setting up a test project .
From there we 'll keep extending the project until we achieve the end result , our first complete Chipmunk simulation .
Here 's a preview of the results :
Though not an amazing finish , at the end of this tutorial you should have all the basic knowledge to do basic simulations and even apply all concepts of this tutorial to do your first game .

A magnitude 4.7 earthquake shook a large stretch of Southern California on Sunday night .
There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries , though some broken windows , falling dishes and minor property damage occurred .
The quake hit at 8:39 p.m. and was centered near Lennox , a community between Inglewood and Hawthorne and east of Los Angeles International Airport .
Lasting about 15 seconds , the temblor could be felt as far away as the High Desert , Indio , Carpinteria and San Diego County .
The earthquake was “ a bit deep , ” said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough -- originating 8.4 miles below the surface .
“ That tends to make it less sharp -- less of a jerky , abrupt motion , ” Hough said .
As a result , most of the region felt the quake as a rolling motion , though some closer to the center may have felt a jolt .
“ It felt like all the windows were about to pop , ” said Joseph Poindexter , 36 , of Los Angeles , who was inside the Hollywood Park Casino .
“ It sounded like a big sonic boom .
Everybody started running or ducking under the tables . ”

Automatic sensors initially logged a magnitude 5 , but as more data came in , seismologists downgraded it to a magnitude 4.7 .
A brief aftershock , registering 3.1 , followed the quake at 8:45 p.m. , also centered in the Lennox area .
At the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department ’s Lennox station , deputies said the shaking was brief but intense .
“ It was pretty strong but over in about 10 seconds , ” said Lt. Kent Wegener .
“ There are no [ immediate ] reports of damage .
At this point , we are checking all the critical facilities and getting our ducks in a row . ”
Los Angeles city and county fire officials also said they had not received significant damage reports in residential or industrial areas , including the coastal refineries .

In Hawthorne , firefighters were called to a light pole on Chadron Avenue , near Crenshaw Boulevard , which was damaged during the earthquake .
One man suffered a heart attack but it was unclear whether that was connected to the quake .
“ Luckily , nothing major so far , ” said Hawthorne Police Lt. Michael Ishii .
At the South Bay Galleria , south of the epicenter , ceiling tiles fell inside a movie theater .
There were no injuries reported , though police were called to the scene to help reunite customers with belongings they ’d left inside when rushing for the exits , said Redondo Beach Police Sgt. Scott Weibel .
Lucy Jones , a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey , said the quake appeared to be consistent with a rupture on the Newport - Inglewood fault .

That fault has produced several damaging temblors , including the 1933 Long Beach earthquake , which measured about 6.3 in magnitude .
But it is not typically thought to be capable of producing “ The Big One ” -- the Long Beach quake is about as big as experts expect from the fault , Jones said .
“ In general , it ’s an active area , ” Jones said .
Sunday ’s quake was in keeping with that history -- “ a real garden - variety California earthquake . ”

Times staff writers Jia-Rui Chong , Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton contributed to this report .
Scientists in Portugal and France managed to follow the patterns of gene expression in food - poisoning bacteria Listeria monocytogenes ( L. monocytogenes ) live during infection for the first time .
The work about to be published in PLoS Pathogens shows how the bacterial genome shifts to better adapt to infection by activating genes involved in virulence and subversion of the host defences , as well as adaptation to the host conditions .
This is the first time that the molecular interactions between L. monocytogenes and its host , as they occur during the different steps of infection , are followed in real time .
The study paves the way , not only to the development of new therapies against this potentially lethal bacterium , but also for the study of other pathogen / host interactions .
L. monocytogenes exists everywhere in nature what is not a problem for individuals with healthy immune systems capable of keep the bacteria at bay , but a real danger for immunocompromised or pregnant hosts , in which case Listeriosis ( the infection ) can result in a mortality rate as high as 30 % .
The disease , which normally occurs after ingestion of contaminated food , starts in the digestive system with the bacteria moving next to the liver and spleen .
There , if not controlled by the immune system , it will continue to multiply and eventually lead to septicaemia or , if it migrates into the brain , to meningitis as well being able to induce miscarriages in the case of pregnant women after infection of the foetus .
Although the disease is relatively rare and there are antibiotics , these are not particularly efficient - probably because of the bacteria capability to hide inside the cells – as revealed in the high mortality rate found among susceptible individuals .
This makes Listeriosis an important public health problem and not only in the developing world - where AIDS and poor nutrition create high numbers of vulnerable individuals - but also in countries such as the US where about 1600 new cases and 500 deaths are reported every year .
To understand better the infection Ana Camejo , Didier Cabanes and colleagues from the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Oporto University , Portugal and the Pasteur Institute in Paris , France made use of a powerful approach called DNA array , which allows to follow gene expression by detecting the RNA molecules being produced at a certain time point .
In fact , during the process of gene expression the information contained in the DNA is converted into RNA molecules that are then read by the body machinery to produce the corresponding proteins .
DNA arrays are plates of spots with attached DNA fragments which bind and detect their corresponding RNA , and by detecting the RNA present in a cell they effectively identify the genes that are active at a certain time point .
In the case of L. monocytogenes it is known that about 19 % of its genome is differentially expressed during infection and to identify those genes is key to understand such events as the bacteria capacity to cross the intestinal , brain and placenta barriers or to infect the immune system cells without being targeted by it , all crucial for the bacteria high lethality .
To discover this Camejo , Cabanes and colleagues compared RNA molecules collected at different times ( 24 , 48 and 72 hours ) after infection from bacteria infecting mice , with the RNA from bacteria growing in laboratory , the idea being , that those genes only activated in the bacteria infecting mice but not when in laboratory would be linked to the infectious process .
And in fact , it was found that about 20 % f the bacterial genome was differentially expressed during Listeriosis with most of the activated genes linked to subversion of the host ’s defence - such as for example the production of a negative charge in the bacterial wall to repel the host anti-microbial peptides – resistance to the stress induced by the host defences and several adaptations to the new environment .
Camejo and colleagues also found that these infection - linked genes were controlled by a complex network coordinated by two major regulators called PrfA and SigB .
Finally , the researchers were able to identify several new virulence factors , which are bacterial proteins that induce the disease in the host .
Camejo , Cabanes and colleagues ’ work reveals how DNA arrays can give a detailed image of the molecular interactions between pathogen and host as they are occurring in the host in real time and how this can be a powerful tool to understand infection as demonstrated by the discovery of several new virulence factors for Listeria .
This information can now be used in the development of more efficient interventions against the disease , particularly in more susceptible individuals but also paves the way for the use of the technique in other infectious where the knowledge of the host / pathogen interaction is still scarce .

You 're gay , son ?
But what about MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Want yet another example of " pro-family " self - absorption ?
Well check out the following snippet from a new Focus on the Family interview .
The refeernced speaker is Anita Worthen , who co-founded New Hope Ministries with her " ex- gay " husband Frank :
Q.. Anita , tell me about the day your 16 - year - old son told you he was living a gay lifestyle .
What advice do you have for parents facing a similar situation ?
A. Anita : I ’ll never forget that moment because it was like I went into shock .
It ’s so hard because people never guess it ’s going to happen until it does .
But if parents could do the right thing , it ’s just not say anything until they learn more .
Just express the fact that they love their child : " I love you .
This does n’t change how I feel about you . "
You really hope that this is just a little hiccup in your life , a nightmare , and you can get everything straightened out ‘ cause you 're mom and that ’s your job .
I felt like it was just a little skip in his life , not a fall in our plans for his life .
And I think that ’s true with most parents .
There are two things I tell parents : I cannot fix your kid , but I know God can .
God is able .
And the second thing :
God is able to do this without you .
And sometimes you may be getting in the way .
Friday Five : Ministry Leaders Frank and Anita Worthen [ FOF ]
" I went into shock " ?
" Just a little hiccup in your life " ?
" You 're mom and that 's your job " ?
" Our plans for his life " ?
" Fix your kid " ?!
Good mother of arrogance : Homosexuality is not a dirty diaper in need of changing !
It 's not all about you , the parent .
In fact , it 's not really AT ALL about you :
It 's about your child ( and husband ) and their truth (s ) !
The idea that is the parent 's life that is disrupted is the underlying problem with this whole " gays can change " mentality , as it adds the " you should change to please me subtext " that belies the professional " ex- gay " community 's claims that their movement is all about self - determination and personal choice .
It bears out a crucial reality :
That this movement hopes to recruit impressionable parents ( or other family members ) more than it hopes to recruit actual gay people .
The idea is to misinform potential allies to recruit them and those within their sphere of influence into the " pro-family " way of thinking .
They wish to muddy truth 's waters , " changing " much more that gays into " ex- gays . "
Instead , they wish to change ( no quotes ) society into ex-accepting !
Those of us who 've dealt with family non-acceptance have a particularly weak heart for this sort of non-acceptance , because we know the whole host of problems , dangers , and mind - f*cks that it can cause .
So we ask Anita Worthlen to stop for a second , quiet the head , and at least consider for just a moment that maybe she is not meant to be the harsh , constrictive director of their child 's movie .
If she does , we think she might begin to see that the lead actor 's gay casting does not automatically turn his or film into a tragedy or horror , and that it 's actually her own refusal to accept the unexpected script change that more fully ensures a flop .
With peace , all can have a happy ending .
Your thoughts
" There are two things I tell parents : I can not fix your kid , but I know God can .
God is able . "
Sure , but is God willing ?
Let 's look at Anita 's example .
She 's been stressing and fretting and has made her entire life centered around her distress over Tony 's sexual orientation .
And yet God still has n't " fixed " her kid .
It 's been 40 years or more of demanding that God change her son and God does n't seem to be be much inclined .
Anita , like Regina and so many others , are complete failures .
They have presented their wishes and their beliefs and their teachings and their faith for decades .
And those closest to them , those who know them best , their own children reject their agenda .

Even otherwise accepting parents have a tendency to do this .
My mother spent two years ranting about how hard it was for her .

Poor Tony !
I heard / read some of this stuff when I covered the " Love Won Out " seminar in Orlando a few years back , and it stunned me .
I found myself idly wondering what they would do if , say , their grown child was hit by a bus and paralyzed , or murdered someone and went to jail , or was , you know , a participant in any real tragedy at all .
Instead they have to turn the simple fact that their child grew into something different than they 'd planned into a tragedy with their own selfishness .

This is a case of the pot calling the kettle black .
Granted some parents take it over board but is n't pride a selfish " LOOK AT ME I'M QUEER ! IT 'S ALL ABOUT ME ! " event and mindset ?
It is a selfish event for GLBT 's but no one is going to cop to that because they will be seen as somehow denying joy to poor GLBT's and their endless injustices .
Parents have a right to be upset and talk about - at length even .
Much to the horror of the person who has come out .
News flash - being gay will always be a badge of shame no matter how much democratic media spin you put on it .
Society as a whole no matter how accepting will always look at parents with a suspicious eye and think " They must have done something wrong . "
No matter how much proof is provided to the contrary .
It 's gays that need to tone down the selfishness but that 's in direct opposition to the " If it feels good over do it " mindset of gay culture .
But one can never expect GLBT's to take a honest look in the mirror and accept the fact that the gay life is flawed and that denial is king of it .
Truth - Gays will never tell you the truth , only a forced and fake happy version of any event .
Proof is all around but no one is opening their eyes .

Poor bot fails and need some help
Now this works even with the first step
On a very unique design wirls LMB - user Arek ArunioSmo .
Neat I just see , that he comes form Duisburg , not that far away .
No wonder , that this type of stair - style just released some enjoyable childhood memories .
" ArunioSmo " uses a very unique design with a wooden arc for The Climber .
It uses its wheels to get grip and climb the stairs .
The " organic " feel of the robots gives a worm feeling like a living creature .
Very well done !
If you are reading this Arek , feel free to throw in a comment !
Fans of the Metroid Prime games , as well as those who enjoy a good FPS / action title , are in for a treat this summer .
Nintendo will be releasing the entire trilogy as a single - disc collection for the Wii in August .
Unsurprisingly named Metroid Prime Trilogy , the collection is set to be released on August 24 , and will sell for $ 49.99 .
The disc will include Metroid Prime , Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes , and Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , but will have an updated control scheme for the first two games to make them compatible with the Wii 's motion - sensing technology .
Apparently , these earlier entries into the trilogy will feature some other unspecified enhancements , though widescreen presentation has been confirmed .
Finally , the games will all feature a new unlockables system , allowing players to earn digital rewards like music and artwork by accomplishing objectives .
For fans of the Metroid games , this is undoubtably exciting news , as it will update some of their favorite titles and make them feel fresh again .
For those who are new to the series , though , having all three games on a single disc for a reasonable price is is a great introduction to the universe of Samus Aran .
North American fisheries have now largely collapsed , and now fisheries - induced evolution has been highlighted as one of the factors ( KIERAN DODDS / Rex Features )
Fishing is causing cod to evolve faster than anyone had suspected it could , fisheries scientists in Iceland have discovered .
This turbo-evolution may be why the world ’s biggest cod fishery , the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , crashed in 1992 and has yet to recover .
The Icelandic cod fishery , almost the only large cod fishery left anywhere in the world , is about to go the same way unless urgent conservation measures are applied , the scientists warn .
Einar Árnason ’s lab at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik is part of MADFish , a network of Nordic scientists studying molecular mechanisms of adaptation in fish .
They have discovered a gene in cod , Pan I , that seems to govern the depth at which the fish live .
Cod with the B form of Pan I live deeper down , except when they are on the shallow spawning grounds .
Cod with the A form of the gene spend all their time closer to the surface .

As the cod close to the surface are most likely to get caught , survival chances of fish with the A gene are only 8 per cent of those with the B gene .
As a result , fish with the A gene are disappearing rapidly .
Rapid change
Fisheries are known to exert selective pressure on fish .
In some cases this has led to the evolution of smaller fish .
This was thought to be a slow process .
“ Previous workers have concluded that evolutionary changes are only observable on a longer timescale , of decades , ” Árnason says .
“ The changes we observe are much more rapid . ”
The A gene is being driven out simply because of where those fish choose to live , says Árnason .
Such inadvertent , rapid selective pressure may drive some fisheries to crash .
“ Man the hunter has become a mechanised techno - beast , ” the team writes .
“ Modern fisheries are uncontrolled experiments in evolution . ”
Worryingly , the researchers found that cod in the Icelandic fishery are becoming sexually mature while still smaller and younger .
Something similar occurred in Newfoundland cod just before that fishery crashed .
“ We think this too is an evolutionary response to the selective pressure of fisheries , ” says Árnason .
To relieve the pressure , the team recommends setting aside large marine reserves to be kept off - limits to fishing .
Spawn from those areas could then replace fish with A genes lost elsewhere off Iceland .

In the social reality , despite all change , the domination of man by man is still the historical continuum that links pre-technological and technological Reason .
However , the society which projects and undertakes the technological transformation of nature alters the base of domination by , gradually replacing personal dependence ( of the slave on the master , the serf on the lord of the manor , the lord on the donor of the fief , etc. ) with dependence on the " objective order of things " ( on economic laws , the market etc. ) .
To be sure , the " objective order of things " is itself the result of domination , but it is evertheless true that domination now generates a higher rationality - that of a society which sustains its hierarchic structure while exploiting ever more efficiently the natural and mental resources , and distributing the benefits of this exploitation on an ever - larger scale .
The limits of this rationality , and its sinister force , appear in the progressive enslavement of man by a productive apparatus which perpetuates the struggle for existence and extends it to a total international struggle which ruins the lives of those who build and use this apparatus .
At this stage , it becomes clear that something must be wrong with the rationality of the system itself .
What is wrong is the war in which men have organized their societal labor .
This is no longer in question at the present time when , on the one side , the great entrepreneurs themselves are willing to sacrifice the blessings of private enterprise and " free " competition to the blessings of government orders and regulations , while , on the other side , socialist construction continues to proceed through progressive domination .
However , the question cannot come to rest here .
The wrong organization of society demands further explanation in view of the situation of advanced industrial society , in which the integration of the formerly negative and transcending social forces with the established system seems to create a new social structure .
This transformation of negative into positive opposition points up the problem : the " wrong " organization , in becoming totalitarian on internal grounds , refutes the alternatives .
Certainly it is quite natural , and does not seem to call for an explanation in depth , that the tangible benefits of the system are considered worth defending -- especially in view of the repelling force of present day communism which appears to be the historical alternative .
But it is natural only to a mode of thought and behavior which is unwilling and perhaps even incapable of comprehending what is happening and why it is happening , a mode of thought and behavior which is immune against any other than the established rationality .
To the degree to which they correspond to the given reality , thought and behavior express a false consciousness , responding to and contributing to the preservation of a false order of facts .
And this false consciousness has become embodied in the prevailing technical apparatus which in turn reproduces it .
We live and die rationally and productively .
We know that destruction is the price of progress as death is the price of life , that renunciation and toil are the prerequisites for gratification and joy , that business must go on , and that the alternatives are Utopian .
This ideology belongs to the established societal apparatus ; it is a requisite for its continuous functioning and part of its rationality .
However , the apparatus defeats its own purpose if its purpose is to create a humane existence on the basis of a humanized nature .
And if this is not its purpose , its rationality is even more suspect .
But it is also more logical for , from the beginning , the negative is in the positive , the inhuman in the humanization , enslavement in liberation .
This dynamic is that of reality and not of the mind , hut of a reality in which the scientific mind bad a decisive part in joining theoretical and practical reason .
Society reproduced itself in a growing technical ensemble of things and relations which included the technical utilization of men- in other words , the struggle for existence and the exploitation of man and nature became ever more ' scientific and rational .
The double meaning of " rationalization " is relevant in this context .
Scientific management and scientific division of labor vastly increased the productivity : of the economic , political , and cultural enterprise .
Result : '" the higher standard of living .
At the same time and on the same ground , this rational enterprise produced a pattern of mind and behavior which justified and absolved even the most destructive and oppressive features of the enterprise .
Scientific - technical rationality and manipulation are welded together into new forms of social control .
Can one rest content with the assumption that this unscientific outcome is the result of a specific societal application of science ?
I think that the general direction in which it came to be applied was inherent in pure science even where no practical purposes were intended , and that the point can be identified where theoretical Reason turns into social practice .
In this attempt , I shall briefly recall the methodological origins of the new rationality , contrasting it with the features of the pre-technological model discussed in the previous chapter .
The quantification of nature , which led to its explication in terms of mathematical structures , separated reality from all inherent ends and , consequently , separated the true from the good , science from ethics .
No matter how science may now define the objectivity of nature and the interrelations among its parts , it cannot scientifically conceive it in terms of " final causes . "
And no matter how constitutive may be the role of the subject as point of observation , measurement , and calculation , this subject cannot play its scientific role as ethical or aesthetic or political agent .
The tension between Reason on the one hand , and the needs and wants of the underlying population ( which has been the object hut rarely the subject of Reason ) on the other , has been there from the beginning of philosophic and scientific thought .
The " nature of things , " including that of society , was so defined as to justify repression and even suppression as perfectly rational .
True knowledge and reason demand domination over - if not liberation from - the senses .
The union of Logos and Eros led already in Plato to the supremacy of Logos ; in Aristotle , the relation between the god and the world moved by him is " erotic " only in terms of analogy .
Then the precarious ontological link between Logos and Eros is broken , and scientific rationality emerges as essentially neutral .
What nature ( including man ) may be striving for is scientifically rational only in terms of the general laws of motion .:.- physical , chemical , or biological .
Outside this rationality , one lives in a world of values , and values separated out from the objective reality become subjective .
The only war to rescue same abstract and harm - less validity for them seems to be a metaphysical sanction ( divine and natural law ) .
But such sanction is not verifiable and thus not really objective .
Values may have a higher dignity ( morally and spiritually ) , but they are not real and thus count less in the real business of life - the less so the higher they are elevated above reality .
The same de-realization affects all ideas which , by their very nature , cannot be verified by scientific method .
No matter how much they may be recognized , respected , and sanctified , in their own right , they suffer from being non-objective .
But precisely their lack of objectivity makes them ' into factors of social cohesion .
Humanitarian , religious , and moral ideas are only " ideal " ; they do n't disturb unduly the established war of life , and are not invalidated by the fact that they are contradicted by a behavior dictated by the daily necessities of business and politics .
If the Good and the Beautiful , Peace and Justice cannot be derived either from ontological or scientific - rational conditions , they cannot logically claim universal validity and realization .
In terms of scientific reason , they remain matters of preference , and no resuscitation of some kind of Aristotelian or Thomistic philosophy can save the situation , for it is a priori refuted by scientific reason .
The unscientific character of these ideas fatally weakens the opposition to the established reality ; the ideas become mere ideals , and I their concrete , critical content evaporates into the ethical or metaphysical atmosphere .
Paradoxically , however , the objective world , left equipped only with quantifiable qualities , comes to be more and more dependent in its objectivity on the subject .
This long process begins with the algebraization of geometry which replaces " visible " geometric figures with purely mental operations .
It finds its extreme form in same conceptions of contemporary scientific philosophy , according to which all matter of physical science tends to dissolve in mathematical or logical relations .
The very nation of an objective substance , pitted against the subject , seems to disintegrate .
From very different directions , scientists and philosophers of science arrive at similar hypotheses on the exclusion of particular sorts of entities .
For example , physics " does not measure the objective qualities of the external and material world - these are only the results obtained by the accomplishment of such operations . " [ 1 ]
Objects continue to persist only as " convenient intermediaries , " as obsolescent " cultural posits , " [ 2 ]
The density and opacity of things evaporate : the objective world loses its " objectionable " character , its opposition to the subject , Short of its interpretation in terms of Pythagorean - Platonic metaphysics , the mathematized Nature , the scientific reality appears to be ideational reality , These are extreme statements , and they are rejected by more conservative interpretations , which insist that propositions in contemporary physics still refer to " physical things . " [ 3 ]
But the physical things turn out to be " physical events , " and then the propositions refer to ( and refer only to ) attributes and relationships that characterize various kinds of physical things and processes , [ 4 ]
Max Born states : " . . . the theory of relativity , , , has never abandoned an at- tempts to assign properties to matter .
. . "
But " often a measurable quantity is not a property of a thing , but a property of its relation to other things . . .
Most measurements in physics are not directly concerned with the things which interest us , but with same kind of projection , the word taken in the widest possible sense . "
[ 5 ]
And W. Heisenberg : " Was wir mathematisch festlegen , ist nur zum kleinen Teil ein ' objectives Faktum , ' zum gr�sseren Teil eine Uebersicht �ber M�glichkeiten . " [ 6 ]
Now " events , " " relations , " " projections , " " possibilities " can be meaningfully objective only for a subject -- not only in terms of observability and measurability , but in terms of '; the very structure of the event or relationship .
In other : words , the subject here involved is a constituting one - that is , a possible subject for which some data must be , or can be conceivable as event or relation .
If this is the case , Reichenbach 's statement would still hold true : that propositions in physics can be formulated without reference to an actual observer , and the " disturbance by means of observation , " is due , not to the human observer , but to the instrument as " physical thing . " [ 7 ] �
To be sure , we may assure that the equations established by mathematical physics express ( formulate ) the actual constellation of atoms , i.e. , the objective structure of matter .
Regardless of any observing and rneasuring " outside " subject A may " include " B , " precede " B , " result in " .'
B ; B may be ' between " C , " larger than " C , etc . -- it would still be true that these relations imply location , distinction , and identity in the difference of A , B , C .
They thus imply the capacity of being identical in difference .
of being related to . . . in a specific mode , of being resistant to other relations , etc .
Only this capacity would be in matter itself , �and then matter itself would be objectively of the structure I of mind -- an interpretation which contains a strong idealistic element : " . . . inanimate objects , without hesitation , without error , simply by their existence , are integrating the equations of which they know nothing .
Subjectively , nature is not of the mind - she does not think in mathematical terms .
But objectively , nature is of the mind - she can be thought in mathematical terms . " [ 8 ]
A less idealistic interpretation is offered by Karl Popper , [ 9 ] who holds that , in its historical development , physical science uncovers and defines different layers of one and the same objective reality .
In this process , the historically surpassed concepts are being cancelled and their intent is being integrated into the succeeding ones - an interpretation which seems to imply progress toward the real core of reality , that is , the absolute truth .
Or else reality may turn out to be an anion without a core , and the very concept of scientific truth may be in jeopardy .
I do not suggest that the philosophy of contemporary physics denies or even questions the reality of the external world but that , in one war or another , it suspends judgment on what reality itself may be , or considers the very question meaningless and unanswerable .
Made into a methodological principle , this suspenion has a twofold consequence : ( a ) it strengthens the shift of theoretical emphasis from the metaphysical " What is . . . ? " to the functional " How . . . ? " , and ( b ) it establishes a practical ( though by no means absolute ) certainty which , in its operations with matter , is with good conscience free from commitment to any substance outside the operational context .
In other words , theoretically , the transformation of man and nature has no other objective limits than those offered by the brute factua1ity of matter , its still unmastered resistance to knowledge and control .
To the degree to which this conception becomes applicable and effective in reality , the latter is approached as a ( hypothetical ) system of instrumentalities ; the metaphysical " being - as - such " gives way to " being - instrument . "
Moreover , proved in its effectiveness , this conception works as an a priori- it predetermines experience , it projects the direction of the transformation of nature , it organizes the whole .
We just saw that contemporary philosophy of science seemed to be struggling with an idealistic element and , in its extreme formulations , moving dangerously close to an idealistic concept of nature .
However , the new mode of thought again puts idealism " on its feet , " Hegel epitomized the idealistic ontology : if Reason is the common denominator of subject and object , it is so as the synthesis of opposites .
With this idea , ontology comprehended the tension between subject and object ; it was saturated with concreteness .
The reality of Reason was the playing out of this tension in nature , history , philosophy .
Even the most extremely monistic system thus maintained the idea of a substance which unfolds itself in subject and object - the idea of an antagonistic reality .
The scientific spirit has increasingly weakened this antagonism , Modern scientific philosophy may well begin with the notion of the two substances , res cogitans and res extensa -- but as the extended matter becomes comprehensible in mathematical equations which , translated into technology , " remake " this matter , the res extensa loses its character as independent substance .
" The old division of the world into objective processes in space and time and the mind in which these processes are mirrored - in other words , the Cartesian difference between res cogitans and res extensa - is no longer a suitable starting point for our under - standing of modern science " [ 10 ]
The Cartesian division of the world has also been questioned on its own grounds .
Husserl pointed out that the Cartesian Ego was , in the last analysis , not really an in - dependent substance hut rather the " residue " or limit of quantification ; it seems that Galileo 's idea of the world as a " universal and absolutely pure " res extensa dominated a priori the Cartesian conception . [ 11 ]
In which case the Cartesian dualism would be deceptive , and Descartes ' thinking ego - substance would be akin to the res extensa , anticipating the scienti:6 c subject of quantifiable observation and measurement .
Descartes ' dualism would already imply its negation ; it would clear rather than block the load toward the establishment of a one - dimensional scientific universe in which nature is " objectively of the mind , " that is , of the subject .
And this subject is related to its world in a very special war : " . . . la nature est mise sous le signe de l'homme actif , de l'homme inscrivant la technique dans la nature . " [ 12 ]
The science of nature develops under the technological a priori which projects nature as potential instrumentality , stuff of control and organization , And the apprehension of nature as ( hypothetical ) instrumentality precedes the development of all particular technical organization : " Modern man takes the entirety of Being as raw material for production and subjects the entirety of the object - world to the sweep and order of production ( Herstellen ) . " " . . . the use of machinery and the production of machines is not technics itself but merely an adequate instrument for the realization ( Einrichtung ) of the essence of technics in its objective raw material . " [ 13 ]
The technological a priori is a political a priori inasmuch as the transformation of nature involves that of man , and inasmuch as the " man-made creations " issue from and re- j enter a societal ensemble .
One may still insist that the machinery of the technological universe is " as such " indifferent :, towards political ends - it can revolutionize or retard a society .
An electronic computer can serve equally a capitalist or socialist administration ; a cyclotron can be an equally , efficient tool for a war party or a peace party .
This neutrality is contested in Marx 's controversial statement that the " handmill gives you society with the feudal lord ; the steam - mill society with the industrial capitalist . " [ 14 ]
And this statement is further modified in Marxian theory itself : the social mode of production , not technics is the basic historical factor .
{
However , when technics becomes the universal form of material production , it circumscribes an entire culture ; it projects a historical totality - a " world . " !
Can we say that the evolution of scientific method merely " reflects " the transformation of natural into technical reality in the process of industrial civilization ?
To formulate the relation between science and society in this war is assuming two separate realms and events that meet each other , namely , ( 1 ) science and scientific thought , with their internal concepts and their internal truth , and ( 2 ) the use and application of science in the social reality .
In other words , no matter how close the connection between the two developments may be , they do not imply and define each other .
Pure science is not applied science ; it retains its identity and validity apart from its utilization .
Moreover .
this nation of the essential neutrality of science is also ex- tended to technics .
The machine is indifferent toward the social uses to which it is put .
provided those uses remain within its technical capabilities .
In view of the internal instrumentalist character of scientific method .
this interpretation appears inadequate .
A closer relationship seems to prevail between scientific thought and its application , between the universe of scientific discourse and that of ordinary discourse and behavior - a relationship in which both move under the same logic and rationality of domination .
In a paradoxical development , the scientific efforts to establish the rigid objectivity of nature led to an increasing de-materialization of nature : " The idea of infinite nature existing as such , this idea that we have to give up , is the myth of modern science .
Science has started out by destroying the myth of the Middle Ages .
And now science is forced by its own consistency to realize that it has merely raised another myth instead . " [ 15 ]
The process which begins with the elimination of independent substances and final causes arrives at the ideation of objectivity .
But it is a very specific ideation , in which the object constitutes itself in a quite practical relation to the subject : " And what is matter ?
In atomic physics , matter is defined by its possible reactions to human experiments , and by the mathematical - that is , intellectual - laws it obeys .
We are defining matter as a possible object of man 's manipulation . " [ 16 ]
And if this is the case then science has become in itself technological : " ' Pragmatic science has the view of nature that is fitting for technical age . " [ 17 ]
To the degree to which this operationalism becomes the center of the scientific enterprise , rationality assumes the form of methodical construction ; organization and handling of matter as the mere stuff of control , as instrumentality which lends itself to all purposes and ends - instrumentality per se , " in itself " .
The " correct " attitude toward instrumentality is the technical approach , the correct logos is technology , which projects and responds to a technological reality . [ 18 ]
In this reality , matter as well as science is " neutral " ; objectivity has neither a telos in itself nor is it structured toward a telos .
But it is precisely its neutral character which relates objectivity to a specific historical Subject - namely , to the consciousness that prevails in the society by which and for which this neutrality is established .
It operates in the very abstractions which constitute the new rationality - as an internal rather than external factor .
Pure and applied operationalism , theoretical and practical reason , the scientific and the business enterprise execute the reduction of secondary to primary qualities , quantification and abstraction from , " particular sorts of entities . "
True , the rationality of pure science is value - free and , does not stipulate any practical ends , it is " neutral " to any extraneous values that may be imposed upon it .
But this neutrality is a positive character .
Scientific rationality makes for a specific societal organization precisely because it projects mere form ( or mere matter - here , the otherwise opposite terms converge ) which can be bent to practically an ends .
Formalization and functionalization are , prior to an application , the " pure form - of a concrete societal practice .
While science freed nature from inherent ends and stripped matter of an hut quantifiable qualities , society freed men from the " natural " hierarchy of personal dependence and related them to each other in accordance with quantifiable qualities - namely , as units of abstract labor power , calculable in units of time .
" ' By virtue of the rationalization of the modes of labor , the elimination of qualities is transferred from the universe of science to that of daily experience . " [ 19 ]
Between the two processes of scientific and societal quanti:6cation , is there paral1e1ism and causation , or is their connection simply the work of sociological hindsight ?
The preceding discussion proposed that the new scientific rationality was in itself , in its very abstractness and purity , operational inasmuch as it developed under an instrumentalist horizon .
Observation and experiment , the methodical organization and coordination of data , propositions , and conclusions never proceed in an unstructured , neutral , theoretical space .
The project of cognition involves operations on objects , or abstractions from objects which occur in a given universe of discourse and action .
Science observes , calculates , and theorizes from a position in this universe .
The stars which Galileo observed were the same in classical antiquity , but the different universe of discourse and action - in short , the different social reality - opened the new direction and range of observation , and the possibilities of ordering the observed data .
I am not concerned here with the historical relation between scientific and societal rationality in the beginning of the modern period .
It is my purpose to demonstrate the internal instrumentalist character of this scientific rationality by virtue of which it is a priori technology , and the a priori of a specific technology - namely , technology as form of social control and domination .
Modern scientific thought , inasmuch as it is pure , does not project particular practical goals nor particular forms of domination .
However , there is no such thing as domination per se .
As theory proceeds , it abstracts from , or rejects , a factual teleological context - that of the given , concrete universe of discourse and action .
It is within this universe itself that the scientific project occurs or does not occur , that theory conceives or does not conceive the possible alter - natives , that its hypotheses subvert or extend the pre-estalished reality .
The principles of modern science were a priori structured in such a way that they could serve as conceptual instruments for a universe of self - propelling , productive control ; theoretical operationalism came to correspond to practical operationalism .
The scientific method which led to the ever - more - effective domination of nature thus came to provide the pure concepts as well as the instrumentalities for the ever - more - effective domination of man by man through the domination of nature .
Theoretical reason , remaining pure and neutral , entered into the service of practical reason .
The merger proved beneficial to both .
Today , domination perpetuates and extends itself not only through technology hut as technology , and the latter provides the great legitimation of the expanding political power , which absorbs all spheres of culture .
In this universe , technology also provides the great rationalization of the unfreedom of man and demonstrates the " technical " impossibility of being autonomous , of deter - mining one 's own life .
For this unfreedom appears neither as irrational nor as political , hut rather as submission to the technical apparatus which enlarges the comforts of life and increases the productivity of labor .
Technological rationality thus protects rather than cancels the legitimacy of domination , and the instrumentalist horizon of reason opens on a rationally totalitarian society : " On pourrait nommer philosophie autocratique des techniques celle qui prend I 'ensemble technique comme un lieu ou l'on utilise les machines pour obtenir de la puissance .
La machine est seulement un moyen ; la fin est la conquete de 1a nature , la domestication des forces naturelles au moyen d'un premier asservissement :
La machine est un esclave qui sert a faire d'autres esclaves .
Une pareille inspiration dominatrice et esclavagiste peut se rencontrer avec une requete de libert� pour l�homme .
Mais il est difficile de se lib�rer en transf�rant l'esclavage sur d'autres etres , hommes , animaux ou machines ; r�gner sur un peuple de machines asservissant Je monde entier , c'est encore r�gner , et tout r�gne suppose l'acceptation des sch�mes d'asservissement . " [ 20 ]
The incessant dynamic of technical progress has become permeated with political content , and the Logos of technics has been made into the Logos of continued servitude .
The liberating force of technology -- the instrumentalization of things - turns into a fetter of liberation ; the instrumentalization of man .
This interpretation would tie the scientific project ( method and theory ) , prior to an application and utilization , to a specific societal project , and would see the tie precisely in the inner form of scientific rationality , i.e.. in the functional character of its concepts .
In other words .
the scientific universe ( that is , not the specific propositions on the structure of matter , energy , their interrelation , etc. , but the projection of nature as quantifiable matter , as guiding the hypothetical approach to - and the mathematical - logical expression of - objectivity ) would be the horizon of a concrete societal practice which would be preserved in the development of the scientific project .
But , even granting the internal instrumentalism of scientific rationality , this assumption would not yet establish the sociological validity of the scientific project .
Granted that the formation of the most abstract scientific concepts still preserves the interrelation between subject and object in a given universe of discourse and action , the link between theoretical and practical reason can be understood in quite different ways .
Such a different interpretation is offered by Jean Piaget in his " genetic epistemology . "
Piaget interprets the formation of scientific concepts in terms of different abstractions , from a general interrelation between subject and object .
Abstraction proceeds neither from the mere object , so that the subject functions only as the neutral point of observation and measurement , nor from the subject as the vehicle of pure cognitive Reason .
Piaget distinguishes between the process of cognition in mathematics and in physics .
The former is abstraction " a l'int�rieur de l'action comme telle " : " Contrairement � ce que l'on dit souvent , les etres mathematiques ne r�sultent donc pas d'une abstraction a partir des objets , mais bien d'une abstraction effectu�e au sein des actions comme telles .
R�unir , ordonner , d�placer , etc. sont des actions plus g�n�ral que penser , pousser , etc. parce qu'elles tiennent � la coordination meme de toutes les actions particuli�res et entrent en chacune d'elles � titre de facteur coordinateur . . . " [ 21 ]
Mathematical propositions thus express " une accomodation g�n�rale � l'objet " - in contrast to the particular adaptations which are characteristic of true propositions in physics .
Logic and mathematical logic are " une action sur l'objet quelconque , c'est - a - dire une action accomod�e de facon generale " [ 22 ] and this " action " is of general validity in as much as " cette abstraction ou diff�renciation porte jusqu 'au sein des coordinations h�r�ditaires , puisque les m�canismes coordinateurs de faction tiennent toujours , en leur source , � des coordinations r�flexes et instinctives . " [ 23 ]
In physics , abstraction proceeds from the object but is due to specific actions on the part of the subject , thus abstraction assumes necessarily a logic - mathematical form because " des actions particuli�res ne donnent lieu a une connaissance que coordonn�es entre elles et que cette coordination est , par sa nature meme , logico - math �matique . " [ 24 ]
Abstraction in physics leads necessarily back to logico - mathematical abstraction and the latter is , as pure coordination , the general form of action -- action as such " ( " raction comme teIle " ) .
And this coordination constitutes objectivity because it retains hereditary , " reflexive and instinctive " structures .
Piaget 's interpretation recognizes the internal practical character of theoretical reason , hut derives it from a general structure of action which , in the last analysis , is a hereditary , biological structure .
Scientific method would ultimately rest on a biological foundation , which is supra- ( or rather infra - ) historical .
Moreover , granted that all scientific knowledge presupposes coordination of particular actions , I do not see why such coordination is " by its very nature " logico - mathematical - unless the " particular actions " are the scientific operations of modern physics , in which case the interpretation would be circular .
In contrast to Piaget 's rather psychological and biological analysis , Husserl has offered a genetic epistemology which is focused on the socio- historical structure of scientific reason .
I shall here refer to Husserl 's work [ 25 ] only insofar as it emphasizes the extent to which modern science is the " methodology " of a pre-given historical reality within whose universe it moves .
Husserl starts with the fact that the mathematization nature resulted in valid practical knowledge : in the construction of an accidentional " reality which could be effectively " correlated " with the empirical reality ( p. 19 ; 42 ) .
But the scientific achievement referred back to a pre-scientific practice , which constituted the original basis ( the Sinnesfundament ) of Galilean science .
This pre-scientific basis of science ' in the world of practice ( Lebenswelt ) , which determined the theoretical structure , was not questioned by Galileo ; moreover , it was concealed ( verdeckt ) by the further development of science .
The result was the illusion that the mathematization of nature created an " autonomous ( eigenst�ndige ) absolute truth " ( p. 49 f. ) , while in reality , it remained a specific method and technique for the Lebenswelt .
The ideational veil ( Ideenkleid ) of mathematical science is thus a veil of symbols which represents and at the same time masks ( vertritt and verkleidet ) the world of practice ( p. 52 ) .
What is the original , pre-scientific intent and content that is preserved in the conceptual structure of science ?
Measurement in practice discovers the possibility of using certain basic forms , shapes , and relations , which are universally " available as identically the same , for exactly determining and calculating empirical objects and relations " ( p. 25 ) .
Through all abstraction and generalization , scientific method retains ( and masks ) its pre-scientific - technical structure ; the development of the former represents ( and masks ) the development of the latter .
Thus classical geometry " idealizes " the practice of surveying and measuring the land ( Feldmesskunst ) .
Geometry is the theory of practical objectification .
To be sure , algebra and mathematical logic construct an absolute ideational reality , freed from the incalculable uncertainties and particularities of the Lebenswelt and of the subjects living in it .
However , this ideational construction is the theory and technic of " idealizing " the new Lebenswelt : " In the mathematical practice , we attain what is denied to us in the empirical practice , i.e. , exactness .
For it is possible to determine the ideal forms in terms of absolute identity . . .
As such , they become universally available and disposable . . . " ( p. 24 ) .
The coordination ( Zuordnung ) of the ideational with the empirical world enables us to " project the anticipated regularities of the practical Lebenswelt " : " Once one possesses the formulas , one possesses the foresight which is desired in practice " - the foresight of that which is to be expected in the experience of concrete life ( p. 43 ) .
Husserl emphasizes the pre-scientific , technical connotations of mathematical exactness and fungibility .
These central notions of modern science emerge , not as mere byproducts of a pure science , hut as pertaining to its inner conceptual structure .
The scientific abstraction from concreteness , the quantification of qualities which yield exactness as weIl as universal validity , involve a specific concrete experience of the Lebenswelt - a specific mode of " seeing " the world .
And this " seeing , " in spite of its " pure , " disinterested character , is seeing within a purposive , practical context .
It is anticipating ( Voraussehen ) and projecting ( Vorhaben ) .
Galilean science is the science of methodical , systematic anticipation and projection .
But - and this is decisive -- of a specific anticipation and projection - namely , that which experiences , comprehends , and shapes the world ) in terms of calculable , predictable relationships among exactly identifiable units .
In this project , universal quantifiability is a prerequisite for the domination of nature .
Individual , non-quantifiable qualities stand in the way of an organization of men and things in accordance with the measurable power to be extracted from them .
But this is a specific , socio- historical project , and the consciousness which undertakes this project is the hidden subject of Galilean , science ; the latter is the technic , the art of anticipation extended in infinity ( ins Unendliche erweiterte Voraussicht : p.51 ) .
Now precisely because Galilean science is , in the formation of its concepts , the technic of a specific Lebenswelt , it does not and cannot transcend this Lebenswelt .
It remains essentially within the basic experiential framework and within the universe of ends set by this reality .
In Husserl 's formulation : in Galilean science , the " concrete universe of causality becomes applied mathematics " ( p. 1l2 ) - but the world of perception and experience , " in which we live our whole practical life , remains as that which it is , in its essential structure : in its own concrete causa1ity unchanged . . . " ( p. 51 ; � my italics ) .
A provocative statement , which is easily minimized , and I take the liberty of a possible overinterpretation .
The statement does not refer simply to the fact that , in spite of non-Euclidean geometry , we still perceive and act in three - dimensional space ; or that , in spite of the " statistical " concept of causality , we still act , in common sense , in accord with the " " old " laws of causality .
Nor does the statement contradict the perpetual changes in the world of daily practice as the result of ' " applied mathematics . "
Much more may be at stake : namely , the inherent limit of the established science and scientific method , by virtue of which they extend , rationalize , and insure the prevailing Lebenswelt without altering its existential structure - that is without envisaging a qualitatively new mode of " seeing " and qualitatively new relations between men and between man and nature .
With respect to the institutionalized forms of life , science ( pure as well as applied ) would thus have a stabilizing , static , conservative function .
Even its most revolutionary achievements would only be construction and destruction in line with a specific experience and organization of reality .
The continuous self - correction of science - the revolution of its hypotheses which is built into its method -- tself propels and extends the same historical universe , the same basic experience .
It retains the same formal a priori , which makes for a very material , practical content .
Far horn minimizing the fundamental change which occurred with the establishment of Galilean science , Husserl 's interpretation points up the radical break with the pre-Galilean tradition ; the instrumentalist horizon of thought was indeed a new horizon .
It created a new world of theoretical and practical Reason , but it has remained committed to a specific historical world which has its evident limits - in theory as well as in practice , in its pure as well as applied methods .
The preceding discussion seems to suggest not only the inner limitations and prejudices of scientific method hut also its historical subjectivity .
Moreover , it seems to imply the need for same sort of " qualitative physics , " revival of teleological philosophies .
etc . I admit that this suspicion is justified , hut at this point , I can only assert that no such obscurantist ideas are intended . [ 26 ]
No matter how one defines truth and objectivity .
they remain related to the human agents of theory and practice , and to their ability to comprehend and change their world .
This ability in turn depends on the extent to which matter ( whatever it may be ) is recognized and understood as that which it is itself in all particular forms .
In these terms , contemporary science is of immensely greater objective validity than its predecessors .
One might even add that , at present " , the scientific method is the only method that can claim such ' validity ; the interplay of hypotheses and observable facts validates the hypotheses and establishes the facts .
The point which I am trying to male is that science , by virtue of its own method and concepts , has projected and promoted a universe in which the domination of nature has remained linked to the domination of man -a link which tends to be fatal to this universe as a whole .
Nature , scientifically comprehended and mastered .
reappears in the technical apparatus of production and destruction which sustains and improves the life of the individuals while subordinating them to the masters of the apparatus .
Thus the rational hierarchy merges with the social one .
If this is the case , then the change in the direction of progress .
which might sever this fatal link .
would also affect the very structure of science -- the scientific project .
Its hypotheses .
without losing their rational character , would develop in an essentially different experimental context ( that of a pacified world ) ; consequently science would arrive at essentially different concepts of nature and establish essentially different facts .
The rational society subverts the idea of Reason .
I have pointed out that the elements of this subversion , the notions of another rationality , were present in the history of thought from its beginning .
The ancient idea of a state where Being attains fulfillment , where the tension between " is " and " ought " is resolved in the cycle of an eternal return , partakes of the metaphysics of domination .
But it also pertains to the metaphysics of liberation -- to the reconciliation of Logos and Eros .
This idea envisages the coming - to - rest of the repressive productivity of Reason , the end of domination in gratification .
The two contrasting rationalities cannot simply be correlated with classical and modern thought respectively , as in John Dewey 's formulation " ' from contemplative enjoyment to active manipulation and control " ; and " from knowing as an esthetic enjoyment of the properties of nature .
. . to knowing as a means of secular control . " [ 27 ]
� Classical thought was sufficiently committed to the logic of secular control , and there is a sufficient component of indictment and refusal in modern thought to vitiate John Dewey 's formulation .
Reason , as conceptual thought and behavior , is necessarily mastery , domination .
Logos is law , rule , order by virtue of knowledge .
In subsuming particular cases under a universal , in subjecting it to their universal , thought attains mastery over the particular cases .
It becomes capable not only of comprehending hut also of acting upon them , con- trolling them .
However , while all thought stands under the rule of logic , the unfolding of this logic is different in the various modes of thought .
Classical formal and modern symbolic logic , transcendental and dialectical logic - each rules over a different universe of discourse and experience .
They all developed within the historical continuum of domination to which they pay tribute .
And this continuum bestows upon the modes of positive thinking their conformist and ideological character ; upon those of negative thinking their speculative and utopian character .
By war of summary , we may now try to identify more clearly the hidden subject of scientific rationality and the hidden ends in its pure form .
The scientific concept of a universally controllable nature projected nature as endless matter - in - function , the mere stuff of theory and practice .
In this form , the object - world entered the construction of a technological universe -- a universe of mental and physical instrumentalities , means in themselves .
Thus it is a truly " hypothetical " system , depending on a validating and verifying subject .
The processes of validation and verification may be purely theoretical ones , hut they never occur in a vacuum and they never terminate in a private , individual mind .
The hypothetical system of forms and functions becomes dependent on another system - a pre-established universe of ends , in which and for which it develops .
What appeared extraneous , foreign to the theoretical project , shows forth as part of its very structure ( method and concepts ) ; pure objectivity reveals itself as object for a subjectivity which provides the Telos , the ends .
In the construction of the technological ' reality , there is no such thing as a purely rational scientific order ; the process of technological rationality is a political process .
Only in the medium of technology , man and nature become fungible objects of organization .
The universal effectiveness and productivity of the apparatus under which they are subsumed veil the particular interests that organize the apparatus .
In other words , technology has become the great vehicle of reification - reification in its most mature and effective form .
The social position of the individual and his relation to others appear not only to be determined by objective qualities and laws , but these qualities and laws seem to lose their mysterious and uncontrollable character ; they appear as calculable manifestations of ( scientific ) rationality .
The world tends to become the stuff of total administration , which absorbs even the administrators .
The web of domination has become the web of Reason itself , and this society is fatally entangled in it .
And the transcending modes of thought seem to transcend Reason itself .
Under these conditions , scientific thought ( scientific in the larger sense , as opposed to muddled , metaphysical , emotional , illogical thinking ) outside the physical sciences assumes the form of a pure and self - contained formalism ( symbolism ) on the one hand , and a total empiricism on the other .
( The contrast is not a conflict .
See the very empirical application of mathematics and symbolic logic in electronic industries . )
In relation to the established universe of discourse and behavior , non-contradiction and non-transcendence is the common denominator .
Total empiricism reveals its ideological function in contemporary philosophy .
With respect to this function , same aspects of linguistic analysis will be discussed in the following chapter .
This discussion is to prepare the ground for the attempt to show the barriers which prevent this empiricism from coming to grips with reality , and establishing ( or rather re-establishing ) the concepts which may break these barriers . [ 1 ]

I hope I will not be misunderstood as suggesting that the concepts of mathematical physics are designed as " tools , " that they have a technical , practical intent .
Technological is rather the a priori " intuition " or apprehension of the universe in which science moves , in which it constitutes itself as pure science .
Pure science remains committed to the a priori from which it abstracts .
It might be clearer to speak of the instrumentalist horizon of mathematical physics .

" One might call autocratic a philosophy of technics which takes the technical who1e as a place where machines are used to obtain power .
The machine is only a means ; the end is the conquest of nature , the domestication of natural forces through a primary enslavement :
The machine a slave which serves to make other slaves .
Such a domineering and enslaving drive may go together with the quest for human freedom .
But it is difficult to liberate oneself by transferring slavery to other beings , men , animals , or machines ; to rule over a population of machines subjecting the whole world means still to rule , and all rule implies acceptance of schemata of subjection . "

Big shift in homeschooling
Parents who home - school children increasingly are white , wealthy and well - educated – and their numbers have nearly doubled in a decade , a new federal government report says .
What else has nearly doubled ?
The percentage of girls who are home - schooled .
They now outnumber home - schooled boys by a wide margin .
As of spring 2007 , an estimated 1.5 million , or 2.9 % of all school - age children in the USA , were home - schooled , up from 1.7 % in 1999 .
The new figures come from the U.S. Department of Education , which found that 36 % of parents said their most important reason for home schooling was to provide “ religious or moral instruction ” ; 21 % cited concerns about school environment .
Only 17 % cited “ dissatisfaction with academic instruction . ”
Perhaps most significant :
The ratio of home - schooled boys to girls has shifted significantly .
In 1999 , it was 49 % boys , 51 % girls .
Now boys account for only 42 % ; 58 % are girls .
That may well be a result of parents who are fed up with mean - girl behavior in schools , says Henry Cate , who along with his wife home - schools their three daughters in Santa Clara , Calif .
“ It ’s just pushing some parents over the edge , ” says Cate , who writes the blog Why Homeschool .
Home schooling has grown most sharply for higher - income families .
In 1999 , 63.6 % of home - schooling families earned less than $ 50,000 .
Now 60.0 % earn more than $ 50,000 .
Cate says many highly educated , high - income parents are “ probably people who are a little bit more comfortable in taking risks ” in choosing a college or line of work .
“ The attributes that facilitate that might also facilitate them being more comfortable with home - schooling . ”
Among the other findings :
3.9 % of white families home - school , up from 2 % in 1999 .
6.8 % of college - educated parents home - school , up from 4.9 % in 1999 .
Michelle Blimes home - schools her three daughters in Orem , Utah .
Initially it was for academics , and now she sees social benefits .
“ They should be able to enjoy playing and being kids before being thrown into the teen culture , ” Blimes says .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Two key proposals to improve access to health insurance could reduce the ranks of the uninsured but cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , according to preliminary estimates released Monday by the Congressional Budget Office .
The estimates are the first in a series over the next few months that will attempt to quantify the costs and benefits of various health reform options .
President Obama , citing the huge part health care spending plays in the economy , has made passing reform this year a top priority .
The report by CBO , an independent agency that scores legislative proposals for lawmakers , focuses on proposals to create health insurance exchanges and subsidize the cost of insurance for some households .
The agency estimated that the exchange and subsidies could reduce the number of uninsured people by roughly 16 million by 2015 .
It is estimated there would otherwise be 51 million uninsured that year .
The CBO estimates are based on parts of a health reform bill from Democrats on the Senate 's Health , Education , Labor and Pension Committee , chaired by Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass .
The committee will start debating and amending that bill on Wednesday .
Under the bill , the federal government would give grants to states to set up insurance exchanges that consumers could use to comparison shop for health insurance .
And it would offer subsidies of varying levels to help families with incomes up to 500 % of poverty level ( roughly $ 110,000 ) to pay for coverage .
The federal government would also subsidize small businesses that offer health benefits but have workers with low wages .
The CBO stressed that its estimates are preliminary for several reasons :
They only reflect analysis of one part of the health committee bill .
So they are n't a comprehensive look at the potential costs and savings of all measures in that bill .
They do not reflect the likely interactions that will occur with other elements of comprehensive health reform that may be included -- such as an expansion of Medicaid or the creation of a public insurance plan , which is the most controversial issue in the health reform debate .
In addition , the CBO has not yet finished its analysis of all the bill 's elements , such as a proposal to let parents cover their children as dependents until they 're 27 .
The health committee bill is hardly the last word on health reform .
Other congressional committees have jurisdiction over other parts of health care reform .
One is the Senate Finance Committee , which will oversee the tax proposals intended to help pay for the overhaul of the health care system .
The finance panel 's chairman , Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , is expected to release a draft of his health reform bill this week .
The New York Times and the Iranian election
15 June 2009
The response of the US media to the Iranian election says more about the state of democracy and the so - called “ free press ” in America than it does about the state of democratic rights in Iran .
The coverage by the New York Times typifies a presentation of the victory of the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , over his main challenger , former Prime Minister Mirhossein Mousavi , that abandons any pretense of journalistic objectivity .
It is sheer propaganda aimed at discrediting the election result .
No sooner had Iranian authorities announced late Friday , US time , that Ahmadinejad had defeated Mousavi by a 30 percent margin than the Times and virtually the entire media proclaimed the election a fraud .
The Times did not simply report the allegations by Mousavi that the election had been stolen , it embraced them wholeheartedly and uncritically .
It did so without undertaking any independent investigation .
It brought forward no serious facts to substantiate the claim .
Rather , it relied on allegations made by Mousavi and his supporters .
Already on Saturday , the Times made a video , which it posted on its web site Sunday , in which its leading foreign correspondent , Roger Cohen , breathlessly denounced the “ hastily declared ” victory of Ahmadinejad and gave the impression that Tehran had been placed under martial law , with droves of black - clad police roaming the city and beating oppositionists .
The only “ evidence ” Cohen was able to produce for his claim of a stolen election was the fact that the authorities had declared Ahmadinejad the victor “ within hours ” of the polls closing and that the official vote numbers had “ scarcely varied ” from the initial tallies .
Cohen ’s video was supplemented by a front - page article on Sunday by the Times ’ executive editor , Bill Keller , in which Keller cited uncritically the claims of opposition voters that Ahmadinejad ’s reelection was “ the imposed verdict ” of the regime and a “ coup d’état . ”
He adduced not a single fact to back these charges .
In lieu of evidence , he reported the claim by “ somebody ’s brother who supposedly knew someone inside ” that “ vote counters simply were ordered to doctor numbers . ”
The core of Keller ’s argument that the election had been manipulated was what he called the “ preposterous margin of victory ” for Ahmadinejad .
But he himself acknowledged in his piece that Ahmadinejad successfully appealed to the Iranian poor , a huge percentage of the electorate .
And he acknowledged the severe disappointment of “ Western leaders who had seen a better relationship with Iran as potentially helpful in resolving the problems of Afghanistan , Iraq and nuclear proliferation . ”
The Times and the rest of the US media , directly reflecting the outlook of the government , had promoted the candidacy of Mousavi and depicted a rising tide of popular support that was certain to either sweep the “ reformer ” into office or obtain a close enough result to force a run-off contest with Ahmadinejad .
In their function as conduits for the state and US imperialist policy , they were seeking to promote the notion that a victory for Mousavi would represent a triumph of democracy and open up a new chapter in US - Iranian relations .
The only possible explanation for Ahmadinejad ’s landslide victory , they immediately concluded , was fraud .
For anyone with a serious knowledge of Iranian society and politics , the decisive victory of Ahmadinejad could not have come as a surprise .
Even Western newspapers that denounced the election admitted that the incumbent had strong support among urban workers and the rural poor — the vast majority of the population .
Ahmadinejad has retained this constituency , despite the repressive and corrupt character of the regime , because of the absence of a socialist alternative .
On what mass base could Mousavi depend for a successful bid to unseat Ahmadinejad ?
The candidate of the Iranian liberal establishment , he campaigned as no less an ardent defender of Islamist clerical rule than Ahmadinejad .
On domestic policy , he vaguely called for more openness , while opposing Ahmadinejad ’s “ populist ” subsidies to the urban poor and the peasantry .
The media has not sought to explain why the mass of the Iranian people should be expected to support an advocate of the same free market policies that have produced a social disaster throughout the world .
Mousavi ’s most prominent backer , moreover , was Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a leading figure in the state apparatus and one of the country ’s wealthiest men .
Rafsanjani , notorious for his corruption , is despised by Iranian workers and the poor .
Mousavi ’s actual electoral base did not extend beyond better - off - sections of the urban middle class , university students and businessmen .
There is another issue .
What standing do the New York Times and the US media as a whole have to lecture Iran about democratic elections ?
The Times accepted the theft of the 2000 US presidential election without a whimper .
That was a presidential coup , and it was carried out in broad daylight , with Bush and the Republicans suppressing votes and the Supreme Court halting a recount in Florida that would have given the election to Al Gore , who had won the popular vote nationally .
One need only recall the extraordinary events of election night 2000 , when the networks suddenly reversed their call for Gore in Florida and declared the pivotal state for Bush .
The American elections are among the least genuinely democratic elections in what passes for the world ’s democracies .
Working and poor people are routinely denied the right to vote .
The elections are dominated by corporate money and media manipulation .
Third parties find it virtually impossible to obtain ballot status because of laws that are designed to maintain the monopoly of two big business parties .
The state of American democracy is summed up in the current mayoral election in the country ’s largest city , New York .
There , a multi- billionaire media tycoon , Michael Bloomberg , overturned a term limit law and is running unopposed for reelection .
The Times is silent about the historical record concerning US “ support ” for democracy in Iran .
This includes the 1953 coup , organized by the CIA , which overthrew the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and installed the Shah .
From then until the 1979 Islamic Revolution , the US backed the Shah ’s torture regime and hailed it as the bulwark of the “ free world ” in the Persian Gulf .
The filthy role of the Times in seeking to discredit the Iranian election epitomizes the corruption of the American media and its integration into the state .
The mass media serve ever more openly as instruments for the manipulation of public opinion in the interest of state concerns .
That the role of the Times as a conduit for US foreign policy aims is not limited to one country or one part of the world is underscored by another example of propaganda in the guise of news .
Just two weeks ago , on May 30 , the Times published a diatribe against another regime deemed by Washington to be an obstacle to US imperialist interests — that of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela .
Headlined “ Chávez Seeks Tighter Grip on Military , ” the article retailed without substantiation claims of a massive crackdown by Chávez against dissidents within the military .
In this article , as in the articles published on the Iranian election , there is a large element of provocation .
Such “ news ” items are written on assignment from US intelligence agencies .
This corruption of the media is itself a critical expression of , and factor in , the advanced decay of American democracy .
The election in Iran underscores the necessity for an orientation to the Iranian working class on the basis of a clearly defined socialist and internationalist program as the only foundation for opposition to the reactionary bourgeois regime of the clerics .
The response of the US media to the election underscores the fact that the American working class can defend its democratic rights only by developing its own mass , independent socialist movement .

" Do you think that this kind of behavior is going to solve any of your problems ?
It will only make people think you are someone like Bush , " the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying .
" You are at the beginning of your way and you are gaining experience , and we do not wish the scandals of the Bush era to be repeated during your term of office , " the Iranian leader said .
President Obama , who has been in office for five months , has been treading a careful line on Iran , which has seen two weeks of street demonstrations following a disputed presidential election there .
Watch how U.S. - Iran relations got to this point
Pro-government security forces have cracked down on the protests , with officials saying 17 people have died .
Unofficial reports suggest the number is much higher .
Official results gave Ahmadinejad a 2 - to - 1 victory over his nearest rival , former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi .
Moussavi says the results were rigged .
Obama has said Iranians must be free to demonstrate peacefully , and his administration Wednesday withdrew invitations to Iranian diplomats around the world to attend U.S. embassy Fourth of July parties .
The extension of invitations last month was seen as a cautious outreach to Iran , which has not had diplomatic relations with Washington for 30 years .
Obama wrote secretly to Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , before the election , Iranian sources confirmed Wednesday .

Obama said Tuesday that Iran 's government must justify itself not in the eyes of the United States , but in the opinion of its own people .
" A sizable percentage of the Iranian people themselves ... consider this election illegitimate , " he said at a White House news conference .
" It is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and prosperity , " he said .
" We hope they take it . "

Ahmadinejad said Thursday that even 5 - and 6 - year - olds would not allow insults to the Iranian nation , telling Obama : " We hope that you will avoid interfering in Iran 's affairs and somehow express your regret so that the Iranian nation can become aware of your regret .
If there is real change , the Iranian nation will welcome it . "

Subprime Predation
Prime : 521,000 loans averaging $ 202 K each ( $ 105B ) .
Subprime : 721,000 loans averaging $ 177 K each ( $ 127B ) .
Why Would They Do That ?
Okay , You 're Not Helping
The TL ; DR Version
Lending institutions were unwillingly forced to loan money to NINJA applicants .
Determination : FALSE CRA regulations only affected 20 - 30 % of the institutions issuing subprime loans .
CRA / SASA loan defaults account for the overwhelming majority of mortgage defaults .
Determination : FALSE
About 1 in 8 mortgages ( 12 % ) have resulted in foreclosure as of Feb 2008 .
While 20 % of CRA loans ( the numbers vary ) wind up in foreclosure , 10 % of all loans are CRA , which puts the total CRA contribution to 2 % of those 12 % .
Fully 6 times as many loans being foreclosed now are non-CRA .
Myth : Busted .
Finally , a nice video explanation in case TL ; DR is TL;DR
Recently pundits and bloggers everywhere have been volleying back and forth accusations about who is responsible for the whole financial meltdown in general and the subprime meltdown in specific .
Naturally , it 's political .
A lot of the rightwingnuts blame the Democrats entirely ; it 's their fault for forcing banks to hand over cash to No Income No Job / Assets ( NINJA ) applicants .
Well , specifically , brown people .
They also claim that the Republicansto stop them repeatedly but were completely impotent to do so ( even though they controlled the entire fucking government from 2000 - 2006 ) .
So everybody seems to be lobbing around " facts " and proving them by pointing to everyone else lobbing " facts , " eventually getting to the point where they cite stuff as fact because " everybody knows it . "
But saying it ( or just repeating it ) does n't make it true , and it 's been really hard to find any actual concrete provable information that was n't just referentially true because someone else said it also .
I mean like the whole " government forced banks to make bad loans " thing .
Well , okay , you could be right .
The government forces people to do things by making laws .
So , show me the law forcing banks to make bad loans ?
And show me that they would not otherwise have made those loans if it had n't been for those requirements ?
That 's all I ask .
Since good research does n't just take someone 's word for it , I set about doing some original research myself .
Y'know , go to the actual agencies involved , look up the statistics , cite references , correlate data , analyze the timelines , etc.
Following are some of my findings , originally written in response to the standard authoritative hand - waving I 've been seeing on the topic lately
At contention here is whether banks were required to issue loans to people who could n't afford loans at all , and moreover whether that caused the financial meltdown .
When people cite this , they 're talking about the Community Reinvestment Act , a 1977 law under Carter that 's been amended and modified over the years ( twice by GHW Bush ( let 's not forget his own son 's pivotal role in the savings and loan crisis in the 80's ) , thrice by Clinton , twice by GW Bush ) , and a similar body of legislation called the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness
Act of 1992 , which imposed similar policies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , two federally - sponsored but privately - held agencies responsible for purchasing and securitizing mortgages so that the sourcing lenders can continue to have funds available for new loans .
Before the CRA , banks routinely discriminated , even forcing black loan applicants to pay higher interest rates and maker larger down payments than their white customers .
The CRA was also designed to stop banks from " redlining " geographic areas in which they typically refused to issue loans at all , and make them contribute something substantive back to the communities in which they are chartered .
This was as an attempt ( as the name indicates ) to re-capitalize decaying urban areas .
As such it 's a bit of a misnomer to say that the CRA " forces banks to make loans to people who can't afford them . "
The " making loans to poor people " part just sort of falls out of that as a side - effect because they 're about the only ones willing to work and live in these areas .
Different kinds and sizes of banks are differentially subject to CRA guidelines , andbanks are subject to them .
The act really only has teeth when it comes to a bank 's CRA rating being a factor in approving their applications for new bank branches and in mergers / acquisitions .
Even banks required to be CRA compliant are n't always so According to the federal reserve 's 2006 analysis , CRA - related loans to lower - income individuals accounted for 10 % of all loans originated .
Also according to the federal reserve , 65 % of all banking institutions ( sized $ 1B - > $ 30T + ) report " about the same " rate of credit loss on CRA - related loans versus non-CRA loans .
In fact , banks reported that roughly 82 % of CRA - related home purchase / refinance loans were either " profitable " or " marginally profitable .
" Curiously , roughly 50 % of 2006 's subprime loans were extended by independent mortgage companies ( not FDIC - insured banks at all , and not subject to CRA regulation ( 2004:51 % ; 2005:52 % ; 2006:46 % ) ) .
These institutions had absolutely no requirement to make risky loans to NINJA borrowers -- but they did it anyway .
An additional 20 - 30 % of subprime mortgages were made by bank and thrift subsidiaries , which are beholden to CRA to some degree , but not nearly that of their parent corporations .
Federal Reserve data show that 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions .
Between 2003 and 2007 , the dollar amount of subprime loans tripled ( $ 332B ->$ 1.3T ) .
Meanwhile CRA loans actually fell after 2004 , when Bush signed legislation relaxing the requirements .
Freddie and Fannie have been widely accused in this mess too , specifically regarding their " requirement to lend money to people with poor credit .
"
In 1999 , the Clinton administration did indeed pressure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more low / moderate income ( LMI ) mortgages .
Simultaneously , pressured them to ease the credit requirements on the mortgages they were willing to purchase .
This opened the door for those lenders to issue high cost , subprime loans at much higher interest rates , and still be able to unload them on Freddie and Fannie , shifting the risk .
Anti-predatory lending laws enacted in 2000 disallowed Freddie and Fannie from counting those high risk loans against their LMI loan requirements ... and those laws were dropped in 2004 , once again opening that door .
In 2003 , Bush signed the " American Dream Downpayment Act , " sponsored by Rep. Katherine Harris ( R- FL ) and Sen. Wayne Allard ( R - CO ) .
The ADDA helped lower income borrowers with their down payment and closing costs , further lowering the bar .
It 's worth noting that Freddie and Fannie can only buy loans that conform to the standards explained above .
" Non-comforming " mortgages can still be bought and sold by private entities , like Countrywide , Bank of America , JP Morgan / Chase , Citigroup , Merrill Lynch , Bear Stearns , and the rest of the motley crew of suspects who now stand next to the broken economy going , " Oopsie !
" So it turns out there is no direct linkage between subprime loans and CRA lending requirements .
First , as noted , 70 - 80 % of the institutions issuing subprimes were n't even subject to CRA regulation .
Secondly , the CRA does not mandate that affected loans have the predatory terms they did .
Nearly 20 % of subprime mortgages issued were documented as " potentially prime " by the originating lender .
In other words , these peoplebeen given much cheaper , less risky loan terms , but were " steered " into taking riskier and more expensive loans ... many of which have since collapsed into foreclosure .
How many dollars are tied up in foreclosed loans as of Q1'08 ?
Many more institutions were issuing subprime loans than than were required to issue CRA - designated loans .
And choosing to issue predatory loans , like ones that offer an initially tiny interest rate and then jack them up a couple of years later , is a completely independent variable .
The criteria under which a loan is considered " predatory " are somewhat arbitrary , but as an example , 70 % of all subprime mortgagespeople for paying ahead of schedule .
In fact a 2008 study found that the default rate did not correspond to income level , but itcorrespond strongly to the type of mortgage product sold ; people steered into expensive ARMs inevitably fared worse : Lenders issued subprimes because it was profitable to do so .
Why ?
Because investors had an insatiable appetite for tiered - risk CDO's .
Consumers only needed so many prime mortgages ... but the demand from investors for new CDOs vastly outstripped the supply .
Banks were thus encouraged to spray money out their loan - cannons , especially risky loans , because those loans would immediately get snapped up by investment banks because of their relatively high yield , and AIG was going to insure them anyway , right ?
So yay !
Everybody 's happy .
Rich and happy .
But not rich enough and happy Given a high yield investment , how do you make a whole bunch more ?
You leverage it !
Investors were leveraging CDOs and MBSs so excessively that the only way to stay competitive was to keep upping the ante .
When AIG finally tipped over , they were leveraged by a factor of 11 to 1 .
At that point all it takes is a single tiny mis-step by one of the players in the game , and all of them come tumbling down .
At a multitude of instances throughout his tenure , Bush 's administration dropped interest rates , attempting to negate what now seem like laughably tiny market hiccups .
Every time the prime rate went down , it re-catalyzed everybody to finance and refinance , to invest in real estate .
In large part that drove the real estate bubble to ever - increasing new levels of investment .
Post 9/11 , as the economy started to flutter , Bush called out to American consumers , " Buy like there 's no tomorrow .
Go into debt if you have to but bottom line , BUY BUY BUY to save our economy . "
And they did .
As a percentage of GDP , overall consumer debt hung at about 60 % for the decades leading up to 2001 .
Then in 2001 it shot up like a hockey stick .
Today , our consumer debt : GDP ratio is essentially flat ; 1:1 . $ 13T in debt to $ 13T in GDP : So to support the allegation that compulsory CRA / SASA lending was responsible for the global financial collapse , one has to prove the following : Did lenders hand over wads of cash to people they should n't have ?
Yes !
Did the government force them to ?
No .
The investment community 's feeding frenzy of greed did .
Obviously there 's a wealth of blame to throw around in this mess .
Consumers get a lot , banks get a lot , investors get a lot , the government gets a lot ... actually we all do .
Who , more than anybody else is responsible ?
Given all the above , and all my research on the matter , I 've got to conclude that wall street itself is responsible ; they 're the ones who found loopholes in the regulations , they 're the ones who exploited them , and they 're the ones who over - leveraged transactions WAY past the point where they knew it would end in tears .
And there 's not a goddamn thing you or I can do to wipe that smug grin off their faces .
Part 1 : Part 2 : But for God 's sake ... do n't takeword for it .
Go do your own research .
Suicide bomb attacks kill dozens in Iraq
2 suicide bombers attacked Baghdad in Iraq on Thursday , killing almost 70 people , many of them Iranian pilgrims , police said .
The bombers , wearing vests stuffed with explosives blew themselves up in separate attacks that resulted to multiple deaths and injuries .
According to Reuters , the blasts occurred as apprehension grows in Iraq ahead of a pullout by U.S. troops from city centers in June , and after warnings from officials that insurgent groups may try to take advantage of that to launch attacks .
50 people were wounded and at least five children were among the dead .

Even more classic Worms - style gameplay is coming to Xbox Live Arcade with Worms 2 : Armageddon , a proper numerical sequel to Team17's 1999 classic turn - based strategy game Worms Armageddon .

Worms 2 : Armageddon 's trailer highlights the changes coming to the XBLA version — and eventually to the PC and Mac — including new vertical levels and other landscape types , all - new weapons and much more .
Team17 tells us we can expect the game " soon , real soon , " so keep an eye peeled .
( We did n't see the game listed under Microsoft 's planned " Summer of Arcade " promotion , so hopefully that " real soon " will be sooner than we anticipated . )
Until then , might not be a bad idea to hook up the Dreamcast ( or PlayStation or Nintendo 64 ) to get some Worms Armageddon practice in .
MooTools , Framework Compatibility , and Dollar $ afe Mode
MooTools 1.2.3 was released on June 19 , 2009 .
With this release , MooTools implemented Dollar Safe Mode .
Essentially , MooTools no longer requires the $ function for its own purposes .
Valerio Proietti writes about Dollar Safe Mode on the MooTools blog but I 'll give a quick overview below .
document.id( ) vs $
The $ function has become document .id ( ) .
The code looks as follows :
/* old : : var myElement = $ ( ' my - element ' ) ; */ var myElement = document .id( ' my - element ' ) ;
If MooTools does n't detect another framework requesting the $ function , $ will automatically be assigned to MooTools .
document.search ( ) vs $ $
The $ $ function will also be renamed document .
search ( ) .
The code looks as follows :
/* old : : var inputs = $ $ ( ' input ' ) ; */ var input = document . search ( ' input ' ) ;
Like the $ function , $ $ will be assigned to MooTools ' document .
search ( ) if a $ $ function is not detected .
Note that document . search ( ) was NOT implemented in MooTools 1.2.3 ; document.search ( ) will be implemented in MooTools 2 .
Strategies For Updating < 1.2.3 MooTools Code
There are a couple of ways to update your code .
The first is to simply switch all $ references to document.id ( ) :
/* old : : var myElement = $ ( ' my - element ' ) ; */ var myElement = document .id( ' my - element ' ) ;
The second method is to use closures so you can continue to use the $ and $ $ functions :
( function ( $ , $ $ ) { this .
MyClass = new Class ({ // functionality in here ... } ) ; var myInstance = new MyClass ( $ ( ' search - box ' ) , $ $ ( ' input ' ) ) })(document.id,document.search ) ;
DO NOT FEAR !
My MooTools Code Still Works !
Do n't pass up my older code samples due to the move away from requiring $!
The code will still work .
Use one of the above strategies for making my code framework - compatible .

I ’ve been experimenting with tea bags and water to create some custom grunge stained paper textures , I wanted to see how different they would be from water colours but there ’s not a lot of difference to be fair , I am going to keep experimenting any way , so this is the first batch and hopefully the next batch can bring some more refinements .
These 20 textures are also at a high resolution to cover most working areas and are ideal to be edited , such as colour adjustmets and cropping

I am absolutely incensed and disgusted with Speaker Michael Martin , over his statement to the House of Commons this afternoon !
With a startling disregard for how strong feelings are running in the country over the spectacular and systemic abuse of expenses by MPs , exposed over the last few days by the Daily Telegraph , the Speaker proceeded to castigate the media and MPs ( the very few ) who have had the gall to criticise the Westminster Parliament 's MP 's expenses system !
With outstanding disregard for what clearly is worrying and incensing the public , the Speaker instead , bleated on about ' disregard for important data ' being passed to the media !
What world is this idiot living in ??
The abuse of priveleges by MPs , that is now in the public domain , thanks to the information that has been given to the Daily Telegraph by I do n't care whom ... to my mind , is not just abuse of expenses , ( within the rules according to many MPs ) ... but in many instances , it is tantamount to ... if not actually , criminal offences and fraud !
I gather that Speaker Martin has also called in the Police to investigate the leak to the Telegraph !
Shades of the Greengate - Galleygate affair again ?
Quite frankly , it seems to me the only ' interest ' the Speaker is interested in or serving is politicians ’ personal interests in protecting themselves from embarrassment .
The police should certainly not be abused in this way again .
Their resources are much better employed investigating the abuses by the MPs !
I am disgusted by the increasing list of MPs who actually have the gall to come onto our TV screens , and excuse their abuse by saying " oh well , but it 's within the rules " !!
What a load of bollocks !
I am reminded of the days after the second world war ... and during the Nuremberg Trials ... where an endless procession of Nazis , claimed they were " only obeying orders " .
They may have been ' obeying orders ' but the question always was ... was it right ?
I make no apology for this comparison .
The claims by MPs ... that their flagrant abuse of the Parliamentary system of expenses , is within the rules ... is actually just NOT so !
Not only have they become morally defunct ... they also seem to have lost all sense of right and wrong ... and of simple literacy !
The rules as stated in the The Green Book - A Guide to Members Allowances , the principles governing Members allowances are as follows :
Members of Parliament are provided with financial support in the form of allowances to enable them to work effectively in Parliament and in their constituencies .
Parliamentary allowances are designed to ensure that Members are reimbursed for costs properly incurred in the performance of their duties .
Many of the expenses that have been disclosed that MPs have claimed for , defy these simple guidelines ... and really makes our eyes boggle !
It 's all very well for the Prime Minister , the leader of the Conservative opposition and many MP 's to now come out and apologise ... and say the system is wrong ( as Speaker Martin also did today ) and is now being put right .
What a nerve !
It 's the least these tossers can do frankly !
Of course it needs to be put right .
It should never have been allowed to develop in the way it did ... as many other honourable MPs such as the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker , who has long campaigned for greater transparency on MPs ' expenses , has been saying for years .
Today , in his statement in Parliament , Speaker Martin instead of congratulating Mr Baker for his steadfastness and honesty , criticised him , calling him " another member who is keen to say to the press what the press wants to hear " !
I 'll tell Speaker Martin what I want to hear ... I want to hear his resignation !
Speaker Martin is ultimately responsible for the Committee on Members ’ Allowances , who oversees and guides Members in all the claims which they make .
The Department of Resources , also under Speaker Martin 's responsibility , has the task of administering the rules , of ensuring compliance with them and of giving help and advice to Members .
These systems should have protected the taxpayer and the voting electorate from MPs abuse of privileges .
It clearly has not ... and the Speaker of the House , Michael Martin , is responsible as are these departments under him .
They passed these abusive claims and allowed these abuses to go on without restraint !
Speaker Martin along with the heads of the department and the whole of the Committee on Members ’
Allowances should do the honourable thing ... and resign ... en masse !!
They and the MPs abusing the system , have brought our once proud Parliament into disrepute , not only in the eyes of the Electorate but also in the eyes of the World !
Disgraceful !
Those MPs who HAVE transgressed the rules should be investigated and prosecuted if evidence of fraud or criminal wrongdoing is proven .
They should be prosecuted and of course made to resign from Parliament .... as they are no longer ' the right honourables ' ... and they are certainly not fit to represent anyone in Parliament !
The rumbles , hardly surprisingly following Speaker Martins statement to the House this afternoon , are already starting .
Douglas Carswell MP is , as I write , preparing a ' Motion of no confidence in the Speaker ' .
He too believes , " Enough is enough " :
" I 've drafted the text of a motion for the Speaker to quit , and to be replaced by a new Speaker with a mandate to clean up the Commons .
I 'm consulting the Commons Table Office for advice on it .
I 'm also starting to canvass for support for it from colleagues . "
The latest news is that the House of Commons ' Table Office ' has just approved some text for a suitable motion !
I have emailed my MP and urged him to back the motion .
If you are as disgusted as I am with Speaker Martin , I would suggest you do the same !
People struggle with why Twitter is special .
It ’s special because it counters , better than any other technology , the timeless social obstacle of “ out of sight , out of mind ” .
Regardless of how much time you ’d spend with a given person if they lived nearby , relationships atrophy when distance comes between you .
The longer someone you care about is gone , the more an invisible barrier grows between you–one that makes it awkward to reinitiate contact .
It ’s as if loved ones over time somehow change from tangible people into abstract ideas that require effort to interact with .
This sinister effect of distance turns best friends into strangers , and technologies such as mobile phones and video conferencing do n’t help .
They do n’t help precisely because the barrier is the initiation of contact , not the ability to communicate once connected .
Twitter solves this problem in a way that no other technology has .
Through a stream of common , real - world updates about one ’s life , Twitter reminds our fickle , here - focused brains that those we care about are real , and prevents them from disappearing into the world of the abstract .
In short , Twitter ’s magic is that it ’s able to keep close people close regardless of how far they are from each other , which is a feat that no other technology has been able to accomplish . ::
Frustrated by the expanded power of Washington , a growing number of state lawmakers are defying the federal government and passing legislation aimed at rolling back the reach of Congress and President Obama .
While many measures are symbolic ones declaring the sovereignty of states , some Westerners are taking more dramatic steps .
One Utah lawmaker wants to limit federal law enforcement in his state .
In Montana , legislators enacted a bill that flagrantly ignores federal firearm restrictions , hoping to force a constitutional showdown .
Supporters of the bill want the Supreme Court to eliminate gun controls and , eventually , curtail Washington ’s ability to set policy on a wide range of issues , including education , civil rights , law enforcement and land use .
“ It ’s about states ’ rights , ” said state Rep. Joel Boniek , an independent - turned - Republican from nearby Livingston , who introduced the bill .
“ Guns are just the vehicle . ”

The Montana Firearms Freedom
Act seeks to exempt from federal regulation any firearm , gun component or ammunition made and kept within the state ’s borders .
The legislation , signed by Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer , becomes law Oct. 1 , though federal officials will likely act quickly to keep the measure from taking effect .
Legal experts are skeptical Montana will prevail in court , and even some proponents express their doubts .
But supporters say the fight is a necessary step to change Washington ’s attitude .
Similar bills have been introduced in nearly a half dozen states , and lawmakers in about a dozen more have expressed interest .
“ We need 15 , 25 , 30 states to pass these types of legislation , so that we send a clear message to the country and to the national government , ” said Utah Rep. Carl Wimmer , a Republican from suburban Salt Lake City .
In addition to supporting a version of Montana ’s gun law , Wimmer is drafting legislation that would forbid local authorities to help enforce federal statutes inside Utah -- another bill that , if passed , would surely trigger a court fight .

“ The national government has gained more and more power . . . to a point where we ’re simply subjects of the ruling masters in Washington , D.C. , ” said Wimmer , who has established an organization , the Patrick Henry Caucus , to rally like - minded lawmakers from other states .
“ That is not the way this country and this government were set up . ”
It is no accident the greatest defiance has surfaced in the West , a region with a history of antipathy toward outsiders and , especially , Washington .
“ You ’re going to get more of it as people look at the growth of the federal government and the big bailout of financial interests , ” said Eric Herzik , a University of Nevada political scientist and expert on the Sagebrush Rebellion , the populist movement that swept the West a generation ago and helped put Ronald Reagan in the White House .
The sacred text for Wimmer , Boniek and their allies is the Constitution ’s 10th Amendment , which limits the powers of Washington .
Although the language is straightforward -- all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states -- the meaning has been debated ( and elastically interpreted ) throughout history .
Advertisement
Conservatives and libertarians have long cited the 10th Amendment to press their case against the expansion of federal power , usually to little avail .
Their latest effort is the state sovereignty movement .
( Some also refer to the “ states ’ rights ” movement , though for many those words evoke the segregated South and efforts to fight racial equality . )
In just the last few months , legislatures in five states -- Alaska , Idaho , North Dakota , Oklahoma and South Dakota -- have passed resolutions asserting their sovereignty and asking the federal government to “ cease and desist ” from meddling in their business .
Similar measures are pending in about two dozen other states , including seven out West .
“ There ’s a lot of people in the federal government saying : ‘ Do this .
You must do that .
We ’re the boss , ’ ” said Republican state Rep. Brad Klippert , co-sponsor of sovereignty legislation pending in Olympia , Wash .
“ That ’s not true . ”
Several Republican governors , including Sarah Palin in Alaska , Mark Sanford in South Carolina and Rick Perry in Texas , have gone beyond symbolism , turning down a portion of federal stimulus funds -- and rejecting the strings attached -- as a way of expressing their independence from Washington .
That has sometimes meant going to court and fighting fellow lawmakers eager to accept the money .
Advertisement
The latest movement appears aimed at Obama , who , in just a few months , has increased the size and scope of the federal government more dramatically than any president in decades .
Advocates deny that , citing a litany of grievances that include the No Child Left Behind education bill , which imposed strict federal testing requirements , and the Real ID law , which dictates costly national standards for driver ’s licenses .
Both were signed by President George W. Bush .
Still , Obama and his expansive agenda have unquestionably given momentum to the state sovereignty effort , which has been embraced by Republican politicians like Perry and heavily promoted by sympathetic commentators on conservative TV and talk radio .
For his part , Boniek at one point equated Obama with Hitler , Mao and Stalin , saying each loved his country in his fashion but proved disastrous as a leader .
“ He ’s ruining the country I love , ” Boniek said of Obama , his soft tone belying the harsh comparison .
“ He does n’t know what freedom is . ”

It is difficult to say how the Supreme Court might rule on Montana ’s gun law , which challenges the government ’s authority under the commerce clause of the Constitution , the legal basis for much federal regulation .
In the mid-1990s , the court struck down a federal law that sought to restrict guns near schools , using the rationale behind Montana ’s law : that the federal authority over interstate commerce did not extend to a product that was made and used within one state .
More recently , however , the justices rejected a direct challenge to the commerce clause , ruling in 2005 that the federal government had the authority to effectively override California ’s medical marijuana law , even though the cannabis was being grown and used within the state ’s borders .
“ As an abstract legal matter , it ’s perfectly plausible , ” Eugene Volokh , a UCLA expert on constitutional law , said of Montana ’s case .
“ But it ’s very unlikely to succeed in today ’s legal climate . ”
Advertisement
Backers of the legislation concede as much .
“ No federal employee in a black robe is going to roll back the power of the federal government , ” said Gary Marbut , president of the Montana Shooting Sports Assn. , who wrote the bill .
“ But we want to make a statement , get the legal arguments on the record and get people active . ”
Boniek , who makes his living operating a crane and leading big - game hunts , is already planning for next year ’s session .
( Montana , like some other Western states , has a part - time legislature . )
He plans to introduce a bill that would make the sheriff the top law enforcement official in each county , requiring federal officers to seek permission to exercise authority in Montana .
For now , Boniek is waiting to see how the fight over his gun bill goes .
“ The whole thing is like a chess game , ” he said .
“ We ’ve made our move .
The next move is up to the federal government . ”

THOUGH HOSTILITY to state power precedes anarchism , the idea of a society without a state has now ( wrongly ) come to be associated exclusively with anarchism .
Conversely , Marxism is almost universally identified ( again wrongly ) with the idea of state ownership of the economy , and , by extension , with strengthening the state , rather than doing away with it .
This mistaken idea that Marxism is somehow pro-state comes first from the development of reformist Social Democratic parties after Marx and Engels ' death that indeed argued that the path to socialism led through the existing state institutions .
In particular , Social Democracy of the early 20th century envisioned socialism as something to be achieved by gaining a majority within the representative institutions of the state , and then using its electoral conquests to implement a series of social reforms , leading to full socialization of production .
These ideas -- which were practically discredited by the fact that this particular brand of social reformism tended to adapt to capitalism rather than transform it -- became associated , wrongly , with Marx .
Columnist : Paul D’Amato Paul D'Amato is managing editor of the International Socialist Review and author of The Meaning of Marxism , a lively and accessible introduction to the ideas of Karl Marx and the tradition he founded .

There was a brief revolutionary hiatus in which the Russian revolutionary Lenin rescued from oblivion the original ideas of Marx and Engels on the state -- that it was an instrument of class oppression and , therefore , could not be used by the working class to change society .
When Lenin began to argue that the state should be " smashed " and on its ruins new organs of workers ' democracy erected , his fellow revolutionaries accused him of a lapse into anarchism .
The degeneration of the Russian Revolution - - a process inescapable once the revolution became isolated and encircled by hostile powers -- and the rise of Stalinism on its ruins once again entrenched a conception of socialism as statification of the economy .
Marxism and anarchism do have different conceptions of the state , and , therefore , of what should be done about it .
Both anarchists and Marxists seek a stateless society -- the anarchists because in the state they see the root of all oppression and exploitation , and the Marxists because the state , as the instrument for the maintenance of class rule , must fall away when class rule is done away with .
Frederick Engels expressed the difference well in a letter to an Italian anarchist on Mikhail Bakunin , a contemporary of Marx and Engels :
Bakunin has a peculiar theory of his own ... the chief point of which is in the first place that he does not regard capital , and therefore the class contradiction between capitalists and wage earners which has arisen through social development , as the main evil to be abolished - - instead , he regards the state as the main evil .
While the great mass of the Social Democratic workers hold our view that state power is nothing more than the organization with which the ruling classes , landlords and capitalists have provided themselves in order to protect their social prerogatives , Bakunin maintains that it is the state which has created capital , that the capitalist has his capital only by favor of the state .
As , therefore , the state is the chief evil , it is above all the state which must be done away with and then capitalism will go to hell of itself .
We , on the contrary say : do away with capital , the appropriation of the whole means of production in the hands of the few , and the state will fall away of itself .
Bakunin's own writings , I believe , misconstrued the differences between the two doctrines .
" They [ Marx and his followers ] are worshippers of state power , and necessarily also prophets of political and social discipline and champions of order established from the top downwards , " he wrote .
No doubt there were socialists who worshipped state power and top - down control , but neither Marx nor Engels were one of them .
In his pamphlet , Socialism : Utopian and Scientific , Engels explicitly rejects the notion that state ownership equals socialism :
Certainly , if the taking over by the state of the tobacco industry is socialistic , then Napoleon and Metternich must be numbered among the founders of socialism .
MARX AND
Engels were opposed to the idea that revolutions could be made by minorities on behalf of the working class .
Marx , for example , rejected the politics of the German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle , who viewed the working class as a sort of stage army that would help him into office , after which he and his cohorts would implement socialism from above .
" He behaves , " Marx complained of Lassalle , " with an air of great importance , bandying about phrases borrowed from us -- altogether as if he were the future workers ' dictator .
The problem of wage - labor versus capital he solves like ' child 's play ' ( literally ) .
To wit , the workers must agitate for universal suffrage and then send people like him ' armed with the unsheathed sword of science ' into the Chamber of Deputies .
Then , they form workers ' factories , for which the state advances the capital , and these institutions by and by embrace the whole land . "
Though they admired his devotion and courage , Marx and Engels were critical of the politics of the French revolutionary Auguste Blanqui , who , according to Engels , believed " that a small and well - organized minority ... could carry the mass of the people with them ... and... make a victorious revolution . "
Engels also criticizes the Blanquists for seeking a " dictatorship , not of the entire revolutionary class , the proletariat , but of the small minority that has made the revolution , and who are themselves previously organized under the dictatorship of one or several individuals . "
The last point is important , because the standard anarchist critique of Marxism is that it stands for " dictatorship , " and what Engels ' makes clear here is that by this loaded word , they did not mean the rule of a minority , but the rule of the majority ( the working class ) over its former exploiters ( the minority ) .
An anarchist might argue that it is still an argument for an authoritarian state of some sort , even after the revolution .
And they would be right .
Anarchists and socialists both agree that we need to do away with unaccountable authority , and all forms of authority that are deployed to maintain the current relations in society of exploitation , inequality and oppression .
Beyond that however , the agreement begins to break down .
In his essay , On Authority , Engels wrote :
All socialists are agreed that the political state , and with it political authority , will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution , that is , that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society .
But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke , even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed .
Engels concluded by arguing that revolutions are , by definition , authoritarian , because they involve one part of society ( the majority of oppressed and exploited ) imposing its will on the other ( the minority of exploiters and their supporters ) .
The question then arises : how can a new society be built if the new revolutionary power refuses to establish a new power , i.e. , a state , to prevent the old order from regaining its foothold ?
Lenin put it this way : " We do not at all disagree with the anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as an aim .
We maintain that , to achieve this aim , temporary use must be made of the instruments , means and methods of the state power against the exploiters , just as the dictatorship of the oppressed class is temporarily necessary for the annihilation of classes . "
As night settled in , the streets in northern Tehran that recently had been the scene of pre-election euphoria were lit by the flames of trash fires and blocked by tipped trash bins and at least one charred bus .
Young men ran through the streets throwing paving stones at shop windows , and the police pursued them .
Earlier in the day , hurried meetings were reported among Iran ’s leading political figures and clerics ; some were said to be trying to influence Ayatollah Khamenei to intervene in a situation that could stain public confidence in the integrity of Iran ’s elections .
But Saeed Leylaz , an economist and political analyst , said he believed that Ayatollah Khamenei ’s statement would bring a resolution , even if demonstrations persisted for a few days .
“ This has put an end to political negotiations from above , ” Mr. Leylaz said .
For the moment , Ayatollah Khamenei ’s admonition did nothing to calm the opposition ’s rage .
“ The results of the 10th presidential election are so ridiculous and so unbelievable that one cannot write or talk about it in a statement , ” said Mehdi Karroubi , a reformist cleric and candidate .
Mr. Karroubi came in last with 300,000 votes  far fewer than analysts had predicted .
“ It is amazing that the people ’s vote has turned into an instrument for the government to stabilize itself , ” he said .
The other candidate , Mohsen Rezai , got 680,000 votes , Interior Ministry officials said .
In 2005 , when Mr. Karroubi was also a candidate for president , he accused the government of rigging the vote in Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s favor .
In that election , the government announced when polls closed that there would probably be a runoff between two of three candidates , a reform candidate and a former police chief .
Today , I was at the grocery store and this hot guy was staring at my ass , so I smiled at him .
My mother noticed he was checking my ass out , and she approached him and said " I know she has a big ass , but it 's rude to stare , son . "

Would your wife still be your wife if you were waiting in line for a Palm Pre at 7:45 when the wedding started at 8 ?
My guess is no — but this guy has himself a very special lady .
On Saturday at 7 a.m. , Theodore was 14th in line at an Atlanta - area Sprint store , fidgeting for his new Pre .
His wedding was scheduled for 8 a.m .
As much as Theodore wanted Pre , he wanted his bride , Anita , to see him at the altar at the appointed time .
At 7:45 , he abandoned his wait and left his line - number and credit card information with a Sprint store employee , asking that he " hold the 14th phone for me . "
The Sprint store employee obliged .
Minutes after the recessional , the newlyweds returned to pick up their phone , spending the first minutes of married life with a Ready Now consultant who walked the happy couple through Pre 's setup and features .
The new Mrs. Travis later revealed that her reaction was " You did what ? " to her husband spending the hour before their wedding waiting for a phone , but later admitted , " I guess I kind of understand now . "

Oh Anita , wrap your arms around this dude and never let go .
Nerds falling in love is a beautiful thing ... but I give it six months .

It ’s kind of a stoner rite of passage to feed a pet some form of narcotics .
I find that my cat ’s instinctual curiosity and literal inability to “ just say no ” makes him a prime candidate for chasing the green dragon .
Plus I ’d hate to be one of those losers who smokes pot alone .
That ’s why when I get high with my cat I plan activities that the two of us can find equally engaging .
Like watching movies where people turn into cats , so we both get freaked out .
If I ’m sitting there baked out of my potato , considering the implications of turning into a cat ( increased stealth , cuter agility ) , I like to think that ol ’ furball can also wig off imagining how it ’d be to morph into a human ( i.e. no having to bury own shit , non -weird prick , can open a savings account…etc . )
The films Cat People and Sleepwalker pretty much make up the “ werecat ” genre of cinema , the former of which IMDB describes as an “ erotic remake , ” which is the best kind of remake .
While I zoned out imagining an erotic remake of Downfall , my cat remained transfixed on a scene where some guy gets his arm ripped off .
I did n’t want him to get any bright ideas , so it was on to the next film .
Sleepwalkers details that tired old yarn about a shape - shifting mother - son duo that feed on the souls of virgins .
For reasons pot-related , I do n’t really remember this film .
Though I do know it feature my favorite kind of stabbing .
You guessed it , corn-stabbing .
As my cat ’s interests shifted towards urgently mewling at a shadow , it became clear he did n’t give two buried shits about these movies .
My attention eventually wandered as well , and I later found myself on the Internet Googling pictures of Jocelyn Wildenstein , the infamous “ real ” cat woman of plastic surgery .

But not for much longer
NO ONE should have been surprised when Canada 's elderly nuclear research - reactor near Ottawa sprang a leak last month , prompting a prolonged shutdown that removes two - fifths of the world 's supply of a medical isotope widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer .
After all , the government - owned reactor was fired up in 1957 , the same year that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik and Elvis Presley starred in “ Jailhouse Rock ” .
But the reactor 's second unscheduled shutdown in as many years left health officials in Canada and the United States scrambling to find alternative sources of the isotope .
Hospitals in both countries rescheduled thousands of tests and treatments .
This debacle has stirred Stephen Harper 's Conservative minority government into a decision .
It says it will divide AECL , the state - owned atomic - energy company , into two , privatising all or part of its division that makes and services nuclear - power stations while winding down the research reactor .
Eventually , says Mr Harper , Canada will get out of making isotopes altogether .
His spokesman used blunter language , saying that AECL was “ dysfunctional ” and a “ sinkhole ” that has cost the Canadian governments C$ 30 bn ( $ 26.5 billion ) since its creation in 1952 .
Critics worry that the government is getting out of the nuclear business just when concerns about fossil fuels are prompting its renaissance .
They believe that demand will rise not just for medical isotopes but also for Canada 's CANDU reactors , which use a different technology from many elsewhere .
Canada led the world in the development of radioactive isotopes for medical diagnosis and therapy , says Jacalyn Duffin , a medical historian at Queen 's University in Ontario .
“ Why quit now ? ” But supporters of privatisation such as the C.D. Howe Institute , a think - tank , say that AECL is too small to survive , and the sale of its potentially profitable parts is the only way a nuclear resurgence in Canada is possible .
Canada 's dream of being a nuclear power began in 1943 when Mackenzie King , the prime minister , agreed with Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt to co-operate on nuclear research .
But government backing for peaceful nuclear operations later withered , a casualty of deficit - reduction under the past two Liberal governments and the Conservatives ' preference for smaller government .
With a stimulus package driving the federal budget 's forecast deficit up to C$ 50bn this fiscal year , Mr Harper does not want to add to the C$ 1.7 billion his government has given AECL since coming to power in 2006 .
Health officials in the United States are seeking an American supplier of medical isotopes , having decided that Canada is no longer a reliable source of molybdenum - 99 , which when processed into technetium - 99 m is used in two - thirds of all diagnostic medical - isotope procedures south of the border .
As long as AECL was working on two replacement reactors , American processing firms were content to wait .
But Canada cancelled the replacement programme last year when the new reactors , already eight years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget , failed tests .
In Canada the isotope shortage has become a liability for Mr Harper .
Lisa Raitt , the minister responsible for AECL , apologised to cancer patients after she was caught on tape discussing how her career might benefit if she solved the “ sexy ” isotope crisis .
Leona Aglukkaq , the health minister whom Ms Raitt also criticised in the taped conversation , says she has arranged for new supplies from Australia .
Yet Australia has problems of its own with its single , albeit newish reactor , and has recently been importing isotopes from South Africa .
Capitalising on government disarray , Michael Ignatieff , the Liberal leader , demanded more information on isotope supply as one of several small concessions he extracted from Mr Harper in return for keeping the government in office by agreeing to back it in a confidence motion on the budget due for debate in the House of Commons on June 19th .
AECL 's nuclear - power business has also suffered in recent years .
Its CANDU reactors were once thought superior because they could be refuelled without shutting down .
But rival technologies have improved .
Potential foreign buyers of the company are waiting to see whether AECL 's latest , previously untried design wins a competition this summer to build a new reactor for Ontario 's provincial government .
Should the province select either of two rivals — a French consortium headed by Areva or an American consortium headed by Westinghouse , both of which use different reactor technology — the new CANDU design will probably be aborted .
AECL 's business would be limited to servicing the 48 nuclear - power plants around the world that use its technology .
And Canada 's nuclear dream would have died .

An unlikely friendship , perhaps , but one no less true : A dog and a wild boar piglet have become chums .
Their story began when a hunter in the western German town of Ehringhausen found the piglet abandoned in the woods .
JERUSALEM —
Air raid sirens wailed out on Tuesday morning and Israelis were asked to go down into bomb shelters as the country engaged in its largest - ever civil defense drill .
Israelis remain deeply worried by what they perceive as an existential threat of a possible future all - out missile attack from Iran and its proxies .
But what makes Israelis really jittery right now is the possibility that they may lose their long - held status as the best ally of the U.S. in the Middle East , a prospect which , to many Israelis , is of an equally existential concern .
All of a sudden , Israelis are taxed by the unthinkable : how come , less than six months into the new administration in Washington , the central pole of U.S. Middle East strategy is now but a wooden plank ?
All of a sudden , Israeli concerns have been relegated to the sidelines , in the shadow — in President ’s Obama ’s phrase — of " America ’s national interests . "
Who could have imagined that when Obama re-engages the U.S. in the region , that he would deliberately not even have made a courtesy stopover in Jerusalem ?
And , who could have contemplated that , for the first time since former president Ronald Reagan back in 1982 unveiled his now long - demised revolutionary plan for settling the Arab - Israel conflict on the lines of a two - state solution in Palestine , Israel would be kept in the dark about the content of a keynote presidential address — that to be made Thursday in Cairo to the Arab and Muslim world .
Twittering in the wings , the Israeli government is literally at sixes and sevens .
Speaking at an intimate gathering of his Likud party parliamentary caucus , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu displayed rare frankness : " I do n’t want to create any illusions , " he said .
" We are in the midst of a reality that is not at all simple .
We have to consider what options we have on the settlements , in practical terms vis -à - vis this Administration , but also vis -à - vis ourselves .
We do n’t want to deepen the rift with the Americans .
We have no interest in that .
But , we ’re not going to uproot settlements – no one envisages that . "
On Tuesday night , as Netanyahu ’s Defense Minister Ehud Barak was meeting at the White House with U.S. national security advisor , General James Jones , Barack Obama made a surprise entry .
He popped in for a 15 - minute chat with the Israeli guest — enough time not only to exchange pleasantries but to reinforce the adamant U.S. position : there must be no more settlement building whatsoever in the occupied territories .
This came hard on the heels of what Barak had heard just the previous day from the President ’s special envoy to the Middle East , Senator George Mitchell — that the U.S. is no longer willing to return to understandings reached between previous Israeli governments and the Bush Administration , a tacit agreement which allowed Israel to continue its policy of building in some approved " settlement blocs " close to the 1967 border .
The Netanyahu government has thus far been unsuccessful in heading off the looming showdown with Obama over settlements by offering to remove 26 " illegal settlement outposts " in return for U.S. approval for continued limited settlement expansion .
Opposition parliamentarian Nachman
Shay told IPS that the reason Netanyahu is having such a hard time handling the U.S. challenge on settlements is " because he simply has no alternative policy to offer . "
But , there is a deeper reason for Israel ’s national disarray — the inherent contradiction in the Israeli leader ’s policy — between his demand that the U.S. respect its past commitments on settlements , and his refusal to adhere to Israel ’s own previous commitment to the two - state solution .
The disagreement concerning the settlements produced an embarrassing encounter in London last week between Mitchell and Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor .
Netanyahu ’s envoy advanced the argument of the informal letter between former president George W. Bush and Israel ’s former prime minister Ariel Sharon , stating that the " settlement blocs " would remain in Israeli hands even in a peace agreement , and thus construction of new homes could continue there .
Mitchell retorted by showing Meridor that another of the letter ’s sections enshrines the principle of " two states for two peoples . "
" That ’s also written in the letter — do you agree to that ? "
Mitchell asked pointedly .
Writing in the liberal Tel Aviv daily Haaretz , commentator Akiva Eldar sees the settlement dispute in more strategic terms : " Netanyahu is blowing the row out of proportion .
He is focusing on the so - called ‘ natural population growth ’ in settlements simply in order to try to head Obama off before the President begins making demands over borders and Jerusalem . "
Netanyahu is clearly caught on a cleft stick , and it ’s already on fire .
According to Arab Israeli legislator Ahmad Tibi , a close confidant of Palestinian leaders for the past 20 years , Obama has laid down a tight deadline .
" He ’s told the Israeli prime minister : Come up with your updated peace position by July 1st , but make sure you relate both to the need for a total settlement freeze and that you are ready to sign on to the two - state principle . "
Israeli antennae are closely attuned to how the President formulates his vision at Cairo University about U.S. - Arab relations , and how he envisages it will shape the future of the region .
Already the Israeli government recognizes that this will probably be but the first of many screws Obama means to tighten around Netanyahu .
That could leave the Israeli leader facing an unenviable choice — square up to a determined U.S. President , or turn his back on his settlement credo and risk finding himself in a showdown with his own right - wing allies .
That , in turn , could mean the shortest - ever term in office any Israeli leader has had .
( Inter Press Service )
Other Republicans privately said Ensign could have handled the situation better , saying they would have preferred he not announce the affair at a press conference 30 minutes before local news outlets went on the air , engage in a war of words with the Hamptons and return to Washington less than a week after the scandal broke .
“ You could definitely say ” the handling of the scandal has been more frustrating for GOP Senators than the affair itself , a second Republican aide said .
... At one point , Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , Ensign ’s housemate in Washington , D.C. , motioned for Ensign to follow him , and the two sat at couple of desks on the floor and appeared to engage in a private conversation .
The discussion appeared friendly , although it lasted for about five minutes and involved more than Coburn welcoming Ensign back after a week away from the Senate .
Following in the footsteps of other Republican hypocrites who swore on stacks of Bibles they were innocent and as pure as the driven snow , Nevada philanderer John Ensign , his political career a smoldering wreck , addressed his GOP colleagues at their weekly lunch today .
While President Obama talked with normal Americans about a wide variety of issues Republican senators are n't interested in -- financial regulations , peace in the Middle East , health care reform , etc -- the Republicans were forced to relive their collective embarrassment for harboring so many sex - obsessed hypocrites , from David Diapers Vitter ( R - LA ) and Larry Craig ( R - ID ) to John Ensign ( R - NV ) .
A Republican Senate aide toldthat Ensign is n't toxic yet , although as more information comes seeping out it looks like there were illegal payoffs being made and taxes not paid and purposeful misuse of campaign donations .
Speaking about the Republican Conference -- the chairmanship of which Ensign has resigned -- he said , “ they all feel a certain degree of sympathy for his situation ...
It ’s not like the Conference is at a stage where they just do n’t want the guy there -- yet . "
None of the senators , except Senator Hannity , have called on Ensign to resign -- the way Ensign did when Larry Craig was arrested in a public toilet trying to have sex with a handsome young policeman -- and his Lordship Bob Corker ( R - TN ) , who refused to meet with Judge Sonia Sotomayor because her broken leg caused her to be 10 minutes late -- said Republicans have had no discussions about trying to get him to resign .
“ I have heard no discussions ...
Nothing but support , ” Corker said .
( Still , in the crucial vote that the Nevada tourism industry was pushing -- and that Ensign co-sponsored -- only one other Republican voted with Ensign and the Democrats , Mel Martinez .
The rest abandoned Ensign to the anger of his home state 's most important industry .
It is a tragic consequence of Ensign 's misbehavior . )
It is widely believed that Coburn was trying to get his story straight so that he and Ensign would n't contradict each other about the nights Ensign hung the red tie on the doorknob .
For his luncheon apology , Ensign made brief remarks , took no questions and was greeted by a round of applause .
Mel Martinez said he sounded " sincere . "
Meanwhile , according toMagazine 's most connected reporter , Karen Tumulty , one of the slimiest GOP consultants , Alex Castellanos , remarked that if South Carolina missing Governor Mark Sanford really " was camping , he 's going to have to explain where he was setting his tent pole . "
Others claim that " hiking the Appalachian trail " is a Republican euphemism for " I have a wide stance . "

Not too long ago , J.D. over at Get Rich Slowly posted 25 Useful Financial Rules of Thumb .
These guidelines are designed to help everyday people do more with their finances .
We wanted to expand on that idea and make a more investing - specific list , with useful rules of thumb for the everyday , buy - and - hold ETF / index fund investor .
Here are 10 investing rules of thumb that can help you make the most of your long - term ETF portfolio [ for further reading also Download 101 ETF Lessons Every Financial Advisor Should Learn ] :
1. Rule of 72 .
The Rule of 72 states that you can divide the number 72 by whatever yield you are getting to see how long it would take for your investment to double .
Master Your Card has a great example of how the Rule of 72 works in real life :
The membership share he currently has his money in is earning 1 % interest .
I explain the rule of 72 to him and then write it down on paper so that he can see what I ’m doing … I like to draw crazy pictures when I talk numbers .
So , I break it down for him .
At 1 % , it would take 72 years for his $ 165,000 to double .
If he wen back to the money market — our rate up a little — he ’d be earning 4.75 % on his money and that would only take about 15 years to double .
Clearly he ’d have more fun in the next 15 years than he would in 72 .
The concept works that same with returns on an ETF .
You can estimate how long it will take for the money in your ETF to double if you leave it there at its average yield .
Of course , because ETFs can change , it is probably best to figure this number on a five or ten year average ( or a longer average if you can find one ) .
2. “ 120 Minus Your Age ” Rule .
The old rule of thumb was to take your age and subtract it from 100 .
That is your percentage of stock allocation .
No Debt Plan , however , points out that with the new life expectancies , that rule is rather conservative .
Instead , the suggestion is to change that 100 to 120 :
As an individual investor , you need incentive to take risk .
That incentive with stocks is — over the long run — higher returns .
If you could n’t earn higher returns in stocks then everyone would invest in safe assets like bonds , CDs , and saving accounts .
There would be no incentive to take the additional risk .
With longer retirements and longer lives , a little more risk at a younger age is needed to make sure that your money will last as long as you do .
You can have some or all of your equity allocation in the form of ETFs ( or index funds ) comprised of stocks .
Then , use a bond ETF like BND , or even a TIPS ETF ( to protect against inflation ) , to account for your bond allocation .
Note that in our ETFdb sample portfolio we actually recommend using the formula 110 minus your age , but the truth is , any of these rules will achieve the goal of moving to less risky investments as your investment horizon decreases .

3. The Long Term Inflation Average Is 4 % .
For the immediate future , deflation is one of the major concerns afflicting the economy .
However , over time , inflation provides a real hit to your investment portfolio .
AllBusiness points this out about assuming an inflation rate of 4 % :
An inflation rate of 4 % might not seem significant until you consider the long - term effect on your purchases and your investments
For example , in 20 years , 4 % inflation annually would drive the value of a dollar down to $ 0.44 .
Inflation also works against your investments .
When pursuing long - term financial goals , from college savings for your loved ones to your own retirement , it ’s important to consider the real rate of return , which is determined by figuring in the effects of inflation .
When figuring the real rate of return on your investments , using a 4 % annual inflation rate can help you plan more realistically for your future needs .
Long - term , buy - and - hold investors know that they need to look at the big picture and add inflation - beating investments to their portfolios .
When combined with rule # 2 , you can set up a long - term investment portfolio that has an asset allocation to that provides a capital preservation base but also offers growth that beats the rate of inflation .
4. Very Few Years Are “ Average ” .
One of the indexes that is routinely touted as a great market beating investment is the S&P 500 ( you can “ buy ” the S&P with an ETF such as SPY or RSP ) .
Indeed , rolling returns from the S&P 500 show an historically high level on an average basis .
However , the nature of the stock market is to move up and down ; year - to - year consistency is not to be expected .
Indeed , columnist Humberto Cruz points out that the S&P rarely makes it ’s historical average in any given year :
The average historical long - term return for the S&P 500 Index is about 10 percent a year .
But the index rarely comes close to returning 10 percent any particular year .
In the past 40 years , returns have ranged from a gain of 37.5 percent in 1995 to last year ’s 37 percent loss .
Only twice — gains of 10 percent in 1993 and 11 percent in 2004 — did gains range between 8 and 14 percent .
Another thing to keep in mind that inflation must be subtracted from returns as well , so annual S&P gains on a real basis are closer to the 6 - 7 % range .
5. You Need 20 x Your Gross Annual Income to Retire .
This rule is a great starting point for your retirement planning , though as GRS ’s J.D. points out , this 20 x your income rule may not be the be - all - and - end - all :
Another approach to retirement savings says that you ’ll need to save about 20 x your gross annual income to retire .
In other words , if you earn $ 50,000 per year , you ’ll need $ 1,000,000 to retire .
Again , I think this is lame because it focuses on income and not expenses , and expenses are what matter .
But still , this can be a handy gauge .
The point , of course , is that expenses may matter more .
So use the 20 x your income rule as a good starting point , but modify according to your expenses .
Figure out how long you think your retirement will be and multiply that by your annual expenses .
I think my retirement is likely to last 30 years .
30 x my annual expenses of $ 40,000 ( which will go down when I retire and no longer have a mortgage and student loans ) is $ 1.2 million .
Will my rule # 2 asset allocation help me get there in 20 years when I retire ?
I can use rule # 1 to get an idea .
And , of course , I ’ll still be adding to my retirement portfolio .
Of course , this formula does n’t take into account me living longer — or needing long - term care .
6. 4 % Withdrawal Rule .
In order to protect your principal during when you start withdrawing from your investment portfolio , use the 4 % rule to figure out how much you can take out .
Four Pillars offers an excellent explanation of how the 4 % rule works :
The way the 4 % rule works is that you start by taking 4 % out of your portfolio in the first year – this includes dividends , interest , withdrawals .
The next year you take out the same figure you took out the first year plus inflation .
So if you start by taking $ 40,000 out and then inflation is 3 % then the second year you take out $ 40,000 + 3 % ( $ 1200 ) = $ 41,200 .
Every year after that you adjust the previous year ’s withdrawal amount by the inflation rate .
Of course , you will probably need to adjust this rule , depending on how your retirement is going , and how well the market is performing .
But it ’s a reasonable rule that can help you determine how much you can take out .
And if your investments are beating inflation ( a TIPS ETF can help ensure that some of your portfolio is at least keeping pace ) , this rule should last you quite some time .
7. Retirement Plan Priorities : 401 ( k ) ’ til match , then Roth IRA , then 401 ( k ) ’til max .
It ’s a good idea to understand your retirement account investing priorities .
There is a definite strategy that can be employed when you are putting money into your retirement accounts .
The Motley Fool offers some great advice on retirement account priorities :
Your priority should usually be your employer ’s 401 ( k ) plan , if it matches your donations to any degree .
Take maximum advantage of matching funds , because they represent free money which will grow for you over time .
The Roth IRA is the next best option for most people , since it offers a place where your ( post - tax ) dollars can grow tax - free for many years .
Note that you ’re probably best off contributing as much to your 401 ( k ) as you need to for the maximum match , then putting your next dollars into a Roth IRA .
Once you ’ve maxed out the Roth , look at the 401 ( k ) again , and after that , a traditional IRA .
8. Save and Invest 10 % of Your Pre-Tax Income .
Before spending your money , follow the old adage “ pay yourself first . ”
This is great advice !
Take 10 % of your income ( pre-tax if possible ) and set it aside , preferably in some sort of account that offers returns , such as a retirement account .
Master Your Card offers this observation about the 10 % savings rule :
Think about it this way : for every 10 dollars you earn , save at least one dollar for yourself before spending the rest .
This practice is often referred to as “ Paying yourself first ” , implying that you ’re paying to build equity in yourself with every paycheck .
This money which you ’re saving is then kept as a private reserve , which you can invest in a wide array of low - risk investment vehicles .
Thus , over time you are building wealth not only through your regular deposits of 10 % of your income , but also through the interest being earned on the money you ’ve already made .
One of the best ways to do this is via direct deposit .
Have a portion of your paycheck direct deposited into a savings account .
Even better , make sure your retirement account deposits are coming out of your paycheck automatically as well .
The best policy is to make savings automatic .
9. 10 , 5 , 3 Rule .
This is a handy rule that states that you can expect a nominal return of 10 % from equities , 5 % return from bonds and 3 % return on highly liquid cash and cash - like accounts .
Of course , this is a an average return over the long haul .
Here is what FIRE Finance points out about what is more likely to be the case this year :
Being conservative in nature and observing the current state of the market we ’d rather root for a more achievable 8 , 5 , 3 .
That ’s our rule of thumb for investing this year .
Let ’s see how the year unfolds as we go along and the lessons involved .
And it is worth noting that some feel as though equities offer lower average returns that 10 % .
The bottom line is that investment returns fluctuate year - to - year .
It is also worth noting that ETFs can be used in many of these investments –including stock ETFs and bond ETFs .
There are even cash and currency ETFs , such as FXE .
10 . Required Return .
There is an interesting formula to help you figure out your required return ( this is a bit more advanced than our other rules , but it ’s a useful one ) .
It looks as follows : Required return = risk free rate + beta ( historical market return – risk free rate ) .
Allan Baraza offers this explanation of what each of the parts to this equation represent :
The risk free rate is the return on a 5 or 10 year government note .
Choice of notes to use will depend on time horizon used to estimate the historical market return .
Beta is a measure of a stock ’s volatility ; the higher the beta , the higher the volatility .
This volatility is relative to the market volatility .
A stock with a beta of 1.5 means that the stock will rise 15 % with a 10 % rise in the market ; conversely , it falls 15 % with a market fall of 10 % .
It follows , then , that the market beta is 1 .
Historical market return is a regression estimation of the return over the estimation time period .
He points out that during times of uncertainty and volatility , lower beta stocks are preferred .
You can learn a little more about the advantages and disadvantages of beta in a useful Investopedia article on the subject .
These ten investing rules of thumb should serve you well in building and maintaining your ETF portfolio .
Of course , there ’s more to personal finance than just investing , so if you ’re not yet to the point where you find this article to be helpful , you ’ll want to check out GetRichSlowly ’s 25 Useful Financial Rules of Thumb first .

According to Publisher 's Marketplace , Golden Reflections will be an anthology of stories based on Saberhagen 's novel Mask Of The Sun .
It 'll be edited by Joan Saberhagen and Robert Vardeman , and will include seven " distinguised SF writers . "
And Baen Books just agreed to publish the result .
In Mask Of The Sun , Mike Gabrieli 's ne'er - do - well brother Tom disappears , soon after discovering a super - valuable Aztec relic , a golden mask .
Mike decides to try wearing the mask , and finds himself traveling between the past and the future , and even to alternate realities .
He becomes " the focal point of an inconceivable war between time - traveling Tenokas and 16th century Incas . "

And eventually , Mike discovers that Pizarro was able to conquer the Incas on behalf of Spain because he had a similar gold mask .
Mike uses his own mask to stop Pizarro , and save the Incan Empire from the Spanish .
But he finds he 's created a new branch of history — one in which he may never be born .
And he's not sure if it's an alternate future , or if it 's become the future .
As one reviewer puts it :
One of the characters in this story says " . . . do n't worry if you do n't understand it all .
Like trying to make common sense out of the theory of relativity . "
Truer words were never spoken .

At a media event yesterday in New York , representatives from smartphone maker HTC passed around their latest creation : an Android - based device they ’re calling Hero .
And … wow .
It bears saying I am not traditionally a fan of HTC products .
Their TouchFLO interface for Windows Mobile I find to be an over - engineered abomination that lags and spasms its way through even basic tasks .
Their hardware is usually pretty nice –the Touch Diamond is a great little machine , for example–but their first Google phone , the G1 , feels like a big dumb ham sandwich in my hand .
( Being an iPhone die - hard , I ’m not a fan of pop - out keyboards . )
So it was with notable reticence that I took a shine to the Hero .
The whole interface is skinned in HTC ’s own UI , which they call “ Sense , ” built on top of Google ’s Android operating system , version 1.5 ( aka Cupcake ) .
Like other HTC - designed interfaces , it ’s beautiful .
Unlike others , it works .
Fast .
In fact , if there was one thing that left me ready to kidnap the Hero and leave my iPhone behind , it was the speed of the thing .
What the iPhone lacks in snappiness ( talking about the 3G here ; the 3G S is plenty fast ) and the G1 lacked in glamour , the Hero has in spades .
Switching from app to app was crisp and quick , animations happened flawlessly , buttons were responsive ( though the two on the bottom are awkwardly placed ) and programs opened without lag .
Typing was responsive and comfortable –better even than the iPhone–and spelling corrections dropped in seamlessly .
Nearly everything I tried on the phone–which was running a pre-release OS – happened in a flourish of brevity and style .
In two minutes , I was smitten .
In the demo videos below , you may assume that operations have been sped up for your benefit , as with say , iPhone commercials .
They have n’t , really .
This thing is snappy .
Ramon sez , " In Germany internet censorship will be introduced .
The bill did not pass yet , but the ruling parties have agreed to do so .
Over 130.000 people in Germany have signed a petition to protect the freedom of speech and information , but we have not been heard .
Read details about the consequences , arguments and counter measures here . "
The Minister for Family Affairs Ursula von der Leyen kicked off and lead the discussions within the German Federal Government to block Internet sites in order to fight child pornography .
The general idea is to build a censorship architecture enabling the government to block content containing child pornography .
The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation ( BKA ) is to administer the lists of sites to be blocked and the internet providers obliged to erect the secret censorship architecture for the government .
A strong and still growing network opposing these ideas quickly formed within the German internet community .
The protest has not been limited to hackers and digital activist but rather a mainstreamed effort widely supported by bloggers and twitter - users .
The HashTag used by the protesters is #zensursula – a German mesh up of the Ministers name and the word censorship equivalent to #censursula .
As part of the public 's protest an official e-Petition directed at the German parliament was launched .
Within three days 50,000 persons signed the petition – – the number required for the petition titled â€ žNo indexing and blocking of Internet sites " to be heard by the parliament .
The running time of an e-Petition in Germany is 6 weeks – within this time over 130,000 people signed making this e-Petition the most signed and most successful ever .

A 5 km path of wreckage found in the Atlantic Ocean is that of the missing Air France jet , Brazilian authorities have confirmed .
Brazil 's defence minister , Nelson Jobim , said the discovery of the debris by Brazilian military pilots " confirms that the plane went down in that area " hundreds of kilometres from the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha .
He said the strip of wreckage included metallic and nonmetallic pieces , but did not describe them in detail .
No bodies were spotted in the crash of the Airbus in which all 228 aboard are believed to have died .
DEBRIS FOUND : A Brazilian Air Force helicopter lands after taking part in the search mission for Air France flight 447 .
Authorities have confirmed debris found belongs to the jet .
The discovery came just hours after authorities announced they had found an airplane an airplane seat , an orange buoy and signs of fuel in a part of the Atlantic Ocean with depths of up to 4,800 metres .
The chances of finding survivors appears to be close to nil and authorities were treating the passenger list as a death toll .
NO DISTRESS SIGNAL
Three Brazilian air force Hercules planes took off from the islands of Fernando de Noronha , which sit about 370 km off the coast of South America , early on Tuesday to look for traces of the Airbus A330 , which is thought to have crashed in a storm on Monday .
The area is near where the last contact was made with the flight that took off for Paris from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night and went missing in storms about four hours later without sending any distress signal .
Brazil 's air force last had contact with the plane at 1.33 pm NZT on Monday when it was 565 km from Brazil 's coast .
The last automated signals were received at 2.13 pm NZT .
If no survivors are found , it would be the worst disaster in Air France 's 75 - year history and the deadliest since one of the company 's supersonic Concorde planes crashed in 2000 .
Air France flight 447 sent an automatic message reporting electrical faults before it went missing .
But aviation experts said they did not have enough information to understand how a modern plane with an excellent safety record and operated by three experienced pilots could have crashed .
" All scenarios have to be envisaged , " French Defence Minister Herve Morin said on Europe 1 radio .
" We can't rule out a terrorist act since terrorism is the main threat to Western democracies , but at this time we do n't have any element whatsoever indicating that such an act could have caused this accident , " Morin added .
The flight was carrying 216 passengers of 32 nationalities , including seven children and one baby .
Sixty - one were French citizens , 58 Brazilian and 26 German - there were no passengers from New Zealand .
Twelve crew members were also on board .
Senior French minister Jean - Louis Borloo said it was crucial to locate the black boxes , or flight recorders , which are programmed to emit signals for up to 30 days .
Distraught relatives of the flight 's passengers were assisted by teams of psychologists in Paris and Rio .
French electrical equipment firm CGED said 10 of its staff were on the missing plane with their partners after winning a trip to Brazil in the company 's annual sales contest .
An Air France spokesman said on Monday that a lightning strike could be to blame for the disaster .
But aviation experts said such strikes on planes were common and could not alone explain the downing of a modern aircraft .
Experts were baffled by the absence of any distress messages , either human or automatic , from the plane .
No mayday message was picked up , nor were any signals received from emergency beacons that should have transmitted automatically .
" It would be very unusual to have all the communications systems fail at once , " said David Gleave of Aviation Safety Investigations , an airport and air traffic control risk management consultancy based in Britain .
" That would tend to indicate that something catastrophic happened .
Morin said France had sent three jets , one AWACS or airborne warning and control system , as well as two naval vessels to search for the plane .
The United States agreed to help locate the crash site using satellite data .
Air France said the plane , which was powered with General Electric engines , went into service in April 2005 .
It last underwent maintenance in a hangar in April this year .

It ’s summer in the Northern hemisphere , and for many , that means going on holiday to warm , tropical locales .
And using air conditioning .
Lots of it .
In fact , in some tropical places , nearly 80 % of energy use in a hotel room is for air conditioning .
1200 to 2000 watts on average .
Evening Breeze is an interesting solution :
It ’s a canopy bed that has adjustments for both temperature and humidity , and delivers it quietly , overhead , using only 400 watts .
As it ’s focused just on the place where coolness is desired , there ’s no need to try and cool the whole room .
Simple , brilliant .
The resulting energy savings can mean 4MWh , $ 1000 and 2.5 tons of CO2 reduction annually .
[ social_buttons ]
Since windows and doors can now be left open since there ’s not a need for an air seal , this increases the indoor air quality , often an issue in just about any indoor location .
Further enhancing the environment , Evening Breeze has an air filter that removes 99.97 % of air particles .
Mosquito netting is included , to keep out what may come in with those open windows .
No joke , as dengue fever is a wide spread issue in much of the world .
Beyond the energy savings , Evening Breeze ’s makers took into consideration what goes in to making it and what goes into the atmosphere from their product .
All FSC certified wood for the frame , and R410A ( chlorine free , not damaging to the ozone ) coolant in the air conditioning , which as they put it “ allows a higher heat transfer ” as compared to conventional R22 coolant , making it further energy efficient .
From the looks of the site , Evening Breeze is early stage at this point .
How do they cost in comparison to other beds ?
A fairer comparison would be how it compares when factoring in annual energy / cost savings .
Readers :
What other simple , thoughtful , well designed ways to increase energy efficiency and sustainability in homes , hotels and other indoor structures are you interested in these days ?

* Shuttle launch scheduled for 5:40 a.m. EDT ( 0940 GMT )
* Fuel leak stymied first launch try
* Shuttle to deliver Japanese porch to space station
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla. , June 16 ( Reuters ) - Delayed by bad weather , NASA on Tuesday began filling space shuttle Endeavour 's fuel tank for launch , hoping to begin a key construction mission at the International Space Station .
Fueling was delayed nearly three hours by thunderstorms and lightning at the Florida launch site .
The shuttle is scheduled to lift off at 5:40 a.m. ( 0940 GMT ) on Wednesday .
With good weather forecast for the launch , NASA began filling the space shuttle 's fuel tank with 500,000 gallons ( 1.9 million litres ) of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen needed to power the ship 's three main engines during an 8 1/2 - minute climb to orbit .
Endeavour will deliver to the space station a porch that will be attached to the Japanese Kibo laboratory so that experiments can be exposed to the open space environment .
NASA had hoped to launch Endeavour last Saturday , but sensors detected dangerous levels of hydrogen gas escaping from a vent line and canceled the launch .
A similar problem stymied sister ship Discovery during a launch attempt in March .
Engineers have not determined the root cause of the problem .
The fix for Endeavour is the same procedure NASA implemented to launch Discovery -- replacing suspect seals .
NASA will know if the plan worked when the shuttle 's tank is full .
The vent line removes hydrogen that has turned from liquid to gas inside the shuttle 's fuel tank .
The gas is funneled to a flare stack away from the shuttle and safely incinerated .
Since hydrogen is so volatile , NASA has very tight safety restrictions on how much gas can be outside the shuttle .
NASA is expecting to have just one shot at launching Endeavour before the mission would be postponed to July .
The Eastern Test Range , which supports both shuttle and unmanned rocket launches from Kennedy Space Center and the adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , is planning to launch NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter between Thursday and Saturday .
The range can only support one type of rocket at a time and it takes about two days to reconfigure equipment for different launchers .
Launching Endeavour after Saturday is not an option because the angle of the sun would overheat the shuttle while it was docked at the space station .
The next launch opportunity is on July 11 .
NASA is trying to finish building and outfitting the space station by Sept. 30 , 2010 , so it can retire the shuttle fleet and move on to developing a new spaceship that can carry astronauts to the moon and other destinations beyond low - Earth orbit .
Eight missions remain to complete the station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 nations that has been under construction 225 miles ( 362 km ) above the planet for more than a decade .
The seven - member Endeavour crew will install the Japanese porch , replace batteries on one of the station 's solar wing panels and perform other maintenance tasks .
The mission , the third of five flights planned for this year , is scheduled to last 16 days .

Johnny Depp tips waiter $ 4,000
And yes , the waiter was terribly delighted over it .
I mean , who would n’t be anyway ?
Mohammed A. Sekhani , a veteran waiter in the exclusive steakhouse Gibson ’s in Chicago , said that Johnny Depp generously gave him $ 4,000 as tip .
Sekhani says that he’s had the pleasure of waiting on Depp himself before , and that Depp was very welcome in the restaurant .
Johnny Depp was at Gibson ’s right after the red carpet event of the movie Public Enemies from 11:30 pm all the way to 2:30 am the next day .
Depp reportedly spent around $ 4,400 in food and drinks that night .
Which makes his tip even the more outrageous .
I would n’t mind getting that amount for anything myself .
My favourite programming language Haskell has a nice library for doing calculations with probablility distributions , called probability .
The library was originally written by Martin Ewig and Steve Kollmansberger and then extended and packaged for convenient installation by Henning Thieleman .
Its main idea for the implementation is to use the fact that “ probability distributions form a monad ” ( from a paper by the authors of the library ) .
This post aims at translating this claim into standard probability notation and showing how it is used in the library .
Monad is a notion in category theory which is defined as a monoid in the category of endofunctors .
That sounds so cool that I really wish I knew what it means .
The only thing I know now is that the “ monoid ” here is not the standard monoid from mathematics founded on set theory , but rather its category theory analogue .
So what does the claim “ probability distributions form a monad ” mean Haskell - wise ?
Let ’s load the library and play with it .
Prelude >:m + Numeric .
Probability .Distribution
In the probability library distributions are ( essentially ) represented as lists of pairs ( element , probability ) .
There are a couple of functions defined that provide means of generating some often used distributions .
For example “ choose p a b ” will generate a distribution that assigns probability p to a value a and ( 1 - p ) to b .
Prelude Numeric.Probability .Distribution > choose 0.3 0 1 Loading package array - 0.1.0.0 ... linking ... done .
Loading package containers - 0.1.0.1 ... linking ... done .
Loading package mtl-1.1.0.0 ... linking ... done .
Loading package old - locale - 1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done .
Loading package old - time - 1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done .
Loading package random - 1.0.0.0 ... linking ... done .
Loading package probability - 0.2.1 ... linking ... done .
fromFreqs [ ( 1,0.7 ) , ( 0,0.3 ) ]
Another example is the function “ uniform ” that assigns the same probability to all elements of a list .
Prelude Numeric.Probability.Distribution > uniform [ 0,1,2,3 ] fromFreqs [ ( 0,0.25 ) , ( 1,0.25 ) , ( 2,0.25 ) , ( 3,0.25 ) ]
There is also a function “ certainly ” that constructs a point mass
Prelude Numeric.Probability .Distribution > certainly 5 fromFreqs [ ( 5,1 ) ]
Now what about that monad thing ?
Let ’s think about distributions on a given finite set as nonnegative functions that sum up to 1 and let be the set of such distributions .
So , we have .
Suppose now we have two finite sets .
We can define a binary operation that takes a distribution on and a function that assigns a distribution on to every element of , and creates a distribution on in a ( quite ) natural way :
for any and .
By taking the sum over all it is easy to check that is indeed a distribution on .
It can be interpreted as the distribution of the result of selecting first according to distribution and then selecting from the set according to the distribution given by .
We can use the “ ” ( corresponding to Haskell ’s “ >>= ” ) operation to construct joint distributions .
For example to generate o model of two coin tosses we can do
Prelude Numeric.Probability .Distribution > ( choose 0.5 0 1 ) >>= ( \x -> choose 0.5 ( x,0 ) ( x,1 ) ) from Freqs [ ( ( 0,0 ) ,0.25 ) , ( ( 0,1) ,0.25 ) , ( ( 1,0 ) ,0.25 ) , ( ( 1,1) ,0.25 ) ]
Now suppose we have three finite sets and corresponding operations in
and
that we will both denote .
Then for all , and we have the identity , where is defined as .
Note that if then is a distribution on and for .
Let ’s expand both sides to see that the identity really holds .
Fix .
We want to see that the values of the distributions and are the same on .
The left hand side evaluates to
and on the right hand side we have
.
So they are the same .
The fact that we have such quasi- associativity ( plus two other conditions that are trivial to check ) allows to claim that the type of distributions forms a monad .
In Haskell this opens up a whole world of possibilities .
There are hundreds of functions related to monads in Haskell libraries .
One can assume that each one does something useful when applied to probabilistic calculations and the only problem is to figure out what that useful thing is .
For example the function “ replicateM ” creates distributions of sequences of independent identically distributed random variables :
Prelude Numeric.Probability.Distribution > :m + Control .
Monad Prelude Numeric.Probability.Distribution Control .Monad > replicateM 4 ( choose 0.5 0 1 ) fromFreqs [ ( [ 0,0,0,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,0,0,1] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,0,1,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,0,1,1 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,1,0,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,1,0,1 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,1,1,0 ] , 6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 0,1,1,1] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,0,0,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,0,0,1] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,0,1,0 ] , 6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,0,1,1] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,1,0,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,1,0,1 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,1,1,0 ] ,6.25e - 2 ) , ( [ 1,1,1,1],6.25e - 2 ) ]
One can define a function that calculates the sequence of expectations of maximum of i.i.d random variables with common distribution as follows :
expmaxseq n d = [ D.expected $ D.map maximum $ replicateM k d | k <- [ 1..n ] ]
For throwing dice we get the following expectations of maximum for 1,2 , … , 7 dice :
ProbLib Numeric.Probability.Distribution > expmaxseq 7 ( uniform [ 1..6 ] ) [ 3.5,4.472222222222223,4.958333333333335,5.2445987654321105 , 5.4309413580246915,5.560292352536542,5.65411736969124 ]

Store first in Europe to pioneer green energy system where customers create 30 kWh an hour by driving over plates in car park
A supermarket chain will open its first " people - powered " store this week using technology that captures energy from vehicles to power its checkouts .
In a European first , Sainsbury 's will install the invention at its new store in Gloucester , opening this Wednesday .
Energy will be captured every time a vehicle drives over " kinetic road plates " in the car park and then channelled back into the store .
The kinetic road plates are expected to produce 30 kWh of green energy every hour — more than enough energy to power the store 's checkouts .
The system , pioneered for Sainsbury 's by Peter Hughes of Highway Energy Systems , does not affect the car or fuel efficiency , and drivers feel no disturbance as they drive over the plates .
Alison Austin , Sainsbury 's environment manager , said : " This is revolutionary .
Not only are we the first to use such cutting - edge technology with our shoppers , but customers can now play a very active role in helping make their local shop greener , without extra effort or cost .
" We want to continue offering great value but we also want to make the weekly shop sustainable .
Using amazing technology like this helps us reduce our use of carbon and makes Sainsbury 's a leading energy - efficient business . "
The kinetic road plates are one of a number of energy - saving measures at Sainsbury 's new store in Gloucester Quays , Gloucester .
The store will harvest rainwater to flush the store 's toilets and solar thermal panels will heat up to 100 % of the store 's hot water during the summer , and more than 90 % of the construction waste was re-used or recycled .
David Sheehan , director of store development and construction at Sainsbury 's , said : " The new environmental features within the Gloucester Quays store mark a very exciting time in store development .
We are able to use cutting - edge technology to improve our services and the store environment for our customers and colleagues , at the same time as ultimately reducing our carbon footprint across the UK . "
Scientists pointed out that the energy generated by the devices is not
totally " free " .
Rather , they capture a tiny amount from each car that
passes over them , increasing each vehicle 's fuel consumption by a tiny
amount .
First things , first , apologies for the lack of posting of late , which is due to a number of ongoing real life issues that I can’t discuss for the time being , but which I may be able to clear up in due course .
Now , having got that out of the way , let ’s get down to business … and the business for today is yet another piece of piss poor science / health journalism by the Independent :
Vinyl flooring ‘ doubles chances of children being autistic ’ , study shows Children who live in homes with vinyl flooring have double the chance of being autistic , research has discovered .
The finding – which amazed even the scientists conducting the study – provides one of the first clues as to a possible cause of the condition .
Shall we run down the checklist ?
Scary sounding and , for preference , incurable / untreatable / terminal ( delete as applicable ) but poorly understood illness / condition ( autism ) ?
Check !
Sympathetic ‘ victims ’ ( childrens ) ?
Check !
Common household item ( vinyl flooring ) ?
Check !
Meaningless statement of relative risk derived from a wholly speculative and unverified epidemiological correlation ( ‘ doubles chances ’ ) ?
Check !
Right , so this is all a load of bollocks ?
CHECK !
But do n’t just take my word for it , let ’s take a look at the rest of the article , by Geoffrey Keen and Nina Lakhani , and explain exactly how we arrive at that last conclusion , starting with …
The study , by scientists in Sweden , Denmark and the United States , stumbled across the connection almost by accident .
Well that ’s a bad sign for starters .
Yes , science is no less prone to throwing up its fair share of serendipitous accidental discoveries than another field of intellectual endeavour but for every such discovery ( electric current , radioactivity , pencillin ) there ’s are thousands of other unlooked for ‘ discoveries ’ that rapidly fall by the wayside and into well - deserved obscurity for the simple reasons that further investigation shows them to be complete and utter rubbish – and this is particularly true of apparent epidemiological ‘ discoveries ’ arising from post hoc analyses derived from data that was originally collated for an entirely different purpose .
This is precisly the situation we have here .
The main study , from which the data used in this paper was abstracted , was primarily concerned with an altogether different set of common childhood ailments and conditions :
The present paper describes the results of a study undertaken as part of a larger project devoted to the connection between properties of the indoor environment and asthma and allergy in young Swedish children .
The larger project , The Dampness in Buildings and Health ( DBH ) Study , began in the year 2000 with a questionnaire distributed to parents of all children 1 – 6 years of age in one Swedish county ( DBH - I ) .
So , we start with an asthma / allergies study and now , nine years down the line , we have an alleged ‘ connection ’ between autism and vinyl flooring with the researchers getting from A to B as follows :
The original survey collected information about the child , the family situation , practices such as smoking , allergic symptoms , type of residence , moisture - related problems , and type of flooring material , which included polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) .
The 2005 survey , based on the same children , now 6 – 8 years of age , also asked if , during the intervening period , the child had been diagnosed with Autism , Asperger ’s syndrome , or Tourette ’s syndrome .
There is a screamingly obvious problem with this particular methodology .
The main study was designed specifically to look for possible causes and contributory factors relating to asthma and allergies and , consequently , would have collated information relating to a range of factors that the researchers thought might be relevant to the study .
It also means that there ’s a wide range of other factors relating to the families included in the study which were excluded from consideration because they were thought not to be relevant to the study ’s main purpose any one ( or collection ) of which could also be correlated with the prevalence of autism found by the follow - up study AND also correlated with the prevalence of vinyl flooring .
That ’s one of key reasons why one cannot infer causation from correlation , because an apparent correlation between two factors may , quite easily , be the product of individual correlations between each of these two factors and third , unknown , factor ( factor X ) .
The classic example of a false assumption based on a ‘ factor X ’ correlation was the miasmatic theory of disease , which was popular from the Middle Ages right through to the 19th Century and which was , at one time , thought to explain why diseases such as cholera and the ‘ Black Death ’ were endemic in areas where the water supply was unfiltered , untreated and foul - smelling .
Ironically , the wholly mistaken belief that cholera was transmitted by ‘ bad air ’ did lead to improvements in public sanitation that did result in fewer outbreaks of cholera , all of which appeared to support the validity of the miasmatic theory and it was only when John Snow traced the cause of an outbreak of cholera in Soho ( in 1854 ) to the public water pump in Broad Street , that miasmatic theory was disproven .
Despite this very obvious problem with the articles headline assertions , the Indy goes on to add :
It is being taken seriously because autism has long been thought to result from environmental factors .
All of which completely misrepresents the current state of autism research .
As most people are , I think , perfectly aware , we do n’t know exactly what cause autism or even if there is a single common cause for the condition – increasingly the prevailing view of the condition is that its an extremely complex disorder in which its core aspects have distinct but co-occuring causes .
There is no single cause for autism , rather there are a number of complex , overlapping causes in which environmental factors may play some part , even if it well established that autism has a strong genetic component , one that is equally complex to the point where its not clear whether it occurs as a consequence of complex multi- gene interactions or due to rare mutations with major effects .
There is also a growing body of evidence linking the condition to ‘ de novo mutations ’ ( mutations found in the child that are not present in its parents ) which suggests that autism is heritable but not inherited , i.e. that what children may actually inherit from their parents is a genetic susceptibility to autism that may become active due to the influence of anything from environmental factors to simple random chance .
So , while there are many environmental factors that have been put forward as possible causes for autism ( including certain foods , infectious disease , heavy metals , solvents , diesel exhaust , PCBs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines and prenatal stress ) there is no solid evidence of causation for any of these candidates as yet and if de novo mutations are , indeed , part of the causal mechanism , no guarantees that eliminating any of the alleged causal factors will actually have any impact on the prevalence of the condition
Between 133,000 and 200,000 British children are thought to be autistic , but nobody knows for sure , or whether their numbers are increasing , because they are not counted .
But the numbers of babies born with the condition in California has risen more than seven times in the past two decades , convincing scientists that pollution must be to blame .
Convincing some scientists but not all , not be a long way and , again , the article woefully misrepresents the findings of a 1999 report by the California Healthy and Human Services Agency to support its already poor line of argument as the National Autistic Society point out in its own , excellent , overview of the existing evidence for the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders .
At present , it is not possible from the California study to draw any definite conclusions concerning the apparent rise in rates .
The author of the California report comes to the same conclusion .
The report emphasises the complexity of the problem and the need for properly designed research .
Quite … and please do read the NAS ’s article in full , it does provide a very good overview of both the current state of knowledge and understanding of the prevalence of the condition and the difficulties that arise when attempting to calculate accurate incidence / prevalence rates for autism and autistic spectrum disorder .
Skipping quick over the next bit , which give only a bit of basic factual information about the study …
The new research , which traced nearly 5,000 Swedish children from infancy to at least six years old , set out to investigate links between air pollution and asthma and other allergies .
The scientists – from Karlstad University in Sweden , the universities of Rochester and Texas in America , and the Technical University of Denmark – identified the type of flooring in each home at the start of the study , but only started to look at autism later .
… the articel goes on to state that :
Their paper , published in the journal Neurotoxicity , describes the findings as “ puzzling , even baffling , and not readily explicable at this time ” .
But it adds : “ Because they are among few clues that have emerged about possible environmental contributions to autistic disorders , we believe that they should be weighed carefully and warrant further study ” .
Oops – looks like its the sub - editor ’s day off .
The article does n’t appear in a journal called Neurotoxicity , in fact you ’ll be hard pushed to find such a journal as it does n’t exist and the actual journal it appears in is called Neurotoxicology , but having tracked down the abstract , what we find is not only that the researchers have been , as always ( and as the article notes , belatedly ) , much more circumspect in their conclusions but that vinyl flooring is only one of five factors where the study found an apparent correlation with the incidence of autism in the study group :
An analysis of the associations between indoor environmental variables in 2000 as well as other background factors and the ASD diagnosis indicated five statistically significant variables : ( 1 ) maternal smoking ; ( 2 ) male sex ; ( 3 ) economic problems in the family ; ( 4 ) condensation on windows , a proxy for low ventilation rate in the home ; ( 5 ) PVC flooring , especially in the parents ’ bedroom .
In addition , airway symptoms of wheezing and physician - diagnosed asthma in the baseline investigation ( 2000 ) were associated with ASD 5 years later .
So , in theory , the article could have been headed up as “ Maternal smoking ‘ doubles chances of autism ’ , say study ” , or maleness , poverty or even poor ventilation and condensation , but it does n’t because all this is leading up to a specific point … this :
A possible explanation , they suggest , is that vinyl , or PVC , flooring produces dust full of phthalates , which are then breathed in .
Experts who have reviewed the study believe that , if this is the cause , the children may have been most vulnerable when their brains were developing in the womb .
That ’s a big if there and all the more so for having tracked down the researchers previous study on phthalates and asthma , which was found to be subject to an important limitation , the data on exposure to phthalates was too imprecise to draw any kind of solid conclusions from the study .
Nevertheless , it seems that phthalates , a plasticising agent used to increase the flexibility of plastics , are set to become the ‘ next big thing ’ in ‘ environmental ’ autism scare stories , with this latest paper following closely on heels of an epidemiological study by researchers at UC Davis , which revisited and updates the statistical data used in the 1999 California prevalence study and claims to show a substantial real increase in the prevalence of autism in the state , although its not clear from the abstract alone whether this paper has adequately addressed the methodological issues that the National Autistic Society highlighted in their article ( linked earlier ) .
It may well be that the researchers , here , have hit upon an interesting line of future enquiry but , and its a very big but that the Indy have chosen to ignore , its far too early to say whether this will lead anywhere in particular or prove to be yet another blind alley .
Other than the two papers already linked in this article I can find only two other research papers on PubMed which reference both phthalates and autism , a 2004 animal study ( using rats ) which looked at the possible connection to motor hyperactivity in autism and ADHD and a new study , published in January this year , which postulates that a transient thyroxine deficiency in pregnancy might be a causal factor for autism .
This last , and seeningly new , hypothesis has yet to be tested but , if the abstract is anything to go by , could well lead , in the fullness of time , to a rich vein of autism scare stories relating to what are , otherwise , very humble and mundane vegetables of the brassica family ( cabbage , cauliflower , broccoli , etc. ) all of which contain natural chemicals ( goitrogens ) which suppress the function of the thyroid gland .
But that ’s almost certainly part of the appeal , to press , of this kind of story , as the articles final paragraph hints …
If this is so , the threat may come from more than just vinyl flooring .
Californian research has also found high levels of the chemicals in wall - to - wall carpeting .
Quite – and if one does nothing more than consult Wikipedia , one also finds that …
Phthalates are used in a large variety of products , from enteric coatings of pharmaceutical pills to viscosity control agents , gelling agents , film formers , stabilizers , dispersants , lubricants , binders , emulsifying agents , and suspending agents .
End applications include adhesives and glues , agricultural adjuvants , building materials , personal care products , detergents and surfactants , plastic objects , paints , printing inks and coatings , pharmaceuticals , food products and textiles .
Phthalates are also frequently used in soft plastic fishing lures , nail polish , adhesives , caulk , paint pigments , and sex toys made of so - called “ jelly rubber . ”
Phthalates are used in a variety of household applications ( shower curtains , adhesives , perfume ) , modern electronics and medical applications such as catheters .
The most widely - used phthalates are the di-2 - ethyl hexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , the diisodecyl phthalate ( DIDP ) and the diisononyl phthalate ( DINP ) .
DEHP is the dominant plasticizer used in PVC , due to its low cost .
Benzylbutylphthalate ( BBzP ) is used in the manufacture of foamed PVC , which is mostly used as a flooring material .
Phthalates with small R and R’ groups are used as solvents in perfumes and pesticides .
Phthalates are pretty much everywhere in any modern work or home setting , all of which makes this story perfect fodder for the jobbing but terminally lazy journalist – its one of those gift stories that just keeps on giving because there ’s always going to be another scare story just around the corner … just pick a product off what is an already very long list and run the same basic story over , and over , and over , and over …
Bags I get the ‘ Jelly Dildos Cause Autism ’ headline .
Most of the time the brain works as it ought to : limbs move , memories are retrieved and experiences processed .
But occasionally things go awry .
In tip - of - the - tongue experiences , for instance , words suddenly and perplexingly go missing only to reappear seconds or minutes later .
Another brain quirk – déjà vu – confirms the fallibility of memory .
Now two new studies have shed light on both phenomena .
Nearly everyone has tip - of - the - tongue moments , but bilinguals seem especially prone to these momentary lapses in vocabulary , says Jennie Pyers , a psychologist at Wellesley College in Massachusetts .
One possible explanation is that similar - sounding words compete for our brain ’s attention .
Since bilinguals know twice as many words as monolinguals , there ’s more chance for tip - of - the - tongue experiences .
Advertisement
“ Often when we ’re having tip - of - the - tongue experiences , words that sound the same come to mind , ” Pyers says .
“ There ’s a sense that you do know the first letter ; there ’s a sense that you might know how many syllables it is . ”
Alternatively , they could occur when our brains recall rarely used words , Pyers says .
“ It ’s much easier to retrieve a word like ‘ knife ’ than ‘ guillotine ’ . ”
It ’s a… , it ’s a …
Since bilinguals , by definition , speak two languages , they are bound to use many individual words less frequently than monolinguals .
In hopes of narrowing down these explanations , Pyers ’ team compared 11 Spanish - English bilinguals with 22 people who used English and American sign language ( ASL ) .
Since the signers ’ second “ tongue ” makes no use of sound , there is no opportunity for sound - alike words to elicit tip - of - the - tongue experiences , says Pyers , who is fluent in ASL .
To provoke tip - of - the - tongue moments , the researchers showed the bilinguals , as well as a control group of 22 English monolinguals , pictures of dozens of different objects and challenged the volunteers to name them in 30 seconds .
The viewed objects – which included axes , weathervanes , gyroscopes , nooses and metronomes – were obscure enough to elicit tip - of - the - tongue experiences in all but one participant .
Rarity is key
As with previous experiments , monolinguals had fewer tip - of - the - tongue experiences than bilinguals , about 7 words versus 12 , out of a total of 52 – though Pyers ’ team counted only instances where the volunteer knew the word .
However , Spanish bilinguals experienced roughly the same number of tip - of - the - tongues as sign language bilinguals .
This rules out the possibility that similar - sounding words compete for our brain ’s attention in tip - of - the - tongue experiences .
More likely , tip - of - the - tongue experiences occur when we ’re trying to recall rarely used words , Pyers says .
“ People often have tip of the tongue experiences for proper names , again because we do n’t use them very frequently , ” she adds .
Seconds later during an interview with New Scientist , Pyers struggled briefly to recall the name of a colleague .
“ I can picture this guy in my head , ” she said .
Brief exposure
It may be relatively easy to generate these moments in the lab or in conversation , but another common mental quirk , déjà vu , has been much harder to recreate and study , says Alan Brown , a psychologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas , who studies both phenomena .
“ The fascinating thing about déjà vu is that it is so complex and amorphous , ” he says .
“ How do we unpack that and try to push that experience in sort of more circumscribed ways in the lab . ”
See our feature : Déjà vu :
Where fact meets fantasy
One of several theories to explain déjà vu suggests that these moments are triggered by a conscious recognition of a visual cue that we processed subconsciously moments before .
Teaser image
To trigger this effect in the laboratory , Brown showed volunteers a cryptic pattern on a computer screen followed by an unfamiliar symbol and then the question : “ Have you ever encountered this symbol prior to the study ? ”
On some occasions , the same symbol had appeared for 35 milliseconds behind the cryptic pattern – too briefly to be consciously observed .
On others , this “ teaser ” symbol was different from the one that would follow and , in some trials , no teaser appeared .
“ What we wanted to do was make something where you could attribute a familiar experience to something prior to the study … not just a minute or two ago , but a day or two months , ” Brown says .
After going through 144 such tests each , two dozen university students said they had seen the symbol before the experiment 22 per cent of the time when an identical teaser had preceded the symbol .
With a different teaser or none at all , volunteers said they had previously seen less than a tenth of the symbols .
Uncommon experience
Moreover , in a post - experiment debriefing , 80 per cent of volunteers said they were confused about whether they had seen a symbol before , and half said they had a déjà vu experience in the lab .
Most volunteers claimed they normally experience déjà vu twice a year or less .
“ We really were n’t expecting someone to have that ‘ whoa ’ experience , because we ’re not recreating all the pieces , ” Brown says .
Genuine déjà vu experiences often incorporate sound and emotions .
In hopes of creating – and manipulating – more realistic episodes in the laboratory , Brown plans next to use virtual reality to create an even more immersive environment .

I attended an excellent Erlang workshop presented by Martin Logan Friday morning at the Flourish conference hosted by UIC , my alma mater .
Martin is a great presenter who is a lead developer of the Erlware open source project as well as an author of an upcoming Erlang book .
I recorded parts of the workshop using the Flip Mino HD .
If you missed this event you might want to check the upcoming Erlang Factory conference where Martin will be presenting again .
Otherwise , check out the videos at the end of this post .
There was a great turnout at this event .
Is it worth your while to learn a new language with such a strange syntax ?
IMHO , it certainly is !
I was first convinced after reading The End Of The Free Lunch which explains the paradigm shift in processor design from higher speed to multi-core and the subsequent need for concurrency oriented programming .
I continued to read up on concurrency oriented languages and the Actor model , and I found out about all the fuss about Erlang .
I have had far too much experience with Java applications that crash under load due to concurrency issues related to the Java shared memory model , so Erlang really piqued my interest .
It was pretty easy for me to commit to Erlang / OTP for new distributed services middleware when I worked at Orbitz Worldwide , especially since Martin is employed there as a Technical Manager .
He mentored a very small team of developers who wrote an awesome RESTful web services reverse proxy using Erlang / OTP .
It provides for robust and fault tolerant service registration , request routing and monitoring in only a few hundred lines of code .
Congrats to the team at Orbitz for recently deploying this app to production !
I plan to apply the same design for Sears Holdings ’ Online Division as we continue to build out our platform . 😉
I have a couple more videos that I ’ll upload later .
p.s. We ’re hiring !

Everyone follows some sort of a moral code , even atheists .
Jews have the Old Testament or the Talmud .
Christians have the New Testament or the Bible .
Other religions have their particular holy books .
Non-religious people subscribe to natural law , the Golden Rule , altruism , or some other ism .
Every moral code shares some basic similarities : it is wrong to lie , cheat , steal , rape , murder — and torture .
The current debate over the morality of the U.S. government engaging in torture has revealed many Americans who profess to adhere to a moral code to be hypocrites .
Now we are being told that , because the end ( saving American lives ) justifies the means ( torture ) , the use of torture is justified under certain circumstances .
Christians especially are being hypocritical since they have historically condemned situation ethics and the decline of moral absolutes .
They are also cautioned in the New Testament not to do evil that good may come ( Romans 3:8 ) .
What some Americans are now advocating is the torture of suspected terrorists held in Guantánamo and other prisons .
Real terrorists , like foreigners Ramzi Yousef and Zacarias Moussaoui and American José Padilla , have been charged for their crimes , convicted in federal court , and are currently incarcerated in U.S. prisons .
Let us assume for the sake of argument that terrorists are those that fight against a U.S. invasion of their country and not vice versa , that men held in places like Guantánamo are really suspected terrorists and are not there merely because they were wrongly picked up by bounty hunters paid by the U.S. government , and that torture does in fact result in valuable information being revealed that could prevent a terrorist attack and save American lives .
If it is morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives , then :
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist who is a child in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist who is a woman in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Is it morally permissible to torture by any means a suspected terrorist in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist even if it results in his permanent disability in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist even if it results in his death in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Is it morally permissible to do any of the above if it may save just one American life ?
If not , then why not ?
I am afraid that many American torture advocates would not have a problem with any of the above , even if it might only save just one American life .
But if the goal is possibly saving American lives , then what about torturing American citizens who might know about American lives being in jeopardy ?
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspected terrorist who is an American in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
What about American woman and children ?
Are all means of torture acceptable or are there certain forms of torture that are only reserved for foreigners ?
What if the suspected American terrorist becomes disabled or dies as a result of the torture ?
Again , if the goal is possibly saving American lives , then what about torturing American citizens who are not suspected terrorists but might know about American lives being in jeopardy ?
Is it morally permissible to torture a suspect in police custody in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
But what if the suspect is a woman or a child ?
And may any form of torture be used or are there certain forms of torture that are off limits for suspects in police custody ?
What if the suspect in police custody becomes disabled or dies as a result of the torture ?
But why stop with suspects in police custody .
I mean , if the goal is possibly saving American lives , then what about torturing Americans in their homes who might know about American lives being in jeopardy ?
And what about travelling overseas to torture foreigners in their homes ?
Is it morally permissible to torture anyone anywhere in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives ?
If not , then why not ?
Just think about the potential benefits of torture for local law enforcement .
Drug users could be tortured until they reveal the names of their dealers .
Serial killers could be tortured until they reveal where they buried their dead bodies .
Pedophiles could be tortured until they reveal the names of the children they have victimized .
Burglars could be tortured until they reveal the addresses they have burglarized .
Rapists could be tortured until they reveal the names of all the women they have violated .
College students could be tortured until they reveal the names of those who illegally supplied them with booze .
Reporters could be tortured until they reveal the names of their sources .
Hey , if we torture enough people , we can get a confession for every unsolved crime in the world .
The trump card of conservative torture advocates like Thomas Sowell is always an emotionally - charged reference to one ’s family :
What if it was your mother or your child who was tied up somewhere beside a ticking time bomb and you had captured a terrorist who knew where that was ?
Face it :
What you would do to that terrorist to make him talk would make water - boarding look like a picnic .
In such a highly emotional and personal situation , it ’s difficult to know with certainty how someone would react .
Face it :
If someone thought that their loved ones were in imminent danger of death , and they thought that the only way to save them was by torturing someone , he might be willing to torture a terrorist , a terrorist ’s mother , a terrorist ’s child , or even you , your mother , or your child .
But is this the right thing to do ?
And is this how U.S. foreign policy should be conducted ?
I do n’t think that many Americans who say that torture is justified under certain circumstances if it may save American lives really believe what they are saying .
If you really want to get a terrorist to talk , there are ways to do it without laying a finger on him .
Here is one :
Take his wife and son and , in front of him , rape her , crush the boy ’s testicles , and sodomize them both .
That will get him talking more than anything you could ever do to him .
If the end is gaining information that may save American lives , then why not ?
Now , except for some red-state conservative fascists and a few bloodthirsty Christian warmongers , I think that most Americans would n’t go this far .
But if you believe in torture in an attempt to gain information that may save American lives , where do you draw the line ?
Once you establish a “ ticking time bomb ” exception , every situation ends up becoming a ticking time bomb scenario .
And how credible is information obtained via torture ?
Face it : Just as someone might be willing to torture anyone and everyone if they thought the lives of their loved ones were in imminent danger , so anyone and everyone undergoing torture might be willing to admit to anything to get the torture to stop .
If we took a chainsaw to Dick Cheney , he would confess to all sorts of crimes that the Bush administration did n’t even commit .
Even the U.S. Army ’s 2006 field manual on interrogation says about torture :
Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results , may damage subsequent collection efforts , and can induce the source to say what he thinks the HUMINT [ Human Intelligence ] collector wants to hear .
Use of torture can also have many possible negative consequences at national and international levels .
But even if credible information could be obtained through torture , it is still immoral , barbaric , and un-American .
Seldom heard in the torture debate is why people became terrorists in the first place .
A recent article by James Payne , “ What Do the Terrorists Want , ” shows that , contrary to neoconservative warmongers like David Frum and Richard Perle , terrorists espouse neither an ideology of conquest like the Nazi Germany and Soviets Russia nor a desire to impose on the whole world its religion and law .
The majority of Osama bin Laden ’s venom is directed at the West for aggression , oppression , and exploitation of Muslim lands and peoples , not because he , like President Bush driveled , “ hates our freedoms . ”

Rather than saving American lives , the torture of Muslim prisoners serves as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist organizations .
Yes , the crimes of terrorists are many .
But why give them reasons to commit more of them ?
“ If we forfeit our values by signaling that they are negotiable in situations of grave or imminent danger , we drive those undecideds into the arms of the enemy , ” says former commandant of the Marine Corps Charles C. Krulak .
It is proponents of torture that are n’t concerned about American lives .
If they were then they would n’t support the senseless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have resulted in almost 5,000 American soldiers dying for a lie .
Who are the true patriots ?
Who are the real Americans ?
Those who defend foreign wars that send thousands of Americans to their deaths , create terrorists where there were none , and increase the hatred of foreigners toward the United States or those who want to end the U.S. foreign policy of intervening in the affairs of other countries , dismantle the Holy American Empire , and bring all U.S. troops home to stay ?

The early media messaging about Dr. Tiller seems determined to paint him as " that polarizing , controversial abortion doctor , " nothing more .
I did not have the honor of meeting Dr. Tiller , but I greatly admired his clinic .
In all the conversations I 've had with colleagues and staff , everyone keeps coming back to Dr. Tiller 's kindness , his generosity and spirituality .
They recalled hearing him talk about really listening to women 's stories , about the importance of ritual for families who are grieving .
In honor of his life , let 's not reduce his career or women 's stories to caricature .
One site which allows patients to share their complex experiences is Kansas Stories .
These stories primarily focus on situations of fetal anamoly .
These are average women .
Dr. Tiller could have been your sister 's doctor .
Your wife 's doctor .
These are not " culture warriors , " this is your math teacher , your girl scout leader , your best friend .
As one woman writes :
The reality is that abortion in the late second and third trimesters is extremely rare .
The reality is that finding a doctor to do this procedure in the late second or third trimester is almost impossible .
For me , the reality was that at the most painful time of my life I had to travel out of state , stay in a hotel room and face hostile protesters in order to carry out this most personal of choices .

If one were to name the most intriguing recent development in America ’s religious life , it would have to be the unprecedented rise of disbelief , or what many have dubbed “ the New Atheism . ”
The tendency in the media has been either to hail this phenomenon as the latest cultural fad or to dismiss it as a secular equivalent of religious fundamentalism .
In reality , it is neither of these .
The New Atheism is a complex movement that has the potential both to inspire positive change and , sometimes , to promote intolerance .
The New Atheism ’s Positive Contributions
At their best , the New Atheists foster a renewed sense of respect for science , spur on social progress , and empower the growing but reviled nontheistic minority to find its voice in America ’s public square .
Public support for science is notoriously low in the United States , especially when it comes to culturally controversial topics such as the origin of life and humanity , embryonic stem - cell research , and global climate change .
Unlike most developed nations , where the theory of evolution enjoys wide support , only 4 in 10 Americans accept the scientific account of human origins , according to a recent Gallup poll .
At this difficult time for science education in America — as it faces the ire of religious fundamentalists and its message gets distorted by promoters of quackery of all kinds — atheists and agnostics remain science ’s staunchest allies .
Most of America ’s elite scientists hold no religious beliefs , compared to only a fraction of the general population .
Regardless of what one thinks of Richard Dawkins ’ take on religion , few individuals have done more to raise awareness of the importance of science .
A former Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford , Dawkins exemplifies the best in science writing for a popular audience .
His books , most notably The Selfish Gene , The Blind Watchmaker , and Climbing Mount Improbable , combine clarity with passion to explain the evolutionary process in terms that make it both intriguing and accessible .
Dawkins ’ success as a science writer stems as much from his expertise in biology and literary talent as from his refusal to confine science to the realm of dry facts .
He approaches science poetically , demonstrating that it can enrich our lives and aid us in a search for meaning and purpose .
“ The world and the universe is an extremely beautiful place , and the more we understand about it the more beautiful does it appear , ” Dawkins explains .
It is this belief in the power of science to open our eyes to the awe - inspiring splendor and mystery of the Cosmos and its contents that drives Dawkins ’ passion for evolutionary biology and his criticism of religion .
As he puts it , “ I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world . ”
Certainly , atheists like Dawkins , Stephen Hawking , and the late Carl Sagan do not hold a monopoly on science education .
Religious believers , too , can represent science with integrity and success .
Geneticist Francis Collins and biologist Ken Miller are the most prominent examples of how one can be passionate about both science and faith .
And yet , atheists seem to have a special affinity for science , perhaps because in the absence of God and divine revelation they see it as our only source of objective knowledge and the only hope we have of surviving and flourishing in an indifferent and often hostile world .
Related to the New Atheists ’ support for scientific progress is their advocacy of progressive values .
The social and political implications of the New Atheism are often overlooked because disbelief does not presuppose a particular political ideology .
Even among the so - called “ four horsemen ” of the New Atheism ( Dawkins , journalist Christopher Hitchens , author Sam Harris , and philosopher Daniel Dennett ) , there is little consensus on social and political matters .
Hitchens in particular tends to embrace political views that are unpopular within the atheist camp .
A consistent supporter of the Iraq War , he has expressed opposition to physician - assisted suicide and some hesitation in regard to women ’s reproductive rights .
On the whole , however , atheists are among the most liberal segments of the U.S. population , and their spokespersons often advocate progressive values along with a naturalistic worldview .
In last year ’s massive U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reported that only 14 % of atheists and 15 % of agnostics self - identified as politically conservative , compared to the national average of 37 % .
In contrast , 50 % of atheists described themselves as liberal , a percentage matched only by Unitarians and Buddhists .
More than any other group , atheists and agnostics tended to express support for gay rights , a woman ’s right to choose , stricter environmental regulations , and less government interference in promoting morality .
Of course , American nonbelievers are also the strongest supporters of the separation of church and state .
All of these positions frequently find reflection in the New Atheist books , documentaries , and blogs .
The truth is that a progressive president and a progressive political agenda would not be possible in the United States without the votes of the relatively small but fast - growing secular minority .
In the 2008 presidential election , unaffiliated Americans accounted for 12 % of the electorate ( up 3 % since 2000 ) , and they voted for Barack Obama by a three - to - one margin , giving him the edge over John McCain .
The only two groups that gave Obama more support were black Protestants and Jews .
In a situation when mainline Protestant denominations experience a decline , nonbelievers are becoming a major constituency in progressive politics , and their role is likely to increase in the years to come .
One further contribution of the New Atheists is that for the first time in American history , disbelief has become a legitimate cultural alternative .
Ironically , it took a devout president , George W. Bush , to galvanize American nonbelievers and turn atheist manifestos into national bestsellers .
When President Obama acknowledged nonbelievers in his inaugural address , he recognized a group of people who had previously been invisible in American politics .
Of course atheists remain a distrusted and despised minority , and it will take time for politicians to begin to acknowledge personal disbelief publicly , but for the first time , led by a group of articulate spokespersons , nonbelievers seem to have found their identity and public voice .
This cultural development should be celebrated by all progressives , regardless of their religious affiliation or lack of belief .
The Dark Side of the New Atheism
But there is a dark side to the New Atheism , too .
Although they put a premium on critical thinking , atheist authors often forget to apply it in their critique of religion .
Not satisfied with refuting arguments for God ’s existence , they unfairly present religion as at best useless and at worst deadly .
One of the arguments Dawkins , Dennett , and Hitchens make , for instance , is that one need not be religious to be a moral person .
They like to point to the evolutionary origins of our moral sense — or as Dawkins puts it : “ the lust to be good ” — in order to claim that morality precedes religion and does not require it .
While plausible , this argument does not prove that religion has no effect on morality .
In fact , study after study has shown that deeply religious people tend to give substantially more to charity and to volunteer more often than their nonreligious counterparts .
Regardless of the reason for this trend , it seems obvious that something about religious communities and worship encourages individuals to love their neighbor , to share resources , and to be involved in the community .
Whether atheists like it or not , religion does have an ability to inspire remarkable acts of kindness and generosity , and usually it does so not by scaring people with hellfire , but by appealing to their highest ideals of love , compassion , and justice .
Sadly , one would be hard - pressed to find any mention of the positive effects of religion in atheist literature .
After reading Dawkins ’ The God Delusion or Hitchens ’ God Is Not Great , one comes away thinking that religion literally “ poisons everything , ” as the subtitle to Hitchens ’ book argues , and is “ the root of all evil , ” a title of Dawkins ’ 2006 documentary .
There is nothing wrong with intellectual squabbles over God ’s existence , but it ’s at this point that the New Atheism crosses the line and undermines its own effort to promote critical thinking .
The problem with an exclusively negative approach to religion is twofold .
First , while it helps sell books , it risks promoting intolerance and potentially even hatred of religious people .
Atheists will point out that they do not fly planes into buildings or murder doctors , as some religious fundamentalists have done .
However , it takes one visit to an atheist blog ( e.g. , RichardDawkins. net or Pharyngula ) to learn that many commenters on these sites harbor deep resentments toward religious people , Christians in particular .
Atheist authors and bloggers have an obligation to take precautions against expressions of intolerance ; but more importantly , they need to lead by example in drawing a clear distinction between a much - needed intellectual debate over life ’s biggest questions and harmful attacks on persons who happen to hold a religious worldview .
Atheists do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past .
Having witnessed the atrocities committed by twentieth - century godless regimes , the New Atheists should be at the forefront of advocating freedom of conscience and religious liberty for everyone .
A related problem is that the New Atheist approach to religion burns bridges that could otherwise help further the progressive cause .
When atheists criticize religion , they usually focus on the excesses of fundamentalist churches : their intolerant attitudes , extremist behavior , a literalist interpretation of scripture , bizarre eschatological beliefs , and so on .
One would think that atheists would find an ally in religious progressives , most of whom equally dislike fundamentalist positions .
Unfortunately , that is not always the case .
Sam Harris in particular has accused religious progressives of being part of the problem by not speaking out harshly enough against the conservatives , and thus legitimating fundamentalist perspectives .
I think Harris ’ criticism is misguided .
Religion Dispatches is a perfect example of a progressive media outlet that challenges the fundamentalist vision of both religion and society .
In fact , religious progressivism , far from being the problem , may be the most effective antidote to the dangers of fundamentalism .
The answer to radical Islam , for instance , is not atheism , but moderate Islam .
Perhaps the real reason behind Harris ’ criticism of religious progressives is that they expose the weakness of atheist arguments against religion .
Militant disbelief depends on the excesses of fundamentalists to sustain strong anti-religious sentiment .
Progressive believers , on the other hand , demonstrate that faith and reason can coexist peacefully in modern societies ; that is something the New Atheists do not want to admit , as it denies them the moral high ground and turns their case against God into an intellectual argument with little social or political significance .
Instead of attacking religious progressives , the New Atheists should seek ways to cooperate with them in order to advance science , reason , and progressive values .
One can cite numerous examples of fruitful cooperation .
When science education was under attack in Dover , Pennsylvania , Ken Miller ( a devout Catholic ) provided key expert testimony in support of evolutionary theory , helping the scientific community win an important legal battle against proponents of Intelligent Design .
The famous entomologist and humanist E.O. Wilson , in an effort to raise awareness of the dangers facing Earth ’s biodiversity , composed a passionate book entitled The Creation : An Appeal to Save Life on Earth , in which he called on religious believers to take active part in protecting the environment .
In both cases , dialogue and cooperation between believers and nonbelievers has helped advance the cause of science and social progress .
This type of cooperation is the only way forward , and the New Atheists would be wise to embrace it .
Abstract
We present a principled methodology for filtering news stories by formal measures of information novelty , and show how the techniques can be used to custom - tailor newsfeeds based on information that a user has already reviewed .
We review methods for analyzing novelty and then describe Newsjunkie , a system that personalizes news for users by identifying the novelty of stories in the context of stories they have already reviewed .
Newsjunkie employs novelty - analysis algorithms that represent articles as words and named entities .
The algorithms analyze inter- and intra- document dynamics by considering how information evolves over time from article to article , as well as within individual articles .
We review the results of a user study undertaken to gauge the value of the approach over legacy time - based review of newsfeeds , and also to compare the performance of alternate distance metrics that are used to estimate the dissimilarity between candidate new articles and sets of previously reviewed articles .
Even so , in some traditional Swiss restaurants , well - known bankers have been booed out of the house ; one brasserie even turned away an illustrious banker client .
While he was chairman of the board at UBS , Marcel Ospel dined regularly on Wednesday evenings at his favorite restaurant , the Kronenhalle , an old brasserie near the opera house where paintings by Matisse , Picasso and Miró adorn the walls .
Yet last year , after Mr. Ospel announced that UBS had lost more than $ 19 billion , the Kronenhalle made him feel he was persona non grata , according to Swiss news media reports .
Only recently has he begun to visit the restaurant again .
But the restaurants that are not turning the bankers away are the Italians , which have displaced the Chinese as the largest group of restaurants in the city that do not serve up Swiss dishes .
Asked where he eats when he goes out , Mr. Roth of the Bankers Association replied , “ If I ’m with clients , I go to local restaurants around the office ; if I ’m alone and just want to relax , I go to Il Giglio . ”
Mr. Giglio , for one , is not mystified by the bankers ’ sudden taste for Italian cuisine .
Like another Italian specialty , it is soothing , he said : “ Like the music of a tenor .
For lots of music has been written for tenors ; for Caruso , Pavarotti . ”
And yet , on a recent evening when a banker and a lawyer were complaining loudly over their pasta about their banking losses , Mr. Giglio said , a diner at a neighboring table leaped to his feet and loudly upbraided them .
“ He told them it was not they , the bankers , who were losing money ; it was paupers like him , ” he said .
“ Giglio ’s is a place you can go to in good times and bad , ” said Jan A. Bielinski , 55 , of Bank Julius Bar , an exclusive private bank just off the Bahnhofstrasse .
“ The mood has changed , ” he said over coffee .
“ The moods change when the market changes , and a bad market influences everybody . ”
Mr. Müller of Bindella agrees with Mr. Giglio about the soothing factor in Italian food .
Leisurely dining is fading in Switzerland , he said , where life is increasingly rushed .
“ Here you have the feeling of being on vacation , ” he said , picking at calamari and polenta at the Café Terrasse , one of his group ’s newest restaurants , in a hall that once housed a striptease club .
Since its discovery in 2004 , the carbon - based material known as graphene has revealed a stream of attractive properties .
Now , researchers in the US have shown that a two - layer version can deliver yet another : a wide , tunable bandgap .
The discovery paves the way for new electronic devices , from lasers that change colour to electronic circuits that rearrange themselves .
Graphene is a sheet of carbon just one atom thick , with a structure that resembles chicken wire .
Single sheets of the material have proved to have record - breaking strength , high conductivity and high transparency .
But recently some scientists have come to suspect that the most interesting properties might arise in two parallel sheets , or so - called bilayer graphene .
Feng Wang and others at the University of California at Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have investigated the properties of bilayer graphene when it is performing within a field - effect transistor .
Such transistors work using an electric field to control a semiconductor ’s conductivity , which in turn controls charge flow .
In Wang and colleagues ’ device , however , there is a segment of bilayer graphene sandwiched between the transistor ’s ’ source ’ and ’ drain ’ electrodes , and the electric field serves to pull apart the graphene ’s highest valence band and the lowest conduction band .
To witness this effect , the researchers used infrared microscopy and monitored the absorption spectrum .
Peaks in the spectrum revealed the crucial bandgap , which the electric field could tune from zero to over 250 meV .
Wang told Chemistry World that the tunable bandgap , which generally determines a material ’s transport and optical properties , will enable ’ flexibility and optimisation ’ of electronics and photonics .
He says it could be used to control the colour emitted from lasers and other light sources .
Moreover , because it can make insulators turn into semiconductors , and vice versa , he believes it might lead to electronic circuits that can be programmed in the field .
Yu -Ming Lin , a graphene scientist at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in New York , said the wide bandgap in bilayer graphene will allow the creation of high - speed digital switches .
’ I think this paper is very interesting and the results are definitely important to the field , ’ he added .
However , Antonio Castro - Neto , a researcher at Boston University who has also studied tunable bandgaps in bilayer graphene , thinks there is still much more to be learned .
He notes that bilayer graphene ’s density of states -- that is , the number of energy states available for occupation -- is finite , which indicates there should be complex , many - body effects .
’ These systems may be able to show magnetic or superconducting properties that have not been explored yet , ’ he said .

Is the Israel Lobby getting weaker ?
Several people have recently asked me if the Obama administration ’s tough line towards Israel ’s settlements and its insistence on a two - state solution invalidates the arguments that John Mearsheimer and I made about the political influence of the “ Israel lobby . ”
Not surprisingly , a few critics have made similar points in print .
For what it ’s worth , I think Obama ’s approach is largely consistent with the views we set forth in the book , and certainly with our overall aim in writing it .
To review : in our book we argued that U.S. Middle East policy in recent decades has been strongly influenced by a loose coalition of individuals and groups which we termed the “ Israel lobby . ”
We pointed out that the lobby did not “ control ” U.S. Middle East policy ( though it was a powerful influence ) , and we emphasized that the various groups that made up this loose coalition did n’t agree on everything ( such as the merits of a two - state solution ) .
All of them have sought to encourage a “ special relationship ” between the U.S. and Israel , however , and all to maintain nearly - unconditional U.S. support .
Absent their influence , we argued , U.S. policy in the region would be substantially ( though not entirely ) different .
Like plenty of other interest groups in the United States , the Israel lobby worked in legitimate ways within the American political system and successfully acted to shape public discourse about Israel in ways they believed would reinforce the special relationship .
As a result , the entire subject had become something of a taboo issue , especially for anyone seeking a prominent career in American politics or in the U.S. foreign policy establishment .
Finally , we saw this situation as increasingly harmful to U.S. and Israeli interests alike , and argued that a more normal relationship would be better for both countries .
In particular , we hoped that a more open discussion of these issues would lead to a revision in U.S. policy , and that more moderate and sensible groups within the “ pro-Israel ” community would become more influential .
We even expressed the hope that the more hardline groups might reconsider their policy positions .
In short , our main concern was not the existence of a powerful pro-Israel lobby ; it was the fact that the most influential groups within that “ loose coalition ” were advocating policies that were harmful to the U.S. and Israel alike .
This basic portrait of the lobby ’s activities and influence fit the historical record up through the 2008 Presidential election .
What has happened since ?
After pandering to the lobby during the campaign ( just as all major candidates do ) and remaining studiously silent during the Chas .
Freeman debacle , President Obama has taken several recent steps that signal a different approach .
He has appointed a Middle East envoy ( George Mitchell ) with a reputation for evenhandedness .
Obama was n’t available to meet with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu during the AIPAC policy conference , so Netanyahu had to delay his trip .
Obama has already spoken in one Muslim country ( Turkey ) and is about to give a major address to the Muslim world from Cairo , after first stopping off in Saudi Arabia , and is n’t touching down in Israel on this tour .
Most importantly , he and other administration officials — including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel — have forcefully reiterated the Administration ’s commitment to a genuine two - state solution and its opposition to Israel ’s settlements policy , including the fig leaf of “ natural growth . ”
That position was recently echoed by German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , which suggests that Obama ’s team has been quietly lining up EU support for their position .
Special envoy Mitchell reportedly drove that point home in his recent meeting with Israeli defense minister Ehud Barak , and there ’s no question that Israeli leaders are feeling the heat .
And Obama himself has emphasized that “ part of being a good friend is being honest , ” suggesting that he understands the pitfalls of unconditional U.S. support .
Do all these steps mean the lobby has lost all its power , and that our book was all wrong ?
Not hardly .
Let ’s start by recognizing that all Obama has done so far is lay down some rhetorical markers .
That ’s not a trivial step , especially since he and his aides have used unusually direct language and have n’t waffled in the face of initial Israeli protests .
If nothing else , these declarations make it harder for Obama to backtrack later on and mark a clear departure from Bush ’s ( failed ) approach .
But Obama has yet to put any real pressure on Israel , and he certainly has n’t tried to make U.S. support ( still over $ 3 billion / year ) conditional on Israeli compliance .
And the main bone of contention right now is simply whether Israel is willing to stop expanding settlements ; we have n’t even gotten to all the steps that will be necessary to make a viable Palestinian state possible .
Furthermore , we pointed out in our book that the lobby exerted more influence in Congress than on the Executive Branch , and we noted that several past Presidents ( e.g. , Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush ) had been able to put limited pressure on Israel in recent decades .
So mild Presidential pressure on Israel is hardly unprecedented .
In the meantime , the situation on the Hill has n’t changed very much : a recent AIPAC - sponsored “ Dear Colleague ” letter telling Obama to privately coordinate his Mideast diplomacy with Israel ( and proposing various conditions on the Palestinians ) garnered 76 signatures in the Senate and 329 in the House .
And there are signs that Israel ’s supporters on the Hill are beginning to mobilize in more direct ways .
Nonetheless , there are also signs that AIPAC ’s control on the Hill may be diminishing too , Richard Silverstein has pointed out that two prominent progressive Democrats — Barney Frank ( D - MA ) and Robert Filner ( D - CA ) – did not sign the AIPAC letter , and recent meetings between Netanyahu and several congressmen ( including John Kerry of Massachusetts , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee ) included sharp exchanges over Israel ’s settlements policy .
Most of the signatures on those two AIPAC letters were probably pro forma anyway , and they do n’t seem to have had the chilling effect that AIPAC - sponsored missives had in previous eras .
Thus far , Congressional pressure on Obama seems intended to moderate the Administration ’s positions , but not derail its efforts entirely .
So where does this leave our arguments about the lobby ’s profound influence ?
First , our main goal in writing our book was to encourage a more open discussion of this issue .
We were describing the situation as it existed up through 2007 ( when we finished the book ) , but we believed that if the taboo were challenged and a more open discourse emerged , more and more Americans would realize that the “ status quo ” lobby ( e.g , AIPAC , the Christian Zionists , the neoconservatives , and groups like the Zionist Organization of America ) were advocating policies that were bad for the United States and also bad for Israel itself .
The good news is that a more open discussion has emerged in recent years , as illustrated by Jimmy Carter ’s book Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , by numerous commentators in the blogosphere like Ezra Klein , Phil Weiss , Andrew Sullivan , Richard Silverstein , Matt Yglesias , and others , and by clear - eyed columnists such as Roger Cohen .
Jon Stewart ’s Daily
Show has done its part too , with some pointed commentary on Gaza and at least one wickedly satirical look at AIPAC itself .
Second , partly because of this more open discourse , more and more people — including Americans who care strongly about Israel ’s well - being — have begun to realize that failure to achieve a two - state solution is jeopardizing Israel ’s long - term future .
As we wrote in our book and as I ’ve blogged about before , the only alternatives to a two - state solution are the ethnic cleansing of millions of Palestinians , the creation of a binational democracy , or some form of apartheid .
That is why Ehud Olmert eventually came around to the two - state solution , and people who used to reject the idea of pressure have begun to see the light .
Even Martin Indyk is starting to sound a little bit like us .
In other words , what it means to be “ pro -Israel ” is being redefined , thereby creating space for Obama to move toward a more sensible U.S. policy .
Third , events in the region have reinforced this growing sense that a different course of action is needed .
The 2006 war in Lebanon and the recent carnage in Gaza have underscored the futility of trying to solve these problems by force alone and cast doubt in Israel ’s efforts to portray itself as the eternal victim .
More and more people are aware of the long - term demographic trends , and they also know that the Arab League has offered to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel once the Palestinians have a viable state of their own .
Some people also realize that settling the Israeli - Palestinian conflict would remove an arrow from Iran ’s quiver and make it easier to mobilize a united front against Iran should that become necessary .
Of course , the election of the most right - wing government in Israel ’s history ( and the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as Foreign Minister ) has n’t made it any easier for defenders of the status quo either .
Fourth , the behavior of some of Israel ’s most fervent defenders may have helped open eyes and ears as well .
In particular , the reflexive tendency to smear and marginalize critics of the “ special relationship ” by accusing them of being either anti-semites or “ self - hating ” Jews has become a self - discrediting enterprise , because the charge keeps getting directed at people for whom it is so obviously false .
Condemning neo -Nazis and Holocaust deniers is a worthy enterprise , but smearing respected individuals such as Carter , Desmond Tutu , Tony Kushner , Tony Judt , or others is transparently bogus and intended solely to stifle intelligent discourse on a vital subject .
And when defenders of any cause have to stoop to such tactics , it reveals that they are defending an increasingly weak case .
Finally , we argued in the conclusion of our book , part of the solution here was the emergence of a different sort of pro-Israel lobby , one that might be equally influential but in the service of smarter policies .
There are encouraging signs on this front , and the increased prominence of groups such as J Street , the Israel Policy Forum , or Brit Tzedek v’Shalom are encouraging developments .
There is no reason why groups like AIPAC cannot evolve too , and begin to use their considerable political acumen in the service of a more far - sighted approach .
People who think that the Israel lobby is some sort of secret Jewish conspiracy probably also believe that its influence could never be countered and that the groups within it are irredeemable .
That is the essence of conspiracy theories — and especially anti-Semitic ones –they impute dark and magical powers to some secret organization or cabal and portray it as evil , all - powerful , unchanging , and unstoppable .
By contrast , those of us who see the lobby as a typical interest group engaged in the normal rough - and - tumble of democratic politics have recognized that its considerable influence ( which no one seriously denies ) could be mitigated or modified over time , especially once it became clear that the policies promoted by its most powerful components were in fact harmful to U.S. and Israeli interests alike .
We wrote our book to contribute to that process , and while realists should probably never be too optimistic — and especially about the Middle East — it ’s hard for me not to see the recent turn in U.S. policy as encouraging .
Now let ’s see what Obama says in Cairo .

Iran has long been accused of supporting Shia militants in Iraq Iran remains the " most active state sponsor of terrorism " in the world , a report by the US state department says .
It says Iran 's role in the planning and financing of terror - related activities in the Middle East and Afghanistan threatens efforts to promote peace .
Al - Qaeda remains the biggest danger to the US and the West , the annual report states , noting that terror attacks are rising in Pakistan .
Iran rejected the report , saying the US was guilty of double standards .
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the US had no right to accuse others in light of its actions at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay .
' Existential threat '
The BBC 's state department correspondent , Kim Ghattas , says the new US administration may be trying to engage Tehran , but , just like last year , Iran is still described as the most active state sponsor of terrorism .
The report singles out the Quds unit of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard
The report charges that Iran 's involvement in countries like Lebanon , Iraq , Afghanistan and in the Palestinian territories threatens efforts to promote peace , economic stability in the Gulf and democracy .
The report singles out the Quds force , an elite branch of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as the channel through which Iran supports terrorist activities and groups abroad .
The report also takes to task Syria , an Iranian ally in the region .
Of equal concern , our correspondent notes , is the advance of al - Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan where terrorist attacks are sharply on the rise while the rest of the world , including Iraq , has seen terrorist attacks decrease .
The acting coordinator for counter - terrorism for the state department , Ronald Schlicher , told journalists that al - Qaeda was using border areas of Pakistan to regroup .
" Al - Qaeda and al - Qaeda associated networks remain the greatest terrorist threat to the US and its partners , " he said .
Mr Schlicher said they were using the Afghan - Pakistan border area " as a safe haven where they can hide , where they can train , where they can communicate with their followers , where they can plot attacks and where they can make plans to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan " .
Washington is worried that the government in Islamabad might collapse , and last week US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Taleban fighters posed an existential threat to Pakistan , which is a nuclear power , our correspondent adds .

A national PBS documentary will point to Portland as one of three cities that exemplify how the nation can use transportation infrastructure to fight sprawl , preserve the environment and promote mass transit .
" Blueprint America : Road to the Future " airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on public broadcasting stations nationwide and on Oregon Public Broadcasting in the Portland area .
It uses Denver , New York and Portland - and their nearby suburbs - as examples of how national policies on transportation can shape cities .
Producers hope the show and related segments other PBS programs will influence upcoming debates on a new multi- year federal transportation bill and stimulus spending .
" How we build ultimately will determine how we live and the quality of life we enjoy , " said Neal Shapiro , chief executive officer of WNET .ORG .
" For many years , cities have been neglected , and in many cases harmed , by government policies that favored sprawl over density . "
The show makes a pitch for more federal money for mass transit and bicycling and less for new highways , quoting well - known Portlanders -- U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer , Metro Council President David Bragdon , Portland Mayor Sam Adams , urban planning professor Ethan Seltzer and bike blogger Jonathan Maus -- at length on big policy questions .
In a copy of the film distributed to The Oregonian , car commuters ' desires for more lanes , more speed and less traffic are treated as antiquated ideals , exemplified in snippets of video from the 1950s and 60s .
But reporter Miles O'Brien also features landowners frustrated by Portland - area growth restrictions and a Denver - area family that seems content with a suburban lifestyle .
And he explains the continued popularity of car - friendly policies , citing as an example the defeat of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's proposal to charge tolls on cars entering the city to boost mass transit funding .
The show comes after a May 10 documentary , " Making Sense of Place , " examined Portland 's growth management policies .
-- Dylan Rivera ; dylanrivera@news.oregonian.com
Four months into his new position as secretary of transportation , Ray LaHood has a great deal on his plate .
As well as overseeing 55,000 employees and a $ 70 billion budget , he 's in charge of $ 48 billion in stimulus funds directed to his department by the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act and is gearing up for the reauthorization of the massive , six - year " highway bill " that funds transportation projects .
The former congressman from Illinois sat down with U.S. News to talk about the administration 's priorities , high - speed rail , and where all that money will come from .
Excerpts :
Given everything that is going on right now , is this a watershed moment for transportation ?
I think the term really is " transformational . "
The things we have in our part of the economic recovery are not just highways and bridges .
It 's transit .
It 's airports .
It 's $ 8 billion for high - speed rail .
And I also think it 's some opportunities that we have to promote livable communities .
You 've spoken about drawing on the Portland , Ore. , model of transportation as a " livable community " that emphasizes public transit and walking and biking paths .
But is it exportable to all kinds of cities , even the largest ?
I think it can be replicated in some cities .
I also think you can replicate parts of it in neighborhoods in cities .
Chicago is so spread out and so big , but you could connect neighborhoods , perhaps with light rail .
And they 've been connected by " rails to trails . "
So much of why we have n't done these things yet seems to stem from a culture of driving in America .
Is that really changeable ?
We 've spent three decades building an interstate system .
We 've put almost all of our resources into the interstate system .
This is a transformational president , and the department is following the president 's lead .
People have n't really been thinking about these things .
They have been thinking about how to build roads , how to build interstates , how to build bridges .
People now are thinking differently about where they want to live , how they want to live , and how they want to be able to get around their communities .
What is the administration 's biggest priority for the reauthorization of the so - called highway bill in the fall , which will fund transportation projects for the next six years ?
The Highway Trust Fund , we think by August , is going to probably be in some serious need of plussing up .
People have lots of ideas about all of the things that they want to do , and we have lots of ideas , and we know that the Highway Trust Fund is just not going to be adequate enough to do all the things that everybody wants to do .
So we 're thinking about an infrastructure bank that could fund some projects of national prominence .
What about raising the gas tax ?
We 're not talking about raising the gas tax .
With hard economic times , with so many people out of work , the last thing we really want to be proposing is raising the gas tax .
Still , Obama 's stricter emissions regulations will mean people will be spending less money on gas .
Those standards really do n't take ef - fect until 2012 in the executive order that the president signed and 2016 in the announcement that the presi-dent made at the White House .
At that point , hopefully , the economy is going to be in much better shape , and there will be opportunities for us to find other ways to fund the things that we want to do .
How would a national infrastructure bank avoid competing with other sources of funding ?
You would allow the states — and you could even do it at the federal level — to sell bonds .
Then you could [ set aside money for ] projects of a state or of a national significance .
You would know that it was going to the big stuff , the big projects .
It 's been tried in some states , and it works , and you can generate a lot of money .
For metropolitan transportation , one challenge has been that funding flows through states , which have n't historically prioritized cities .
Is this a problem ?
I talked to a number of mayors during the time that we were working on the economic recovery [ act ] , and I know that they were concerned that money was going to go through the states .
But what 's happened is they 've worked with the states , and they 've been able to get a pretty good chunk of money to fix up roads .
So you 're not considering changing the way funding works systematically ?
I think the thing that the mayors would really like to see changed is the metropolitan planning organizations , the MPOs .
The mayors would like it if they would be much more broad - based — rather than just in a metropolitan area , that they take in a much larger area .
I think that 's the kind of reform that they 're going to try to get into the highway bill .
If they can convince the transportation committee to change , that 's something that I think needs reform .
The American Society of Civil Engineers has given U.S. infrastructure a D. Would you agree ?
I would agree with them for last year .
But I think when the grades come out after our economic recovery plan is implemented and after we move beyond that with the Highway Trust Fund , we 'll get a good grade .
Look , there has n't been a lot of attention paid to infrastructure over the last eight years .
There 's been more attention paid to it in the last hundred days than there has in a long time .
So a D probably is a good reflection of the past .
I hope it's an A a year from now .
How far can $ 13 billion for high - speed rail — $ 8 billion in the stimulus , $ 5 billion in the budget over five years — really go ?
The San Francisco - to - Los Angeles line alone is projected to cost more than $ 30 billion .
When you look back when the interstate bill was signed , I 'm sure people were saying , " Well , where are we going to get the money for it ? "
And I guarantee you this , all of the lines were n't on the maps .
Three decades later , we have an interstate system that 's a model for the world , built with Highway Trust Fund money .
Eight billion dollars is a lot of money .
It will help jump - start opportunities all over America .
You know what ?
It 's an excellent start .
What have the biggest obstacles been , historically , to the United States having a top - notch infrastructure ?
Only the will to do things .
Infrastructure is n't usually seen as a " sexy " topic .
How do you get the public engaged in transportation issues ?
Is it time to run ?
That ’s what I ’ve been asking myself for three years now .
Before that , I thought it was simply a matter of finding a better place to live .
A place that was quieter and cheaper .
Where flippers and developers had n’t taken over the neighborhood .
Somewhere safe I could park my car on the street and not worry about it .
But by the time I found it , I also found that the thieves were inside the house , not on the street .
There ’s really no hiding from them .
And no hiding from what they can do .
Our mene , mene , tekel upharsin is on the wall .
It ’s time to run , not hide .
I mean that .
We ’re in the throes of an economic collapse of a kind last seen in the 1930s .
The government is intent on grabbing control of whatever it can .
American firms are dropping like flies .
Unemployment is soaring .
Debt is soaring .
The money supply is soaring .
Our foreign policy is a wreck — we have more enemies than we can count .
We have a drug war on the borders , we have gang war in the ghettos , we have culture wars in the academy and media .
We have criminals in government .
The future is n’t any brighter .
Subprime is only the first leg down .
We still have a second wave of housing trouble in store , centering around commercial real estate and option ARM loans .
Gerald Celente , the CEO of Trend Research , wrote a piece last year predicting that by 2012 there would be food riots , tax rebellion , and revolution across the country .
Celente has a good track record in the forecasting business .
Experts predict a 100 % rise in prices across the board .
In the best - case scenario , it will happen over ten years .
In the worst case , it might happen within months .
More “ hate crimes ” laws are on the table .
They ’ll not only crimp political speech , they ’ll make it criminal .
The likely targets will be people who propose tax rebellion and secession or oppose US support for Israel or militant Zionism .
Other candidates for thought reform are Christians who oppose abortions and gay marriage and environmental and animal rights activists .
Homeland Security is preparing a network of emergency facilities for civilians .
Innocuous ?
Maybe , but it ’s odd that these holding camps should be built on military installations .
Medical information is being centralized in online data banks accessible by the government , and some favored groups .
Bills to snoop , bills to spy , bills to control .
Each time one gets struck down , another sprouts in its place .
Is it really the best strategy to fight each bill one at a time , over and over ?
Why ?
If this is what the public and the congress want , so be it .
So what if they ’re unconstitutional ?
We ’ve long ago established that the constitution means just about whatever anyone wants it to mean .
When it comes to torture , Republicans rip up the constitution .
When it comes to tax and spend , Democrats rip it up .
The whole thing is a partisan racket .
Whoever shouts the loudest gets what he wants .
So be it .
Rather than forcing the country to change , a far simpler and humbler strategy is to let the country go whichever way it wants , and get out of its way .
I ’m not a cynic .
I ’m not telling you to stand on the sidelines and egg both sides on .
I ’m not telling you to forget your native soil or your community .
I ’m suggesting that it might be easier for you to defend them from abroad .
And I ’m suggesting that you start making yourself a foothold abroad .
Just in case .
If you ’re finding it hard to manage , if you ’ve reached a dead end , if you ’re depressed by the way things are here , go .
How to do it ?

First .
Get your papers in order .
I ’m amazed at the number of people who do n’t have passports .
A passport is the nearest thing you have to a veto on Washington .
Get it in order .
You ’ll also need other valid documents .
Now is the time to start getting them together .
You should at least have your driving license , passport and birth certificate ready to go .
You should also start collecting other documents you might need ( marriage , divorce , and adoption papers , incorporation papers , name changes , social security papers , bank statements , recommendations , letters of authorization , educational and work certifications ) .
These can take months to get from the proper source .
You might also need to have them validated by the embassy of the country where you want to move .
Second .
Figure out where you want to live .
This is not as hard as it sounds .
Almost all your research can be done on the net , though at some point , you ’ll have to buy a ticket and try living where you want to move .
A good place to start your research is the CIA fact book , which lists current geographic and economic statistics .
Wiki will give you maps , photos , and general background .
For property prices , viviun.com or glo-con.com have a wide selection of all kinds of property in practically every part of the world .
Be aware that prices on English language international sites are usually higher than what you will be able to find from local sources .
I suggest you pick a dozen countries you think might interest you and start researching them systematically .
How you choose your country will depend on who you are and what you plan to do .
Families with children should look at job opportunities , political stability , crime rates , and schools .
Cheap prices ca n’t be their only criterion .
For retired people on a fixed income , warm weather and good health care might be much more important .
For those working on the net , an important factor will be good DSL and accessibility to a major city for tech help .
I remember I saw what looked like the perfect little farm in the remote highlands of a little visited Central American country .

Spanish will take you anywhere in Latin America .
French helps in Africa and in some parts of Asia .
But language is made out to be a much bigger problem than it really is .
Buy a decent phrase book and a dictionary , make good use of online translators like babel fish , and you ’ll be fine .
I have conducted lengthy email conversations about renovation costs , world politics , alternative medicine , and Dick Cheney , all with babel fish .
The translations are crude and sometimes off the wall , but foreigners are forgiving of people who at least try to talk their language .
Purchasing property in a foreign language is a bit trickier .
For that , you ’re wise to look for local lawyers and notaries .
A good place to make contacts is the online forum of an expat community in that country .
Get an internet alias and start asking questions before you leave .
Make sure you double check everything your hear against the local government ’s official information .
Ownership , work , and residency rules for foreigners are constantly changing .
Third .
Visit your safe - haven .
Every fantasy has to hit the ground for it to become real .
For many people , this is the hard part .
Dreaming is one thing .
But only people who are willing to do the hard work , take some risk , and live with something less than perfection get to make their dreams come true .
Each time you try anything , you ’ll always have a hundred naysayers at your elbow , most of them , your nearest and dearest .
They mean well .
They ’re doing what they think is best for you .
And about half the time , they may even be right .
Do n’t bite their heads off .
Smile sweetly , listen to all the advice , and when it ’s over , make your own decision .
Weighing pros and cons is a good start .
But ultimately , do n’t flinch from making a decision based on gut feeling .
Two heads may be better than one .
But one strong gut reaction is far better than any number of heads .
Listen to it .
You need about two months to prepare for a trip properly .
Book well in advance to get the best prices .
I started using the site bootsnall.com many years ago and it ’s still one of the best .
Some places need you to take shots , but usually you can skip this if you ’ve not been out of the US in a while .
Here are a couple of important tips :
Book a hotel or a hostel for the first few nights .
Then find an apartment from there .
You need to meet the owner in person to feel comfortable in a rental apartment .
Pack light .
Security checks are increasingly uncomfortable and time - consuming .
The less you carry , the easier your trip will be .
Make it a priority to visit one foreign country within the next six months .
You ’re going to find that having another option besides staying put is going to change the way you think and feel about everything here .
It may be that leaving for good is n’t for you .
You may find that you prefer home with all its problems to a strange culture .
Well and good .
What have you lost ?
A small amount of rapidly depreciating money .
It ’s an insignificant price to pay for something that will renew your spirit no matter what you decide .
And one day , it may end up being your only avenue of escape from trouble .

Ask 15 Republicans about climate change , and you ’ll get 20 different answers .
GOP grapples with climate confusion
Ask 15 Republicans about climate change , and you ’ll get 20 different answers .
In March , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told a national conservative radio program that the Earth is “ cooling , ” not warming .
Advertisement
Last week , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said global warming is real and hurting her state , acknowledging that “ many believe ” an international effort to reduce greenhouse gases is necessary .
And on Sunday , Republican leader John Boehner dismissed as “ almost comical ” the idea that carbon dioxide is “ a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment , ” arguing that it must be safe because humans “ exhale ” it and cows deposit it .
An EPA spokesman called Boehner ’s comments “ erroneous , ” noting that whether a gas is a carcinogen does n’t have anything to do with whether it causes global warming .
The GOP ’s scattershot messaging on climate change threatens to distract from the party ’s primary attack on the Democrats ’ global warming plan : that the cap - and - trade system will dramatically raise prices on business and consumers .
“ The debate should be starting right now , and it should be all about taxes coming from climate change , ” said one former Republican Senate aide .
This week , 54 witnesses — including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson and former Vice President Al Gore — will testify about climate change over three days of hearings before the Energy and Commerce Committee .
Three weeks ago , committee Chairman Henry Waxman and Rep. Ed Markey released the outlines of a cap - and - trade bill that they hope to fast - track to a full House vote by the Memorial Day recess .
But as Democrats charge forward , Republicans have yet to produce an energy plan .
Boehner told ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos that he thinks the Republicans will produce a plan on climate change , but he offered no details about what it might be or when it might come .
Boehner has tasked Indiana Republican Rep. Mike Pence ’s American Energy Solutions working group with working out the details of the Republican alternative .
House Republicans are focusing on the costs of a cap - and - trade system , warning that the new regime would raise regulatory costs on businesses and increase energy prices , particularly for consumers in the Midwest .
In a briefing with reporters Tuesday , Pence called the Democrats ’ proposal “ a declaration of economic war on the Midwest by liberals on Capitol Hill . ”
The ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , made similar points in his opening statement Tuesday .
“ How many businesses have folded , or will fold , because of skyrocketing energy prices ? ” he asked .
“ How much higher must unemployment creep before we realize that we are sabotaging our way of life in the name of carbon dioxide ? ”
House Republican aides argue that there are so many lines of attack coming out of the party because there is so much to criticize .
“ As House Republicans and the American Energy Solutions working group work through the process of building a taxpayer - friendly alternative to the president ’s cap - and - tax policy , there will be plenty to criticize in the Democrats ’ proposal , ” said Mary Vought , press secretary for the House Republican Conference .
A tightly focused economic message could help Republicans persuade Democrats — particularly those from Rust Belt states hit hard by the recession — to vote against the bill .
But Republicans also fear that their economic arguments are getting lost in a hazy mix of conflicting and sometimes confused commentary .
“ If you get bogged down in the debate to what degree this bill will actually diminish or lower human - created climate change , then you lose , ” said Brian Darling , director of Senate Relations at The Heritage Foundation and a former Republican Senate staffer .
“ I would concentrate 100 percent on the tax debate . ”
Traditionally , splits on climate change happen more along regional , rather than party , lines .
And Democrats certainly have their own internal divisions , with Rust Belt lawmakers wary of the impact a cap - and - trade system could have on energy prices for already - strapped consumers and trade - sensitive manufacturing industries such as paper and steel .
Still , most Democrats agree some action should be taken on global warming — they just disagree about the timing , mechanics and other details .
Republicans are still divided over whether global warming is actually happening .
Nowhere were the differences of opinion more apparent than in Republican responses to last Friday ’s proposed finding by the EPA that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare .
The announcement opened the door to new regulations on a huge swath of polluters , from auto manufacturers to power plants .
The highest ranking senators on the committees overseeing energy and environmental matters took radically different views on the proposed finding .
Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , called it the “ beginning of a regulatory barrage . ”
“ The solution to this ‘ glorious mess ’ is not for Congress to pass cap - and - trade legislation , which replaces one very bad approach with another .
Congress should pass a simple , narrowly targeted bill that stops EPA in its tracks . ”
But while Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) , the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , slammed the administration for “ acting on its own , ” she stressed the need to address climate change .
“ Addressing climate change is an important challenge that must be tackled , but it should be done through an open and deliberative process in Congress , ” Murkowski said .
Experts from both sides of the climate change debate note that Republicans are trapped in a climate change triangle .
Without congressional action , the White House can authorize the EPA to impose regulations .
But efforts in Congress are being led by some of the chamber ’s most liberal Democrats , including Waxman , Markey and California Sen. Barbara Boxer .
Outside the Capitol , business groups — a key Republican constituency — are fractured in their opposition to climate change legislation .
The United States Climate Action Partnership , a coalition of business and environmental groups , backs a cap - and - trade system that includes “ a significant portion ” of free allowances to help its membership — which includes General Motors , Alcoa and Shell — adopt new , less - polluting technologies .
But the Chamber of Commerce , the country ’s most powerful business lobby , remains significantly more wary of the idea .
And Republican opinion leaders Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck deride global warming as a “ scam ” and a “ hoax . ”
The Washington Post ’s George Will frequently expresses skepticism about the severity of man-made global warming .
“ If they come to the table , a lot of them see political suicide because of the effect of the principled punditry , ” said one House Democratic aide .
“ A lot of the people that can unleash on them do n’t think it ’s a problem . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A northwest Montana town where asbestos contamination has killed more than 200 people will get more than $ 130 million in cleanup and medical assistance from the Obama administration , the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday .
Libby , Montana , will get new help dealing with asbestos contamination .
The declaration is the first issued by the agency , which has grappled with the " toxic legacy " of a mine outside Libby , Montana , since 1999 , Administrator Lisa Jackson said .
The town was heavily contaminated with asbestos - laced dust that federal prosecutors said resulted in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses .
" For decades , the disease and death rate from asbestosis in the Libby area was staggeringly high -- much higher than the national average , " Jackson told reporters .
Not only did dust from the mine spread all over Libby and the neighboring town of Troy for decades , but tailings from the facility also were used as fill for driveways , gardens and playgrounds , she said .
" Literally no matter where these residents turned , they were being exposed yet again , " Jackson said .
She said the declaration " should be a reminder of the serious consequences of mismanaging hazardous material . "
EPA spokeswoman Adora Andy said $ 6 million from the Department of Health and Human Services will go to local health care providers to screen , diagnose and treat asbestos - related illnesses , while $ 125 million will go toward cleaning up contaminated areas .
The new commitment brings the total amount the EPA has designated for the Libby area to $ 333 million , she said .
The agency still needs to conduct " significant research " into the health effects of the type of asbestos that has been spread around town since the 1920s , she said , and does not yet know how many properties will need to be cleaned up .
During Jackson 's confirmation hearing in January , Montana Sen .
Max Baucus said the valley 's 12,000 residents had been " hung out to dry " and pressed Jackson to review the issue .
Wednesday , Baucus presented Jackson and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius with a photo of one of his constituents , former miner Les Skramstad .
" He died , and others in Libby have died , " said Baucus , a Democrat .
" But the decision is the beginning of what needed to be done .
It 's the first time in American history that we 've had this declaration , and I cannot think of a more fitting time and place for it than Libby , Montana . "
Baucus is the former chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and now leads the Finance Committee .
He is a key architect of a still - being - drafted health care bill the Obama administration has said it wants to see pass this year .
The Libby operation began producing vermiculite -- a mineral often used in insulation -- in 1919 .
Dust from the plant covered patches of grass , dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents ' daily lives .
But the product was contaminated with tremolite asbestos , a particularly toxic substance that has been linked to mesothelioma , a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs , abdomen , or heart .
In May , a federal jury acquitted mine operator W.R. Grace and three of its former executives of criminal charges related to the contamination .
Grace operated the facility from 1963 until it closed in 1990 , and prosecutors argued that its executives knowingly released the substance and tried to hide the danger from the community .
Baucus said that despite the verdict , he still believes the company " knew it was contaminating the town . "
" Regrettably , the trial did not conclude the way I thought that it should , " he said .
There was no immediate response from the company to the senator 's remarks .
During the three - month trial , Grace did not deny that the asbestos came from its mine , but it said it acted responsibly to clean up the contamination .
It also paid millions in medical bills for area residents , and agreed in 2008 to pay $ 250 million to reimburse the EPA for its cleanup efforts .

The classic Berkeley home - a creaky Victorian with drafty windows , a Wedgewood stove and musty furnace - will undergo a drastic makeover under the city 's aggressive new plans to fight global warming .
Within the next few years , the city is likely to mandate that all homes meet strict energy standards .
In many cases this would mean new double - paned windows , insulation in the attic , walls and floors , a new white roof that reflects heat , a forced - air furnace and high - efficiency appliances .
The cost : upward of $ 33,800 .
" The improvements will not only save energy , they 'll make the home less drafty and more comfortable , " said Billi Romain , the city 's sustainability coordinator .
" There are many benefits not just for the city , but for the homeowner . "
The requirements , some of the most drastic efforts any municipality has taken to curb global warming , are part of the city 's long - awaited Climate Action Plan .
The 145 - page report , which has been closely watched by other cities and states , covers everything from organic gardening to recycling to bike paths .
The plan , which the City Council is slated to approve Tuesday , aims to bring the city into compliance with Measure G , a 2006 initiative requiring the city to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
Under the proposal , all homeowners in Berkeley will be required to hire an energy auditor to inspect their home for leaks and inefficiencies .
Each home will receive a rating , similar to a car 's gas- mileage rating .
The owner will be required to improve the home 's energy efficiency to meet city standards .
From incentives to penalties
In the beginning , the city will offer incentives , such as rebates and financial assistance , for homeowners to comply .
But within a few years , the city will start imposing penalties for those who do n't meet the standards , said Timothy Burroughs , the city 's climate action coordinator .
" We want to emphasize that this is in people 's interest , " he said .
" If we 're serious about reducing our emissions , it 's only possible if virtually every building achieves significant improvements in energy efficiency . "
No deadlines or specific standards have been set yet .
But the city 's goal is for all of Berkeley 's 23,000 homes and 25,000 duplexes and apartment units to reduce energy use by 35 percent by 2020 .
In some cases , the standards can be met relatively inexpensively , Romain said .
Caulking , sealing , insulation and new appliances - an investment of under $ 10,000 - can reduce energy use by more than 25 percent .
Tougher new standards
Berkeley already has strict energy standards for homes , but they 're only applied when a home is sold or undergoes major remodeling .
The new standards will be tougher and apply to all homes .
Eventually energy standards will be applied to businesses and industries , as well .
Financial assistance will be available to low - income homeowners .
Portions of the plan will be paid for with federal stimulus money , parking rate increases and possibly a carbon tax .
The plan is likely to draw an uproar at Tuesday 's meeting , not just for the home requirements but for its emphasis on high - density housing development .
" It 's ridiculous , " said Laurie Bright , president of the Berkeley Council of Neighborhood Associations .
" I do n't believe this proposal will have any effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , " he said .
" We can't develop our way out of climate change . "
Berkeley is already overloaded with permit requirements and building standards , he said .
" This is piling on , " Bright said .
" It 's like the banks making their customers bail them out .
Berkeley wants to do all these great things but wants the homeowners to pay for it all . "
Former Mayor Shirley Dean said the costs will be too high for most residents .
" If we 're going to have any economic diversity in this city at all , we can't require people to make these awfully , awfully costly upgrades , " she said .
" I think people really want to do the right thing , but they just do n't have this kind of money . "
Meeting the Measure G goal will require Berkeley residents to dramatically change their lifestyles , but the sacrifices will make the city healthier and lead to a higher quality of life , said Alan Tobey , a board member of Livable Berkeley , which advocates for moderate growth .
The plan also calls for zero garbage sent to landfill , large improvements in public transit , bike lanes and car - shares , and most food sold in stores and restaurants to be produced within a few hundred miles of the city .
" This plan is a national model , in many ways , " Tobey said .
" People belittle the idea that one city can take on a global problem , but we 're showing that it can be done . "
Council meeting The Berkeley City Council meets at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Old City Hall , 2134 Martin Luther King Jr. Way , Berkeley .

The new test was introduced in April
The government is under pressure to rethink its new motorcycle test following a series of crashes in the first few weeks of its use .
Some instructors blame a new " swerve test " , which they say is dangerous - particularly in the wet .
Bikers e-mailing BBC
News said it could be difficult to safely achieve the 50 km / h speed the manoeuvre required .
The Driving Standards Agency ( DSA ) said the test was needed to help reduce deaths of motorcyclists on the roads .
It said the test was designed by professionals in conjunction with the motorcycle industry and 300 trials were carried out before it was brought in .
During the test , learners have to reach 50 km / h ( 31.2 mph ) , then perform a swerve , on special test centre tracks .
A brake and swerve manoeuvre on a wet road is fraught with danger for even an experienced motorcyclist
Jeff Stone
British Motorcyclists Federation
But some instructors say that if riders brake and swerve at the same time they are likely to come off , particularly in the wet .
The new test was brought in at the end of April and in the first three and a half weeks there were 15 incidents during the exam , with at least one rider left with broken bones .
The Motorcycle Action Group says it has warned the government that the test is unsafe and asked for changes .
Its national chairman , Paul Turner , told the BBC News website the new test had been brought in without enough consultation or consideration for riders .
" We do n't mind improvements in the test which will make for better riders , but putting people at risk during the test is ludicrous . "
He said the new test had been very poorly implemented as many test centres were not ready , and the number of centres had been reduced from 200 to 60 .
I have been riding for 30 years and I would not want to do the test they have to do
Barry Kenward
Instructor Jeff Stone , of the British Motorcyclists Federation , said : " There is no real argument with the actual test , but the DSA really do have to take note of ' real world ' conditions .
" A brake and swerve manoeuvre on a wet road is fraught with danger for even an experienced motorcyclist , so there needs to be a safer option for inclement weather conditions . "
Mr Stone pointed out that car driving tests were postponed in snowy or icy conditions .
" A motorcyclist 's competency can be best judged in the dry , " he said .
" Wet conditions introduce a chance element that should not be part of the test . "
Unsafe acceleration ?
Phil Woolley , 28 , of Liverpool , told the BBC News website that he recently failed his test after completing the swerve slightly below the required 50 km / h .
But the size of test centre sites made it difficult to reach the speed without accelerating unsafely , he said .
" Do it at a controlled speed and you will almost certainly fail , " he said .
" Or you just floor it as hard as you can and there is a good chance you will pass , but also a risk you will come off . "
The hazard avoidance manoeuvre was the only part of the test he had failed , Mr Woolley said .
" I know I can ride a bike , so it 's frustrating , " he said .
Barry Kenward , deputy chairman of the Driving Instructors Democratic Union , has put in a Freedom of Information request to find out how many accidents have occurred on the test so far .
He said : " In the dry the test is fine but the stopping distance is not enough for the stop to be carried out safely when it is wet .
" I have been riding for 30 years and I would not want to do the test they have to do . "

Autoblog reader Conor sent us this photo of Santa Monica Blvd. in Southern California where a billboard advertising the new Audi A4 has apparently been up for months .
The ad throws down a gauntlet at the feet of BMW with an image of the new A4 and the statement , " Your move , BMW . "
Whether by design or by happenstance , the Munich - based brand recently made its move , hoisting up a billboard across the street that displays the high - performance M3 and the word " Checkmate . "
Ouch .
We 're sure Audi will have more to say when the RS4 / 5 arrives sometime in the near future , but for now , BMW appears to have the final word in this billboard chess match .
As you 'll likely remember , these two brands are no strangers to duking it out with each other in advertisements , having gone toe - to - toe with each other and Subaru in late 2006 over which brand had the most prestigious " Of the Year " award .
Thanks for the tip , Conor .

1.1.4 About BFilter is a filtering web proxy .
It was originally intended for removing banner ads only , but since then its capabilities have been greatly extended .
Unlike most of the similar tools , it does n't rely on blacklists ( although it does support them ) .
The problem with blacklists is that advertisers are always one step ahead .
You see an ad slip through , you update your blacklist , and in case it did n't help , you add a new entry yourself .
Once I got tired of that , I decided to write a proxy that would detect ads heuristically , much like modern anti-virus software manages to detect many viruses unknown to it .

MOSCOW : Two Russian women got an unpleasant surprise when their former boss paid them more than 1,000 dollars to settle a labour dispute -- in dozens of heavy bags full of tiny coins .

Two Russian women got an unpleasant surprise when their former boss paid them more than 1,000 dollars to settle a labour dispute -- in dozens of heavy bags full of tiny coins .
[ Agencies ]
The two had worked as office managers for Deco - Line , a company that installs ceilings in Russia 's far eastern city of Vladivostok .
When the company refused to pay , Sizhuk and Shemyakina complained to Russian labour authorities .
Finally the director of the company relented and said he would pay the women the 36,000 rubles ( 1,150 dollars , 830 euros ) they were demanding .
But when the company delivered the money , it came in 33 bags filled mostly with five - kopek coins , a virtually useless piece of currency that Russia keeps in circulation though it is worth only a fraction of a cent .
Sizhuk and Shemyakina had to call friends to help them carry the bags , which weighed around 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) .
But their boss was unrepentant when a reporter from Komsomolskaya Pravda asked for an explanation .
" The girls wanted to get a lot of money , and they got it .
What difference does it make what sort of units it came in ? "
Deco -Line director Konstantin Lyalikov told the newspaper .
He added that the two women had been sacked because they wasted too much time browsing the Internet for personal purposes .
Shemyakina , were laid off amid the global financial crisis and had demanded that their boss pay them for unused vacation time , the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily reported on Friday .
Bright skies at night were noted in Britain for days after the event in 1908
There is new evidence in the debate regarding the 1908 Tunguska event that destroyed 80 million trees in Siberia .
Researchers say that clouds that form at the poles after shuttle launches are due to the turbulent transport of water from shuttle exhaust .
Similar clouds were visible at night long after the Tunguska event .
The Geophysical Research Letters study suggests that an icy comet , rather than a meteor , must have been responsible for the event .
The Tunguska event has generated much debate , but 100 years on it remains unclear if it was caused by a comet , an asteroid , or a meteoroid .
What is known is that after the event , bright skies at night were noted in a number of places , particularly Britain .
' Unexpected physics ' Night - time or " noctilucent " clouds are the highest in the Earth 's atmosphere , forming at an altitude up to 85 km .
They lead to bright night skies when they are illuminated by sunlight from beyond the horizon .
Such noctilucent clouds were noted in the polar regions by researchers after launches of space shuttles Discovery in 1997 and Endeavour in 2003 .
Because the shuttle 's main engine combines liquid oxygen with hydrogen , launches produce more than 300 tonnes of water that is deposited in the upper atmosphere .
The event flattened over 2,000 square kilometres of forest However , it was unclear how a water vapour trail could spread to a 1000 km size and travel more than 8000 km to the poles .
Now , Michael Kelley of Cornell University and his colleagues propose that so - called " two - dimensional turbulence " is to blame .
The phenomenon arises when , instead of being able to move freely in three dimensions , fluids are constrained by , for example , a magnetic field .
As a result , they can move much more quickly in two dimensions in which they are still free to move .
The team says that the water vapour could get trapped in such a two - dimensional layer , being funnelled to the poles quickly while being spread out over vast distances .
" There is a mean transport of this material for tens of thousands of kilometres in a very short time , and there is no model that predicts that , " Professor Kelley said .
" It 's totally new and unexpected physics . "
Having found a mechanism for the transport of water over vast distances , leading to the noctilucent clouds , the team now suggest that bright night skies after the Tunguska event could be explained by a great deal of water being released into the upper atmosphere .
That suggests the cause was a comet that shed its icy outer coating before plunging to Earth , rather than an asteroid or meteoroid .
" It 's almost like putting together a 100 - year - old murder mystery , " Professor Kelley said .

They die from bleeding , infection , high blood pressure , prolonged labor and botched abortions  problems that can be treated or prevented with basic obstetrical care .
But in Tanzania , which has neither the worst nor best medical care in Africa , but is similar to many poor countries , everything is in short supply : doctors , nurses , drugs , equipment , ambulances and paved roads .
By the time many women get to the 120 - bed hospital here , it is too late to save them .

Their babies may be saved , but their survival hangs in the balance .
Often , the father or other remaining relatives cannot take care of newborns .
Without breast milk , infants here are in real trouble .
Formula and baby food are not widely available , and cow ’s milk is a poor substitute .
Malnutrition and infection are constant threats .
An orphanage can provide basic needs , but to thrive , babies need dedicated caregivers , and their extended families may live in distant villages .
The orphanage here , started in 1965 by United German Mission Aid , an evangelical Christian mission , began recruiting relatives to move in about five years ago .
Ute Klatt , a German missionary and nurse who has been director of the orphanage for 10 years , said she learned about the practice from another orphanage in Tanzania .
Now many of the children at the orphanage are cared for by a teenage girl from the extended family  a binti , in Swahili  often a sister , cousin or aunt , who lives with them and learns how to take care of them .
The young women come to love the children , and will look after them when they leave the orphanage , Ms. Klatt said .
In addition , the bintis , some of whom have never been to school , gain some education .
Ms. Klatt provides schoolbooks , she said , and the young women study and teach one another in the evenings .
Many arrive illiterate and leave knowing how to read .
She also teaches them the basics about health , and they learn sewing and batik , and share the cooking in an outdoor kitchen .
“ Before we had this system , the families were n’t visiting , and it was hard to reintegrate the children , ” Ms. Klatt said .
“ There were attachment disorders . ”
With the bintis , Ms. Klatt said , life becomes less institutional and the children grow up more normally , as they might at home .

A high - powered group of senior Republicans and Democrats led two missions to China in the final months of the Bush administration for secret backchannel negotiations aimed at securing a deal on joint US - Chinese action on climate change .
The initiative , involving John Holdren , now the White House science adviser , and others who went on to positions in Barack Obama ’s administration , produced a draft agreement in March , barely two months after the Democrat assumed the presidency …
“ My sense is that we are now working towards something in the fall , ” said Bill Chandler , director of the energy and climate programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , and the driving force behind the talks .
“ It will be serious .
It will be substantive , and it will happen . ”
John Holdren , head of White House science office

The secret missions suggest that advisers to Obama came to power firmly focused on getting a US - China understanding in the run-up to the crucial UN meeting in Copenhagen this December , which is aimed at sealing a global deal to slash greenhouse gas emissions .
In her first policy address the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she wanted to recast the broad US - China relationship around the central issue of climate change .
She also stopped in Beijing on her first foreign tour …
The first communications , in the autumn of 2007 , were initiated by the Chinese .
Xie Zhenhua , the vice - chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission , the country ’s central economic planning body , made the first move by expressing interest in a co-operative effort on carbon capture and storage and other technologies with the US …
Taiya Smith , an adviser on China to Bush ’s treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , who was at the first of the two sessions , said : “ The thing that came out of it that was priceless was the recognition on both sides that what China was doing to [ reduce ] the effects of climate change were not very well known , ” she said .
“ After these discussions was a real public campaign by the Chinese government to try to make people aware of what they were doing .
We started to see the Chinese take a different tone which was that ‘ we are active and engaged in trying to solve the problem ’ . ”
RTFA .
A good deal we have n’t heard about before .
Seems clear the Chinese expected the same election results many activists did .
And in 2007 and 2008 , it was possible to get a bipartisan working group together from the United States – for bilateral talks .
No surprise that some of the folks taking part in those discussions ended up in Obama ’s administration .
If you think comic sans is the worst font ever , there ’s an app for that .
President Zardari addressed the nation in a late - night broadcast Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has condemned the killing of an anti-Taliban cleric in a suicide bombing .
In a late - night broadcast to the nation , Mr Zardari singled out the killing of cleric Sarfraz Naeemi at a school in Lahore by the Taliban .
He said the Taliban were brutal people who were working against the sovereignty of Pakistan .
Mr Zardari also announced bonuses for the armed forces and pay rises for government officials .
In the attack on the Islamic religious school and in a simultaneous suicide bombing at a mosque in the north - west garrison town of Nowshera at least six people were killed and about 100 injured .
In pictures : Pakistan blasts A leading Sunni Muslim scholar opposed to the Taliban , Mr Naeemi was known for his outspoken views against suicide bombings and militancy .
He was one of the few scholars who had openly supported the ongoing military operation in Swat and had labelled the activities of the Taliban " un- Islamic " .
Mr Zardari said : " We are fighting a war for our sovereignty .
We will continue this war until the end , and we will win it at any cost . "
The president paid tribute to the bravery of soldiers fighting what he called " this war on terrorism " .
He said they would receive allowances equal to a month 's pay immediately , while other soldiers would receive them next January , and other government officials would also see a rise in their salaries .
He promised that two million people displaced by the current offensive against the Taliban would be rehabilitated .
Government forces have made recent gains against the Taliban , but it is a battle for hearts and minds , too , the BBC 's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge says .
Sarfraz Naeemi was killed when the explosion struck the Jaamia Naeemia madrassa on Friday .

The other attack , in Nowshera , took place in a military high - security zone , close to an armed forces supply depot .
Taliban spokesman Maulvi Omar also told the AFP news agency it was responsible for the attack on the Pearl Continental Hotel in nearby Peshawar , the capital of North West Frontier Province , on Tuesday which killed 18 people .

" Analytical geometry has never existed .
There are only people who do linear geometry badly , by taking coordinates , and they call this analytical geometry .
Out with them ! " -
Jean Dieudonné
" The first test of potential in mathematics is whether you can get anything out of geometry . "

" The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them . "

* Israel 's Barak goes to U.S. to try to narrow rift
* New units part of wider construction plan for settlement
( Adds Abbas comments , paragraph 8 - 11 , background )
JERUSALEM , June 29 ( Reuters ) - Israel 's Defence Ministry said on Monday it had approved construction of 50 new homes at a West Bank settlement as part of a plan for 1,450 housing units , an expansion that defies a U.S. call for a settlement freeze .
News of the planned building work emerged hours before Defence Minister Ehud Barak was due to travel to the United States for talks aimed at narrowing a rift with Washington over the settlement issue .
He will meet President Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy , George Mitchell .
An affidavit submitted by the Defence Ministry to the Supreme Court outlined plans to relocate settlers from Migron , an outpost built in the West Bank without Israeli government permission , to the settlement of Adam , north of Jerusalem .
According to the document , a response to a court case brought by the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now , a master plan for Adam calls for construction of 1,450 homes there .
But the ministry said it had given the go - ahead for the construction of only 50 of the dwellings and any additional units would require its separate approval .
Peace Now said some 2,500 settlement homes are currently under construction in the West Bank .
Obama has pressed Israel to halt settlement activity as part of a bid to revive peace talks under which the Palestinians would gain statehood .
Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem , territory Israel captured in a 1967 war .
Palestinians say settlements , deemed illegal by the World Court , could deny them a viable and contiguous state .
STATEHOOD
In the West Bank city of Ramallah , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas reiterated his refusal to resume negotiations with Israel until it froze settlement .
" We wo n't accept the continuation of settlements , " Abbas said .
Abbas also urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop his conditions for the creation of a Palestinian state , which include international guarantees it would have no army and a demand Palestinians recognise Israel as a Jewish state .
" Israel should accept the two - state vision and not put conditions that would render the issue meaningless , " Abbas said , echoing comments he made through a spokesman after a Netanyahu policy address on June 14 .
In a rare dispute between Israel and its main ally , the United States , Netanyahu has refused to declare a settlement freeze , saying that some construction should continue to match population growth within the enclaves .
Barak left open the possibility of a limited , temporary halt to construction in settlements , in remarks on Sunday in response to an Israeli newspaper report that he would propose a three - month moratorium .

Same topic , new information .
Iran is descending into chaos , and the only people who seem to be keeping tabs on it are online .
Forget about “ the most trusted name in news “ - they ’re busy wanking themselves over the vital issue of Dan - Quayle - in - drag versus David Letterman .
The only “ real ” news network spending any time on these events is the BBC .
For those of you not paying attention , a fundamental shift has taken place in world events : a full - scale cyber war is taking place .
On one side is what passes for the Iranian government these days .
On the other is a motley and diverse group of basement dwellers with internet access .
So far , the advantage is with the Iranian government - due largely to the mainstream media ’s apparent policy of collusion - by - neglect .
An explanation is probably in order .
The Iranian government has been doing its utmost to block out all “ unofficial ” information traffic INTO Iran .
They honestly do n’t care what the rest of the world knows or thinks - they just want to keep the wool pulled firmly over the eyes of their own people .
To that end , they have been trying to block BBC Persia , internet and phone communications , and Twitter .
Even though it causes me physical pain to admit this , Twitter has emerged as a vital tool for the protesters in Iran to spread information about the protests and other news - as well as keeping interested parties outside Iran up to date .
For the past three days , several people personally involved in the protests have been giving the world real - time updates on the situation on the ground in Iran .
Huge amounts of this information ( sent via Twitter ) has later been confirmed by more formal sources ( especially the BBC ) .
Sadly , the US media outlets have apparently chosen to respond with a collective yawn .
Iran has made official requests to Twitter to stop operations in their territory , and were rebuffed .
The government ordered their militia thugs to start attacking and detaining everyone found with a cell phone or other mobile device , and the dormitories at Tehran ’s universities were raided repeatedly by police and militia member searching for satellite dishes and computers .
Government agents have definitely been using Twitter feeds to hunt down and attack protesters using the service .
In response , some of the more reliable and accurate protester - correspondents in Iran asked for help in shutting down the government ’s websites .
A great many of the usual suspects here in the US loaded up on cheesy - poofs and Mountain Dew , then typed into action .
Other people spent their time , energy , and money setting up proxy servers for the protesters to use .
This has allowed ( and is still allowing ) protesters to communicate inside Iran and to pass information to the rest of the world .
Of course , most people in this country still have no idea what has been happening in Iran .
Here is a capsule description by a poster named Tatsuma on FARK.com :
Suppression of Dissent – The Players
Currently , there are either two or three groups who are suppressing the students on the ground that you ’ll read about throughout this thread :
1. The Basij
2. Ansar Hizbullah ( which I will refer to as Ansar )
3. Lebanese Hizbullah ( Unconfirmed but highly probable .
Many different independent reports and video point that way .
Even in the last hours other independent twitter feeds have declared witnessing thugs beating on people while shouting in Arabic ; I will refer to them as Hizbullah )
– The Basij are your regular paramilitary organization .
They are the armed hand of the clerics .
The Basij are a legal group , officially a student union , and are legally under direct orders of the Revolutionary Guard .
Their main raison d’être is to quell dissent .
They are the ones who go and crack skulls , force people to participate in pro-regime demonstrations , and generally try to stop any demonstrations from even starting .
They are located throughout the country , in every mosque , every university , every social club you can think of .
They function in a way very similar to the brownshirts .
They were the ones who first started the crackdown after the election , but it was n’t enough .
While they are violent and repressive , they are still Persian and attacking fellow citizens .
A beating is one thing , mass killings another .
– Another group was working with them , whose members are even more extreme , is Ansar .
There is a lot of cross-membership between the Basij and Ansar , though not all are members of the other group and vice - versa .
The vast majority of Ansar are Persians ( either Basij or ex-military ) , though a lot of Arab recruits come from Lebanon and train with them under supervision of the Revolutionary Guard .
They are not functioning under a legal umbrella , they are considered a vigilante group , but they pledge loyalty directly to the Supreme Leader and most people believe that they are under his control .
They are currently helping the Basij to control the riots , but due to the fact that they are Persians and in lower numbers than the Basij , they are not that active .
– ( the following paragraph includes some speculation based on reports from ground zero )
Hizbullah flew in a lot of their members in Iran , most likely a good deal even before the elections in case there were trouble .
They are the ones who speak Arabs and are unleashing the biggest level of violence on the Persians so far .
Another wave arrived recently and there is chatter that yet another wave of Hizbullah reinforcements are coming in from Lebanon as we speak .
According to Iranians on the ground , they are the ones riding motorcycles , beating men women and children indiscriminately and firing live ammunitions at students .
The Lebanese Hizbullah is a direct offshoot ( and under direct control ) of the Iranian Hizbullah ( itself under direct control of the Supreme Leader ) and cooperates closely with Ansar though Ansar occupies itself only with Iran ’s domestic policies , while Hizbullah occupies itself only with Iran ’s foreign policy unless there is a crisis like right now .
However , Hizbullah has been called to stop violent riots in Iran in the past .
What will happen
Unless the army decides to intervene in the favor of the Council and to stop the early beginnings of the new Revolution , Ansar & Hizbullah members will be the ones doing the brunt of the killing and repression with Basij as a support while also protecting government buildings and try to do crowd control .
The police seems to have for the most part disbanded in centers like Tehran according to all reports , including international media .
If the police decides to come back , they will focus less on protection and crowd control , so the Basij will start to crack more skulls ) .
Currently , this is what is happening .
Timeline
note : I built this through both articles and twitter feeds , so I do not claim that this is a 100 % factually correct representation of reality , but this is the general narrative .
– When the first spontaneous riots erupted , the first wave the Iranian Riot Police was called in , and short after the Basij also took the scene .
The RP concentrated mostly around public buildings and streets while the Basij took position around student groups , especiallly universities .
– As things got more out of hand , more and more Basij troops were called in , as the police started dispersing .
The riot police are less inclined ( or , rather I should say the Basij are more inclined ) to use violence so they retreated and leaving the place to the Basij .
– With the second wave of Basij also came Ansar Hizbullah members .
This is the point where firearms started being used .
There are reports of a few murders but it was mostly fired in the air or on walls in order to scare away protesters in University dorms .
– It ’s around the time of the second wave that the first reports and videos of an important number of non-Persian thugs shouting in Arabic and violently beating people with chains , clubs and electric batons ( similar to cattle prods ) .
The end of the second wave came right before the beginning of the current manifestation .
Things were getting quieter with only sporadic reports of dissenters being assaulted .
Important to note : at this time .
the Supreme Leader has authorized these militias to use live ammunition against the crowd if things get out of hand ( source : BBC )
– This brings us to the third wave , which just began around 12:30 PM for those of us on the East Coast .
According to all reports , plainclothes militia have opened fire on civilians protesting peacefully .
Right now , there is chaos in the streets , reports of fighting all over Tehran , plenty of pictures of people shot , some to death .
Things are ugly and this is spreading in other cities as well .
There is a major crackdown on students , especially those with connections to the outside world going on right now .
Some people report that the students are fighting back in some areas .
Telephones are being bugged and everyone twittering and sending videos outside of Iran are being rounded up .
Violent and murderous repression has started .
At least a twenty people have been killed so far .
Things will spiral down fast , and very soon .
– The people are fighting back .
First , they took over and burned down a Basij base , killing its commander .
Then , they attacked the Basij HQ with molotov cocktails and there are reports of Basij beaten to death as well .
Right now , most people have gone to sleep and there is a major manifestation tomorrow as well , including a general strike all over Iran .
This is the end of the third wave .
– Major events during the third wave : Basij bases have been attacked , and the Basij HQ has been burned to the ground .
A Basij shot a girl in the face in front of their HQ , at which point a policeman went to confront them .
The Basij beat the policeman , at which point students stormed the compound , throwing molotov cocktails , burning it to the ground .
This is big .
Links
For further information on the Basij , Global Security has a good article about the history of the Basij .
CNN has a good article where eyewitnesses describe the current violence unleashed by the Basij here
Here is another good article from GS again giving more background information on the ruthless Ansar thugs .
So , what can you do about this ?
Good question .
How about talking about it ?
You know - passing along information of some importance to US National Security to the rank and file people in this country .
Since most of them do n’t get any decent information from the regular media , a lot of Americans have no idea anything important is happening .
Wake them up !
This is a textbook example of the Four Boxes in operation .
The people in Iran have tried the first three boxes , and their government has responded with violence .
The protesters have already struck back against the Basij , and the die has now been cast .
Blood has been spilled , and hundreds of thousands of people in Iran are beginning to strike back .
Thousands of people in the 101st Global Internet Brigade ( the Fightin ’ Keyboardists ! ) are lending what support they can , but the curious refusal of the American media outlets ( especially CNN ) to give this story the attention it deserves borders on criminal neglect .
Something important and wonderful is happening , but the reports of this event are being smothered in a blanket of “ meh “ !

The government is trying to get a grip on its sprawling estate of websites by taking the revolutionary step of actually verifying how much traffic they generate .
The Central Office of Information says it is " driving forward a programme of work to assess the value for money of government websites to the taxpayer " .
It has taken on ABCe to " independently validate the figures generated by an audit of government websites " .
All the government 's departments will be required to submit their figures to the organisation , which will enforce a consistent set of measurements for users , impressions and number and length of visits .
The COI Board Director for Interactive Services Alex Butler said in a statement that : “ We are determined to drive up the quality of government websites to ensure they offer excellent value for money for the taxpayer , and a better user experience . "
That commitment has been a while coming .
While governments are famous for not wanting to divulge information , this one in particular has used a galaxy of websites to do so , some of which have generated absurdly paltry viewing figures .
Last April , the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts found that the Government is not entirely sure how many websites it has , but believes there could be as many as 2,500 .
Nor does it know how much these websites costs or if anyone is using them .
The committee 's guesstimate for the total cost of the .gov.uk estate is £ 208m .
Earlier this year , Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Angela Eagle revealed that the main Treasury site www.hm-treasury.gov.uk had 266,462 visitors last March , before steadily sliding down to 80,548 in September .
Figures spiked to 465,585 visits in October and 245,986 in November - presumably because of the worldwide financial meltdown .
By February they had slumped again to 152,542 .
Other Treasury sites turned in comically low numbers .
isb.gov.uk's ( Invest to Save Budget to you ) visitors has ranged between 6,359 and 2,092 over the last year .
The Financial Inclusion Taskforce 's site , launched last October , pulled in 985 visitors in its first month , before slumping to 353 the following month .
By March it had dragged itself up to 1,156 . ®
A new plagiarism detection service says that it can help track down copied text on the Internet — but it is any better than a search engine ?
We put it to the test with some of our own content .
Plagium is simple to use : enter text into a box and hit the " track plagiarisms " button .
Site operator Septet Systems says that Plagium uses " Septet ’s proprietary TX Miner engine , which employs advanced search technology for deep mining of documents on the public World Wide Web or within private repositories , " but the actual search results are generated with the Yahoo Search API .
This raises the obvious question : why not just use a search engine in the first place ?
For one thing , Plagium can handle longer strings of text than most search engines ( Google tops out at 32 words per query ) .
Plagium can also generate alerts for a given text string , notifying users by e-mail whenever a new instance of the text appears on the Web .
Finally , it generates a cool graph .
The graph above is a " text usage timeline " showing how often a particular bit of text has appeared on the Web ; it shows up just above a more traditional list of search results .
We ran two Ars articles through Plagium to see how they fared .
The first was our " Dealing with PlayStation 2 disc read errors , " an old piece from 2003 that ( amazingly ) continues to generate pageviews and e-mail .
Sticking one paragraph from it into Plagium brought up 13 documents .
Most were direct rip jobs of the entire article , usually by small - time bloggers .
It goes without saying that such rips featured neither links or attribution , and the really classy ones just inline the images from the post right off our server .
But Plagium cautions that it can't actually " detect " plagiarism — it merely points out possible problems .
Case in point : two years ago , someone posted a question on Yahoo Answers .
It read , " Why dose my old ps2 say disc read error and what can i do to correct it ? "
One of the responses linked the Ars article but also copied eight full paragraphs of text .
That 's a substantial borrowing , but it still might qualify as fair use were it ever to come up in court .
A Google search turned up essentially the same list of sites , despite truncating the input at 32 words .
Testing a second ( and more recent ) piece on Spore 's DRM brought up 10 hits , including the original article .
Google , though , only generated three hits , including the original article .
Given Plagium 's cost ( free ) , decent results , and alert system , it 's certainly worth a try for specialized plagiarism detection .
For the occasional one - off search , however , a traditional search engine will also do a fine job .
The site competes against Copyscape , which offers similar services ( but charges for them ) .
Plagiarism Today ran some tests of its own on both tools and concluded that " in all five tests , Google outperformed both Plagium and Copyscape .
However , it contained a very high amount of duplicate results and the benefit was likely minimal . "
Other plagiarism detection tools like TurnItIn focus on academic plagiarism rather than website copying , and serve a different market .
My own experience with grading collegiate papers quickly taught me that the students likely to do even the minimal work of calling up an academic paper through a database or finding it in the library were unlikely to then plagiarize its content in any brazen way ( improper citation practices were another story ) .
Those who did plagiarize tended to do so in an unsophisticated way , ripping off content from the Web that could easily be found with a simple search .
All that 's to say that sites like Plagium , though they target the Web , will probably catch plenty of less - sophisticated academic plagiarists as well .

Environmentalists push for tougher regulation of chemicals meant to help the ozone layer .
Air - conditioning in cars is a major HFC source .
Alan Schein Photogr./ Corbis
Modern refrigerants designed to protect the ozone layer are poised to become a major contributor to global warming because of their future explosive growth in the developing world , scientists report this week .
Hydrofluorocarbon chemicals ( HFCs ) were developed to phase out ozone - depleting gases , in response to the Montreal Protocol .
But they can be hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide as greenhouse gases in trapping heat .
HFCs are deployed in refrigerators and air - conditioning units , and their use is poised to grow in the coming decades .
In the new study , a team led by Guus Velders at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency in Bilthoven analysed the latest industry trends and then modelled HFC production to 2050 .
Their results suggest that HFC emissions could be the equivalent of between 5.5 billion and 8.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually by 2010 — roughly 19 % of the projected CO 2 emissions if greenhouse gases continue to rise unchecked ( G. J. M. Velders et al.
Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA doi:10.1073/pnas.0902817106 2009 ) .
The new numbers will fuel the efforts of environmentalists and others who have been pushing for aggressive new HFC regulations .
Manufacturers could shift towards using HFCs with the lowest climate impact during the transition to a new generation of refrigerants — still under development — that affect neither the ozone layer nor the climate .
" Now is the moment to make a decision to steer this in a direction that you want , " Velders says .
" The developing world is already in the transition to HFCs . "
Although it makes no policy recommendations , the study could play into an ongoing political debate on regulating the chemicals .
HFCs currently fall under the umbrella of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change , but advocates say the fastest and cheapest way to handle them is under the ozone treaty .
Montreal delegates plan to discuss the issue when they meet in Geneva next month .
“ Now is the moment to make a decision to steer this in a direction that you want . ”
Guus Velders
Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency
Durwood Zaelke , who heads the advocacy group Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Washington DC , says the Velders study confirms the potential benefits of regulating HFCs under the Montreal agreement .
It will , he says , help build momentum as the delegates move towards a decision in November .
The Montreal treaty , which came into force in 1989 , has implementation experts in virtually every country and has already succeeded in reducing 96 chemicals by 97 % each , Zaelke says .
" It 's a winning record , and we need to give the treaty this shot . "
In 2007 , Velders ' team looked at the effect of the Montreal Protocol and found that its incidental greenhouse - gas reductions — equivalent to 11 billion tonnes of CO 2 annually by 2010 — are five to six times greater than those of the Kyoto Protocol .
Montreal participants had already agreed to phase out chlorofluorocarbons by 2010 and hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2040 , but the Velders study helped convince them to accelerate phasing out the latter by a decade in order to capture the climate benefits .
The latest study carries that work forward and suggests that the problem posed by HFCs could be several times larger than projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in its 2007 assessment .
Using the IPCC 's baseline economic scenarios , the work assumes that refrigerant technologies will be deployed at levels roughly equal to those in the developed world today .
By mid-century , emissions in currently developing countries would rise to levels eight times higher than those in developed nations .
Venkatachalam Ramaswamy , a coordinating lead author of the IPCC chapter covering HFCs who was not involved in the study , called the paper " a very good piece of work " .
" It elevates the importance of HFCs in terms of climate forcing to a level higher than we may have thought initially , " says Ramaswamy , a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration 's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton , New Jersey .
Still , he says , it " does n't significantly detract from the attention that CO 2 and methane should be getting . "
The Minnesota Supreme Court is still deliberating on Norm Coleman 's latest appeal in the drawn out Senate Election of 2008 ; but at this point their ruling merely appears to be a legal formality .
Even Minnesota 's Republican Governor , Tim Pawlenty , has indicated his intent to adhere to the MNSC 's ruling by signing the Election Certificate should Al Franken be declared the victor .
With a ruling likely to come this week or next , Al Franken seems poised to become the legal victor , and there is n't anything anybody can do about it .
Michael Brodkorb of MinnesotaDemocratsExposed.com does however seem intent on altering the public 's perception .
On June 8th , just five days before his election as the new Deputy Chair of the Minnesota Republican Party , he filed public data practice requests with seven of Minnesota 's counties seeking photocopies of rejected absentee ballots .
Mr. Brodkorb filed his two page request with the counties of Anoka , Carver , Dakota , Hennepin , Olmsted , Sherburne and Washington , and the cities of Edina , Minnetonka , Orono and Plymouth .
The following excerpt contains the request sent to Anoka County :
Michael Brobkorb
[ Poorly Redacted Address ] June 8 , 2008 Rachel Smith
Anoka County
325 E Main St W130
Anoka , MN 55303- 2465
Re : Data Practices Request
This correspondence is a request for access to public information and data relating to the 2008 general election for United States Senator in your county under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act ( " MGDPA " ) , Minnesota Statutes , Chapter 13 .
Minnesota Statutes § 15.17 requires all government entities to make and maintain all records relative to their official activities .
Minnesota Statutes § 13.03 , subdivision 1 requires all government entities to keep records that contain government data in a way ( or ways ) that makes the data easily accessible for convenient use .
The undersigned requests copies of that portion of the front side of all ballots relative to the 2008 United States Senate general election contained within rejected absentee ballot envelopes in your possession that were not submitted late and were not submitted by persons who otherwise voted in the 2008 general election ( either in person or by replacement absentee ballot ) .
This request does not seek to have the undersigned open or unseal any absentee ballot envelopes ; to the extent any such envelopes have not yet been opened , the undersigned requests that an election judge do so .
This request also does not seek access to any data regarding any individuals , including voter registration applications , voter registration lists or any other information related thereto and subject to restricted access under Minnesota Statutes § 201.091 .
Finally , this request does not seek copies of the absentee ballot envelopes themselves or any accompanying materials , such as absentee ballot applications .
In short , this request in no way seeks to ascertain which person (s ) voted for which candidate (s ) .
The request can be easily complied with while protecting the secrecy of the ballots .
This information / data is clearly public information under the MGDPA .
As you know , Minn .
Stat . § 13.03 , subdivision 1 provides that all government data collected , created , received or maintained is public information unless classified by statute , federal law or temporary classification as confidential , private , nonpublic or protected nonpublic data .
No such classification exists for the information requested .
No Minnesota statute provides that the ballots contained within uncounted rejected absentee ballot envelopes is nonpublic or private information if opened by an election judge ; although Minnesota law requires you to securely maintain all election materials , no Minnesota statute exists which denies the public the right to inspect and / or receive copies of the ballots contained within rejected absentee ballot envelopes .
As the agency with jurisdiction over all ballots and election materials within your county , it is your duty to comply with data practices requests under the MGDPA and the undersigned is not aware of any statutory or other authority which prohibits you from opening the rejected absentee ballot envelopes while maintaining the secrecy of each person 's intended vote for the purposes of complying with this request .
There is simply no risk whatsoever that the secrecy of any ballot ( s ) will be compromised .
Again , this request seeks only a photocopy of the section of ballots relative to the 2008 general election for United States Senator contained within certain rejected absentee ballot envelopes in your possession or under your control and in no way seeks to ascertain which person (s ) voted for which candidate (s ) .
...
Thank you .
Sincerely , Michael B. Brodkorb [ emphasis added ]

There are several catastrophic assumptions and falsehoods located within Brodkorb 's meager request .
I 've bolded the fallacious and contradictory portions from his request above and will now address each item below .
Let 's begin by addressing the issue raised within the first bolded portion ; the need for an election judge to open the requested ballots .
This triggers two questions , the first of which I will now address .
It is necessary for an election judge to open the currently sealed and rejected absentee ballots because of MN § 13.37 :
13.37 GENERAL NONPUBLIC DATA .
Subd .
2 . Classification .
The following government data is classified as nonpublic data with regard to data not on individuals , pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 9 , and as private data with regard to data on individuals , pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 12 : Security information ; trade secret information ; sealed absentee ballots prior to opening by an election judge ; sealed bids , including the number of bids received , prior to the opening of the bids ; parking space leasing data ; and labor relations information , provided that specific labor relations information which relates to a specific labor organization is classified as protected nonpublic data pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 13 .

9 . Nonpublic data .
" Nonpublic data " means data not on individuals that is made by statute or federal law applicable to the data : ( a ) not accessible to the public ; and ( b ) accessible to the subject , if any , of the data .
... Subd. 12 . Private data on individuals .
" Private data on individuals " means data which is made by statute or federal law applicable to the data : ( a ) not public ; and ( b ) accessible to the individual subject of that data .
Source : 13.02 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes via Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes
Minnesota § 13.37 essentially states that unopened absentee ballots are private data and are therefore inaccessible to the general public .
The subject of this request , rejected absentee ballots , are currently unopened and therefore qualify for protection under § 13.37 .
Brodkorb may think he is circumventing § 13.37 by explicitly asking the election judges to open his requested ballots , but data practice requests do not fall within the duties of elections judges with regard to opening absentee ballots .
In fact the only mechanism by which absentee ballots can be opened by an election judge falls within the jurisdiction of § 203B .
12 :
203B.12 ELECTION JUDGES TO RECEIVE AND COUNT BALLOTS .
Subd .
4 . Placement in container ; opening and counting of ballots .
The ballot envelopes from return envelopes marked " Accepted " shall be placed by the election judges in a separate absentee ballot container .
The container and each ballot envelope may be opened only after the last regular mail delivery by the United States postal service on election day .
The ballots shall then be initialed by the election judges in the same manner as ballots delivered by them to voters in person and shall be deposited in the appropriate ballot box .
[ emphasis added ]
Source : 203B.12 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes via Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes
The rejected absentee ballots requested by Brodkorb are not marked with " Accepted " by definition because they were " Rejected " under § 203B .12 subd 2 .
As a result of their current " Rejected " status , the absentee ballots in question would never qualify for the " separate absentee ballot container " and could therefore never be opened by an election judge .
At this point , the first half of Brodkorb 's argument is clear ; he wants election officials to open his requested rejected ballots .
Brodkorb then justifies this request by stating , in the second bolded portion , that the ballots then become public data if they are opened by election officials .
It does n't make a whole lot of sense ; he is attempting to justify one action with another .
The rejected ballots are private data , so to make them public , an election judge needs to open them ; but an election judge cannot open them because they are rejected .
Brodkorb 's entire argument is circular and without merit .
After seventeen days , Brodkorb posted a follow - up to his data practice requests :
I have received responses to all of my requests for public data and every county and city has denied my request .
I 'm reviewing my options and I 'll have updates on this subject in the next 24 hours on Minnesota Democrats Exposed .
Source : Update : MDE Exclusive : Data Practices Request Filed Today Requesting Copies of Certain Rejected Absentee Ballots via Minnesota Democrats Exposed
Brodkorb 's request appears to have been flatly denied by each jurisdiction .
He does however have at least one other option .
Brodkorb could bring forth an action to compel discovery of these rejected ballots in accordance with MN § 13.03 subd .
6 . I do n't know how this would work , or if rejected absentee ballots even qualify for discoverability .
It will be interesting to see if Brodkorb continues to pursue these data practice requests when he becomes the new Deputy Chair of the Minnesota Republican Party this Wednesday .
Scientists believe they have deduced what sustains the noodly appendages of a galactic " spaghetti monster " - actually Galaxy NGC 1275 in Perseus - which displays " a mammoth network of spaghetti - like gas filaments around a black hole " , as New Scientist puts it .
NS explains : " As the black hole sucks in gas from its surroundings , it powers jets of matter that produce bubbles of energetic particles in the surrounding cluster gas .
As these bubbles grow and rise , cooled gas from NGC 1275 's core gets drawn into long tendrils in their wake , like the strings that trail behind balloons . "
Fair enough , although until now no one had been able to work out why these delicate filaments were n't destroyed by the immense magnetic power of the galaxy .
Cue a close perusal of Hubble snaps of NCG 1275 by Andrew Fabian and colleagues at Cambridge University .
They noted that the filaments - extending 300,000 light years - are actually comprised of " a number of thin threads " measuring 20,000 light years .
These are " so tenuous that magnetic fields are the only thing that can protect them from being destroyed " , according to Fabian .
The fields are believed to " get their start " close to the black hole , and while the researchers estimate they 're a mere " 0.01 per cent as strong as the field on the Earth 's surface " , they 're able to " hold onto " the filaments by acting on charged particles ( protons , electrons , etc ) in the filaments ' gas .
The result of this influence is to prevent the gas , weighing in at a modest few hundred degrees Celsius , from " evaporating away into the 40 million °C sauna of surrounding cluster gas " .
Although the filaments appear to lead a fairly precarious existence , their speed indicates they 've been resisting evaporation for more than 100 million years , during which the sustaining magnetic fields may also have prevented their gas collapsing to form stars .
If so , this could help scientists resolve a cosmology poser : why there are " fewer high - mass galaxies than models predict " .
Astronomers reckon some massive galaxies are prevented from expanding further by black holes which are " devouring their surroundings and spewing out jets " .
These jets heat up the galactic gas to such a degree that it simply expands out into the ether , preventing star formation .
Patrick Ogle of Caltech suggested that gas filaments such as those demonstrated in NCG 1275 might also be a contributory factor in some cases in explaining " why these galaxies do n't grow bigger than they do " .
The latest NGC 1275 finding can be found in Nature ( vol 454 , p 968 ) . ®
Will We Avert Ecological Collapse ?

The cataclysmic consequences of unsustainable development pose a challenge to the world that will make the war on terror seem a mere distraction .
One possible outcome of unchecked population growth .

One possible outcome of unchecked population growth .
Image source : e-text population material
So begins a recent article summarizing what Jeffrey Sachs , director of the UN Millennium Project , told participants in a keynote address at the fourth biennial State of the Planet conference at Columbia University .
The story did n’t make front page news , but it ’s a sign the environmental plight we ’re facing is beginning , at least , to emerge into the mainstream media .
The message is that there is less time than most assume for the human species to address a collection of factors wreaking havoc on the environment .
Those factors are headed by the interaction of population growth and growth of per captia resource consumption .
Understanding exponential growth
Let me explain .
Lots of things are characterized by exponential growth .
In the absence of intervening factors all animal populations ( including humans ) , for instance , grow exponentially .
Economic growth , as well , is often exponential .
Population growth and economic growth combine , moreover , to drive the growth of our consumption of natural resources which , therefore , becomes exponential as well .
But how is exponential growth important ?
Well , when something grows exponentially , its growth will often look relatively unremarkable for a period of time .
At a certain point , however , its geometric progression means that the growth suddenly becomes explosive — far more so than one would have guessed just a short time before that point .
An old French riddle makes this clear : Suppose you own a pond , at one end of which is a lily pad .
The lily plant is growing and you know it will double in size each day .
If it grows without interference , you know it will completely cover the pond in 30 days , blocking sunlight , causing a die - off of all life in the pond .
You know that at some point you ’ll have to devote a few days to dealing with the lily plant , and decide to wait to do so once until it has covered half the pond .
How much time have you left yourself to save the pond from destruction ?
To answer that , you have to know on what day the pond will be half covered .
Contrary to intuition , that will be the 29th day .
On the 30th day the plant will double in size , completely covering the pond .
Therefore , you have left yourself only one day to save the pond !
Could you have seen that coming just from watching the plant ’s growth and using common sense to guess when you would really need to intervene ?
Not likely .
Notice that on day 24 only 1.56 % of the pond was covered .
On day 28 the pond is 25 % covered .
Even that might not be particularly alarming .
It would only become alarming if you should project accurately ahead to realize the lily ’s growth had taken off like a rocket and had now exceeded your ability to intervene in time to save the pond .
Where we stand today
Sadly , when we look today at the human ecological footprint a good deal of evidence suggests we ’re approaching day 30 faster than most people would think .
World population growth and our rate of resource consumption ( driven largely by economic growth ) have been following an essentially exponential path .
In recent years cultural and other factors have slowed the rate of population growth , but the growth is still exponential . [ 1 ]
We ’ve come to the kind of explosive growth seen in the last few days of the pond above .
The result has been unprecedented environmental destruction .
We ’re seeing climate change , depletion of the oceans ’ fishes and coral reefs , profound effects of deforestation , a 1,000 fold increase in the normal rate of species extinction to a current conservative estimate of about 27 species per day ( based on 1,000 species per million lost per year , and a conservative estimate of 10 million species ) , the global spread of chemical toxins throughout the environment , and many other environmental stresses .
To make matters worse , we are also at a point of increased risk of disease purely as a result of our increased numbers in a time of great mobility .
The environmental stresses listed above are signs we have now overshot the earth ’s carrying capacity .
The addition of several billion humans and counting , and its impact on environmental systems nudges us steadily and quickly toward an ecological breaking point .
The need for coordinated worldwide efforts at analysis and intervention is now something we are foolish to ignore .
Unfortunately most people are oblivious to the problem because they ’re applying only common sense .
If one merely looks around without doing some research or without a keen appreciation for exponential growth , the state of the “ pond ” might not yet appear so alarming .
It might look like day 28 , for instance .
But what ’s going to happen in just a “ day ” or two ?
To see this more clearly we need only look at a graph of human population growth over history :
Clearly , we are in the explosive growth phase !
And with each step in that population growth comes the expected increase in environmental impact .
That means we have little time left to take steps to avoid what may be profoundly regrettable worldwide societal and environmental consequences .
Scientists have been warning us of the problem of population growth and the associated growth in our ecological footprint for some years now .
They continue today .
We are at a crucial time in human history .
What if we ignore this ?
What if we do n’t intervene ?
As Al Bartlett explains so clearly , population growth will stop .
Exponential growth ( or any kind of growth ) cannot continue forever on a finite planet .
At current or even slower rates , if nothing happened to stop it , humans would soon cover the planet with people jammed toe to toe .
But things will happen .
We are part of , and depend for our very lives on the ecosystem in which we live .
Stress it too far and we will lose its support .
Population growth will stop , then , in one of two ways .
Either nature will take over and choose its own methods for stopping population growth or we can act first and choose our own methods .
Which would be preferable ?
Nature ’s methods are not pleasant .
They include such things as famine , disease , and war .
We see this in animal species .
They can result in die - offs of large numbers of a population , returning it to previous , sustainable levels .
If we wait to let nature take its course , moreover , we must contemplate the level of environmental loss we will by then have witnessed .
We have options
There ’s another way .
As humans we have the unique cognitive capacity to choose our own , less painful methods for ending population growth .
We need to address important correlates of population growth such as poverty and the lack of opportunities for women in developing countries .
As Meadows et al make clear , poverty causes population growth which causes poverty .
We need , as well , national media campaigns and family planning programs .
Population growth in the U.S. is especially destructive to the worldwide environment as our per capita consumption of natural resources is among the highest in the world .
So , with regard to environmental impact , adding one new U.S resident is like adding several people to a typical third world country .
To respond to this , some experts believe the U.S. needs to implement some level of immigration reform .
Understandably , this is a controversial point .
At the time if this writing the contoversy is being played out on Capital Hill as lawmakers struggle with the immigration issue , and in the streets as massive numbers of marchers express opposition to proposed legislation .
Others contend that programs to reduce fertility rates here slightly should alone be sufficient to stabilize the population soon enough to avert disaster .
This could likely be brought about through a diversion of less than 1 % of the military budget to media campaigns and family planning services .
In any case , at present we are barely addressing the problem in any way .
We ’re doing a smidgen more to address consumption levels , but woefully little there as well .
It ’s easy enough to see that to reduce resource consumption we need to do more in familiar areas such as energy conservation while we commit much more to clean , renewable energy sources .
Less obvious to most , and sounding like blasphemy to many , is the suggestion that we need to move away from the endless - growth imperative which dominates the corporate world .
It ’s a prime driver of our increasing ecological footprint .
Our best bet may lie in aiming for for a healthy steady state economy .
We can do our part locally by ceasing activities such as the building of subdivisions which only accommodate population growth while encouraging our automobile dependency .
If we do not take such actions now , if large scale programs are not soon initiated on national and global levels , our children and grandchildren may well be faced , at the least , with a markedly lower standard of living than we now enjoy .
Perhaps more likely , they will be forced to deal with profoundly troubling social and environmental events resulting from ecological collapse .
That is precisely the alarm Jeffrey Sachs is sounding .
In his words , such a collapse is “ the central challenge we face on the planet . ”
It ’s time we recognize it .

For an authoritative , highly readable discussion of the ideas in this essay , I recommend the book Limits to Growth : The 30 - Year Update
[ 1 ]
On a positive note , the populations of some European countries have very recently come close to stabilizing or have actually stabilized .
It ’s a good step , but no credible projections see any similar stabilization for world population any sooner than about 2075 .
By then , world population is likely to have grown from the current 6.5 billion to about 8.9 billion according to the United Nations ’s best guess , their medium scenario ( large PDF ) .
( It could range as high as 10.6 billion .
or as low as 7.4 billion according to the high and low scenarios respectively . )
Note that those projections are , of necessity , based on an assumption of no ecological collapse intervening before 2075 .
No meaningful projection could otherwise be made .
The risk of such a collapse is a matter apart from the U.N. ’s projections .
The projections , moreover , may be optimistic .
More than a few daydreaming co-op shoppers have entertained the notion :
When we get fed up with the rat race , we ’ll move to a sweet patch of land in the country and start up a small organic farm .
After all , people are paying good money for organics , and the market share for this segment is growing every year — what a great cottage industry for a newly minted back - to - the - lander .
Hold on just a minute there .
Before anyone gets too far into their modern agrarian fantasy , they should seek out the May - June issue of In Good Tilth magazine ( not available online ) and read all about the nitty - gritty details of organic farming .
In a series of articles grouped under the cover headline “ Fresh Young Farmers , ” the magazine profiles people who ’ve actually put their hoes to the humus and arrives at an inescapable conclusion :
It ’s really , really hard work — but it ’s also very rewarding for those who ’ve got the right stuff .
In the leadoff article , “ Want to Farm ? ” Katie Kulla , who runs a community - supported agriculture ( CSA ) farm in Oregon with her husband Casey , writes that “ going from the early dream to today ’s farming reality has required more work , money , and time than we ever anticipated . ”
In the spirit of helping others follow their path with fewer obstacles , she offers advice that she wishes she and Casey had gotten before they started : “ Pay off debt and start saving money , ” “ Get in the best physical shape of your life , ” “ Learn about the reality of farming , ” “ Know yourself ( and your partner ) , ” “ Set goals and persevere , ” and “ Stay open . ”
Having doled out these hard truths , Kulla offers encouragement by noting that “ our life is richer and fuller than I thought possible . ”
( Read more about that life on their farm blog . )
In “ Cross - Roads Generation , ” Erin Volheim writes about an influx of young farmers in the Applegate Valley area of southwest Oregon who “ wanted something different for the future , beyond the McJob , ” and started farms in the 1990s .
These Generation Xers had to learn a lot on their own , but they persevered and now are positioned to provide help and advice for the next crew : Generation Y , or the Millennials .
As one of them , “ Mookie ” Moss , says , “ The longer you farm , the more you learn from this dialogue with the land . ”
In “ No Stone Unturned , ” newbie farmer Zoe Bradbury writes that “ anyone who has the passion for farming should have a fair shot at it . ”
She guides prospective farmers through some of the resources available to them , noting that she did n’t always take full advantage of them .
Still , her story is instructive : “ Considering that I was relatively well prepared to take the leap into independent farming , it was still a tough go , ” she writes .

So go ahead and dream — but make sure you do your homework before you buy the farm .
Konik is the largest refugee camp in the Balkans
More than 2,000 Roma ( Gypsies ) who fled Kosovo during the conflict in the 1990s still live in Konik refugee camp near Podgorica , the capital of Montenegro .
The sprawling slum of tents and shacks is built near the largest rubbish dump in Montenegro .
The mayor of Podgorica recently said the refugees should go back to where they came from .
Save the Children is working to integrate the Roma , but few stay long in the local school .
As the UN marks World Refugee Day , Save the Children 's Phoebe Greenwood meets two men who describe appalling living conditions at the largest refugee camp in the Balkans .
VESEB BERISA , AGED 37
My family and I have nothing to eat , nothing to wear , nowhere to take a proper shower .
We have been living like this for 10 years .
Veseb says he wants to leave the camp , but has nowhere to go I work all day every day scouring the rubbish tips for metal to sell and maybe , if I 'm lucky , earn 200 euros ( £ 170 ) a month to feed my family .
We cope because we have to .
I had a job in Kosovo .
I ran my own business buying and selling fruit and vegetables .
I would like to do that here in Montenegro but I can't .
I do n't have any resources .
I 've no money to get started .
The worst thing about the camp is that it 's dirty .
The hygiene here is terrible .
It causes so many health problems .
Everything we have is dirty .
Nothing can stay clean here .
It causes so many health problems .
A lot of people are sick in the camp for lots of different reasons , most often in their lungs because the air here is so foul .
Lots of others have problems with their hearts and blood pressure .
But in 10 years of living here , I 've only seen the UN help one boy who was sick .
It 's too hot here , over 40C in the summer and there is n't enough water .
Water comes into the washing area near the toilets but the water pressure is so low , there is n't enough for all of us .
Some of the kids here go to the local school .
They were given books there but they have no clothes and most of the time they are hungry , so how are they meant to think about learning ?
I would leave now if I could , but where would I go ?
I would like to have a proper house , if only to know that I have my own home , a roof over my head .
I want to leave a house for my children as my father left a house for me .
Piles of rubbish are strewn across Konik I have five children and I 'm worried about their future .
My heart aches for them .
I was sitting here half - an - hour ago , I heard music coming from somewhere and I imagined my family dancing .
But I can only imagine that now .
I know I wo n't see it - it 's not possible any more .
We are in a critical state .
It 's too much .
No - one helps us anymore .
No - one comes to see how we are or how we live .
We want to live as other normal people live do .
We are the same as the other refugees , the Bosnians and Croats who came to this country during the war .
But the refugees from Bosnia have been given houses , all around this camp .
Why do they have different conditions to us ?
Why do we have to live like this ?
We are people too .
We are humans .
We need help from the UN , from the Albanians and Serbs who put us in this situation .
What do they think in America , in the UK ?
They are also responsible for the conditions we live in .
They have done nothing to help us .
HAMZA PAJEZITAJ , AGED 21 I run a business in the camp , cleaning people 's cars and carpets .
I started it two years ago .
I won a competition at the local Catholic Church with my business plan and they gave me 500 euros to get started .
Hamza says most of the refugees are afraid to go out from the camp Sometimes taxi drivers come from the town to get their cars cleaned because I charge three euros and it's five euros in town .
I 'm pretty affordable .
I was 10 when we left Kosovo .
I remember arriving at the camp and thinking it was just too full of people .
There were more than 10,000 people here then and it 's still crowded now .
The people who live around us here are really aggressive .
It 's discrimination .
I do n't have as many problems as most people in the camps because I 've met people from town through my business .
I 'm accepted in a way .
But most of the others who live here feel too afraid to go out .
It 's not so much the local people who fight with us as the local Roma who have lived here for years .
They consider us , refugees , to be a lower status than them .
It 's difficult for us to start any kind of life here because we can't earn money .
We 're not allowed to sell on the streets so most people survive by eating food from garbage cans .
The conditions in the camp are bad .
It 's dirty everywhere and there are n't enough toilets .
The biggest problem people have is to heat enough water to wash themselves and their things .
The air stinks of the piles of rubbish we live in .
The garbage depot is just next door .
It 's the main depot in Montenegro and takes the rubbish for the whole of Podgorica .
They burn rubbish there almost every day and the smoke comes over into the camp .
People have a lot of lung problems here .
Conditions are getting worse because people 's homes are falling apart .
They were only ever meant to be temporary and we 've been living in these huts and tents for 11 years .
The mayor of Podgorica said he wants us to go back to Kosovo but it 's just not possible .
Our houses were burned and our lives there were destroyed .
Those who are lucky go abroad , to Europe .
Others just have to keep their heads down and survive .
I can't go back to Kosovo now .
I have nothing there .
This is my home now .

Either way , it looks pretty crummy now , does n't it ?
What about the rest of you with new , white iPhones ?
Anything to report ?
One more shot of this looker after the break .
Right after its launch , we noted the sundry problems reported by new iPhone 3GS owners , but this is the first time we 've heard tell of this specific one ... and it seems like a doozy .
It 's unclear exactly what caused this , but what is apparent is an unattractive , brownish / pinkish discoloration on the above handset .

Democrats wo n't try to kill ' Do n't Ask , Don't tell ' until 2010 : Frank RAW STORY
Published : Friday April 24 , 2009
Print This Email This Speaking on behalf of Congressional Democrats , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) said Thursday that Democrats wo n't push for a repeal of the Pentagon 's anti-gay " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy until at least 2010 and wo n't include a provision in the current Pentagon budget to drop the policy .
" I believe we should and will do ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' next year , " Frank , a co-chairman of the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender Equality Caucus and the most prominent openly gay member of Congress , told Roll Call .
" We have n't done the preliminary work , the preparatory work .
It would be a mistake to bring it up without a lot of lobbying and a lot of conversation . "
Opponents of the policy , under which gay servicemembers who come out of the closet or are outed by others are discharged from the armed forces , want to attach an amendment to a Pentagon budget bill to get the policy canned .
Frank says he does n't support that route , arguing that it " does n't make sense . "
Those who want the policy nixed " do n't understand the best way to get it done , " Frank said .
" People have to understand the political pressures . "
The Massachusetts Democrat announced his party will put forth a stand - alone bill aiming to kill the policy next year .
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , also openly gay , said her party does n't appear to have the votes to strip the policy from the books .
" We do n't even know the votes in committee , let alone the votes on the floor , " Baldwin said .
" So I think the prediction it will not happen in calendar year 2009 is probably accurate . "
The nonprofit advocacy group Servicemembers Legal Defense Network will launch a push next week aimed at convincing President Barack Obama to abandon the policy , which was instituted in 1993 by President Bill Clinton as a compromise between those who wanted all gays barred from the military and those who wanted gays to be allowed to service .
" The logical place and time for presidential leadership on this issue is next month , when President Obama sends his defense budget to Congress .
President Obama should cut ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' from his budget .
It costs money to fire and replace discharged service members , " an email from the group acquired by Roll Call states .
If Obama keeps the policy , they aver , " he will be effectively approving -- on his watch -- the firing of gays and lesbians from the military .
' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell ' will then become his law , his albatross . "

Advertisement US President Barack Obama has nominated Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the country 's Supreme Court .
Ms Sotomayor , 54 , who has now to be approved by a Senate vote , would be the first Hispanic to take the position .
She would replace Justice David Souter , who announced his retirement from the top US court earlier this month .
Mr Obama said he had chosen Ms Sotomayor after an " exhaustive " process , and paid tribute to her as an " inspiring woman " .
He said she would bring a " depth of experience and a breadth of perspective " to the role .
' No rubber stamp '
In an emotional acceptance speech , Ms Sotomayor said her heart was " bursting with gratitude " .
" I am an ordinary person blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences - today is one of those experiences , " she said .
RISE OF SONIA SOTOMAYOR 1954 Born in South Bronx to Puerto Rican parents
Father died when she was aged nine and her mother raised her 1979 Graduates from Yale and serves as an Assistant District Attorney in New York County 1984
Moves into private practice specialising in intellectual property 1991 George Bush Snr chooses her as a district judge 1997 Bill Clinton nominates her to the circuit court
Profile : Sonia Sotomayor Readers react to nomination
If approved by the Senate , Ms Sotomayor would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the current Supreme Court .
The BBC's Richard Lister , in Washington , says it appears likely she will be confirmed by the Senate - but only after some tough questioning during the confirmation process .
Conservative activists have already challenged comments she made a few years ago that a judge should not dismiss their own gender or ethnicity in deciding cases , our correspondent says .
Mitch McConnell , leader of the Republicans in the chamber , said his colleagues would treat Ms Sotomayor fairly , but stressed that the Senate should not be a " rubber stamp " .
" We will thoroughly examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even - handedly , despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences , " he said .
White House officials told the Associated Press that Ms Sotomayor would bring more judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any other justice confirmed in the past 70 years .
Bronx background Mr Obama had stressed the need to appoint a justice who had life experience as well as legal capabilities .
Ms Sotomayor was raised on a housing estate in the Bronx - in one of New York City 's most deprived areas .
She is said to have been inspired by the Perry Mason TV series to become a judge , and was educated at both Princeton and Yale .
She has been nominated to serve as a judge by both Republican and Democrat presidents .
In 1991 , George H W Bush named her a district judge and his successor in the White House , Bill Clinton , nominated her to the circuit court in 1997 .
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the US , and has the authority to strike down any state or federal law it deems unconstitutional .
Each of the nine Supreme Court justices is nominated to the post for life .
Of the incumbents , four are regarded as liberal , four as conservative and one is seen as unaligned .
If appointed , Ms Sotomayor is expected to be on the liberal wing - leaving the political balance unchanged as Mr Souter is also a liberal .
US MEDIA REACTION TO THE SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION Latino groups have been grumbling somewhat about their representation ( or lack thereof ) in the Obama administration , as well as the fact that immigration reform does n't appear to be on the White House 's front - burner .
But this pick buys Obama A LOT of time with Hispanics - a demographic he won last year , 67%- 31 % - on immigration and other issues .
Is it a coincidence that Obama this week heads out West to Nevada and California , two states with large Latino populations ?
Domenico Montanaro , writing at MSNBC.com , assesses the political strategy behind the nomination .
One advantage for Obama in picking the most left - leaning Hispanic possible / confirmable is that it actually allows the Democrats to - once again - cast Republicans as anti-Hispanic .
The National Review's Jonah Goldberg also has a take on the president 's political calculations .
For someone who has all the usual qualifications to be a Supreme Court Justice , she also has an unusual life story ...
It 's the kind of story that makes you feel good about America and that still resonates as quintessentially American even though social mobility in the United States is n't quite what we like to think .
Matthew Yglesias , blogging at the Centre for American Progress , comments on the symbolism of the choice .
Since she is certain to be confirmed , there are plenty of smart conservatives who will , by midday Tuesday , have done the political cost - benefit analysis : at a time when Republicans are trying to demonstrate that their party can reach beyond rich white men , what mileage is there in doing anything but celebrating such a historic choice ?
Time 's Mark Halperin thinks the Republicans are unlikely to risk much visible opposition to Ms Sotomayor .
I am ... not favorably impressed with her notorious statement that " a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life . "
Not only is it objectionable in and of itself , it also suggests that Sotomayor is a committed believer in the identity politics school of left - wing thought .
Worse , it implies that she believes that it is legitimate for judges to base decisions in part based on their ethnic or racial origins .
Ilya Somin , writing at the Volokh Conspiracy , lays out the conservative case against Ms Sotomayor .

Who Owns Your Computer ?
When technology serves its owners , it is liberating .
When it is designed to serve others , over the owner ’s objection , it is oppressive .
There ’s a battle raging on your computer right now — one that pits you against worms and viruses , Trojans , spyware , automatic update features and digital rights management technologies .
It ’s the battle to determine who owns your computer .
You own your computer , of course .
You bought it .
You paid for it .
But how much control do you really have over what happens on your machine ?
Technically you might have bought the hardware and software , but you have less control over what it ’s doing behind the scenes .
Using the hacker sense of the term , your computer is “ owned ” by other people .
It used to be that only malicious hackers were trying to own your computers .
Whether through worms , viruses , Trojans or other means , they would try to install some kind of remote - control program onto your system .
Then they ’d use your computers to sniff passwords , make fraudulent bank transactions , send spam , initiate phishing attacks and so on .
Estimates are that somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions of computers are members of remotely controlled “ bot ” networks .
Owned .
Now , things are not so simple .
There are all sorts of interests vying for control of your computer .
There are media companies that want to control what you can do with the music and videos they sell you .
There are companies that use software as a conduit to collect marketing information , deliver advertising or do whatever it is their real owners require .
And there are software companies that are trying to make money by pleasing not only their customers , but other companies they ally themselves with .
All these companies want to own your computer .
Some examples :
Entertainment software :
In October 2005 , it emerged that Sony had distributed a rootkit with several music CDs — the same kind of software that crackers use to own people ’s computers .
This rootkit secretly installed itself when the music CD was played on a computer .
Its purpose was to prevent people from doing things with the music that Sony did n’t approve of :
It was a DRM system .
If the exact same piece of software had been installed secretly by a hacker , this would have been an illegal act .
But Sony believed that it had legitimate reasons for wanting to own its customers ’ machines .

Antivirus :
You might have expected your antivirus software to detect Sony ’s rootkit .
After all , that ’s why you bought it .
But initially , the security programs sold by Symantec and others did not detect it , because Sony had asked them not to .
You might have thought that the software you bought was working for you , but you would have been wrong .

Internet services : Hotmail allows you to blacklist certain e-mail addresses , so that mail from them automatically goes into your spam trap .
Have you ever tried blocking all that incessant marketing e-mail from Microsoft ?
You can’t .

Application software : Internet Explorer users might have expected the program to incorporate easy - to - use cookie handling and pop-up blockers .
After all , other browsers do , and users have found them useful in defending against Internet annoyances .
But Microsoft is n’t just selling software to you ; it sells Internet advertising as well .
It is n’t in the company ’s best interest to offer users features that would adversely affect its business partners .

Spyware : Spyware is nothing but someone else trying to own your computer .
These programs eavesdrop on your behavior and report back to their real owners — sometimes without your knowledge or consent — about your behavior .

Internet security :
It recently came out that the firewall in Microsoft Vista will ship with half its protections turned off .
Microsoft claims that large enterprise users demanded this default configuration , but that makes no sense .
It ’s far more likely that Microsoft just does n’t want adware — and DRM spyware — blocked by default .

Update : Automatic update features are another way software companies try to own your computer .
While they can be useful for improving security , they also require you to trust your software vendor not to disable your computer for nonpayment , breach of contract or other presumed infractions .
Adware , software - as - a - service and Google Desktop search are all examples of some other company trying to own your computer .
And Trusted Computing will only make the problem worse .
There is an inherent insecurity to technologies that try to own people ’s computers :
They allow individuals other than the computers ’ legitimate owners to enforce policy on those machines .
These systems invite attackers to assume the role of the third party and turn a user ’s device against him .
Remember the Sony story :
The most insecure feature in that DRM system was a cloaking mechanism that gave the rootkit control over whether you could see it executing or spot its files on your hard disk .
By taking ownership away from you , it reduced your security .
If left to grow , these external control systems will fundamentally change your relationship with your computer .
They will make your computer much less useful by letting corporations limit what you can do with it .
They will make your computer much less reliable because you will no longer have control of what is running on your machine , what it does , and how the various software components interact .
At the extreme , they will transform your computer into a glorified boob tube .
You can fight back against this trend by only using software that respects your boundaries .
Boycott companies that do n’t honestly serve their customers , that do n’t disclose their alliances , that treat users like marketing assets .
Use open - source software — software created and owned by users , with no hidden agendas , no secret alliances and no back - room marketing deals .
Just because computers were a liberating force in the past does n’t mean they will be in the future .
There is enormous political and economic power behind the idea that you should n’t truly own your computer or your software , despite having paid for it .
