Stampede in narrow , slippery passage leading to Chamunda temple
JODHPUR : At least 147 people were killed and 67 others were critically injured in a stampede triggered by severe overcrowding in a narrow , slippery passage at the Chamunda temple in Jodhpur ’s Mehrangarh Fort early Tuesday morning .
Thousands of devotees had gathered at the famous temple of Goddess Chamunda to offer prayers on the first day of the nine - day Navratri festival .
The temple is inside the massive 15th century fort built on a hillock overlooking the city .
Most of the killed were teenagers and youths .
The administration had arranged a separate passage for the women and children and , as such , the casualties were considerably restricted .
“ There has been no casualty in the queue for women in which a large number of children were also present , ” Inspector General of Police ( Jodhpur ) , Rajiv Dasot said .
Police said initial reports indicated that coconut water spilled on the narrow incline to the temple lead people to slip and trample upon one another .
Thousands of devotees carrying coconuts for the deity smashed these open in the passage itself as they inched towards the sanctum sanctorum around 5:30 am .
Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said , “ There was a huge rush in the queue for men and some people slipped causing panic and stampede . ”
Eyewitnesses told reporters that as some devotees slipped on the 75 - metre slope , others fell on them causing the stampede .
Chief Minister Vasundhara
Raje flew to the city and ordered an nquiry by a former high court judge .
The state government has announced a compensation of Rs2 lakh each for the kin of the dead and Rs50,000 for the injured .
The incident sent a shock wave throughout the city and hospitals remained crowded through the day with the families and relatives of the dead and the injured .
For almost an hour after the incident the road from the Fort to the government hospital was filled with ambulances and other vehicles transporting bodies and the wounded .
The Army was called for assistance .
The hospital arrangement too took a beating under such a large rush of people .
Irked at the poor arrangement , family members and relatives of the victims manhandled the Jodhpur BJP MP Jaswant Singh Vishnoi who had gone to see the wounded .
Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot too visited the hospitals .

Hanke and other economists see some similarities with Japan ’s decade - long economic malaise – combination of real estate asset bubble , banking crisis and misguided and expensive government intervention .
“ A lot of the symptoms of the pain and adjustments will be exactly the same , “ says Hanke , now with the Cato Institute and Johns Hopkins University .
“ We 've got some major adjustments coming in the economy , some major slowdowns . ”
Depending on who you ask , that means anywhere between two to five years of no growth or slow growth , while the government rescue plan plays out along , the housing and real estate sectors stagger to recovery and the American consumer restores his own shaken balance sheet .
Opponents of the $ 700 billion plan see no payoff for the real economy .
“ This plan is not about housing , not unless you ’re talking about investment houses , ” says FAO - Economics Chief Economist Robert Brusca .
“ This is not a plan aimed at reviving the economy .
This is all about trickle down . ”
For Investors
Even those who view the plan as necessary but insufficient see hard times ahead .
“ The consumer needs repair , job layoffs are increasing , real wages are not increasing , ” says money manager James Awad , managing director at Zephyr Management .
“ In the corporate sector , everybody ’s in a protect - your - balance–sheet - mode .
Most corporate executives are going to think cash is king .
Overseas economies are slowing , which means exports are going to be a bit slower .
So , that leaves the government and the government is constrained by huge deficits . ”
Are we there yet ?
Sorry , but no .
“ This is the beginning of the adjustment and the Fed and Treasury intervention is slowing that down , ” says economist Ram Bhagavatula , managing director at the hedge fund Combinatorics Capital .
“ Its not like this economy is ready to go if credit is cheap and flexible . ”
“ I think it is horrendous , ” says former FDIC Chairman William Isaac .
“ There are less expensive ways to stabilize depositors if people are nervous . ”
Isaac notes that there were some 3,000 bank and savings and loan failures between 1980 - 1991 ; depositors did n't panic “ because they had confidence in the government , ” says Isaac , now chairman of the Secura Group of LECG .
Japan Vs. US Cases
Most economists say the Japanese government made the mistake of extending the country ’s financial problems by one form of intervention or the other – corporate aid packages , repeated stimulus packages with one - off tax rebates that consumers did n’t spend and ever lower interest rates .
The stock market sank and then languished for years .

This should give college frats and engineering students a challenge during the 2008 - 2009 school year .
Leave it to the fine folks boozers in Milwaukee , Wisconsin to devise a way to incorporate PVC plumbing pipe , plastic hoses and 2X4 lumber into a 144 - person beer bong .
This monster made its debut this weekend during the 105th anniversary of Harley Davidson .
Milwaukee Harley is calling this construction project the “ World ’s Largest Beer Bong . ”
Twin keg barrels pump into the piping system
It ’s good to see that America still has that can - do spirit .
The details :
8 drinking sections
18 hoses per section
9 per side
144 total hoses
The previous self - proclaimed world record holding beer bong also came from Wisconsin .
The problem with this 100 - person bong was the wiring .
What we are seeing now is the next generation of bonging .
Better engineering and preparation .

ATWATER , California ( CNN ) -- Jose Rivera survived two tours of duty in Iraq , but his job as a corrections officer at a high - security federal prison in California cost him his life .
Jose Rivera was guarding 100 inmates when he was stabbed to death at a federal prison in California .
Two inmates using a homemade shank are accused of stabbing Rivera to death in June at the United States Penitentiary in Atwater , California .
The inmates -- Jose Sablan , 43 , and James Guerrero , 40 -- were indicted in August and charged with murder .
They have not entered a plea .
" It was two against one , you know , and no one helped him , " said Rivera 's mother , Terry .
" I did n't think that it would happen , but it was not safe for him to work there . "
Rivera was 22 and had been in his job at the 960 - plus inmate prison for just 10 months when he died .
He was alone guarding about 100 inmates at the time of the attack and had a radio to call for backup in case of trouble .
He did n't have what many guards in California 's state prisons routinely count on : pepper spray , a protective vest and a collapsible baton .
Watch how Rivera 's death has ignited debate on guard security »
Federal officers are not allowed to have those items .
CNN asked the federal Bureau of Prisons why it opposes giving its corrections officers nonlethal weapons .
In a statement , the bureau said that the issue is under review and that no final decisions have been made .
" However , " the bureau added , " we also know through 75 years of experience that federal correctional facilities are managed most effectively through frequent and direct communication with inmates . "
" I would call that unproven , " said Chad Trulson , a criminal justice professor at the University of North Texas who has studied prison issues .
" I do n't think that will diminish their communication at all " by giving officers these weapons .
He added that although non-lethal weapons would do little to stop inmates already inclined to attack , they would " make a world of difference " for the officers ' safety .
Rivera 's death has generated support for more protective gear and nonlethal weapons for federal corrections officers and has brought nationwide attention to the threats facing them , according to guards and their union officials .
One officer who has worked for several years at Atwater , where Rivera was killed , said he feels threatened every day .
Unless the federal government provides additional protection , he said , he 's thinking about leaving the job .
The officer requested that his name not be used because he fears retaliation .
He recounted how a fellow corrections officer 's jaw was broken in nine places in an inmate attack last year .
" Every single inmate in there is armed to the teeth for his own protection , " the officer said .
" I am not Bruce Lee , so I can't take on 110 inmates by myself .
...
Every day , it is like David vs. Goliath .
You are taking on the world by yourself . "
Prisoners make shanks like the one used to kill Rivera and other weapons from otherwise benign objects : toothbrushes , toilet parts , cookie sheets , ice picks and kitchen utensils , to name a few .
Gang rivalries exacerbate a volatile situation .
Gearing up is n't the only solution , said union officials who represent the federal prison system 's 15,427 officers .
The American Federation of Government Employees said the federal prisons are severely overcrowded and understaffed .
On average , they are at 136 percent of capacity .
" The homicide rates among the inmate populations are at the highest levels they 've ever been in the history of the Bureau of Prisons , " said Bryan Lowry , the president of the union 's prison councils .
" The assaults on staff , whether weapons or no weapons , has intensified . "
More officers are needed to ensure safety in the federal prisons , which house 165,000 inmates , the union said .
The Bureau of Prisons said that 14 percent of its jobs are unfilled at its 114 prisons and that there is an " urgent need " for officers at several of the high security penitentiaries .
It is taking specific action at Atwater by offering a 17 percent recruitment incentive for new hires .
But the bureau disputed that violence toward guards is on the rise .
Federal officials said the rate of " serious assaults " on staff at penitentiaries has not increased over the past several years .
But they said inmate assaults on both staff and fellow prisoners are more severe .
While not agreeing to provide officers with pepper spay or batons , the bureau said it has reviewed operations at 12 high - security prisons and is making some changes .
The agency said it will buy protective vests and divide inmates into smaller groups when they are being moved .
Two staff members will be added to beef up supervision at the prison housing units .
" The safety and security of our staff continues to be the highest priority of the Bureau of Prisons , " the bureau said in its statement .
It refused an interview request .
Officials in California 's state prison system opened their doors for a CNN crew and talked openly about the nonlethal weapons and other protective gear that have become standard issue .
In the state prisons , each guard wears a stab - resistant vest and carries a can of pepper spray and an expandable baton .
Officers said they would feel completely vulnerable if they did n't have them .
" The population is just too unpredictable , and you never know if they are going to turn on you or not , " said James Walker , warden at the California State Prison - Sacramento .
At that institution , more than 3,000 prisoners are housed in sections depending on their history of violence , whether they have any mental health problems or whether they have posed any danger while incarcerated .
Prison officials said the pepper spray is used several times a week to quell incidents , and officers use their batons at least a few times a month .

White House missing as many as 225 days of e-mail The Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This By PETE YOST
The White House is missing as many as 225 days of e-mail dating back to 2003 and there is little if any likelihood a recovery effort will be completed by the time the Bush administration leaves office , according to an internal White House draft document obtained by The Associated Press .
The nine - page outline of the White House 's e-mail problems invites companies to bid on a project to recover the missing electronic messages .
The work would be carried out through April 19 , 2009 , according to the Office of Administration request for contractors ' proposals , which was dated June 20 .
Last week , the White House declined to comment on the document .
On Wednesday , the White House refused to talk about internal White House contracting procedures , but said the information is " outdated and seriously inaccurate . "
It would not elaborate .
The White House also declined to say whether it has hired a contractor for the work yet .
" With an eye on the clock , the White House continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency , " said Anne Weismann , chief counsel to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a private watchdog group .
The draft document outlines a process in which private contractors would attempt to retrieve lost e-mail from 35,000 disaster recovery backup tapes dating back to October 2003 , a period covering such events as growing violence in Iraq , the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the criminal probe into the disclosure that Valerie Plame had worked for the CIA .
Industry experts point out that relying on the backup system to ensure accurate retention , preservation and retrieval of all e-mails is problematic because it does not take into account deleted e-mails .
" A backup system is n't designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e-mails , " says William P. Lyons , chairman and chief executive of AXS - One , a provider of records compliance management solutions .
" It 's designed to make a copy of data at a specific point - in - time , " said Lyons .
" Data is backed up on a daily , weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy , to ensure to protect the organization from data loss . "
The White House draft document says that the number of days of missing e-mail ranges from 25 to 225 , a range that industry experts say would make it difficult to bid on a recovery project .
" Generally , when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten , I can only take you so seriously , " said Steve Schooner , co-director of the Government Procurement program at George Washington University .
" Contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate , " said Schooner .
At a hearing on Capitol Hill in February , the White House told Congress it was trying to determine how many e-mails were missing .
An earlier analysis from 2005 estimated the number of days of missing e-mails at 473 over a period of 20 months .
While the higher number would appear to suggest the White House has found a large amount of previously missing e-mail , that may not necessarily be the case .
Industry experts say it is unclear from the brief description in the draft document whether the missing - day measurements in that document and those in the earlier analysis can be compared .
" We will continue to work with members of Congress and the National Archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time , " White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore said .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , has said the White House 's failure to properly archive e-mails violated the Presidential Records Act .
The top lawyer for the National Archives has expressed disappointment the White House did not have a formal records management system in place .
USA arms war - torn Africa under the guise of humanitarian aid
The USA has started to expand its military presence in African countries through humanitarian channels , which can only aggravate the tense situation in the continent .
USA arms war - torn Africa under the guise of humanitarian aid
The Pentagon used to control only three percent of the funds assigned as humanitarian aid to Africa ten years ago .
Nowadays , the Pentagon is in charge of 22 percent of those funds , Refugees International ( RI ) said .
Experts are certain that it is absolutely impossible to achieve peace and stability in Africa with the help of US - made weapons and uniforms .
The anti-terrorist struggle , which the USA tries to conduct all over the world , implies the prevention of any type of threat which may come from so - called weakening states , the number of which is more than enough on the continent .
RI ’s experts proved on the example of Liberia and Congo that the US administration had been running out - of - balance policies on the continent .
The funding of diplomatic efforts and various programs has been reduced , whereas the military aid has been increased .
“ The headline is that at the moment [ US ] policies are out of whack , ” said Refugees International President Ken Bacon .
“ That is affecting our ability to act effectively and coherently in Africa and to carry out the war on terrorism in a coherent , long - term and effective way . ”
The US - led policy in such explosive countries as Liberia and Congo is the cheaper version of military actions conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Humanitarian missions have been minimized to the presence of US military men , who establish their own law and order in Africa .
The Pentagon takes the initiative of the USAID and other civil organizations .
The amount of USAID - controlled funds in Africa has decreased from 65 to 40 percent during ten years , RI said .
Africa continues to receive humanitarian aid , albeit in the form of NATO soldiers only .
The US concept of security in Africa stipulates the arming of local elements .
The Pentagon has already spent about $ 50 million on mercenaries to train 2,000 soldiers in post - war Liberia with its four - million - strong population .
“ Foreign aid is increasingly being overseen by military institutions whose policies are driven by the Global War on Terror , not by the war against poverty , ” the report from Refugees International states .
The US aid contributes to the militarization of the region .
Therefore , it is not ruled out that it will never be possible to establish peaceful communities in post - conflict African states .
The USA will soon set up a new organization , Africa Command ( Africom ) , which will try to reach balance between US financial efforts in Africa , the interests of the Department of State , USAID and the Pentagon .
Most likely , Africom will follow Pentagon ’s instructions only .

Herbal Remedy - Life changing herbal remedies
Home remedies , get healed natures way
Thousands of years ago , there were no doctors .
Our ancestors fell sick and many died .
As time went by , they discovered that their surroundings provided ways and means to recover from sickness .
Herbal Remedies & natural medicine became popular .
Whether it was an ant bite , a bee sting , high fever or a broken leg , they seemed to be able to find , if not cure , relief from ailments .
Some scientist and doctors now agree that herbal remedies can be useful in many treatments .
So the bombers in this case had adequately safe main charges , and in those pre-liquids - ban days they could have taken quite big ones onto the plane with them .
They also had viable detonators , safe enough for suicide terrorists to use if not for normal explosives folk , well able to give the main charges the high - velocity shock they would need to make them detonate rather than deflagrate or burn .
All they needed to do in the airliner loos was hook up their dets to the firing circuit , open the bottles , slip the dets in and press the button .
Job done .
It 's the possession and use of detonators , indeed , that 's the hallmark of a serious bomber .
The Provisional IRA ( PIRA ) of old used detonators , both proper manufactured ones and homemade .
These were very often the primaries for highly effective home - made charges , which went off quite reliably and caused a lot of destruction .
The bombers in this case were serious - not by any means in PIRA 's league yet , but getting there - and their plan was a good one .
The prosecutors have failed to prove to the jury 's satisfaction that the devices were aimed at airliners , but nobody - not even the three convicted bombmakers themselves - suggests that the bombs were n't viable , or that they could n't have got through security .
There 's nothing intrinsically impossible about home - brewing effective bombs out of fairly everyday stuff , remember - other people than PIRA were bound to get wise eventually .
And let 's be quite clear : acknowledging this reality is not the same as endorsing lengthy detention without charge .
It 's not the same as saying that battlefield chemical warheads are equivalent to nukes ; it 's not an argument in support of massive state snooping powers , the use of or connivance at torture , airstrikes against children etc .
It 's perfectly possible to argue that terrorist bombings are n't , in fact , a significant threat to western society and yet acknowledge that this particular plan was a feasible and dangerous one .
Does the liquids limit prevent this kind of attack ?
No , not really .
It 's fairly easy to get round , in fact ; a big team of terrorists with boarding passes for many different flights could bring many small amounts of liquid main - charge through security and combine them afterwards , still needing only one detonator , one firing device and one suicide bomber .
But there are no big teams of terrorists in the UK .
MI5 says that the average size of a UK terror cell known to them is ten .
As a general rule , as soon as you have more than , say , five people in your UK - based jihadi cell , you have probably popped up on the security services ' radar in some way - quite likely because you have an informer in your midst .
So perhaps the liquid limits are worthwhile , the more so as everyone has now got used to them and the worst of the inconvenience has died down .
Personally , I 'd still happily fly without them ; but I 'd never die in a ditch to get rid of them either .
Permission to take liquids on planes is scarcely the most important freedom that has lately been taken away from us .
Were the jury idiots , not to send the three bombmakers down on the big airliner charge ?
Should they have convicted the other four , who had made " martyr " videos but could n't be positively tied to the bomb factory - the four suicide mules who would have carried the devices , according to the prosecution ?
It 's only one man 's opinion - worth what you paid for it , eg nothing really - but I say no .
The bombmakers have been convicted of being bombmakers - they 'll go to prison for a long time .
The video idiots will do less time , presumably not very much more than they already have awaiting trial .
But all of them will be watched for the rest of their lives ; their usefulness as terrorists is over .
They are out of play , and as for encouraging les autres , forget it - you do n't deter suicide bombers by custodial sentences ( or even death sentences ) .
And the numbers probably will stay small ; the more so , following these verdicts .
The message is clear - the British courts are fair , or anyway their juries are .
You will be given the benefit of the doubt in a jury trial , even if you are a dark - skinned bearded man with a scary name ; even if you have made suicide videos and you admit up front that it was your plan to let off high explosives in a crowded public place .
If the prosecutors can't prove beyond reasonable doubt that you were also going to blow up a plane , you still wo n't be convicted of trying to .
Frankly , if I was the Home Secretary I 'd be making a massive propaganda coup out of this - not thinking about wasting a shipload of taxpayers ' money on a retrial .
( That would be expensive .
Lawyers and judges are paid a lot more than either prison guards or surveillance teams , and you 'd still need screws and spooks afterwards even if the retrial was " successful " . )
It seems that the British security services are pointing the finger at America over the failure to make the airliner charges stick .
It 's being said that US - inspired haste at the Pakistani end of the operation meant the UK cops had to move too soon , before the bombers had even bought their airline tickets .
Everyone 's moaning about the pesky Americans going off half - cocked .
But what 's the aim of the game here ?
Is it victory to get a longer jail sentence for a terrorist ?
One might argue that once you 're talking about jail you 're talking about damage limitation after a defeat , not victory of any kind .
Victory , you might say , is when a young man meets a Taliban or al - Q recruiter - travelling in Pakistan , at the mosque back home , at university , wherever - and finds himself unconvinced .
That sort of genuine and elegant victory , you could argue , is more likely following this week 's results - not less .
And it just could be that this time the hasty Americans in Pakistan , triggering an early end to the UK surveillance operation , have actually done us a favour .
Possibly the accused men were planning mass murder , as the prosecution contends : but the cause of Western democracy gains a lot more by showing the world the manifold excellences of trial by jury than it could ever lose by failing to make that charge stick . ®
Lewis Page used to be a mine clearance diving officer in the Royal Navy .
As such , he was trained in demolitions and bomb disposal .
He was assigned as a bomb - squad operator in support of the mainland police from 2001 - 2004 , holding a UK improvised - devices disposal licence for that period .
I had the opportunity to present at the Linux Symposium on Friday , and talked further about my hope that we can improve the coordination and cadence of the entire free software stack .
I tried to present both the obvious benefits and the controversies the idea has thrown up .
Afterwards , a number of people came up to talk about it further , with generally positive feedback .
Christopher Curtis , for example , emailed to say that the idea of economic clustering in the motor car industry goes far further than the location of car dealerships .
He writes :
Firstly , every car maker releases their new models at about the same time .
Each car maker has similar products – economy , sedan , light truck .
They copy each other prolifically .
Eventually , they all adopt a certain baseline – seatbelts , bumpers , airbags , anti-lock brakes .
Yet they compete fiercely ( OnStar from GM ; Microsoft Sync from Ford ) and people remain brand loyal .
This is n’t going to change in the Linux world .
Even better , relations like Debian -> Ubuntu match car maker relations like Toyota -> Lexus .
I agree with him wholeheartedly .
Linux distributions and car manufacturers are very similar : we ’re selling products that reach the same basic audience ( there are niche specialists in real - time or embedded or regional markets ) with a similar range ( desktop , workstation , server , mobile ) , and we use many of the same components just as the motor industry uses common suppliers .
That commonality and coordination benefits the motor industry , and yet individual brands and products retain their identity .
Let ’s do a small thought experiment .
Can you name , for the last major enterprise release of your favourite distribution , the specific major versions of kernel , gcc , X , GNOME , KDE , OpenOffice.org or Mozilla that were shipped ?
And can you say whether those major versions were the same or different to any of the enterprise releases of Ubuntu , SLES , Debian , or RHEL which shipped at roughly the same time ?
I ’m willing to bet that any particular customer would say that they can’t remember either which versions were involved , or how those stacked up against the competition , and do n’t care either .
So looking backwards , differences in versions were n’t a customer - differentiating item .
We can do the same thought experiment looking forwards .
WHAT IF you knew that the next long - term supported releases of Ubuntu , Debian , Red Hat and Novell Linux would all have the same major versions of kernel , GCC , X , GNOME , KDE , OO.o and Mozilla .
Would that make a major difference for you ?
I ’m willing to bet not – that from a customer view , folks who prefer X will still prefer X . A person who prefers Red Hat will stick with Red Hat .
But from a developer view , would that make it easier to collaborate ?
Dramatically so .
Another member of the audience came up to talk about the fashion industry .
That ’s also converged on a highly coordinated model – fabrics and technologies “ release ” first , then designers introduce their work simultaneously at fashion shows around the world .
“ Spring 2009 ” sees new collections from all the major houses , many re-using similar ideas or components .
That has n’t hurt their industry , rather it helps to build awareness amongst the potential audience .
The ultimate laboratory , nature , has also adopted release coordination .
Anil Somayaji , who was in the audience for the keynote , subsequently emailed this :
Basically , trees of a given species will synchronize their seed releases in time and in amount , potentially to overwhelm predators and to coordinate with environmental conditions .
In effect , synchronized seed releases is a strategy for competitors to work together to ensure that they all have the best chance of succeeding .
In a similar fashion , if free software were to “ release its seeds ” in a synchronized fashion ( with similar types of software or distributions having coordinated schedules , but software in different niches having different schedules ) , it might maximize the chances of all of their survival and prosperity .
There ’s no doubt in my mind that the stronger the “ pulse ” we are able to create , by coordinating the freezes and releases of major pieces of the free software stack , the stronger our impact on the global software market will be , and the better for all companies – from MySQL to Alfresco , from Zimbra to OBM , from Red Hat to Ubuntu .

For those of you unfamiliar with this function ( which cropped up in COD4 : Modern Warfare ) kill streaks are awarded when you reach a specific number of kills without dying , and take the form of a special ability which you can utilize against your opponent .
In Call of Duty : World at War , Treyarch will be offering something similar giving players special commands for killing multiple enemies .
Here is the complete list :
Recon Plane ( 3 Kills ) :
Kill three enemies without dying and you are given the ability to call in a recon plane to mark enemies temporarily on your radar map .
The only enemies that wo n’t appear are ones using the Reconnaissance perk .
Artillery Strike ( 5 Kills ) :
Kill five enemies without dying and you are given the ability to call in an artillery strike .
This is very similar to the Airstrike command in COD4 , however , instead of a line of bombs going off , the area in which you select for the drop is completely obliterated in a long series of cannon fire .
Unleash the Dogs ( 7 Kills ) :
Kill seven enemies without dying and you enable the ability to call in attack dogs , which will sniff out any enemies on the map .
Unlike COD4 , attack dogs will find you regardless of where you hide , making it exceedingly difficult to avoid them .
Furthermore , killing the attack dogs will only save you temporarily as the hounds will respawn if killed until their time / kill limit has expired .
Talking to Oneself Productively
by John Pasden in language
As an English teacher in Hangzhou , China , one of the questions Chinese college students most often asked me was , “ how can I improve my spoken English ? ”
As a member of the ChinesePod team and student of applied linguistics , learners frequently ask me , “ how can I improve my spoken Chinese ? ”
Unfortunately , the are no easy answers or “ secrets . ”
If you ’re working hard learning Mandarin on ChinesePod and you ’ve found a way to practice speaking , then you ’re doing the right thing .
But surely there might be an extra trick or two out there ?
Actually , there are a few tricks out there , but their effectiveness tends to vary widely from person to person .
The one I hear most often is “ find a Chinese girlfriend , ” but this one clearly has limited application , and it sometimes does n’t even work for those with Chinese girlfriends / wives .
This “ trick ” is a subset of a larger idea , which is just spend as much time with Chinese speakers as you can .
But that one is obvious , and probably not useful for most learners .
One method I have found useful is to talk to myself in Chinese .
Now before you stop reading , let me explain .
I ’m not talking about “ How are you ?
Fine , thank you ” type conversation .
I mean all day long , as I think about different things , I ask myself , how would I say that in Chinese ?
If I said that in Chinese , how would the Chinese person respond ?
If the Chinese person responded X , what would I say then ?
Let me provide an example of such a train of thought .
OK , I need to buy a lightbulb .
How do I say lightbulb ?
It ’s “ dēngpào . ”
So I want to say , “ Wŏ xiăng măi dēngpào . ”
How will they react to that ?
Well , they might say , “ méi yŏu . ”
If they say that , I ’ll just say , “ hăo de , xièxie . ”
But they should have them , so they ’ll probably just say something like , “ zài zhèli ” or “ yŏu de , zài nàbiān ” and then I can just say “ xièxie ” and buy them .
Obviously , this is a rather simple example , but the method can be applied to much more complicated situations .
The better your imagination , the more extensive and “ branched ” the “ conversation . ”
You might be thinking that this method has a major flaw … if you do n’t know how to say these things in Chinese , then your every internalized “ conversation ” deadends rather abruptly .
It ’s true that the method works better once you get to the advanced beginner or intermediate stage , but the true value in the mental exercise is in identifying what you do n’t know .
It ’s in identifying what you ’re unsure of , before you actually have to use it .
Then you can take these questions you come up with and either look them up somewhere ( if possible ) or ask your teacher .
Soon after I came to China and my Chinese was at the elementary level I would run through this exercise every time I needed to go do something that involved communicating in Chinese .
I ’d think of what I needed to say , how the other person might respond , and how I ’d respond to that .
I ’d look up every word I did n’t know and write it down ( making sure to get the tones right ) , then go and use it .
Talking to myself : it worked for me .

Hollywood stars would like you to believe they 're not as superficial as the glamorous lifestyles they lead .
Sure they might make millions , but they love to use that cash to feed starving children and help the homeless .
But you can't change the world if you do n't look good first , right ?
So while the starlets might pledge thousands to their favorite charities , they 're spending just as much on the latest designer handbags .
Drab outfits might have been OK for Mother Theresa , but today 's celebrity saints have a reputation to uphold .
It makes you wonder whether the stars believe in the causes they support , or whether it 's all just a cheap grab for publicity .
Are they celebrity charlatans using poverty to gloss their image , give them publicity , which subsequently generates them more fame and money to feed a designer shopping addiction ?
How can these socially aware stars spend thousands on some arm candy while people in third - world countries are still dying of hunger ?
Some of these bags are so expensive , they 'd easily feed an entire African village .
If you 've pledged to help fight poverty how can you justify spending thousands on a designer handbag when that that money could make a huge impact on poverty to hundreds ( if not thousands ) of people .
Maybe I 'm being too harsh on these famous celebrities but when you look at how much they 've spent and how that money could have been used to fight poverty it makes you question their motives .
Just take a look at these examples of " poverty fighting " celebs and their excessive handbag spending :
Angelina Jolie and Zahara Show Off Matching Valentino Purses
Image source : The Purse Blog
Angelina Jolie is the poster child for celebrity do - gooders .
She 's a United Nations ambassador , and her Jolie - Pitt Foundation helps humanitarian causes all around the world .
She also likes to adopt orphans from poverty - stricken nations , like adorable Zahara .
Back in Africa , Zahara could never afford this kiddy - sized Valentino Histoire handbag .
Of course Mommy Jolie has the grown up version , which set her back $ 1695 .
I can't imagine how much this custom made mother - daughter pair is worth , but I 'm sure the charities would love a piece of it !
Madonna's $ 471,000 Chanel Purse Helps Charity
Image source : The Purse Forum
Madonna was so moved by a visit to the African country of Malawi , that she brought back a child .
She also joined the Raising Malawi Advisory Committee , and she works tirelessly to provide food , clean water , medical care , and schooling to the struggling nation 's orphans .
She also likes to spoil herself .
At one point she owned a black Chanel alligator bag encrusted with 334 diamonds .
The Material Girl recently sold the bag at a charity auction , raising $ 471,000 , so does that make her splurging OK ?
I just ca n’t help wondering what other exorbitant accessories she still has in her closet .
Beyonce Bags Limited Edition Louis Vuitton Monstrosity
Image source : The Purse Blog
Beyonce Knowles is so committed to fighting poverty that she supports Oxfam and The Lunchbox Fund .
Yet somehow she still managed to find a spare $ 42,000 to pick up one of the 24 limited edition Louis Vuitton Tribute patchwork bags .
Surely you could feed an entire African nation for that price !
The saddest part of it all is just how hideous the handbag is .
I can almost understand dropping thousands on something really beautiful , but this LV purse is so incredibly tacky !
Kate Moss Wants to Make Poverty History , Sort Of
Image Source : The Purse Blog
Kate Moss was one of the star snappers in the massive Make Poverty History campaign .
But you have to wonder whether it was just one big publicity stunt , because the British model seems as self obsessed as ever .
How else can you explain spending $ 13,895 on a Mulberry Bayswater alligator bag ?
At least she looks hot while she 's saving the world , right ?
Victoria Beckham's $ 114,000 Birkin Obsession
Image source : Trend 911
Victoria Beckham has given special performances and donated prized possessions to raise funds for her favorite charity , Children in Need .
But just think how many needy children could benefit if she ’d part with her beloved Birkins !
This particular pink ostrich purse costs more than $ 20,000 .
Her entire collection is reportedly worth $ 114,000 .
That 's a whole lot of Hermes !
Add to that the Giambattista Valli , Oscar de la Renta , and Marc Jacobs Posh loves so much and the dollars really start to add up !
Mischa Barton Saves the Children With the Change From Her Shopping Sprees

Socially conscious Mischa Barton feels so passionately about ending poverty , she 's an ambassador for Save the Children and One Water .
But just think how much clean water she could have sent to Africa instead of dropping $ 5790 on this Gucci Indy bag .
It may be cute , but there 's no way a purse is worth that much .
I 'm sure those thirsty Africans agree !
Lindsay Lohan Joins the Birkin Brigade

She may have hung with Paris and Britney , but Lindsay Lohan is n't just another vapid Hollywood starlet .
She ’s also got a social conscience .
She 's worked tirelessly to promote Bono 's ONE campaign , and she 's even gone hands - on with a trip to Kenya .
But do you think Li-Lo considered the Kenyans before she spent $ 12,750 on this Blue Jean Birkin ?
My car does n't even cost as much as this Hermes handbag !
Pamela Anderson's Another Hermes Lover
Image source : The Purse Page
I 'll bet you thought Pamela Anderson was just another busty blonde bimbo , right ?
But apparently that 's not the whole story .
She 's also a social activist who devotes a lot of time and money to Feed the Children .
But when you 're attending those charity galas you need a beautiful handbag to look your best .
This Hermes Haut a Courrois does the trick at a cost of $ 9000 .
Those starving kids could experience fine dining rather than the white goop with that sort of money !
Heidi Klum's Extravagant YSL Handbag
Image source : The Purse Page
Heidi Klum was very vocal about the Raise Your Voice Against Poverty campaign , proudly wearing her white armband on the cover of Vanity Fair .
But was this social activism just a way for Heidi to make the front page ?
Because this $ 5000 Yves Saint Laurent Ostrich
Muse she ’s toting does n't say " I care about fighting poverty . "
It says " I care about looking sexy , and if I have to support the slaughter of ostriches and spend a few thou to do is , so be it . "
Nicole Richie's $ 18,000 Balenciaga Bag Addiction
Image source : Fashionista
Finally we 've got everyone 's favorite spoiled little rich girl , Nicole Richie .
She 'd like us to believe her work with UNICEF means she 's got a soul , but we know the truth .
All that 's just a way to get in to those fancy shmancy dinners !
If she 'd really like to help fight poverty , perhaps she could offload some of those Balenciaga bags she 's so obsessed with .
Nicole reportedly has twelve of the luxury handbags including Part Timers , Weekenders , and City purses .
All that adds up to more than $ 18,000 .
$ 18,000 !
It 's not quite up to Posh 's standards , but it 's more than any socially responsible girl would spend !
Perhaps these celebs should check out these designer replicas .
They 'd allow the stars to have all the style of the pricy purses they adore at a fraction of the cost .
They could donate the thousands they 'd save to some of those charities they love so much !
Mitt Romney says John McCain earned his homes .
All 14 of them , presumably , including the 12 he could n’t find on a map if his life depended on it .
Speaking to reporters at a lunch sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor , Romney said that while McCain deserved his houses because of the “ hard work ” of himself and his family , “ Barack Obama got a special deal from a convicted felon . ”
As the article linked here explains , there ’s all kinds of nuance and context to Mitt ’s comments .
I ’d like to poke at the whole “ earned / deserved ” meme a little , though .
To review :
McCain had the good sense to be born to the right people .
He married a woman with more money than God .
( Okay , technically he re-married here after ditching Wife 1.0 ; I mean , how many houses are you going to earn by schlepping around with an under - producing disfigured chick , right ? )
He ’s worked his butt off in the Senate , if you call that work .
That ’s a pretty impressive leap in income , huh ?
I ’m personally not going to get twisted about how many houses Johnny McSame owns , and while there ’s a certain obscenity to owning more houses than you can remember , I ’m fine with the idea that people get rich and I like the idea that when they do they spend it .
I mean , somewhere out there real working people were employed and made money off all that house building and decorating , right ?
But I think it ’s time we all called bullshit on the “ earn / deserve ” rhetoric .
When you bust your ass 12 hours a day at a job that takes years off your life , then you ’ve earned something .
When you start with nothing and make it up the ladder through hard work and ingenuity , then you deserve what you have .
When you ’re born into the right family and get to the top because , well , you started out there , please , with all due respect , shut the fuck up .
Of course , we live in an era of pathological doublespeak and all too often we ’re not educated enough to call the purveyors on their fork - tonguery .
Obama ’s an elitist .
Kerry is an elitist .
Hell , I grew up working class in the South , mortgaged my future with student loans that I may get paid off in a few more years , and I ’ve been called an elitist .
But our president , a halfwit who was born into one of America ’s most powerful political and financial dynasties , has never been called an elitist despite being the closest thing the nation has to a dynastic aristocrat .
Because he ’s the sort of guy you could have a beer with .
Then again , Mitt ’s not exactly Mr. Everyman , either .
So maybe his perspective is a little skewed .
But at least he is n’t an elitist , right ?

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn , writer , Nobel Prize winner , and the most famous Soviet dissident died at the age of 89 on August 3 , 2008 in his home near Moscow .
He lived a long and hard life , but he died the way that he wanted to : " He wanted to die in the summer — and he died in the summer , " his wife Natalya said .
" He wanted to die at home — and he died at home .
In general I should say that Aleksandr Isayevich lived a difficult but happy life . "
His entire life was a victory over the most improbable .
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born on December 11 , 1918 in Kislovodsk in Southern Russia , half a year after his father died in a hunting accident .
He managed to get a Soviet university education despite the fact that his mother Taisiya came from one of the richest families of Southern Russia and his father Isaakiy was an officer in the tsar 's army .
Aleksandr was raised by his mother in abject poverty as his earliest years coincided with war communism and its abolition of private property ( making economic calculation impossible ) ; what followed was mass starvation and destruction .
His family was no exception — their property was confiscated and later destroyed by central planners .
Solzhenitsyn stated in his autobiographical series of novels The Red Wheel that his mother was fighting for survival and they had to keep his father 's background in the old Imperial Army a secret .
Taisiya was well educated and openly encouraged her son's literary and scientific interests , while also secretly raising him in the Christian faith .
He studied physics and mathematics at Rostov University before becoming a Soviet army officer after Hitler invaded Russia in 1941 .
He was commissioned as a Soviet artillery officer during the Second World War despite the fact that he had previously been rejected due to poor health .
A successful artillery captain , he was arrested by the secret police in 1945 for disrespectful remarks about Stalin in a letter to a friend .
Despite his eight - year sentence for hard labor ( which was nearly a death sentence in Stalin 's dreadful Gulag system ) , he managed to stay near Moscow in the government research facility for imprisoned scientists .
Eventually he was transferred to the special Ekibastuz camp in Kazakhstan .
In the Tashkent medical ward a malignant tumor was removed from his stomach in 1954 , and he survived the tumor and the surgery against all odds .
After release from the Gulag in 1956 , Solzhenitsyn returned to Central Russia , worked as a math teacher and began to write his powerful prose .
" During all the years until 1961 , not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime , but , also , I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known , " he said in his autobiography .
" Finally , at the age of 42 , this secret authorship began to wear me down . "
He published his first works , two novellas : " One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , " and " Matryona 's House " in a literary journal Novyi Mir ( New World ) in 1962 with explicit approval by Nikita Khrushchev .
These were the only publications of Solzhenitsyn in his own country until 1990 .
In 1970 , after publishing several works in the West , including the novel Cancer Ward — a fictional piece based on Solzhenitsyn's own treatment at the Tashkent cancer ward — he was awarded , while in exile , the Nobel Prize in literature .
Solzhenitsyn did n't attend the ceremony in Stockholm , Sweden for fear that he would not be allowed to re-enter the USSR .
Three years later , his Gulag Archipelago was published in France .
Immediately after this publication he was accused of treason , stripped of his citizenship , and deported to Germany .
He wrote sarcastically : " For a country to have a great writer … is like having another government .
That 's why no régime has ever loved great writers , only minor ones . "
He accepted an invitation to teach at Stanford University , and then moved to Cavendish , Vermont , where he lived with his family for years .
In 1990 , his citizenship was restored by Gorbachev , and he returned to Russia in 1994 and actively participated in the reform process .
He crossed the country that had already ceased to be the Soviet Union , from the East to the West , acquiring " a collection of cries and tears . "
" It is history 's sorrow , " Solzhenitsyn wrote afterwards , " the grief of our era , which I carry about me like an anathema . "
We will remember Solzhenitsyn as an unyielding champion of freedom who dedicated himself to revealing the horrors of socialism and exposing the ultimate evil of Lenin , Stalin , and their cohort of mass murderers .
Once a prisoner of brutal labor camps himself , Solzhenitsyn chronicled the horrors of the Soviet Gulag system and emerged as a one of Russia 's greatest writers .
He became a moral and spiritual leader who exposed and condemned the nefarious nature of the socialist ideology that served as the basis for the monstrous communist slave camps established from Siberia to Ethiopia , Cuba to Vietnam , China , and Yugoslavia .
He riveted socialists of all countries whose secret ghastly history he exposed .
" For us in Russia , communism is a dead dog , while , for many people in the West , it is still a living lion " , wrote Solzhenitsyn while in his exile in the West .
In the West , he liked the Swiss model of local government and spoke highly of his experiences living in Vermont .
Before leaving for Russia in 1994 , Solzhenitsyn spoke to his neighbors in a Cavendish town meeting and thanked the town for its hospitality and for respecting his privacy .
He thought of the town - meeting type of self - government as the most suitable for Russia .
He did not , however , make a god of democracy ; he admired great Russian reformer Pyotr Stolypin with his strong promarket and antisocialist stand as the prime minister of the Russian Empire ( 1906 - 1911 ) .
Solzhenitsyn believed in the individual rather than the group , party , or state .
He wrote in The Gulag Archipelago , " that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties either — but through all human hearts . "
Solzhenitsyn had enough courage to equate socialism and Nazism as equally evil and morally reprehensible .
He condemned both Nazi and Soviet atrocities during the Second World War and he accused his fellow countrymen of masterminding their own shipwreck .
According to Solzhenitsyn , 61,000,000 people were slaughtered in the USSR in the quest for equality .
Under Stalin alone , 43,000,000 were murdered .
Lenin and Khrushchev are responsible for the other 18,000,000 .
Most of these deaths ( 39,000,000 ) were due to forced labor in gulags and during deportations .
His writings earned him over 20 years of prison , exile , and world - wide renown , making him the most prominent dissident of the Soviet era and a symbol of intellectual resistance to communist rule .
But he is also one of the most maligned and defamed writers of the 20th century .
He has been the victim of character assassination and willful distortions from almost every quarter .
He published his final original work in June 2001 with " 200 Years Together : 1775 - 1995 , " about the history of Jews in Russia .
Solzhenitsyn spent his last years in failing health and seclusion at his rural home in Troitse - Lykovo near Moscow , editing his 30 - volume collected works .
He predicted that he would not be able to complete the work , which will " continue after my death . "
Since the start of the Democratic National Convention , ratings have exploded for the cable news channel MSNBC .
So have tensions among the network 's top anchors .
The convention was supposed to be the network 's coming - out party as a hub for politics .
But a year of programming and personnel changes have led to behind - the - scenes strain , which bubbled to the surface repeatedly this week in open arguments between hosts .
In an uncomfortable moment Tuesday night , an exhausted - looking " Hardball " host Chris Matthews shouted at a producer ( " I 'll wrap in a second ! " ) before a stilted exchange with " Countdown " host Keith Olbermann , in which the two argued about who was talking out of turn .
Mr. Olbermann made a flapping - lips hand gesture , and Mr. Matthews took umbrage .
House Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer sat quietly on - screen , waiting to be interviewed .
That incident followed a seven - minute back - and - forth Tuesday afternoon between " Morning Joe " host Joe Scarborough and network correspondent David Shuster .
Mr. Scarborough , a former Republican representative from Florida , accused Mr. Shuster , a registered independent , of taking a " cheap shot " by mentioning his party affiliation .
Mr. Scarborough sarcastically added : " I feel so comforted by the fact that you 're an independent .
I bet everyone at MSNBC has ' independent ' on their voting cards . "
The following is reprinted from The Best of Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader .
FLY OFF THE HANDLE Meaning :
Get very angry , very quickly .

Origin : " Goes back to the days when all gentlemen wore powdered wigs like the ones still worn by the judges in British courts .

The expression ' pull the wool over his eyes ' came from the practice of tilting a man 's wig over his eyes , so he could n't see what was going on . "
HOOKER Meaning : Prostitute .
Origin : Although occasionally used before the Civil War , its widespread popularity can probably be traced to General Joseph Hooker , a Union soldier who was well - known for the liquor and whores in his camp .

LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG Meaning : Reveal the truth .
Origin : Refers to a con game practiced at country fairs in old England .

STEAL SOMEONE'S THUNDER Meaning :
To preempt ; to draw attention away from someone else 's achievement in favor of your own .
Origin : English dramatist John Dennis invented a gadget for imitating the sound of thunder and introduced it in a play in the early 1700s .
The play flopped .
Soon after , Dennis noted that another play in the same theater was using his sound - effects device .
He angrily exclaimed , " That is my thunder , by God ; the villains will play my thunder , but not my play . "
The story got around London , and the phrase grew out of it .
PAY THROUGH THE NOSE Meaning :
To pay a high price ; to pay dearly .
Origin : Comes from the ninth - century Ireland .
When the Danes conquered the Irish , they imposed an exorbitant Nose Tax on the island 's inhabitants .
They took a census ( by counting noses ) and levied oppressive sums on their victims , forcing them to pay by threatening to have their noses actually slit .
Paying the tax was " paying trough the nose . "
CHARLEY HORSE
Meaning : A muscle cramp .
Origin : In 1640 , Charles I of England expanded the London police force .

They joked that their sore feet and legs came from riding " Charley 's horse . "
NOT UP TO SCRATCH Meaning : Inadequate , subpar .
Origin :
In the early days of boxing , there was no bell to signal the beginning of a round .
Instead , the referee would scratch a line on the ground between fighters , and the round began when both men stepped over it .
When a boxer could n't cross the line to keep a match going , people said that he was not " up to the scratch . "
CAUGHT RED -HANDED
Meaning : Caught in the act .

But it was hard to prove unless the thief was caught with a dead animal ... and blood on his hands .
GIVE SOMEONE " THE BIRD " Meaning : Make a nasty gesture at someone ( usually with the middle finger uplifted ) .
Origin :

The " cleanest " : Originally " the bird " referred to the hissing sound that audiences made when they did n't like a performance .
Hissing is the sound that a goose makes when it 's threatened or angry .
LAY AN EGG Meaning : Fail .

Origin : Some Native American tribes declare peace by literally burying a tomahawk in the ground .
CHEW THE FAT Meaning : Chat ; engage in idle conversation .
Origin : Originally a sailor 's term .
Before refrigeration , ships carried food that would n't spoil .
One of them was salted pork skin , a practically inedible morsel that consisted largely of fat .
Sailors would only eat it if all other food was gone ... and they often complained as they did .
This ( and other ) idle chatter eventually became known as " chewing the fat . "
TO THE BITTER END Meaning :
To the very end - often an unpleasant one .
Origin : Surprisingly , it has nothing to do with bitterness .
It 's a sailing term that refers to the end of a mooring line or anchor line that is attached to the bitts , sturdy wooden or metal posts that are mounted on the ship 's deck .
HAVE A SCREW LOOSE Meaning : Something is wrong with the person or mechanism .
Origin :
The phrase comes from the cotton industry and dates back as far as the 1780s , when the industrial revolution made mass production of textiles possible for the first time .
Huge mills sprang up to take advantage of the new technology ( and the cheap labor ) , but it was difficult to keep all the machines running properly ; any machine that broke down or produced defective cloth was said to have " a screw loose " somewhere .
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL Meaning : Someone appears after you mention them .
Origin : People once believed that you could actually summon the Devil by saying his name .
BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN YOUR MOUTH Meaning : Pampered ; lucky ; born into wealth or prosperous circumstances .
Origin :
At one time , it was customary for godparents to give their godchild a silver spoon at the christening .
These people were usually well - off so the spoon came to represent the child 's good fortune .
TO CLOSE RANKS Meaning : To present a united front .
Origin : " In the old - time European armies , the soldiers were aligned side by side , in neat rows , or ranks , on the battlefield .
When the enemy attacked , officers would order the troops to close ranks ; that is , to move the rows close together , so that the enemy faced a seemingly impregnable mass of men . "
( From Fighting Words , by Christine Ammer ) FOR THE BIRDS Meaning : Worthless .
Origin : According to Robert claiborne in Loose Cannons and Red Herrings , it refers to city streets as they were before cars .
" When I was a youngster on the streets of New York , one could both see and smell the emissions of horse - drawn wagons .
Since there was no way of controlling these emissions , they , or the undigested oats in them , served to nourish a large population of English sparrows .
If you say something 's for the birds , you 're politely saying it 's horseshit . "
BEYOND THE PALE Meaning : Socially unacceptable .
Origin : " The pale in this expression has nothing to do with the whitish color , but comes originally from the Latin palus , meaning a pole , or stake .
Since stakes are often used to mark boundaries , a pale was a particular area within certain limits . "
The pale that inspired this expression was the area around Dublin in Ireland .
Until the 1500s , that area was subject to British law .
" Those who lived beyond the pale were outside English jurisdiction and were thought to be uncivilized . "
( From Getting to the Roots , by Martin Manser ) I'VE GOT A FROG IN MY THROAT Meaning : I 'm hoarse from a cold .
Origin : Surprisingly , this was n't inspired by the croaking sound of a cold - sufferer 's voice , but by a weird medical practice .
" In the Middle Ages , " says Christine Ammer in It 's Raining Cats and Dogs , " infections such as thrush were sometimes treated by putting a live frog head first into the patient 's mouth ; by inhaling , the frog was believed to draw the patient 's infection into its own body .
The treatment is happily obsolete , but its memory survives in the 19th century term frog in one 's throat . "
SOMETHING FITS TO A " T " Meaning :
It fits perfectly .
Origin : Commonly thought of as a reference to the T - square , which is used to draw parallel lines and angles .
But this phrase was used in the 1600s , before anyone called it a T - square .
" A more likely explanation is that the expression was originally ' to a tittle . '
A tittle was the dot over the ' i , ' so the phrase meant ' to a dot ' or ' fine point . ' " ( From Why Do We Say It , by Nigel Rees ) X X X Meaning : A kiss , at the end of a letter .
Origin :
In medieval times , when most people were illiterate , " contracts were not considered legal until each signer included St. Andrew 's cross after their name . "
( Or instead of a signature , if the signer could n't write . )
To prove their sincerity , signers were then required to kiss the X .
" Throughout the centuries this custom faded out , but the letter X [ became associated ] with a kiss . "
This is also probably where the phrase " sealed with a kiss " comes from .
( From I 've Got Goose Pimples , by Martin Vanoni ) READ BETWEEN THE LINES Meaning :
To perceive or understand a hidden meaning .
Origin :
In the 16th century it became common for politicians , soldiers , and businesspeople to write in code .
To ordinary folks , this writing was unintelligible .
They concluded that the meaning was not in the lines of gibberish , but in the space between them .
YOU'RE NO SPRING CHICKEN Meaning :
You 're not young anymore ; you 're past your prime .
Origin : Until recent generations , there were no incubators and few warm hen houses .
That meant chicks could n't be raised during winter .
New England growers found that those born in the spring brought premium prices in the summer market places .
When these Yankee traders tried to pass off old birds as part of the spring crop , smart buyers would protest that the bird was " no spring chicken . "
SON OF A GUN Meaning : An epithet .
Origin :
In the 1800s , British sailors took women along on extended voyages .
When babies were born at sea , the mothers delivered them in a partitioned section of the gundeck .
Because no one could be sure who the true fathers were , each of these " gunnery " babies was jokingly called a " son of a gun . "
PUT UP YOUR DUKES Meaning : Raise your fists and get ready to fight .
Origin :
In the early 1800s , the Duke of York , Frederick Augustus , shocked English society by taking up boxing .
He gained such admiration from boxers that many started referring to their fists as the " Dukes of York , " and later " dukes . "
HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND Meaning : Having a hidden agenda .
Origin :
The expression comes from a story told by Benjamin Franklin .
A man once praised Franklin 's father 's grindstone and asked young Benjamin to demonstrate how the grindstone worked .
As Franklin complied , the stranger placed his own axe upon the grindstone , praising the young boy for his cleverness and vigor .
When the axe was sharpened , the man laughed at Franklin and walked away , giving the boy a valuable lesson about people with " an axe to grind . "
UPPER CRUST Meaning : Elite .
Origin :
In the Middle Ages , the highest - level nobility and royal were served the choice part of a loaf of bread , the " upper crust , " before it was offered to other diners .
MEET A DEADLINE Meaning : Finish a project by an appointed time .
Origin :
The phrase was born in prisoner - of - war camps during the Civil War .
Because resources were scarce , the prison camps were sometimes nothing more than a plot of land surrounded by a marked line .
If a prisoner tried to cross the line , he would be shot .
So it became known as the " deadline . "
TOE THE LINE Meaning : Behave or act in accordance with the rules .
Origin :
In the early days of the British Parliament , members wore swords in the House of Commons .
To keep the members from fighting during heated debates , the Speaker of the House of Commons forced the Government and Opposition parties to sit on opposite sides of the chamber .
Lines , two sword - lengths plus one foot apart , were drawn in the carpet .
Members were required to stand behind the lines when the House was in session .
To this day , when a member steps over the line during a debate , the speaker yells : " Toe the line ! " SECOND STRING Meaning : Replacement or backup .
Origin :
You might have caught William
Tell without an apple , but not without a second string .
In medieval times , an archer always carried a second string in case the one on his bow broke .
IN THE LIMELIGHT Meaning :
At the center of attention .
Origin :
In 1826 , Thomas Drummond invented the limelight , an amazingly bright white light , by running an intense oxygen - hydrogen flame through a lime cylinder .
At first , the bright light was used in lighthouses to direct ships .
Later , theater began using the limelight like a spotlight - to direct the audience 's attention to a certain actor .
If an actor was to be the focal point of a particular scene , he was thrust " into the limelight . "
FLASH IN THE PAN Meaning : Short - lived success .
Origin :
In the 1700s , the pan of a flintlock musket was a part that held the gunpowder .
If all went well , sparks from the flint would ignite the charge , which would then propel the bullet out of the barrel .
However , sometimes the gun powder would burn without igniting a main charge .
The flash would burn brightly but only briefly , with no lasting effect .
HAM ACTOR ( HAM ) Meaning : Someone who enjoys putting on a show , or who plays rather obviously to an audience ( though not necessarily on stage ) .
Origin : An American phrase originating in the 1880s .
Minstrel shows , the mass entertainment of the time , often featured less - than - talented performers who overacted .
They frequently appeared in blackface , and used ham fat to remove their makeup .
Thus , they were referred to as " ham - fat men , " later shortened to " hams . "
WHIPPING BOY Meaning : A scapegoat , or something who is habitually picked on .
Origin : Hundreds of years ago , it was normal practice for a European prince to be raised with a commoner of the same age .
Since princes could n't be disciplined like ordinary kids , the commoner would be beaten whenever the prince did something wrong .
The commoner was called the prince 's " whipping boy . "
GO BERSERK Meaning :
Go crazy or to act with reckless abandon .
Origin : Viking warriors were incredibly wild and ferocious in battle , probably because they ate hallucinogenic mushrooms in prebattle ceremonies .
They charged their enemies recklessly , wearing nothing more than bearskin , which in Old Norse was pronounced " berserkr " or " bear - sark . "
PULL SOMEONE'S LEG Meaning : Fool someone .
Origin : Years ago back - alley thieves worked in pairs .
One thief , known as a " tripper up , " would use a cane , rope , or piece of wire to trip a pedestrian , knocking them to the ground .
While the victim was down , the second thief would rob them .
Pulling your leg originally referred to the way the " tripper up " tried to make someone stumble .
Today it only refers to tripping someone figuratively .
RAINING CATS AND DOGS Meaning : Torrential rain .
Origin :
In the days before garbage collection , people tossed their trash in the gutter - including deceased housepets - and it just lay there .
When it rained really hard , the garbage , including the bodies of dead cats and dogs , went floating down the street .
PIE IN THE SKY Meaning : An illusion , a dream , a fantasy , an unrealistic goal .
Origin : Joe Hill , a famous labor organizer of the early 20th century , wrote a tune called " The Preacher and the Slave , " in which he accused the clergy of promising a better life in Heaven while people starved on Earth .
A few of the lines : " Work and pray , live on hay , you 'll get pie in the sky when you die ( That 's a lie ! ) . "
HACK WRITER Meaning : Writer who churns out words for money .
Origin : In Victorian England , a hackney , or " hack , " was a carriage for hire .
( The term is still used in reference to taxi drivers , who need their " hack 's licenses " to work . )
Hack became a description of anyone who plies their trade strictly for cash .
LONG IN THE TOOTH Meaning : Old. Origin : Originally used to describe old horses .
As horses age , their gums recede , giving the impression that their teeth are growing .
The longer the teeth look , the older the horse .
STOOL PIGEON Meaning : Informer , traitor .
Origin :
To catch passenger pigeons ( now extinct ) , hunters would nail a pigeon to a stool .
Its alarmed cries would attract other birds , and the hunters would shoot them by the thousands .
The poor creature that played the traitor was called a " stool pigeon . "
BEAT AROUND THE BUSH Meaning :
Go about things in a circuitous manner , go around an issue rather than deal with it directly .
Origin :
In the Middle Ages , people caught birds by dropping a net over a bush and clubbing the ground around it to scare the birds into flying into the net .
Once a bird was caught , you could stop beating around the bush and start eating .
ONE OF THE REASONS , perhaps the main reason , that the financial deal failed to pass the house today is George W. Bush .
It 's not merely that Bush began with a typical power - grab deal — a proposal that would hand enormous powers over to the executive branch without oversight .
It 's not merely that Bush failed to muster his own party .
It goes much deeper than that .
It goes to the entire last eight years of Republican rule , and the effect it has had on this nation .
More than any other factor , the one thing that blew a bipartisan effort to avoid the financial crisis that now appears to be happening was the mail and calls members of Congress were getting .
A large proportion of the American people revolted .
And why ?
If this had happened during Bush 's first year , we may not have liked the deal , we may have had doubts , but we would have trusted our representatives on two points :
We would have believed Bush when he described the level of danger .
We would have trusted the government to do what it had to do to meet that danger .
But the fact is that a large segment of America did not trust that the President was telling the truth , and did not trust that Congress would hold him to a reasonable plan .
There 's a direct connection between " weapons of mass destruction " , " the war will be over in months " , and the myriad other lies and misleads of the Bush administration , has left a legacy : a legacy of distrust .
The dishonest tactics used to mislead Congress on the need for war , and the tactics used to pass legislation like the patriot act , have left the people worried that they can't even trust Congress to see through Presidential lies .
This is the legacy of the Rove - Cheney - Bush machine .
The damage done is much deeper than an economic crisis , or an immoral and costly war .
It 's deeper than the loss of trust America has suffered around the world during the last eight years .
The damage goes to the heart of America , to our own loss of trust in our own institutions .
It goes to who we are .

After the body is dry , you can pop the balloon and mark up the head .
This point is very crucial - you have to make sure that there are no serious weak spots on your paper mache-ing .
This is critical because the paper will have to withstand some abuse from people patting your head , spilling drinks , people trying your head on , and others .
One way to check is to hold the head up to a light , or to put a flashlight on the inside and look for light spots .
I made the mache approximately a 1/8th of an inch ( 2 - 3 mm ) thick .
Also , you 're going to be making cuts to the mache , so you 'll inherently weaken the overall integrity .

Understanding the Science of Solar - Based Energy : More Researchers Are Better Than One
NSF - funded Chemical Bonding Center project provides a new approach for harnessing the sun 's energy
Center scientists are researching converting water and solar energy to hydrogen and oxygen fuels .
August 28 , 2008
View a video of MIT scientists explaining how they recently discovered a catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water .
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
With the assistance of a five - year $ 20 million award from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) Chemical Bonding Center ( CBC ) project , called " Powering the Planet , " will increase the number of its collaborators to fulfill its goal of efficiently and economically converting solar energy and water into hydrogen and oxygen fuels .
The hydrogen and oxygen gases produced will be usable by a fuel cell , where they will react to reform water , generating electricity for powering an electric car or other devices .
The gases may also be used as a source of energy after the sun goes down , and will generate a carbon - neutral or oil - free source of energy scalable to meet future global energy demands .
One of the center 's key goals is to enhance U.S. economic competitiveness in the area of renewable energy .
" We have a very talented and dedicated group of students who are ready and able to tackle the fundamental chemistry problems that must be solved before it will be feasible to produce clean solar fuels on a large scale , " said Harry B. Gray , Arnold O. Beckman professor of chemistry at Caltech and leader of the CBC .
" We already have several industrial partners , and we intend to add more , as we want to move the new materials and processes invented by our center into the commercial arena as rapidly as possible . "
More than 17 researchers and their students from 12 institutions located throughout the U.S. and Switzerland participate in the CBC .
The center is focusing its research efforts on developing a nanoscale - sized system that captures sunlight and converts it to an electrical charge .
The interaction of the system 's electrical charge and an oxygen catalyst produce oxygen gas and positively charged hydrogen ions or protons from water .
The electrical charge , in combination with a hydrogen catalyst and protons , produces hydrogen gas .
" These transformations will require the development of new models for understanding multiple electron and proton transfer reactions and catalyst design , " said Luis Echegoyen , director of NSF 's Division of Chemistry .
The center has already obtained significant research results .
Daniel G. Nocera , the Henry Dreyfus professor of energy and professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and one of the center 's collaborators , recently announced that he and his postdoctoral associate , Matthew W. Kanan , successfully developed a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water .
In use with an electrical conducting glass electrode , the new catalyst , made from the earth - abundant materials cobalt and phosphate , produces oxygen gas from neutral pH water using a relatively low potential at room temperature and pressure ( see video ) .
Even though the catalytic reaction is still not yet fully understood , its discovery moves the center one step closer to reaching its goal of using the sun 's energy and water as a renewable energy source .
Nocera 's and Kanan 's research was published in the July 31 , 2008 , online issue of the journal Science .
" I strongly support Chemistry 's CBC program as a way to tackle grand challenge problems with potentially transformative societal impacts such as sustainable energy .
The Nocera work and the ' Powering the Planet ' Center is an excellent example of this , " said Tony Chan , assistant director for NSF 's Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate .
Phase I of the CBC was established in 2005 when Caltech and MIT were awarded a $ 1.5 million three - year grant for initial research efforts and for establishing their CBC 's management , education , broadening participation and public outreach plans .
Caltech 's CBC was one of the three Phase I CBCs funded by NSF in 2005 and the only CBC to receive 2008 Phase II funding .
Funding for Caltech 's CBC was provided by award 0802907 .
The CBC is eligible for a $ 20 million five - year renewal in 2013 .

Humiliated by the Kremlin .
No closer to catching Bin Laden .
Saddled with the biggest debt in history .
No wonder America can't wait to get rid of Bush
With just 75 days before his successor is elected , has President George W. Bush finally lost the plot ?
Some of the cockiness has gone out of his walk .
A pleading tone has replaced the threats .
Instead of issuing a High Noon threat over Russia 's aggression towards its neighbours , he complains that their ' bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century ' .
Look who 's talking !
For all Bush 's bluster , Osama Bin Laden is still ' wanted dead or alive ' , and time has surely run out for him to be paraded down Park Avenue on a fire engine to redeem the Bush presidency .
Now it 's his hopeful Republican successor , Senator John McCain , who vows to hunt Bin Laden to ' the gates of Hell and beyond ' .
Humiliated : Bush 's time is nearly up
Having avoided being ' tainted ' by association with the President , McCain is now running as Bush Mark II .
And it seems to be working : he is neck and neck in the polls with black boy - wonder Barack Obama , whose professorial manner is no match for McCain 's brutal candour .
Now Obama 's supporters are urging the sensational : that he choose Hillary Clinton this week as his vice - presidential running mate to get women voters who feel they 've been disenfranchised back on side .
As the excitement builds about this weekend 's Democratic convention in mile - high Denver - will Obama and Hillary appear arm in arm , even though her husband , Bill , has been anything but warm about the candidate who came from nowhere to beat his wife ?
- Bush is almost a forgotten figure here .
The unthinkable : Obama is being urged to pick Hilary Clinton as his running mate
The best anyone can say about him is that he 's not as bad as he used to be .
That he got rid of his scary Defence Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
That he now listens to the calm Condoleezza Rice , his Secretary of State , rather than bogeyman Vice - President Dick Cheney , who 's allegedly so aggressive that , according to one comic , he ' returned fire ' after hearing a 21 - gun salute to some visiting foreign dignatory .
The ' Mission Accomplished ' banner hung on an aircraft carrier off the Californian coast onto which Bush co-piloted a fighter jet after the invasion of Iraq is a grisly memory of presidential hubris which consumes American lives and billions of dollars five years on .
His ' war on terror ' puppet in Pakistan , President Pervez Musharraf , is forced out of office .
In Georgia , Russian troops withdraw at their leisure , their commanders taunting Bush and America .
Calm : Bush takes advice from Condoleeza Rice
' Coming up next : Russian troops driving our Humvees in Georgia ! ' announces a stricken - sounding TV newsman here , referring to American military equipment donated to the Georgians .
Although Bush & Co encouraged Georgia 's reckless provocation of Russia , it was French President Nicolas Sarkozy who raced there and negotiated a ceasefire when it all went pear - shaped .
Bush then sent Condoleeza Rice , supposedly to fine - tune the agreement - i.e. pretend it was their ceasefire , not Sarkozy 's - but no one paid much attention .
For the past two years , Bush 's approval ratings have been below 40 per cent .
Currently they 're on 32 per cent .
On Tuesday , The New York Times carried six letters about the Georgian crisis .
Extraordinarily , all of them criticised Bush 's policies .
John McCain has managed to avoid being tainted by association with Bush
Stationing missiles in Poland and encouraging bellicosity in Georgia only feed Russian paranoia and may well lead to war , ' wrote one reader .
There is a real fear now that a down - and - nearly - out Bush will arrange an ' autumn surprise ' military emergency which compels Americans to support their Government , i.e. the ruling Republicans , at the presidential election .
It was by whipping up American fears about more terrorism in the ' homeland ' ( as his administration began calling the U.S. ) and promising he'd be there to protect them , that draft dodging Bush beat Vietnam War hero John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election .
Of course , The New York Times is not Middle America , where many support the President in any circumstances .
But it 's hard to find anyone other than professional Bush - boosters who has a good word to say about America 's clumsy manipulation of Georgia .
Mostly , the public mood is simple exhaustion with people finding themselves in a trap .
Bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan , in the middle of an economic crisis , Americans do n't need an embarrassing stand - off with Russia .
Where did it all go wrong for Bush ?
Even though he was accused of stealing the 2000 election from Democrat Al Gore , who actually won more votes - the outcome was decided by the Supreme Court - most Americans , even those who had n't voted for him , were prepared to give ' Dubya ' a chance .
A former drunk , the ' born again '
George had developed a good ole boy cowboy persona and way of speaking which generally played well with them , even if it did amuse sophisticated East Coast types who knew he was really a Yale educated grandee .
Besides ,
Gore came across as a stuffed shirt .
While terrifying , the 9/11 attacks were a gift to any U.S. President .
The whole nation united behind him - as did most other nations - when Bush clambered among the World Trade Centre rubble shouting encouragement to rescue workers through a bullhorn .
Even going missing for hours after the attack - when the Secret Service decided to keep him well away from Washington - did no lasting harm to Bush .
Nor did the hare - in - the - headlights expression on his face when told at a Florida school he was visiting at the time about the hijacked airplanes .
But who could have guessed any President would exploit so dastardly an attack on his people to launch a war against Iraq , which he knew had nothing whatever to do with 9/11 , or its supposed mastermind Osama Bin Laden .
From the beginning of his presidency , though , it was clear Bush wanted to remake America after Bill Clinton 's two - terms .
As Newsweek remarks ' Bush rejected and tried to reverse everything that he could , almost as an article of faith .
His decision to blindly repudiate anything associated with Bill Clinton is what got us into this mess in the first place ' .
The ' mess ' is considerable .
Nuclear missile - owning Pakistan is ' lost ' - increasing hugely the risk of even more deadly terrorism .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are surely unwinnable in any real sense of the word .
According to some estimates , Bush has added $ 3trillion to America 's national debt , bringing it to $ 11 trillion .
He has also presided over an increase in the trade deficit from $ 377 billion to $ 800 billion .
The government 's unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations are estimated at $ 54trillion .
These are fantasy figures to most Americans but what they do notice is resurgent China and Russia .
The former has hosted the most spectacular Olympics ever .
Bush was there to cheer them on .
The Kremlin , meanwhile , acts like its knows America can do nothing about its over - the - top aggression in Georgia .
' While America has been bogged down and bled dry , China and Russia are plumping up , ' says The New York Times 's Maureen Dowd , who has written about Bush since 1999 .
' China has bought so much of the U.S. that we Americans would be Peking ducks if they pulled their investments out of our market , and Russia has transformed itself from a pauper nation to a land filled with millionaires - all through our addiction to oil . '
Even such famed U.S. companies as Yahoo , Google and Microsoft have had to comply with the demands of the Chinese - including censorship of the internet in order to win trade deals .
Worst of all for a nation which aspires to lead the world by example , America 's law - ignoring torture of terrorist suspects , held for years at Guantanamo Bay and numerous secret foreign locations , means the U.S. has lost its honour due to Bush & Co 's excesses .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
An out - of - control wildfire near one of the entrances to Yosemite National Park charred more than 18,000 acres , destroyed eight houses and has put about 2,000 homes at risk , fire officials said on Sunday .
Firefighters were able to control about 16 percent of the blaze , dubbed the “ Telegraph Fire , ” which began Friday afternoon , said Wayne Barringer , an information officer at the California Department for Forestry and Fire Prevention .
Seven outbuildings , including barns and sheds , were also destroyed , but there have been no reported injuries , said another officer , Daniel Berlant .
The fire has not seen any “ major movement ” in the past 12 hours , but remains “ very active ” on the south flank toward Mariposa , a town of about 1,800 inhabitants , and on the east flank toward Yosemite , according to the department ’s Web site .
“ It ’s tolerable today , but yesterday afternoon , there was a lot of ash falling down ” in Mariposa , Barringer said .
“ The fire ’s going in all directions , ” said Berlant .
“ There are reports of flame lengths over 100 feet . ”
About 195 homes in the towns of Midpines and Coulterville were under mandatory evacuation orders , officials said .

Midpines is a tiny community of about 600 people along one of the main highways to Yosemite , the storied 1,200 - square - mile
park in central California that gets nearly 4 million visitors a year .
The fire is not affecting the park itself , but power supply to Yosemite Valley , an area that includes popular sightseeing spots like El Capitan , has been cut off , said Julie Chavez , a Yosemite media relations officer .
“ We ’re running on generators , ” she said , adding that all four entrances to the park and major roads remain open .
But “ air quality and visibility have been impeded , ” Chavez said .
Berlant said the fire was caused by a spark from a person shooting at targets and was fueled by dry timber that has not burned for 100 years .
“ There ’s a lot of fuel for the fire burn , ” he said .
There are about 2,000 firefighters battling the blaze , along with 200 fire engines , 12 air tankers and 12 helicopters .
A big challenge to controlling the fire is steep , rugged terrain that makes access difficult , Berlant said .

Print This Email This Howard Wolfson , who since last year had spent his days undercutting Barack Obama as Hillary Clinton 's communications director , will start this week as a political analyst for the Fox News network , according to several reports .
Wolfson told the New York Times that Fox 's coverage of the Democratic primary was " fair and evenhanded . "
Much of the Clinton campaign came to favor
Fox toward the end of the campaign in the face of what they saw as a pro-Obama bent from the rest of the networks .
( For example , unlike , say , CNN or MSNBC , Fox gleefully spread the rumor that Obama was educated in a Madrassa , referred to his fist bump as a " terrorist fist jab , " implied his wife was an unwed mother and hosted a guest who joked about killing Obama . )
The latest member of the Fox News team tells the Times he wants to be a " strong progressive voice " on the predominantly conservative network .
Wolfson is the second member of Clinton 's inner-circle to jump to Fox News ; Lanny Davis , who was a prominent surrogate for Clinton during the campaign , was hired last month .
Former White House political adviser Karl Rove joined the network earlier this year and has been a frequent contributor through the primary season and this summer .
Wolfson , who will contribute to Fox part - time in addition to his work with the Glover Park lobbying firm , said he looked forward to taking on Rove .
In a separate interview with the Times , Rove echoed that sentiment , calling Wolfson " surprisingly pleasant and amiable . "
( Some reporters who dealt with Wolfson on the campaign trail have reached the opposite conclusion . )
In any case , there may be some room for agreement between the former Bush and Clinton henchmen .
During the primary , Rove praised Clinton on several occasions .
The former first lady even pointed to his analysis on the campaign trail in May , when it already was becoming increasingly clear that she could n't emerge as the Democratic nominee .
" I believe I am the stronger candidate .
And just today I found some curious support for that position when one of the TV networks released an analysis done by -- of all people -- Karl Rove saying that I was the stronger candidate , " Clinton said at a campaign stop in Kentucky .
" Somebody got a hold of his analysis and there it is . " "
Report : Mick Foley agrees to contractual terms with TNA Wrestling - info
Reported by Adam Martin of WrestleView.com On Thursday , August 28 , 2008 at 3:47 AM EST
Reports by The Pro Wrestling Torch and ProWrestling .net are stating that Mick Foley has agreed to contractual terms with TNA Wrestling and will debut with the company once he is able to do so .
Foley 's current WWE contract expires after September 1 .
It remains to be seen if his WWE deal would include a non-compete clause , creating speculation on when he would debut for TNA and whether it would go down at the company 's upcoming No Surrender PPV , TV tapings following that event ( the company already taped three weeks worth of TV this week in Orlando ) or even as late as the Bound For Glory PPV in October .
Earlier today ,
Ogre sent me a link to an article about the UK ’s plan to make people get licensed to smoke .
I read this incredible ( not in a good way ) article with something akin to creeping disgust .
The idea , in short , is that smokers would have to buy a permit from the government for £ 10 every year to be allowed to purchase cigarettes .
I suppose some might think that cigarette taxes and permit programs like this are justified as long as there ’s a national healthcare system to pay for everyone ’s hospital use and the like , since smokers are more prone to health problems , making it only fair to charge them extra .
Aside from the fact that it being only fair to charge people who get sick more often more money to pay for the healthcare system sounds like an argument for privatized healthcare , there ’s another problem with this argument .
I ’ll present it in bullet - points for the attention span impaired :
In other words , smokers are n’t just paying their own way — they ’re subsidizing everyone else ’s healthcare , too .
I guess picking one underrepresented group to gouge for all they ’re worth is one way to make a system solvent that would otherwise probably collapse under its own fiscal weight .
It ’s certainly a very democratic solution — let the two wolves and one sheep vote on what to have for lunch .
Remember that in the UK sheep ca n’t legally get guns to contest the vote .
Reading this sort of article might make some US citizens feel better about living in the US : for all the problems our government has with the concept of “ life , liberty , pursuit of ( happiness|property ) ” , at least we are n’t in the UK .
Right ?
We ’re still a bastion of freedom , comparatively speaking .
My thoughts run somewhat differently .
This does n’t make me feel any better about the US — it just makes me feel worse about the rest of the world .
That the US may still be the most free industrialized nation on the planet is very , very depressing — considering the level of freedom “ enjoyed ” here .
Okay , so to the reason I started typing up this entry at SOB in the first place — here ’s a quote I found “ interesting ” from the article :
Le Grand said the proposal was an example of “ libertarian paternalism ” .
The government would leave people free to make their own decisions but it would “ nudge them ” in the right direction .
My first reaction to this should be predictable .
Here it was , in IM conversation with Ogre :
Me : WTF is this “ libertarian paternalism ” crap ?
Ogre : well , he ’s british .
Ogre : I ’m not surprised to find out he literally does n’t know the definition of “ libertarian ”
In a general sense , Ogre has a point .
It seems like quite a few people from a certain subset of industrialized nations suffer that same handicap .
After some thought , however , I came to the conclusion that maybe Julian LeGrand really does know what he ’s talking about in this case .
What he said can , in fact , make some sick kind of sense , if you tilt your head to the left , squint your eyes , and pretend you ’re a willfully ignorant right bastard with an overweening , unjustified sense of self - importance .
I ’ll try to explain .
First , on the subject of children :
I ca n’t think of a really supportable libertarian argument that three year olds , in the real world , should generally be allowed to make all their own decisions without interference .
If the kid wants to touch the hot burner on the stove , one should not take a libertarian hands - off approach to parenting and just say “ That ’s a bad idea , but it ’s your decision . ”
Completely aside from the fact that your authoritarian government would throw your ass in jail and give your kid to a crack - smoking three - dollar whore running a foster home for the government handouts , that ’s just a damned cruel way to raise a child .
“ Go ahead — lose a finger , kiddo .
Maybe you ’ll learn something from the experience . ”
There are a number of different answers to the question of how one determines that a human being has reached a level of maturity suitable to making one ’s own decisions amongst libertarians ( and others , though “ others ” generally have a less encompassing notion of what “ making one ’s own decisions ” actually means , obviously — so they do n’t count ) .
Probably the most common is to simply not think about it , and to accept the idea of letting government set an age limit arbitrarily for various types of ( at least nominally ) “ adult ” decisions .
Some ( like me ) , on the other hand , consider this a ridiculous approach — it ignores people who mature more quickly , and people who are still essentially children at age 30 , to set some arbitrary chronological criteria for “ adulthood ” like “ I ’m eighteen , so I ’m mostly an adult , except for that whole alcohol thing . ”
My take is that adulthood should consist of a combination of a legal test and assumption .
Think about it : a legal “ minor ” in the United States is barred from making all sorts of decisions for him or her self .
A legal “ minor ” , say fifteen years of age , cannot just walk out of the house one day and get a job in a chemical plant , rent an apartment , and live parent - free , generally speaking .
The exceptions involve either flying under radar ( doing so “ illegally ” , in other words ) or legal emancipation .
A minor can sue for emancipation .
This involves a lengthy court process whereby the “ child ” proves to some legal standard that he or she is , in fact , possessed of the maturity of an adult .
This then releases him or her from the fetters of parental oversight , granting recognition to a nontrivial degree as a legal adult — though some things are still reserved to age , of course .
Ca n’t have an arbitrary measure of “ adulthood ” with complete exceptions — parents ’ groups would be up in arms over fourteen year olds suing for emancipation so they can go get drunk at a fraternity house party .
We all know how influential these parents ’ groups can be when it comes time for getting elected to office .
Perhaps , then , the answer is to treat the matter of adulthood entirely as a matter of legal rights and responsibilities possessed by the individual .
If parent and child effectively agree on an age of emancipation , no legal involvement is necessary — unless something happens to the “ child ” in question , and criminal negligence on the part of the parent in freeing the “ child ” from parental control is determined to be a factor in the unfortunate event .
If they disagree , an emancipation proceeding may be necessary to determine whether the “ child ” is in fact entitled to emancipation , and whether the parent is in fact freed from legal parental responsibility .
The whole thing could be run on an “ innocent until proven guilty ” basis , and may even be wildly successful at reducing the number of 23 year olds who do insane things that get people killed , while allowing the particularly perspicacious to get out from under the yoke of parental oppression at an earlier age .
Good parents , too , would be rewarded while bad parents might substantially be made better .
Nice how eliminating arbitrary limits and giving people the freedom to enjoy their rights can make the world a better place .
So . . . what does this have to do with cigarette purchase licensing in the UK and the term “ libertarian paternalism ” ?
Simply put , the key is in the word “ paternalism ” and a more common term for the same sort of governmental behavior : “ nanny state ” .
It ’s possible — if you tilt your head to the left , squint your eyes , and pretend you ’re a willfully ignorant right bastard with an overweening , unjustified sense of self - importance — to imagine that you ’re a libertarian while charging £ 10 annually for a license to smoke , even if you understand what the word “ libertarian ” means .
The key is in the definition of “ adult ” .
One might simply assume that , to some degree , all people are children unless they meet some arbitrary , government enforced criteria — and that one may cease to be an adult in old age , as well as growing to be an adult at a younger age , and possibly even have fluctuating levels of adultness over the course of a life .
If that ’s your basis for determining adulthood , government suddenly has a responsibility to monitor one ’s adulthood , and to act to some degree as a parental unit .
This basically turns my above - described solution to emancipation on its head , assuming childhood with the state as ultimate guardian , rather than assuming adulthood when all involved individuals mutually agree .
It ’s assumption of guilt — which is normal for the British criminal “ justice ” system , anyway .
If you ’re going to use arbitrary measures like whether or not someone has reached the age of 18 for “ allowing ” some “ adult ” decisions , one may as well use other arbitrary measures .
Why not an annual license ?
Perhaps , being older than 18 , you have the “ adult ” decision - making ability to determine whether you should have the “ adult ” decision - making ability to purchase cigarettes — and paying £ 10 proves you have enough disposable income to support your habit and the idea that you ’re a self - sufficient adult !
It ’s hopelessly meta , and terribly illogical , of course — even if it can be a dangerously attractive train of thought for the weak - minded .
It does n’t require that one fundamentally misunderstands the concept of “ libertarian ” , though .
It just requires that one be a willfully ignorant right bastard with an overweening , unjustified sense of self - importance .
That , or maybe a garden - variety idiot .
Hershey names David West as new CEO HARRISBURG , Pa.  The Hershey Co. board said Tuesday that another former Nabisco executive will follow Richard H. Lenny at the helm of the nation 's largest candymaker .
David J. West , Hershey 's chief operating officer , was named company president and a director , effectively immediately , and will become chief executive on Dec. 1 , the board said in a statement .
The move came a day after Lenny announced he was stepping down as chief executive following six tumultuous years at Hershey .
" Dave is a very strong leader with an in - depth knowledge of all aspects of Hershey 's business , " company director Robert H. Campbell said in the statement .
Hershey 's stock fell $ 1.63 a share , or 3.4 percent , to $ 45.78 in trading Tuesday .
Lenny , who was the first CEO hired from outside Hershey , will remain as chairman through the end of the year , when Campbell will take over , the company said .
Campbell is the former chairman and chief executive of Philadelphia - based petroleum refiner Sunoco Inc. and has been a Hershey director since 1995 .
Soon after Lenny left Nabisco for Hershey in 2001 , he hired West away from the snack company to come up with a marketing plan for the candymaker .
West became Hershey 's chief financial officer in 2005 and chief operating officer in January .
After shrugging off a near - sale and a six - week strike in 2002 , Hershey 's revenue grew quickly -- 6.2 percent in 2004 and 8.8 percent in 2005 -- on the strength of new and limited edition versions of some of its best known brands , such as Hershey 's Kisses and Reese 's peanut butter cups .
However , the company has yet to recover after it stumbled last fall while shifting from those products to a new platform of dark and organic chocolates , which it views as a fast growing , high - margin segment .
Advertising flopped , leaving stores backed up with its older products .
Its closest competitor , Mars Inc. , which makes M&M's , gained ground in the domestic market .
Hershey 's share price also has suffered , dropping from almost $ 58 a share two years ago .
Meanwhile , Lenny has sought to expand Hershey 's reach with joint ventures in China and India , where its competitors are already active .
Earlier this year , Hershey announced it will close six U.S. and Canadian plants and cut more than 3,000 workers in the two countries , including 900 total at its hometown plants , and shift more of its production to contractors and a new plant under construction in Mexico .

Yesterday I mentioned the irony of John McCain 's complaining that Barack Obama " did n't understand " the difference between strategy and tactics , given that the Obama campaign seemed guided by a long - term strategy leading to November 4 while McCain was fighting day by day tactical battles .

THIS year ’s Little League World Series , which began on Friday , is a lavish , nationally televised American sporting event .
At the site of the series in South Williamsport , Pa. , there is a tent for the tournament ’s corporate sponsors to show off their products , an instant - replay system to decide close calls and a perfectly groomed , two - stadium baseball complex .
For all of the tournament ’s seductive gloss , Little League was born in poverty .
In 1938 , Carl E. Stotz , a Williamsport oil company clerk , lost his job when the business shut down the plant where he worked .
As Stotz explained in his 1992 autobiography , “ A Promise Kept , ” when he was n’t working the odd job , he  at the urging of two baseball - crazy young nephews  devoted much of his time to planning the very first Little League .
And when he organized the first games in 1939 , knowing firsthand how tough the times were , he refused to charge parents for the privilege of having their children in his league .
He relied on donations from local businesses instead .
By the early 1950s , Stotz had turned Little League into an international organization , and he enshrined his no - fee policy as an official rule .
Even though Stotz eventually broke with Little League after a bitter fight with the organization ’s board , his rule remains .
You can find it in on page 39 of this year ’s 88 - page Little League rule book .

I recently found a shell injection bug in some Ruby - gem I use .
Shell injections have scared me for a long time and I usually prefer to whitelist certain characters / patterns rather than to blacklist .
This means that the system fails to the save side .
Unfortunally it usually does fail – my whitelisting is to rigorous and data that would not cause any problems gets rejected .
So I decided to take the opportunity to investigate how to prevent shell injection in my favorite scripting language ( Python ) , the language I found the problem in and finally the language that I can not avoid ( PHP ) .
Ruby
In Ruby you can use exec and system in a shell injection save way .
If you pass a single string to them they will expand all shell characters , but if you pass the command and arguments separately , they wo n’t be interpreted by the shell :
irb ( main ) : 011:0 > system ( " echo -e $ ( seq 5 ) " ) 1 2 3 4 5 => true irb( main ) : 012:0 > system ( " echo " , " - e " , " $ ( seq 5 ) " ) $ ( seq 5 ) => true
Unfortunally IO.popen and the backticks do n’t have such a feature .
Ruby really leaves you in the rain here ( and that triggers bugs like the one mentioned in the intro ) .
UPDATE : As 13 k mentioned below there is a stdlib method now : shellescape .
Here the escape - library jumps in :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > require ' escape ' => true irb( main ) : 002:0 > s=`#{Escape.shell_command([" echo " , " $ ( seq ) " , " \ " '`seq` && | | " ] ) }` => " $ ( seq ) \ " ' `seq` && ||
"
Something like that should really become part of the ruby standard library .
Python
Since version 2.4
Python has the subprocess - module which claims to handle arguments securly :
Unlike some other popen functions , this implementation will never call / bin / sh implicitly .
This means that all characters , including shell metacharacters , can safely be passed to child processes .
By default shell characters will not be expanded .
>>> import subprocess >>> subprocess.call ( [ " ls " , " *.c " ] ) ls : *.c :
No such file or directory
However , you can tell it , to do so by setting shell =True :
>>> import subprocess >>> subprocess.call( "ls *.c " , shell =True ) crack_rsa_in_qudratic_time.c
Did you notice , that the syntax slightly changed ?
I passed " ls *.c " instead of [ " ls " , " *.c " ] .
The latter wont work without shell =True :
>>> subprocess.call ( [ " ls " , " *.c " ] , shell =True ) a_short_proof_of_fermats_last_theorem.tex loveletter.tex crack_rsa_in_qudratic_time.c showargs.sh 0
In fact it just calls “ ls ” .
It took me quite some time to figure out , what ’s going on .
Digging through the subprocess source I found :
if shell : args = [ " / bin/sh " , " - c " ] + args if executable is None : executable = args [ 0 ] .... if env is None : os.execvp( executable , args ) else : os.execvpe ( executable , args , env )
So calling subprocess.call ( [ " ls " , " *.c " ] , shell =True ) is ( roughly ) equivalent to os.execvp ( " / bin/sh " , [ " - c " , " ls " , " - l " ) .
And the man page of bash explains :
-c string
If the -c option is present , then commands are read from string .
If there are arguments after the string , they are assigned to the positional parameters , starting with $ 0 .
Reading this carfully you might guess that sh -c in fact does not “ call ” the program after the -c parameter but invokes the “ shell - script ” and sets the positional parameters $ 0 , $ 1 , $ 2 , ... according to the following arguments .
The following should clarify what ’s going on :
>>> import subprocess >>> subprocess.call ( [ ' echo $ 0 $ 1 $ 2 $ 3 ' , ' arg0 ' , ' arg1 ' , ' arg2 ' , ' arg3 ' ] , shell =True ) arg0 arg1 arg2 arg3 0
This is a bit sad , since it implies that using shell =True , changes the syntax of of call ( ) and Popen ( ) .
If you really want to use shell expansion , it is probably best to put the whole command in one string .
Read more about subprocess .
PHP
PHP offers the usual commands :
system ( ) , exec ( ) , passthru( ) and backticks .
None of them protects you from shell injection by default .
You have to use escapeshellarg ( ) or escapeshellcmd ( ) .
McDowell says reinstated powers could be tagged on to net neutrality debate by leading Democrats

Wednesday , August 13 , 2008
FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell says that the potential re-introduction of the Fairness Doctrine under a Democratic administration could lead to “ government dictating content policy ” on the Internet .
The Fairness Doctrine was an FCC regulation mandating broadcasters afford time to opposing viewpoints .
It was abolished in 1987 by the Supreme Court after it was found to be harmful to journalistic freedom and anathema to the First Amendment .
Speaking to the Business and Media Institute , McDowell stated that the Fairness Doctrine could return under a different name and be tagged on to the net neutrality debate , opening the door for the government to regulate content on the Web .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
McDowell said the net neutrality effort could win the support of “ a few isolated conservatives ” who may not fully realize the long - term effects of government regulation .

Watch the clip .
“ I think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content , their points of view , right , ” McDowell said .
“ I think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy , which by the way would have a big First Amendment problem , ” said McDowell .
“ Then , whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair , under a so - called ‘ Fairness Doctrine , ’ which wo n’t be called that – it ’ll be called something else , ” McDowell said .
“ So , will Web sites , will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their Web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that ? ” he added .
The reinstitution of the Fairness Doctrine has strong support amongst top Democratic powerbrokers and an effort to push it through under a different name is expected should Barack Obama secure the presidency .
In June , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that the Democratic caucus was interested in bringing back the Fairness Doctrine .
Senators Richard Durbin and John Kerry have also publicly supported its return .
Neo -Con radio talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh have long railed against the Fairness Doctrine , but its impact would be felt by all alternative news outlets , who would be forced to devote some of their time to parroting government talking points while enduring constant harassment and threat of closure .

Comment on this article
In the last two presidential elections , we have been forced to watch from afar as public officials in closely contested states abuse their authority in clear attempts to sway the entire election .
Who could forget Florida and the infamous Katherine Harris , who refused to count legitimate votes during the 2000 presidential election ?
In 2004 , it was Ohio ’s Ken Blackwell not allocating enough voting machines in Democratic - leaning areas and insisting that voter registration cards be of a specific weight or be thrown out .
Harris and Blackwell were not only state officials charged with running the elections , they were also partisan campaign officials for George W. Bush .
In the end , their reprehensible actions clearly helped make Bush president in both elections while disenfranchising countless voters .
In 2008 , it looks like Republicans will once again do anything to win , but this time Wisconsinites may have a front - row seat to all of their shenanigans and attempts to suppress the vote .
Complications and Challenges on Election Day
Last week the highest - ranking Republican official in the state , Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen , filed a frivolous election lawsuit against Wisconsin ’s Government Accountability Board ( GAB ) .
In the suit , Van Hollen demands that the GAB overturn a recent decision and change election procedures just before a presidential election that will likely have record turnout .
Federal law requires each state to match their voter registration list with other state records , such as the Department of Transportation database .
Those matches are already taking place , but Van Hollen wants them to go back retroactively to 2006 .
Van Hollen ’s action would require that people with non-matching data be disqualified from casting a regular ballot on Election Day .
This could greatly complicate voting for hundreds of thousands of people in Wisconsin simply because of things like a clerical error , a missing middle initial or the listing of an old address on a driver ’s license .
Recently , the GAB announced that even four of the six judges on its own board failed a complete match against the voter data .
If Van Hollen ’s lawsuit is successful , their names will be dropped from the voter rolls and they would be forced to cast provisional ballots , which are much easier to challenge and require an additional trip to the polls to prove eligibility by the next day .
Friends of the Shepherd Help support Milwaukee 's locally owned free weekly newspaper .

The League of Women Voters opposes Van Hollen ’s lawsuit because it would “ disenfranchise people just because at some time in their lives , their data was entered somewhat differently into two different databases . ”
They also caution that the rule would cause long lines and confusion at the polls .
Municipal clerks testified at a GAB hearing that such a rule would compromise their efforts to run fair and clean elections this November and , among other problems , could prevent absentee ballots from being sent overseas to Wisconsin soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The GAB has also expressed its concern , saying that Van Hollen ’s plan could cause unnecessary hardship and confusion at the polls and the disenfranchisement of Wisconsin citizens with a clear and legitimate right to vote .
Van Hollen said in an interview last week that such criticism shows that people do n’t understand the lawsuit that he has filed .
Some have taken his statement to be the height of arrogance , since the board of the GAB consists of six retired judges who surely understand both the federal law and Van Hollen ’s frivolous lawsuit .
Van Hollen ’s a Reliable Tool for the Republican Party
Van Hollen has insisted that his lawsuit has no partisan motive .
Actually , he started defending his motives before anyone even started to call them into question , which makes one think that the attorney general “ doth protest too much . ”
After all , Van Hollen brought this lawsuit only weeks after the GAB rejected the Republican Party ’s request to implement the very same rule .
Immediately after Van Hollen filed the suit , the Republican Party of Wisconsin praised his partisan action , saying that he “ lived up to an important campaign promise . ”
Van Hollen is not only a reliable tool of his political party , but he is also a co-chair for the John McCain presidential campaign in Wisconsin .
In what promises to be another close election , Van Hollen ’s proposed rule would likely have a disproportionate effect on groups of people that are not as likely to support McCain .
Immediately after the attorney general announced that he filed the lawsuit , One Wisconsin Now demanded that he recuse himself from any election - related lawsuits because of his very obvious conflicts of interest .
Van Hollen has refused to do so .
McCain often uses the theme “ Country First , ” but apparently Van Hollen prefers to practice “ Party First , ” as he uses his position of authority to act in support of his Republican masters and to the detriment of scores of voters .
Even the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , often a milquetoast when it comes to the darlings of the right wing , flatly says that Van Hollen ’s action “ smells of political mischief . ”
More McCain Mischief
The frivolous lawsuit that Van Hollen has sprung on the public is not the only sign that there is mischief being made for unsuspecting vot ers .
The Wisconsin State Journal has reported on a large number of mailings sent out by McCain ’s presidential campaign that include absentee ballot applications that were addressed to the wrong municipal clerk .
It appears that the mailings with the wrong addresses were mostly directed toward Wisconsin Democrats .
These developments have led some to question whether the Arizona senator ’s campaign is deliberately trying to get certain voters to apply for absentee ballots in places where they are n’t eligible to vote .
Mark Jefferson , executive director of the state GOP , claimed that the mailing was not intended to keep people from the polls and that the problem resulted from incorrect information in the databases used for the mailing .
He went on to comment that “ you do the best with the lists you have , and no list is perfect . ”
Apparently he holds different standards for lists that the GOP is using to send out erroneous information as opposed to the one that Van Hollen is suing the state of Wisconsin over .
Regardless of Jefferson ’s excuse - making and inconsistency , the state elections agency is now investigating the massively misleading McCain mailing .
One can only worry about what will happen when record numbers of Wisconsinites try to vote this November .
Will all of these seemingly coordinated efforts significantly derail the massive turnout that is expected ?
Voters would do well to fully inform themselves of these events and tac tics and to be diligent in ensuring that their vote is counted regardless of the attempted roadblocks that may be erected .
You can learn more about protecting your right to vote by visiting http://ProtectWisconsinsVote.org, which includes a helpful voter tool kit .
In an interview on WisconsinEye last week , Van Hollen was asked if a person who gets flagged under his lawsuit would get a notice advising them of the problem before they show up to vote in November .
The ini tial word that Van Hollen uses to respond is as telling as it is disturbing : “ Hopefully … ”
He then tries to pawn off all of those inevitable problems onto the GAB .
So Van Hollen files a lawsuit that could create mass confusion if enforcedand somehow that is not his problem or even a concern ?
Such a response lends itself to the idea that chaos at the polls is not just an afterthought , but precisely the goal in the first place .

NOT since the 1975 release of ' ' Jaws ' ' have sharks received as much media attention as they did last summer , when three people were killed in a series of attacks along the East Coast .
And just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water , experts are predicting that the number of shark attacks in the United States this summer may surpass the 55 reported last year , as more and more people flock to the beach .
'' Like thunderstorms , there will be more shark incidents this summer , '' Robert E. Hueter , director of the Center for Shark Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota , Fla. , said at a news conference on shark attacks last month in Washington .
Indeed , most people who have been in the ocean have come within 15 feet of a shark without knowing it , other experts said at the news conference .
Looking to allay fears , an Australian company has introduced a lightweight electronic device that repels sharks .
The Shark Shield , which weighs a pound and is about the size of a mobile phone , attaches to the ankle and surrounds surfers or swimmers with an electromagnetic field that affects the shark 's central nervous system .
The discomfort from the field becomes worse as the shark approaches until it causes muscle spasms and prompts the shark to turn away .

August 6 , 2008 -- Durban 's University of KwaZulu - Natal vice - chancellor Malegapuru Makgoba is expected to deliver an edict that the Centre for Civil Society will close on December 31 .
The reason given by dean Donal McCracken to a sceptical School of Development Studies ( where the centre is housed ) is that staff do not have " permanent " funding .
But neither do most of the university 's research units , and there is money in centre reserves for at least a couple of years , plus ongoing donor support for many of our projects .
Hence this " execution " will be doggedly resisted because UKZN still has many staff and students who remember the struggle for non-racial democracy and do n't mind speaking out to challenge misguided decisions .
As the two most senior academics in the centre , holding an honorary professorship and tenured research chair , respectively , we will resist , despite what a UKZN internal report recorded -- an environment of " intimidation and bullying " , in which management " deploys power rather than intellect " , as Rhodes professor Jimi Adesina put it .
The decision is misguided for many reasons , not least for overturning the official recommendation of a five - month University Research Review finalised in February , which advocated strengthening the centre and giving it more autonomy : " Closing down or removing the centre from UKZN does not appear to be an option as it was rejected by all interviewees and panel members .
Through its international recognition and standing , the centre has put UKZN on a world map in social science , a position the university dare not risk to lose . "
Newsmakers
On the local map , the centre has offered nearly 100 free events a year , including seminars , conferences , micro film festivals , literary celebrations and the Harold Wolpe Lecture , Durban 's main lecture series .
In Howard College , several hundred community residents join academics on the last Thursday of each month to debate newsmakers and intellectuals , global and local -- such as , this year , commentator Xolela Mangcu , Soweto activist Trevor Ngwane , filmmaker John Pilger , Kenyan feminist Eunice Sahle and Zimbabwe democracy activists Judith Todd and Joy Mabengwe , as well as local anti-xenophobia campaigners Baruti Amisi , Pierre Matate and Orlean Naidoo .
Among our inspirations is Fatima Meer , whom we host this Sunday in Chatsworth in celebration of her 80 years of commitment and wisdom , as well as her decade of support to the " new social movements " in the original Concerned Citizens Forum which in 1998 helped renew urban justice advocacy across South Africa .
Meer 's
Wolpe lecture last year called for a progressive , post - nationalist liberatory politics to emerge from the grassroots , like the creative spark generated in 2001 when the World Social Forum in Brazil rose against the World Economic Forum in Switzerland .
With our centre 's assistance , the Social Movement Indaba network and Diakonia Council of Churches hosted a local equivalent in January , drawing 400 community and labour leaders .
Among those present were many who resisted Inanda Dam displacement , Treatment Action Campaigners and Congolese inner-city traders who hang in against all odds .
Evidence of abuse in the authorities ' diktat to shut the centre ranges from a flawed process , to extreme race and gender implications , since contract termination affects a dozen black staff , most of whom are working class .
The only paid staffer who should retain his job , McCracken told us , is the sole white expatriate ( a writer of this article , Bond , whose government research subsidies more than pay his salary ) .
In addition to UKZN 's threat to this centre and a generation of new critical scholars , a great deal of concrete research activity is now at risk .
UKZN claims it has South Africa 's " second best " research profile ( after the University of Pretoria ) .
A modest contribution comes from our centre staff 's peer - reviewed articles , chapters and books -- 58 in 2007 with an average 50 a year since 2005 ( and no , these fortnightly Mercury columns do n't count ) -- which rank us at the top of the university , measured per academic employee .
High productivity arises from documenting and interrogating the social laboratories of Durban , South Africa , Africa and the world , where contradictions generated by globalisation and the flawed character of post - colonial politics create conflict .
We have sought sites and research areas -- climate , energy , water / sanitation , global and national political economy , survival strategies and community philanthropy , the rise of social movements in Africa -- where these contradictions tell us more about society , politics , economy , gender , race , environment and other social relations than we would normally get from our academic armchairs .
Conflicts
Beyond merely trying to understand the conflicts , serious scholars will contribute to addressing them in a non-violent manner , such as through international legal strategies that the other writer of this article , Brutus , contributes to .
He does this with the Jubilee and the Khulumani Support Group , aiming for US $ 400 billion ( R2951 billion ) in reparations to be paid by apartheid - era US and EU corporations -- which hopefully will frighten them enough to think twice about their next investment in the Sudan , Zimbabwe , Burma and the like .
The danger of the centre 's approach to knowledge production , " praxis " , is that the research generated sometimes threatens the privileges of power .
Two years ago , the same authorities banned Ashwin Desai from continuing employment at the centre and at UKZN , amidst a haze of confusion and weak excuses .
We lost a major Human Sciences Research Council " Race and Redress " grant as a result of this interference .
In 2003 , the US Agency for International Development retracted a multimillion - rand donation after centre founder Adam Habib spoke out against the Iraq war .
That sort of style the centre encouraged from the outset : honest and courageous , combining the left brain 's love of rigorous detail , and the left side of the body 's beating heart .
UKZN management has stabbed this centre , but it can not be allowed to die .
So this is really all about politics , and whether a university can host a critical mass of professional academics and community scholars devoted to social justice .

ImpeachForPeace.org cofounder Jodin Morey discusses at the RNC why even as Cheney and Bush leave office , impeachment is still crucial to the health of our republic . —
So I ’m here to talk to you about impeachment , and I know what you ’re thinking “ Bush is almost out of office . ”
But this is n’t about Bush .
The underlying problem does not end with him , it preceded him , and it will endure after him .
I ’m here today to advocate for impeachment as an ever - present value in YOUR life .
We should see impeachment as a cherished tool that balances power between us and government .
We should never have allowed government , or media to convince us impeachment is extreme or divisive .
We need to alter our thinking about impeachment to coincide with that of early presidents and the founders of our nation .
James Madison was proud that the Constitution made impeachment of a power abusing president “ easy . ”
Since I ’ve been alive , almost every president who has been in office has abused their power in such a way as to warrant impeachment .
We should impeach George W. Bush .
We should have impeached Reagan .
We should have impeached Bush Sr ,
we should have impeached Clinton , but NOT for his lying about a blowjob , but rather for military actions overseas .
The media of course largely ignored Clinton ’s abuse of power in Yugoslavia and Mogadishu .
And anyone who believes that the next president will magically remain within his constitutional restrictions is fooling themselves .
If you do n’t support impeachment now , when will you ?
When it ’s time to impeach McCain ?
When it ’s time to impeach Obama ?
Will you once again accuse the impeachment movement of being divisive ?
Or INSTEAD will you recognize the corrupt GOVERNMENT for being divisive ?
Will you once again ask for impeachment to wait until we ’ve won the next midterm elections , and after those elections will you then say that it ’s too late ?
Will you once again believe what the media tells you about the likelihood of impeachment , or will you fight for a cause because it ’s right .
And believe that today ’s impossibility is tomorrow ’s reality .
If you only fight for the causes that the media tells you are possible , how does that make you special or a visionary ?
How does that make you courageous or bring meaning to your life ?
You ’ve seen that bumper sticker that reads , “ I ’m already against the NEXT war ? ”
Well , I ’m already in favor of impeaching the NEXT PRESIDENT ! ”
Until we do , and continue doing it with every president that abuses their power , they wo n’t stop .
And why should they ?
They ’ve got a pretty good deal going .
Presidents can do whatever they want and get away with it .
That ’s the weird thing about accountability .
No one forces it upon themselves .
Our founding fathers knew that .
Jefferson once said , “ In questions of power let no more be said of confidence in man , but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution . ”
What happens when you create a powerful office in which the officers are not accountable to the public ?
Politicians who are unsavory gravitate towards it .
We are asked to trust the president with the power to spy on us .
But a presidency that demands trust attracts untrustworthy presidents .
It ’s easy to fix the problem , our founding fathers knew the solution : Checks balances , and transparency .
When you turn on the cellar light , the roaches scurry .
But congress has learned that WE do n’t care about accountability as much as the LOBBYISTS care about the status quo .
After all , if we turn on the light of transparency , the roaches known as lobbyist will be caught in the act as well .
So , instead , the president breaks the law , and congress fiddles .
It seems so obvious when you think about it that one should impeach a criminal president .
Think of any other criminal .
Say a rapist .
What if a judge were to stop prosecuting rapists because he said that doing so was divisive , or that their crime was in that past and that we should be looking forward instead .
That ’s what our congress has done , except instead of raping a person our president has raped a country and congress refuses to prosecute .
As a result a million are dead , millions more are displaced , and future presidents will feel free to rape countries as they wish . , until we start impeaching them .
Until then , our democracy will continue deconstructing until there is no democracy left .
We ’ll slide slowly into totalitarianism while singing “ Land of the free and Home of the Brave . ” 
But when we ’re not brave enough to stand up to our presidents , we lose that freedom .
If everyone who thought Bush should have been impeached would have called their congressperson , we ’d be in a different kind of country today .
You could still do it right now .
Even if it does n’t result in Bush ’s impeachment , it will let congress know that the public is behind impeachment in principle when a president goes haywire .
Maybe then they ’ll start holding presidents accountable .
But it ’s always easy to come up with reasons not to do something , or why something might fail .
And that pessimism can be a self - fulfilling prophecy .
We can go the way of societies like Nazi Germany who were too pessimistic or distracted to do the right thing when there was still time to do it .
We seem willing to do that with the environment .
But can we afford that luxury ?
What will it take to motivate good people to turn off their TV and make the difference that ’s necessary ?
Let me leave you with a hopeful thought .
Because I believe we will eventually start impeaching presidents freely .
We ’ll have to .
So imagine the presidency we ’ll have one day when they fear impeachment .
When so many before them have been impeached , and imprisoned that they fear the power of the people .
A presidency with so much transparency , oversight , and accountability that they know they ca n’t step too far out of bounds .
Imagine the kind of politician who would never run for such an office .
Do you think Cheney would wish to work there ?
Imagine the kind of president that office will attract .
A president who is n’t afraid to have the people see what she ’s doing .
A president who preserves and restores our civil liberties .
A president so proud of her work that she wo n’t claim executive privilege .
A president who identifies with citizens , not corporations .
A president who does n’t fear our free speech .
A president with the interests of the people paramount in her mind .
A president the founding fathers envisioned was possible only after they mandated the use of impeachment .
Writing code that does async I/O is a total pain in the ass .
And I ’ve written a whole lot of async I/ O code , so I should know .
However , if you ’re working in a language with full support for continuations it is a lot easier .
JavaScript does n’t support continuations fully , but it has generators , which is like a lite - version of continuations .
That is part of the reason why I ’m interested in JavaScript scripting .
So , I ’ve been experimenting with how to bind GIO - style async operations in JavaScript so that its easier to write async I /O code .
I ’ve got something going now that looks pretty ok .
Here is an example that calls an async function “ $open ” to read three files .
It also demonstrates how to do calls from one async generator to another .
do_stuff = new AsyncRunner ( function ( filenames ) { for ( let i in filenames ) { var data = yield $ open ( filenames [ i ] , 0 ) ; print ( " data for " + filenames [ i ] + " = " + data ) ; } var ret = yield do_stuff2.call ( " other.txt " ) ; print ( " AsyncRunner call returned : " + ret ) ; } ) ;
do_stuff2 = new AsyncRunner ( function ( filename ) { var data = yield $ open ( filename , 0 ) ; print ( " data for " + filename + " = " + data ) ; yield " the end ( of do_stuf f2 ) " } ) ;
do_stuff.start(null , [ " test.txt " , " test2.txt " ] ) ;
Its IMHO pretty easy to understand .
At every async op we yield which suspends execution and restarts it at that point when we have the operation results .
The “ $ ” in “ $open ” is just to make it different from the sync variant and still short .
This code is far easier than it would look in C , where we would have to split out a new function at each async function call .
The loop in do_stuff makes this quite tricky to do .
The code that implements this is here .
Its somewhat complicated , using things like currying , closures and generators , so read it carefully .
I ’d like some feedback on this .
Are there any tricks I ’ve missed that could make this nicer ?
I really wish javascript had a macro facility so that the yield keyword could be put inside the async calls and we could avoid the boilderplate around the AsyncRunner creation .
I would also like to make the AsyncRunner objects callable like “ do_stuff2 ( ) ” , but that does n’t seem possible with standard javascript ( although it is the AsyncRunner class is implemented natively via the spidermonkey APIs … )

( CNN ) -- Keeping a cell phone on talk mode in a pocket can decrease sperm quality , according to new research from the Cleveland Clinic .
" We believe that these devices are used because we consider them very safe , but it could cause harmful effects due to the proximity of the phones and the exposure that they are causing to the gonads , " says lead researcher Ashok Agarwal , the Director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine .
In the small study , Agarwal 's team took semen samples from 32 men and brought them to the lab .
Each man 's sample was placed into small , conical tubes and divided into two parts : a test group and a control group .
The control group was unexposed to cell phone emissions , but kept under the same conditions and temperature as the test group .
The semen in the test group was placed 2.5 centimeters from an 850 MHz cell phone in talk mode for 1 hour .
Researchers say that 850 MHz is the most commonly used frequency .
They used the measurement of 2.5 centimeters to mimic the distance between the trouser pocket and the testes .
Agarwal reasoned that many men keep their active cell phones in their pants pocket while talking on their headsets .
Do n't Miss Read the entire study
Overall , researchers found an increase in oxidative stress such as a significant increase in free radicals and oxidants and a decrease in antioxidants .
Agarwal says that equals a decrease in sperm 's quality , including motility and viability .
Evidence of oxidative stress can appear under other conditions , including exposure to certain environmental pollutants or infections in the urinary genital tract .
" On average , there was an 85 percent increase in the amount of free radicals for all the subjects in the study .
Free radicals have been linked to a variety of diseases in humans including cancer , " said Agarwal .
Free radicals have been linked to decreased sperm quality in previous studies .
However , the study does have major limitations , he acknowledged , such as the small sample size .
It also was conducted in a lab and so cannot account for the protection a human body might offer , such as layers of skin , bone and tissue .
Agarwal is in the early stages of further research that can model the human body 's role in protecting from radio - frequency electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones .
Agarwal also admits that there is no clear explanation of this demonstrated effect , but he shared some of his theories .
" Perhaps the cell phone radiation is able to affect the gonads through a thermal effect thereby increasing the temperature of the testes and causing damaging effects in the sperm cell . "
In a previous study , Agarwal and his team found that men who used their cell phones more than four hours a day had significantly lower sperm quality than those who used their cell phones for less time .
Those findings were based on self - reported data from 361 subjects .
While representatives from the cell phone industry had not yet reviewed the latest study , they were careful not to give this study much merit .
" The weight of the published scientific evidence , in addition to the opinion of global health organizations , shows that there is no link between wireless usage and adverse health effects , " said Joe Farren , a spokesman for the CTIA - the Wireless Association .
" We support good science and always have , " he said .
" It 's important to look at studies that are peer - reviewed and published in leading journals and to listen to the experts . "
Agarwal emphasized that it is far too early for men to start changing cell phone carrying habits , noting that his own cell phone was in his pocket as he talked to CNN .
" Our study has not provided proof that you should stop putting cell phones in your pocket .
There are many things that need to be proven before we get to that stage , " he said .

There are two major , recent improvements in Perl 6 development :
Patrick Michaud implemented pre-compiled modules for Rakudo .
Precompiling Test.pm greatly reduced the time for running the test suite .
The time for make spectest_regression was reduced from 8 minutes 20 seconds to 2 minutes 40 seconds on my PC .
Larry Wall has been working on his Parser for Perl 6 ( called STD.pm ) .
It can now parse all of the test suite , and even can add operators on the fly .
This week Larry added symbol tables , which means that STD .pm now detects undeclared subs and variables as well as constructs that were missing , and were errornously parsed as sub calls .
This already helped to fix quite some tests in the test suite .
Enlarge AP / Facebook Social networking website Facebook is updating its look .
CEO Mark Zuckerberg is hoping to avoid a backlash as the popular online hangout prepares to impose its new look on its 100 million users , whether they like it or not .
SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) 
The popular online hangout Facebook is forcing users to adapt to a redesigned website — whether they like the new look or not — starting today .
Facebook 's facelift includes separating users ' personal profiles into different areas of the site and providing more tools meant to make it easier to share information and photos .
Since unveiling the makeover seven weeks ago , Facebook had left it up to users to decide whether they wanted to switch over .
But that option will be taken away from all users by the end of the week .
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says the changes — although for the better — will alienate some of Facebook 's 100 million users .
But the company is hoping the gradual unveiling of the changes , which began last May , will ease the transition .

Twenty - five years ago today ( boy that was a long time ) I finished the internship that changed my life .
My bosses at Spinnaker Software gave me a lot of room and I ran with it .
Last March , I posted about an intern program I was starting .
I was overwhelmed by the quality of what I got back .
( The quantity was expected … interesting internships are hard to find ) .
I heard from students on most continents , with a huge variety of backgrounds and life experiences .
And these people were smart .
Unable to just pick a PDF or two , I invited the applicants to join a Facebook group I had set up .
Then I let them meet each other and hang out online .
It was absolutely fascinating .
Within a day , the group had divided into four camps :
The game - show contestants , quick on the trigger , who were searching for a quick yes or no .
Most of them left .
The lurkers .
They were there , but we could n’t tell .
The followers .
They waited for someone to tell them what to do .
The leaders .
A few started conversations , directed initiatives and got to work .
Want to guess who I hired ?
( It was a paid gig and five ended up spending time with me in NY on a somewhat rolling basis ) .
If you ’re hiring for people to work online , I ca n’t imagine not screening people in this way .
This is the work , and you can watch people do it for real before you hire them .
As I went to send a note to the 150 or so who did n’t make the cut , it felt like a waste .
A waste for me , surely , because here were a large number of over - talented , under - employed students facing a boring summer .
And for them , too , because I thought some might want a chance to continue the virtual experience .
So I started a group on Basecamp and invited the rest of the interns to try an unpaid virtual experience .
The idea was that I ’d provide a platform and some projects , and they could ( if they thought it might be interesting ) participate online .
No grunt work , just interesting stuff to try .
To my amazement , more than sixty took me up on it .
The conversations ebbed and flowed , the work got done ( or did n’t ) but I think everyone learned a lot .
Part of the deal was that active participants would get a shout out here on the blog .
So we ’ve put together a PDF of handmade bios of some of the coolest interns in the program .
A shortcut for anyone looking for smart folks from around the world .
If I did it again , I ’d definitely do it again .
I think that smaller , more closely managed projects would probably lead to more productivity , but I also know that when faced with opportunity and freedom , amazing people get stuff done .
If you gave this a try , I think it would be a brilliant move , for you and for the people you work with .
It ’s clear that formal education is failing the smart kids entering our field ( not certain what ‘ our field ’ is , but you know what I mean ) .
We need to create pathways for students to discover that there ’s absolutely nothing holding them back .
One of the major reasons for gas shortages is that fact that inventories were not very high going into the hurricanes .
Then when not one , but two , hurricanes hit , inventories dropped to the level where there was n't enough to go around .
( In fact , the shortages started even before the second hurricane hit . )
How could this happen ?
Is n't there anyone who cares about gasoline inventories ?
I am writing this article from Atlanta , one of the places hardest hit by gasoline shortages .
A person can drive for miles without finding an open gas station .
We hear a lot about the strategic petroleum reserve and its intended role in preventing shortages .
Yet when there have been gasoline shortages , in 2005 and this year , the problem was thatwere out of commission for long periods of time -- almost a month at this point in time .
Getting more crude oil would n't really solve the problem .
What we really needed was more gasoline in inventory , so we had some on hand , when the need arose .
Figure 2 shows a graph of the estimated impact of refinery shutdowns , start ups , and reduced runs , following this year 's hurricanes , based on Department of Energy data .
The amount is really huge in relationship to the total amount we refine .
Figure 2 . Estimated refinery capacity loss , due to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , based on DOE data
At this point , I estimate that there is a shortfall of more than 2 million barrels a day of refining capacity -- more than 10 % of US total , nearly a month after Hurricane Gustav hit .
In the American Petroleum Institute 's bloggers phone call last week , ( here or here ) , I asked ( at 22:13 ) Red Cavaney , President and CEO of API , if higher gasoline inventories were n't key to preventing shortages .
These are excerpts from his response , together with some of my thoughts :
By all means , inventories are obviously key to being able to have the flexibility needed to ensure that all the outlets that need to have gasoline have got it .
My thought : Red agrees that me that large enough inventories are key .
Our big problem , Gail , is that when you get two back - to - back hurricanes that are this close together chronologically , and given extended startup time it takes to bring refineries back on stream , and the fact that hurricanes are notoriously known for at the last minute adjusting their paths .
. .
So it is a challenge – much , much more difficult than if you just have one come through and you can start to move off and work can handle as you would .
My thought : Right .
Except this happened in 2005 as well ( Hurricane Katrina and Rita ) .
At some point , it would seem like we would start catching on that this can happen .
Figure 3 . Graph showing dips in refinery inputs in 2005 , following hurricanes .
In 2008 , our refinery inputs are already lower , so a dip could have greater impact .
. . . when people are concerned about getting enough , everybody tops off and you all know what that means .
That means even if we had sufficient gasoline , you know , people would still have to stand in line .
My thought :
We hear this in every newspaper article .
In Atlanta , lines are so long at the occasional gas station that is open that I doubt that topping off is a major issue at this point .
Anyone who is going to drive 10 miles and wait in line for an hour to top off their tank is pretty persistent .
The are a lot more issues with people just plain running out of gas before they can find it .
Of course , after people are burned this time , they will be more cautious .
If there is another hurricane , people are likely to plan ahead better .
And once there are finally adequate supplies , they may be more cautious about letting their tanks run low .
We were low , but you have got to remember we were low because demand was falling pretty much to unprecedented levels here in recent amounts of time .
My thought :
If the industry is selling 2 % or 3 % less gasoline , it theoretically needs 2 % or 3 % less inventory , but I do n't think that is what Red meant .
Figure 4 . Total refined product supplied to US drivers ( including gasoline , diesel , home heating oil , jet fuel , asphalt , and other refined products .
If you look at the data underlying Figure 4 , you discover that the big drop in product supplied has come in products other than gasoline .
These are the products whose price has risen most ( think diesel ) .
As a result , people are using less of these products whose prices have risen .
But these are n't the products whose inventories have dropped .
The product whose inventory was low was gasoline , but it had only a relatively small drop in supply .
I think that what Red meant was the profit margin that refiners could make was low , because the retail price of gasoline was too low , relative to the cost of making it .
There are several reasons this seems to be happening .
One of them is that world demand is now greater for diesel , and the world market is willing to pay a higher price for it .
Another reason is that Europe has leftover gasoline , and is willing to sell it on the world market at a fairly inexpensive price .
Another reason is that the ethanol is cutting into the need for gasoline .
Yet another is that there seems to be too much refining capacity geared toward light crude oil .
I discuss these issues in the article
Why is n't the cost of gasoline even higher ?
It is not very comforting to think that the level of our inventories depend on how much gasoline Europe decides to use , or how much ethanol is produced .
And at the time you would have had to start building inventory , you could n’t have predicted that you were going to have hurricanes to the extent that you did .
The last two years , we did n’t have any hurricanes to speak of that really significantly bothered production .
My thought :
It sounds like the industry does n't worry about gray swans .
There really is no overall industry plan regarding inventory levels , so one should n't be surprised if no one plans at the 1 in 100 level or 1 in 50 level .
This is not a government program .
The total inventory is just the aggregation of the amounts various producers choose to have on hand .
But it costs to keep inventory .
. .
It is a commodity business .
And every decision has an impact in terms of balancing off the customer service and the cost and the return to shareholders .
My thought :
This is really the issue .
Now that inventory is expensive and profit margins are under pressure , no one wants to pay the cost of keeping adequate inventory .
A related issue is credit problems , which Red addressed later in the call , at 57:54 .
And what most people do n’t understand – I used to be a banker in one of my former lives – what most people do n’t understand is our economy runs on credit .
All the way from people who make most of their purchases on credit cards , to small businesses who usually get a line of credit to help them get the materials in to sell to people who are out running businesses like those that are out , particularly onshore .
And got a couple of rig crews that are out there that he ’s got to pay before the stuff comes in .
They are all on credit .
What has happened is basically , the commercial credit market , or commercial paper has pretty much – ( inaudible ) – by some of the actions that are being proposed , which has forced those borrowers into limited amounts of capital .
And if you are hearing from all parts of the sector now , the strain of not being able to get access to the amount of borrowing that they usually have , and that ’s why there is a sense of urgency on getting this matter resolved .
Because if you do n’t open up the floodgates and the flexibility and take some of the bad stuff out of the system , you ’re not going to free up lending to the extent that you need it .
So it may not be with everybody out in the oil field , but today ’s problems that they are all feeling , but if this thing were to go on for a couple more weeks where we ’re starting to dry up , I can see a big impact .
My thought :
Most people would like to think that the oil and gas business is unaffected by today 's credit problems .
This is clearly not the case .
If we cannot fix the US credit problems ( and it is not clear to me that we can ) , these credit problems are likely to spill over into things we take for granted , like gasoline production and inventories .
Going Forward
It seems to me that there ought to be a more satisfactory way of determining gasoline inventories than depending on how much inventory each producer chooses to keep , based on his current credit situation and how tight profit margins are .
At one point , we had integrated oil companies that owned the whole system from top to bottom .
When this was the case , they had a strong incentive to keep all the pieces working together .
Now , the process is divided among a number of players .
The process depends heavily on price signals , but these have n't been working as one might hope .
The credit situation is adding another dimension .
We should theoretically have a government mandated minimum gasoline reserve , but I doubt this will happen .
I tried to do a little modeling of where we are now .
It looks to me as though we should be able to get inventories back up over 180 million barrels by October 17 , if refinery availability keeps coming back on line , and if we can increase our gasoline imports from Europe to 1.5 million barrels a day .
At such a level , the problem with long lines and stations without gasoline should mostly disappear , I would think .
I wonder , though , whether this will happen on schedule .
Our prices do n't seem to be high enough to encourage large gasoline imports from Europe , and it is not clear our credit problems will go away .
It is possible we may find ourselves struggling with the inventory issue long after it should have been resolved .

Bakersfield Fog - WCHL - 1995-96
Not only does this fog have menacing red eyes but it 's letters are dripping like blood or melting like wax .
I think the artist struggled with this one .
Wait , why is fog tough ?
Anaheim Mighty Ducks - NHL - 1994-95
The Mighty Ducks is not just the worst name for a hockey team ever but the cartoony duck - billed goalie mask is a shining example of why Disney should stick to making crappy movies .
If Disney had it 's way every hockey game would have a love interest and someone would break out in song every ten minutes .
Interesting note : The Anaheim Mighty Ducks logo is the best selling logo ( jerseys , hats , jackets , etc. ) since its introduction in 1994 .
Long Island Ducks - EHL - 1966-67
How cute is this little guy ?
He 's a little pigeon - toed skating duck !
Good thing his mommy made sure he was bundled up in a scarf and earmuffs before he went outside .
That stick looks pretty heavy there ducky .
Maybe next year you 'll think twice about not migrating .
Austin Mavericks - USHL - 1979 -80
A bull on skates is pretty funny .
Did the city of Austin hold a competition for this logo ?
Did they have a budget of fifty cents ?
How does that bull hold onto the stick with those hooves ?
How are his skates magically part of his body ?
Anaheim BullFrogs - RHI - 1994
There 's something about Roller Hockey that consistently produces the worst logos .
Anaheim really kept with the duckpond / hockey theme that they were building with the Mighty Ducks when they came up with Bullfrogs ' logo .
The crown and the brass knuckles somehow work against each other .
What kind of royalty executes its own dirty work ?
Brandon Wheat Kings - WCHL - 1971-72
The Wheat Kings have a pretty good logo now that is a variation of this one .
Here they just could n't get the elements working together .
Is the B or the crown busting out of that stack of wheat ( yes , I think it 's wheat ) ?
Some skates are stuck on it so that we know it is a hockey team , .
Buffalo Stampede - RHI - 1994
God bless the RHI for giving us the worst hockey logos ever .
I do n't know where to begin with this style of logo .
It 's so bad it scares me .
Vancouver Voodoo - RHI - 1994
At a glance it just looks like an alternate logo for the Buffalo Stampede .
I do n't know who thought that the crazy - out - of - control - native - mysticism of voodoo would translate well onto a hockey team or what voodoo has to do with Vancouver .
I can sleep well at night knowing that these jerseys are out - of - print and rare .
July 19 , 2008  --
If the most dire climate predictions come to pass , the Arctic ice cap will melt entirely , and polar bears could face extinction .
So why not pack a few off to Antarctica , where the sea ice will never run out ?
It may seem like a preposterous question .
But polar bears are just the tip of the " assisted colonization " iceberg .
Other possibilities : moving African big game to the American Great Plains , or airlifting endangered species from one mountaintop to another as climate zones shrink .
" It 's a showdown .
The impacts of climate change on animals have become apparent .
And it 's time to decide whether we 're going to do something , " said Notre Dame ecologist Jessica Hellmann , co-author of an influential 2007 Conservation Biology paper ( .pdf ) .
" Reducing CO2 is vital , but we might have to step in and intervene . "
Once dismissed as wrongheaded and dangerous , assisted colonization -- rescuing vanishing species by moving them someplace new -- is now being discussed by serious conservationists .
And no wonder : Caught between climate change and human pressure , species are going extinct 100 times faster than at any point in human history .
And some scientists say that figure is too conservative .
The real extinction rate , they say , is a full 1,000 times higher than normal .
The last time such annihilation took place was during the time of the dinosaurs .
And though many conservationists say that saving species by transplanting them is foolish , others say there 's no choice .
" They want the world to be what it was before .
But it 's not going to happen , " said Australian ecologist Hugh Possingham , author of an assisted - colonization article published Thursday in Science ( citation page ) .
The language of Possingham 's paper is understated -- its centerpiece is a risk - benefit flow chart -- but the recommendations are radical .
He proposes a systematic analysis of Earth 's threatened species , identifying those suitable for last - ditch uprooting .
That the scientific world 's most august publication carries such a proposal marks a sea - level shift in conservationist consciousness , say researchers .
Others have weighed the idea , but Possingham 's team came down firmly in favor .
Adding to the momentum , the Ecological Society of America 's annual meeting in August will be preceded by a three - day discussion of assisted colonization , by ecologists , policy wonks and lawyers .
But not everyone is in a rush .
" I think it 's a bad idea , " said Duke University biologist Jason McLachlan , also a co-author of the Conservation Biology paper .
" There are a million examples of invasive species introduced with good intentions that caused all sorts of damage . "
Unfortunately , perhaps , for the polar bear , it 's a perfect example of McLachlan 's objections .
Cost and logistics aside , the bears would wreak havoc in an ecosystem unprepared for them .
" Antarctic penguins and seals are n't adapted to surface predators , " explained Steven Amstrup , the chief U.S. Geological Survey polar - bear researcher .
" The bears would have a field day for a while , because they could walk right up to them and eat them .
For a short period of time , it would be great , but in the end the whole system would probably collapse . "
Accounts of destruction wrought by invasive species are legion , from wild hogs in the southern United States and zebra mussels in the Great Lakes to cane toads in Australia and mongeese in Hawaii .
An endangered species that now seems sympathetic could quickly become a villain .
But assisted - colonization proponents believe their animals , unlike other invasive species , would be carefully selected and their effects anticipated .
" You work out what the risks are before you take action , " said Possingham .
" You go through these decision trees , and start by doing some trials under very controlled circumstances , then we 'll learn about it . "
Things could still go wrong , said Hellmann , but the consequences pale in comparison to those of climate change and inaction .
And for animals whose natural habitat has been eradicated , or who live -- as did the golden toad of Costa Rica 's cloud forest -- in rapidly changing places from which they cannot escape , there may be no other option .
" If all other conservation methods fail , and evidence shows that a species is in danger of extinction , then assisted migration becomes an option that we should consider seriously , " said Nature Conservancy ecologist Patrick Gonzalez .
McLachlan , however , has other reasons for opposition .
Assisted colonization could be seen as a quick - fix panacea , distracting people from the necessary task of preserving habitat and braking climate change .
More philosophically , there 's something troubling about treating nature as a zoological theme park .
" We 're destroying any semblance of the idea that a place has its own biota and history , " he said .
" It 's not just saving a couple whooping cranes , it 's redesigning the entire biota of Earth .
And that 's incredibly creepy to me . "
Hellmann agrees that assisted colonization could be mistaken as a convenient solution .
But the purity of nature , she said , is now a myth .
" You can find signatures of humanity in the deepest jungles and remote locations .
This idea of pristine nature does n't really apply , " she said .
" If assisted colonization will have benefits , it seems strange not to cross some arbitrary line . "
Editor 's note : Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show .
Glenn
Beck says conservation wo n't solve energy crisis , and we need more oil drilling in the U.S .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Call our politicians and tell them to stay on vacation .
Call the caribou roaming in Alaska and tell them they 're safe .
Call the Saudi king and tell him what you really think of his oil .
I , Glenn Beck , a recovering alcoholic rodeo clown , have come up with a solution to America 's energy crisis ... and you 're wearing it .
Look at yourself right now .
You 've probably got on a shirt , socks , shoes , jewelry , maybe even some pants .
Do you have any idea how much all of that weighs ?
If people really loved America , they would strip down , leave their clothes at home , and drive around buck naked .
That would decrease the weight of our cars , which would increase our gas mileage so dramatically that we probably would n't have to drill for any new oil !
Genius , right ?
Of course , my idea has about as much of a chance to make a real difference in our energy crisis as the suggestion that Barack Obama recently made .
" Making sure your tires are properly inflated , simple thing , " Obama said .
" But we could save all the oil that they 're talking about getting off drilling , if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune - ups .
You could actually save just as much . "
When The Associated Press asked Obama 's campaign for the figures they used to make that claim , they could n't produce any -- but plenty of other people have .
It turns out that about two - thirds of vehicles already have properly inflated tires .
That means we 'd likely save somewhere around 800,000 barrels of oil a day if everyone else also complied .
Meanwhile , the U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates that there are about 86 billion barrels of oil in the areas that we 're not allowed to drill .
You do the math .
But , facts aside , Obama seemed to be stunned that Republicans would dare ridicule an idea as revolutionary as checking your tire pressure .
" They 're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption , " he complained .
No , what they 're making fun of is that a guy who , less than two months earlier , was against the gas tax holiday because it was a " gimmick , " has suddenly embraced what is essentially a gimmick .
No one , including John McCain , disputes that keeping your tires inflated will help you get better gas mileage .
But so will emptying your trunk , buying a hybrid , not using the heat , and driving naked .
The point is that none of those things are solutions ; they 're unsustainable gimmicks that distract people from solving the underlying crisis .
They 're also exactly the type of things that Obama once claimed he was against .
But , of course , the adoring mainstream media does n't want to talk about that , they just want to defend Obama 's honor .
Michael Grunwald recently wrote an article titled , " The Tire - Gauge Solution : No Joke , " that probably would 've been harsher on Obama if it was written by Barack himself .
It 's more love - sonnet than journalism .
" Meanwhile , " he wrote , " efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent .
Many drivers already follow their advice , but if everyone did , we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points .
In other words : Obama is right . "
Of course he 's right ; he 's Barack Obama , savior of the universe !
But one phrase that he used deserves a little more attention : " but if everyone did . "
" But if everyone " donated their organs then people would n't die waiting for them .
" But if everyone " ate only lettuce then our health care system would be fixed .
" But if everyone " just sent me one dollar then I 'd retire with $ 300 million in the bank .
Of course , the reality is that people still die waiting for organs , obesity is an epidemic , and I 'm still writing these columns .
That 's why saying " but if everyone did " is such a red herring .
Grunwald went on to suggest that perhaps we 're just over - thinking this whole " energy crisis " thing .
" It 's a pretty simple concept , " he wrote .
" If our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on Middle Eastern dictators while destroying the planet , maybe we ought to use less . "
Welcome back to Fantasy Land .
Saying " we ought to " is exactly the same as " but if everyone " -- a way to make a ridiculous point sound plausible .
It 's like saying :
We ought to all live in peace and harmony .
It 's not that easy .
But let 's follow his yellow brick road for a second anyway .
If we all put on our Jimmy Carter sweaters and used less oil , we 'd still need millions of barrels .
How about making sure those barrels come from America by starting to drill for it now ?
We 'll never be truly free until we 're completely free from Middle Eastern oil .
Not surprisingly , drilling was nowhere to be found in the article , but Grunwald did include plenty of other , " simple " things we can do :
" We can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs .
We can unplug our televisions , computers and phone chargers when we 're not using them . "
He 's living in a dream world !
Not only is unplugging a television not going to do a darn thing , it 's annoying and almost no one in their right mind will ever , ever , ever , ever do it !
Ever !
And finally , just in case you were n't yet sure if Grunwald 's article was essentially a commercial for Obama , here 's how he ended it :
" It 's sad to see ( McCain's ) campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge , promoting the fallacy that Americans are powerless to address their own energy problems .
Because the truth is : Yes , we can ... "
Hmm , let me think , where have I heard " Yes we can " before ?
Ohhh , that 's right , it 's what Obama supporters chant at his speeches .
Is Obama 's energy policy solely based on tire gauges ?
No .
But can we criticize him for embracing the same kind of gimmicky stall tactics that have gotten us to this place ?
Yes .
Yes we can .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
All About Oil Production and Refining • Barack Obama • John McCain
George W. Bush who hates regulations has fought against it with the food and drugs since he has been in office .
So you know it has to be really adverse to your health when the FDA finally is issuing a warning .
That means check your coffee and get rid of it fast .
I have the list of coffees that are going to be pulled from the grocery stores across the US .
U.S. regulators warned the public on Friday not to consume seven Mr. Brown instant coffee and milk tea products that were made in China because of concerns they may be contaminated with melamine .
The Food and Drug Administration said the products were recalled by King Car Food Industrial Co Ltd “ due to possible contamination with melamine . ”
Infant formula tainted with the industrial chemical has resulted in hospitalization for thousands of Chinese babies with painful kidney stones .
Four have died .
Here are the coffee and tea products that are being recalled :
• Mr. Brown Mandheling Blend Instant Coffee ( 3 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown Arabica Instant Coffee ( 3 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown Blue Mountain Blend Instant Coffee ( 3 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown Caramel Macchiato Instant Coffee ( 3 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown French Vanilla Instant Coffee ( 3 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown Mandhling Blend instant Coffee ( 2 - in -1 )
• Mr. Brown Milk Tea ( 3 - in -1 )
The Bush - McCain Republicans who hate regulations in the banking and finance industry , have crippled the FDA over the last eight years .
Their extreme Neo -Con views and philosophies are causing too many people to die needlessly .
The FDA was put in place to protect all of us and regulate that everything we ingest is safe .
It will be nice under the Obama administration to be able to trust again that the food and drugs we buy will not harm us , what a novel idea ..

Aug. 4 , 2008 -- Actress Christina Applegate , 36 , is being treated for early - stage breast cancer and is expected to recover fully .
Her publicist announced the diagnosis on Saturday , according to media reports .
Applegate 's breast cancer , which was found early through a doctor - ordered MRI , is n't life - threatening , her publicist said .
No other details about Applegate 's breast cancer , including its specific stage and treatment , have been made public .
Applegate , star of the ABC comedy Samantha Who ? , has a family history of cancer -- her mother has had breast cancer and cervical cancer .
How common is breast cancer in young women .
If Applegate got an MRI , should other women do the same ?
And what might her treatment involve ?
For answers , WebMD spoke with Neil Friedman , MD , FACS , medical director of the Hoffberger Breast Center at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore .
Friedman is n't treating Applegate .
Friedman says breast cancer is " relatively uncommon " in young women .
The American Cancer Society 's records for 2000 - 2004 show that 95 % of new cases and 97 % of breast cancer deaths happened in women age 40 and older and the median age at diagnosis was 61 .
What might Applegate 's treatment involve ?
I do n't know what [ early stage ] means .
Early stage can mean different things to different people .
Is it noninvasive , invasive ?
It 's hard to talk about things when you do n't know specifics , so let 's talk about both .
Intraductal cancer , also known as DCIS [ ductal carcinoma in situ ] , is stage 0 breast cancer .
It 's a noninvasive breast cancer .
Many times , you 'll do a lumpectomy .
If it 's really extensive , you might do a mastectomy , but they do n't need chemotherapy .
And if you have a lumpectomy , more than likely you 'll get radiation ; sometimes you would n't .
If it 's truly an invasive cancer , usually the most common is infiltrating ductal cancer .
I would call an early stage something that we call stage 1 , which means that the tumor is less than 2 centimeters and the lymph nodes are negative [ contain no cancer ] .
The problem with that terminology is that there are still patients with early - stage breast cancer , depending on exactly how you use the terms , where you would end up giving chemotherapy to [ them ] .
And most of us would not consider somebody who needs chemotherapy an early - stage breast cancer .
And that 's the problem with using those sorts of semantics .

Some UK politicians have been pushing to get ISPs to play the role of copyright cops for an unclear reason .
It appears they 've bought into the misleading and incorrect claim by the music industry that somehow ISPs are responsible for the record labelsto adapt its business model .
So despite claims from some ISPs that would n't sign up for such a plan , and would n't kick users off the internet , a bunch of those UK ISPs are now promising to play the role of copyright cops anyway -- and this even includes the ISPs who insisted they would n't go down this road .
It 's unclear why exactly they are agreeing to voluntarily waste their time acting on behalf of an obsolete industry 's business model , but the misguided threats from UK politicians probably helped move things along .
Either way , this starts things down the incredibly slippery slope of making ISPs responsible for policing the actions of users .
For years , most governments have realized what a bad idea this is , but suddenly in many countries that concept is falling away , and the end results will not be positive for the internet -- as plenty of perfectly legitimate activities are about to get blocked in an overzealous effort to prop up a few obsolete business models .
Already there are rumors spreading that there is behind - the - scenes maneuvering for the next big step to occur : making all internet users pay an annual " music tax " fee .
The original article on this agreement has someone from BPI denying that such a tax is under discussion , but some UK politicians seem ready to introduce it anyway -- and folks like Billy Bragg 's manager , Peter Jenner , are claiming victory .
And even a music person industry admits that this is a slippery slope ( though , he thinks it 's in the right direction ) , saying that this is : " a first step , and a very big step , in what we all acknowledge is going to be quite a long process .
" The BPI representative backs this up by noting that his goal is n't to take steps towards ending file sharing , but to end it altogether : " There is not an acceptable level of file - sharing .
Musicians need to be paid like everyone else . "
As for the artists whofrom unauthorized file sharing ?
That does n't seem to occur to the BPI .
And , if musicians really need to " be paid like everyone else , " how come the rest of us do n't get paid for the work we did 50 years ago ?
How come if everyone else picks a business model that the market rejects , we do n't get all the other companies in the value chain and the government to artificially prop up that business model for us ?
You know , we work pretty hard here at Techdirt to make a living , but apparently " everyone else " just complains that their business model is n't working and has ISPs take care of it for them .
Can we now get UK ISPs to send " warning " letters to everyone who reads Techdirt to start telling them they should send us money ?
That would be a much easier business model .

Faith Hill and Tim McGraw's Family Outing
Country music 's power coupleandwere out and about with their daughters - Gracie , 11 , Maggie , 9 , and Audrey , 6 - in West Hollywood on Monday .
They also had a couple of extra kids in tow as they grabbed lunch at Cafe Med at Sunset Plaza .
Unlike his Auburn , Washington concert last week , McGraw did n't have to confront any rowdy fans on the family stroll .
McGraw and Hill have been married for nearly twelve years and have vowed to never spend more than three consecutive days apart .

Please see the last " yellow box " below for the latest version of STATIC_ASSERT , or read on for details ...
C99 does n't require support for " sizeof " in preprocessor conditionals and gcc for example does n't support it .
So we can't do something like # if ( sizeof ( my_struct ) ! =512 ) for example .
This prompted me into seeking a more general solution of getting the compiler to check constant expressions , and I came up with this macro to support compile time assertions .
# define ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b ) a##b # define ASSERT_CONCAT( a , b) ASSERT_CONCAT_( a , b ) # define ct_assert (e ) enum { ASSERT_CONCAT ( assert_line_ , __LINE__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) }
ct_assert ( sizeof ( my_struct ) ==512 ) ; ct_assert ( sizeof ( int ) ==4 ) ; ct_assert ( M_PI /2 ) ;
They do n't need to be called in a function and so can be defined at a structure declaration site for example .
You catch any errors earlier and there is no chance of missing the assertion in testing .
You obviate the need for exercising the code path at runtime which may be awkward .
It 's handy to check / ensure a compiler is in fact computing an expression at compile time .
This macro has no runtime side affects as it just defines an enum whose name depends on the current line , and whose value will give a divide by zero error at compile time if the assertion is false .
If you try to ct_assert ( ) a non constant expression by mistake , this will also give an error and you can change to using a normal assert ( ) .
Using this macro you can create a compile time check at any scope as in the following examples :
Note compile time assertions have advantages over runtime ones .
UPDATE 1 : After writing this I noticed that this functionality is more commonly known as static assertion for some reason , and is a new proposal in the C++ 0X draft standard , which takes the form :
static_assert( constant - expression , " error message " ) ;
This is also being considered for the C1X standard .
The macro above will be useful for a long time to come though .
UPDATE 2 : Miguel Sofer added this to TCL and noticed that the above macro does n't work in all places for traditional C , as enums must be declared at the start of scope .
So he fixed that and simplified the macro as well to give :
# define ct_assert(e ) {enum { ct_assert_value = 1/(!!( e ) ) };}
Also it was pointed out on reddit that the linux kernel uses something similar in it 's BUILD_BUG_ON macro :
# define ct_assert(e ) ( ( void ) sizeof ( char [ 1 - 2*!( e ) ] ) )
UPDATE 3 : I just realised myself , and Keith Thompson and Jim Meyering also kindly pointed out , that the above kernel and TCL variants will not work at global scope as they 're statements .
Therefore for traditional C you need to have separate macros to support both cases , which one can see for example in the gnulib verify macros .
For C++ , C99 or GCC though , my original version above works for all situations .
UPDATE 4 : It was pointed out by Bill Davy that ct_assert ( ) would fail to compile if used twice on the same line , or is used on the same line in 2 files included into the same compilation unit ( which could be the same file included twice if it's not protected by # ifdef clauses ) .
I did try to use __FILE__ to distinguish the identifier , but this is not a valid token , and would n't work anyway in the case where a file is included twice .
So therefore I got rid of the unique identifier altogether to get the following which works for C99 and C++ for gcc at least .
# define ct_assert(e ) extern char ( * ct_assert ( void ) ) [ sizeof ( char [ 1 - 2 *!( e ) ] ) ]
UPDATE 5 : Bill Davy again points out that update 4 is very noisy under microsoft compilers .
So how about :
#ifdef __COUNTER__ /* microsoft */ #define ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b ) a##b # define ASSERT_CONCAT( a , b) ASSERT_CONCAT_( a , b ) # define ct_assert (e ) enum { ASSERT_CONCAT ( assert_line_ , __COUNTER__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) } #else /* gnu */ # define ct_assert(e ) extern char ( * ct_assert ( void ) ) [ sizeof ( char [ 1 - 2*!( e ) ] ) ]
#endif
UPDATE 6 : Márcio Faustino mentioned the Microsoft C_ASSERT equivalent .
However it does not detect non constant expressions , but then I realised that my GNU version in update 5 does n't either !
He also mentioned that we should probably add an unused message parameter so as to ease the transition to the official static_assert when it becomes available .
So adding those mods to my original macro and noting the caveats in update 2 , we get :
# define ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b ) a##b # define ASSERT_CONCAT( a , b) ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b) /*
These can't be used after statements in c 89 .
*/ #ifdef __COUNTER__ /* microsoft */ # define STATIC_ASSERT(e , m ) \ enum { ASSERT_CONCAT(static_assert_ , __COUNTER__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) } #else /*
This can't be used twice on the same line so ensure if using in headers * that the headers are not included twice ( by wrapping in #ifndef ...# endif ) *
Note it does n't cause an issue when used on same line of separate modules * compiled with gcc - combine - fwhole - program .
*/ # define STATIC_ASSERT(e , m ) \ enum { ASSERT_CONCAT ( assert_line_ , __LINE__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) } #endif
UPDATE 7 : Microsoft Visual studio 2010 released 2010 - 04 - 12 , supports static_assert .
g++ - std=c++0 x supports the static_assert keyword since version 4.3 released 2008 -03-05 .
UPDATE 8 : gcc supports the _Static_assert keyword since version 4.6 , released 2011 - 03-05 , and does n't need the - std=c1 x option to do so .
Note the C1X standard , defines static_assert as an alias for the _Static_assert keyword in assert.h , but that is less portable to use currently .
UPDATE 9 Nov 2012 : Stephen Pitts mentioned that extra braces are required to support putting the STATIC_ASSERT ( ) right after a case statement .
When testing this I also noticed that gcc since version 4.3.0 supports __COUNTER__ too .
So adjusting accordingly we get :
# define ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b ) a##b # define ASSERT_CONCAT( a , b) ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b) /*
These can't be used after statements in c 89 .
*/ #ifdef __COUNTER__ # define STATIC_ASSERT(e , m ) \ { enum { ASSERT_CONCAT( static_assert_ , __COUNTER__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) } ; } #else /*
This can't be used twice on the same line so ensure if using in headers * that the headers are not included twice ( by wrapping in #ifndef ...# endif ) *
Note it does n't cause an issue when used on same line of separate modules * compiled with gcc - combine - fwhole - program .
*/ # define STATIC_ASSERT(e , m ) \ { enum { ASSERT_CONCAT ( assert_line_ , __LINE__ ) = 1/(!!( e ) ) } ; } #endif
UPDATE 10 Feb 2015 : The extra braces added in update 9 do n't work .
What 's needed is an implicit statement to cater for an assert directly after a label or a case statement , as labels can't be associated with a declaration .
That can be done with a leading ';'
UPDATE 11 May 2016 : Visual Studio 12.0.21005.1 gives warning C4804 : ' operation ' : unsafe use of type ' bool ' in operation .
That can be suppressed with an ( int ) cast , giving :
# define ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b ) a##b # define ASSERT_CONCAT( a , b) ASSERT_CONCAT_(a , b) /*
These can't be used after statements in c 89 .
*/ #ifdef __COUNTER__ # define STATIC_ASSERT(e , m ) \ ;enum { ASSERT_CONCAT(static_assert_ , __COUNTER__ ) = 1/( int ) ( !!( e ) ) } #else /*
This can't be used twice on the same line so ensure if using in headers * that the headers are not included twice ( by wrapping in #ifndef ...# endif ) *
Note it does n't cause an issue when used on same line of separate modules * compiled with gcc - combine - fwhole - program .

Well , it does n’t appear to have registered in the American press yet .
But the story keeps bubbling in the Spanish press about McCain ’s bizarre gaffe about the Spanish Prime Minister .
Here ’s the front page cut out from the Spanish news channel that did the interview .
They ’ve talked to the interviewer now .
Her take ?
McCain did n’t know who Zapatero was …
Late Update : So McCain is the candidate with the foreign policy experience ready to lead on day one .
But he does n’t know who the leader of Spain is .
He gets confused in an interview , apparently thinking Zapatero is someone from Latin America who is an enemy of the United States and manages to create a minor international incident .
Later Update : Here ’s another Spanish press reax .
In Spain , there seem to be two lines of thinking .
The great majority appear to think the McCain was simply confused and did n’t know who Zapatero was — something you might bone up on if you were about to do an interview with the Spanish press .
The assumption seems to be that since he ’d already been asked about Castro and Chavez that McCain assumed Zapatero must be some other Latin American bad guy .
A small minority though think that McCain is simply committed to an anti-Spanish foreign policy since he ’s still angry about Spain pulling it ’s troops out of Iraq .
Finally , a few of those who lean toward the first view speculate that McCain may have confused Zapatero with the Zapatista rebel group in Mexico .
Even Later Update :

BAIL OUTS , TIMING : WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN
By : Devvy
September 29 , 2008
ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
“ We 're turning risk investment funds into the hands of taxpayers , ” pointing out that since no private investor wants to take responsibility for “ risk investments , we 're simply wall papering them on to the taxpayer , and this is monstrous . ”
Nobel Prize recipient in Economic Sciences , Joseph Stiglitz [ 1 ]
Fifteen years ago today , my Project on Winning Economic Reform delivered 1,720,000 signatures to the U.S. Congress to abolish the privately owned Federal Reserve Banking System and the IRS .
During the rally , we collected just under 24,000 more signatures , which were all delivered to every member of the House and Senate .
Some 4400 Americans gathered to tell Washington , DC , we the people demand a return to an honest monetary system and stop the stealing of the fruits of our labor for the benefit of the powerful banking cartel .
Of course , it did n't matter back then or through all the years since .
On March 6 , 2006 , I wrote in ' No More Pretense of Representation ' : " On March 2 , 2006 , the counterfeit U.S. Senate passed the insidious un -Patriot Act by a vote of 89 - 10 .
This vote flies in the face of a massive outcry from millions of Americans against the Patriot Act and more than 440 cities and counties who refuse to enforce it ....
It no longer matters how strong or massive opposition is to what 's going on in Washington , DC ... There is no longer any pretense these people in Congress represent we the people or even pretend to uphold the U.S. Constitution .
They are far , far beyond that . "
We the people have been pounding on Congress for the past two weeks .
Phone calls , faxes and the numbers running so high against these bail outs ( 300 - 1 ) you would think these members of Congress would listen to their constituents .
But , those of us who understand the big picture know that no matter how many slick marketing slogans , i.e. , " protect Main Street , " the bail outs were a done deal .
Period .
Finito .
One hundred " conservative republicans " came out against this massive fraud and rape of Main Street .
Where have these conservative Republicans so outraged now over this grand larceny been all these years ?
They controlled Congress for more than a decade .
The Democrats did nothing the past two years they 've had power as the storm gathered steam , now blame the Republicans .
Yesterday 's headlines : House GOP leaders back bailout bill , urge passage .
Note the H - bomb is still in the package : " The core of the bill is based on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's request for authority to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions ... "
And , hello : " The ultimate cost to the taxpayer is not expected to be near the amount the Treasury invests in the program .
That 's because the government would buy assets that have underlying value . "
Not expected to be near the amount ?
Oh , please , it 's closer to a trillion dollars .
Government would buy the assets ?
We the people you mean and hundreds of billions of those " assets " are toxic .
Can you hear the big sucking sound from your wallet ?
Sadly , too many Americans will overlook the facts and defend their congress critter 's lack of understanding on this issue , like this nonsense from an emailer : " Right now senior Indiana Congressman Mike Pence ( R ) and others are at Capitol Hill holding their ground against The Fed , Bush , Paulson , and Bernanke .
Time is of the essence because Bush continues to feed the message to the media that our world will melt on Monday if they do n't get their $ 700 + billion bailout regardless of what America 's taxpayers want ... Currently , Congressman
Pence is wisely calling for a suspension of the capital gains tax on investments in order to encourage the millions of Americans without debt to invest in the markets . "
If Pence really understood the problem , he would have led the charge to get H.R. 2755 passed 15 months ago and a bill to abolish the unnecessary direct taxation against we the people .
If you do n't have time to read that piece , you can listen on audio ; down load to your IPod or onto a CD to listen while you drive .
When Ron Paul introduced his bill ( H.R. 2755 ) to abolish the Federal Reserve in June , 2007 , where were these newly outraged Republicans ?
There 's not a single cosponsor to Dr. Paul 's bill .
Instead of these Johnny - come - lately 's all indignant about this pillage and plunder of the people 's sweat and blood , why did n't they all come together and say , it does n't matter the terms or what it says , we will not vote on this unconstitutional bail out of private corporations ?
Instead , just like the herd they are , the prod has been effective and the people be damned .
The Hounds of Hell have been unleashed on we the people .
Dr. Edwin Vieira so correctly called it on March 17 , 2005 :
" In addition , rather than disseminating demands for sound money and honest banking in order to deal with the crisis , the controlled media will orchestrate calls for massive increases in the supply of fiat currency and credit , ostensibly in order to enable common people to pay their debts .
Of course , this will necessitate the maintenance of fractional - reserve central banking to emit the new currency , as well as the creation of more , more , and even more debt to serve as " security " for these emissions -- thereby perpetuating the cause of the crisis and ensuring that further crises will break out later on .
In this way , credulous Americans will be duped into chaining themselves to new debts in order to pay off their old ones , rendering permanent their financial indentured servitude to the Establishment . " [ 2 ]
Sun Tzu's Art of War : Sell your enemy his own death while making him think it 's a good idea .
The coup de grâce has been administered and the masses will quiet down , believing it 's their obligation to live a life of quiet desperation because their " leadership " in Congress , while painful for " Main Street , " has done the right thing .
The biggest question out there : how could this have happened ?
Those of us who have studied America 's fatal fiat currency and monetary system know the answer , but average , struggling Americans throughout this country do not .
A huge portion of the blame for that can be placed on corporate media who control the " news " papers in this country and cable network " news " channels . [ 3 ]
Please pay particular attention to this one important piece of the puzzle :
How SEC Regulatory Exemptions Helped Lead to Collapse
" The current excess leverage now unwinding was the result of a purposeful SEC exemption given to five firms .
You read that right -- the events of the past year are not a mere accident , but are the results of a conscious and willful SEC decision to allow these firms to legally violate existing net capital rules that , in the past 30 years , had limited broker dealers debt - to - net capital ratio to 12 - to - 1 . Instead , the 2004 exemption -- given only to 5 firms -- allowed them to lever up 30 and even 40 to 1 .
" Who were the five that received this special exemption ?
You wo n't be surprised to learn that they were Goldman , Merrill , Lehman , Bear Stearns , and Morgan Stanley .
As Mr. Pickard points out that " The proof is in the pudding — three of the five broker - dealers have blown up . "
" So while the SEC runs around reinstating short selling rules , and clueless pension fund managers mindlessly point to the wrong issue , we learn that it was the SEC who was in large part responsible for the reckless leverage that led to the current crisis ....
" The Securities and Exchange Commission can blame itself for the current crisis .
That is the allegation being made by a former SEC official , Lee Pickard , who says a rule change in 2004 led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Merrill Lynch .
" The SEC allowed five firms — the three that have collapsed plus Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to more than double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets and remove discounts that had been applied to the assets they had been required to keep to protect them from defaults .
Making matters worse , according to Mr. Pickard , who helped write the original rule in 1975 as director of the SEC 's trading and markets division , is a move by the SEC this month to further erode the restraints on surviving broker - dealers by withdrawing requirements that they maintain a certain level of rating from the ratings agencies .

" They constructed a mechanism that simply did n't work , " Mr. Pickard said .
" The proof is in the pudding — three of the five broker - dealers have blown up . "
Who knew what and when ?
All this brain power on Wall Street and the million regulations pumped out by Congress after Congress over decades and no one saw this coming ?
None of them noticed a pattern of melt down emerging ?

That was up from 9.4 % in last year 's first quarter , according to research firm SNL Financial . "
September 23 , 2008 , while the tempest was building , an important admission came from White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto : " Fratto insisted that the plan was not slapped together and had been drawn up as a contingency over previous months and weeks by administration officials .
He acknowledged lawmakers were getting only days to peruse it , but he said this should be enough . "
A few days to " peruse " 2,300 pages of save the banking cartel trillions ?
This scheme was drawn up months before and adjusted over the weeks as these immoral vultures waited until just the right time to spring the trap .
The Bush Administration , Paulson , Bernanke and other key players KNEW this whole mess was going to blow up in their faces .
The staggering numbers simply could not hold back the flood gates .
How very convenient that it all just happens to come to a head ten days before Congress is about to adjourn for the year .
The new mantra becomes " We have to do something now ! " and " The world will come to an end tomorrow ! "
Something else was going on in March , 2008 : " While New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was paying an ‘ escort ’ $ 4,300 in a hotel room in Washington , just down the road , George Bush 's new Federal Reserve Board Chairman , Ben Bernanke , was secretly handing over $ 200 billion in a tryst with mortgage bank industry speculators ....

Ultimately greed is the biggest factor for why " no one saw this coming "
" The report , " Ask Yourself Why ... They Didn't See This Coming , " also spotlights the story of the nation 's two largest housing lenders , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , their lobbying and campaign activities , and how the government bailout contrasts with how legislators approached the crisis for average people .
" The story of the housing bubble and meltdown that now threatens the homes and communities of literally millions of Americans is largely about political power .
The financial services industry focuses its lobbying efforts around its immediate desires , and for more than the past decade , this focus has been on relaxing regulation of the mortgage lending and securitization market , " the report says .
" At the national level , the top five spenders among mortgage brokers and bankers paid more than $ 31 million in lobbying fees and in political contributions since the beginning of last year .
The two largest home - loan companies that have been bailed out by Congress , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , spent roughly $ 180 million on lobbying and campaign contributions since the 2000 election cycle .
" Across the country , an estimated 20,000 families are losing their home every week .
Estimates of total foreclosures run about 3 million during 2007 and 2008 .
There are about 2.3 million vacant homes on the market - the highest rate ever recorded .
Most of these figures have not been seen since the Great Depression .
Most troubling , analysts predict a second wave of foreclosures still coming . "
Now , we have a scramble unseen in our life times that will only make the situation worse .
Former Fed Governor William Poole : " These are grand ideas that can not be executed . "
Sept. 25 ( Bloomberg ) --
" More than 150 prominent U.S. economists , including three Nobel Prize winners , urged Congress to hold off on passing a $ 700 billion financial market rescue plan until it can be studied more closely . "
Before the ink is even dry , the big lie is that $ 700 billion borrowed dollars is old news :
Bank Borrowing From Fed Already Exceeded Bailout Total in Last Week
September 26 , 2008
" U.S. banks borrowed $ 188 billion per day on average in the latest week from the Federal Reserve , meaning that the Fed loaned out more money than the Treasury 's proposed bailout in just one week , still barely managing to keep the economy afloat .
Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday the total amount banks borrowed nearly quadrupled the previous record of $ 47.97 billion per day notched just the week before , Reuters reports . "
Some very sharp people are also suggesting the rush to ram this disaster down our throats is because the FDIC has known for some time that banks were going to start collapsing like dominos and there is n't enough in the current pool to bail out depositors .
This is a mathematical fact .
We know that the FDIC fund has about $ 50 billion to " insure " about $ 1 trillion in assets at the nation 's financial institutions .

But , Nancy , not realizing there 's no money in the people 's treasury ( OUR checkbook thanks to these crooks is overdrawn $ 9.8 TRILLION dollars ) wants to add more debt to the funeral pyre : Pelosi Vows to Push Forward With Second Economic Stimulus .
By yesterday afternoon , due to the massive resistance by the American people , Pelosi has declared this is not a bail out , it 's a " rescue plan . "
A rescue plan sells better ; see here .

This should be paradise .
A land of plenty .
The finest schools and hospitals , gleaming infrastructure that shames the West , a place where wealth literally oozes out of the marshy undergrowth .
This was the dream , anyhow .
To say it has turned into a nightmare does n't do justice to the horror that the Niger Delta has become ; it does n't even begin to describe just how disastrous the discovery of oil more than 50 years ago has been for the people who live here .
A sweaty , heaving melting pot of 30 million people from 40 - odd ethnic groups speaking more than 200 different languages , the Niger Delta lies on the southern banks of Nigeria , Africa 's most populous country .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But while we have been using their oil to drive our cars , fuel our aeroplanes , and keep the wheels of our economy turning , those in the Delta have had their land , their lives , their dreams destroyed .
Oil spills have polluted their rivers and land , making fishing and farming impossible .
Flares , burning constantly , have filled their air with soot .
Billions of dollars have been pumped out of their land with nothing in return .
Even the jobs the oil industry promised have gone elsewhere , to well - paid foreigners and Nigerians from less marginalised parts of the country .
For those who live closest to the oil fields , the best they can hope for is casual labour : when there is a spill or a pipeline bursts , locals are employed for pennies to clear it up .
Oil has polluted the Delta beyond recognition .
But it has also polluted the country 's politics .
When the first discovery was made in the late 1950s , Nigeria was on the cusp of gaining independence from Britain .
The potential oil revenues were seen by many as the perfect launchpad for an independent Nigeria .
It has n't worked out that way .
Instead , it has become the perfect launchpad for corrupt politicians and businessmen to enrich themselves at the expense of their people .
It is a dirty business .
Oil in the Gulf of Guinea , which snakes its way along the coast of West Africa from Ivory Coast down to Angola , is cheap and plentiful – and until April , Nigeria was Africa 's largest oil producer , producing more than 2.5 m barrels per day .
That
number is falling though , as the Delta has become chaotic , a place of armed gangs , of kidnappings , of daily violence .
Oil companies , and the people who work for them , have become the target .
In the past few years , shadowy militant groups like the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) have taken advantage of rising anger towards the oil industry .
They kidnap foreign oil workers and attack oil installations .
Almost all of those kidnapped are returned unharmed once a hefty ransom has been paid .
The oil companies and the Nigerian government always insist that no money has changed hands – but no one believes them .
For the oil firms , a seven - figure ransom is a small price to pay to keep on producing .
At five cents a barrel , getting oil out of the ground is 10 times cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia .
But the cost of doing business in Nigeria is getting higher .
Mend 's attacks on oil installations , including one on a Shell offshore field in June , have cut the country 's oil production by at least 20 per cent .
As a result , Angola has now overtaken Nigeria as Africa 's largest oil producer .
Mend claim they are fighting for a fair share of oil revenues to be spent on the Delta .
But nothing is straightforward .
The militant groups may like to portray themselves as rebels fighting on behalf of the people , but many of them are little more than guns - for - hire , taking advantage of the chaos .
Sometimes they work for gang bosses , sometimes politicians , but the result is always the same .
The ransom ends up in some overseas bank account and those living in the Delta get poorer .

Those same accounts are also regularly feathered with money made from " bunkering " – stealing oil direct from the pipeline and selling it on the black market .
The stability or otherwise of the Delta matters a great deal , even to those who have never heard of it .
Within a decade , the United States expects to extract around a quarter of its oil from the Gulf of Guinea .
They see it as a safer option than the Middle East , and it has played a large part in the thinking behind the establishment of the US 's Africa Command – a plan for a series of permanent military bases on the continent .
Britain , one of the largest investors in Nigeria , is also worried .
Gordon Brown has offered to help President Umaru Yar 'Adua deal with the " lawlessness " , as he puts it .
British military aid is on the table .
Yar 'Adua became president in April 2007 .
He would say he was elected , but few who witnessed the poll would describe it as democracy .
Once in office , Yar 'Adua declared the Delta his biggest priority but little , if anything , has really changed .
War has been declared on the militants , but when many of those militants have such close links to senior government officials and wealthy pro-government businessmen , it makes any form of military solution almost impossible .
The Delta is crying out for a comprehensive political solution , one that would bring real investment to a region starved for so long .
But oil does n't seem to work like that .
Look across the Gulf of Guinea .
Nowhere has oil brought peace , security and development .
It has brought wealth for a few and misery for the rest .
On paper , Equatorial Guinea is one of the richest countries in Africa .
In reality , the money is controlled by one man , President Obiang Nguema , a dictator who " won " 97 per cent of the vote last time he bothered asking .
The situation is similar in Gabon , where oil revenues have kept a dictator in power for more than 40 years .
The only potential bright spot is Ghana , a relatively stable democracy which has just found oil .
Few people celebrated when the discovery was announced though .
They looked nervously across at Nigeria and wondered what they were letting themselves in for .

As Hurricane Gustav makes landfall in the U.S. Gulf Coast , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has exercised its authority under the Clean Air Act to temporarily waive certain federal clean gasoline requirements for parts of Texas .
The waiver will last until Sept. 10 , 2008 and will allow greater flexibility for the fuel distribution system to support an adequate supply .
Granted by EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson , the waiver was based on the the extreme and unusual supply circumstances presented by hurricane Gustav , which are likely to result in a shortage of gasoline in some areas .
The waiver allows gasoline sold in certain counties to exceed the 7.8 RVP ( Reid Vapor Pressure ) gasoline volatility standards that are in place during the “ high ozone season . ”
The waiver also enables the sale of conventional gasoline in reformulated gas ( RFG ) areas .
As required by law , EPA and DOE evaluated the situation and determined that granting a short - term waiver was consistent with the public interest .
“ I have determined that an ‘ extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstance ’ exists that will prevent the distribution of an adequate supply of gasoline to consumers in the RFG and RVP covered areas , ” Bodman said in the letter ( pdf ) .
The move comes just days after the EPA granted similar Clean Air Act waivers for parts of Louisiana and Florida .

Racial views steer some away from Obama
Deep - seated racial misgivings could cost Barack Obama the White House if the election is close , according to an AP - Yahoo News poll that found one - third of white Democrats harbor negative views toward blacks — many calling them " lazy , " " violent " or responsible for their own troubles .
The poll suggests that the percentage of voters who may turn away from Obama because of his race could easily be larger than the final difference between the candidates in 2004 — about 2.5 percentage points .

Certainly , Republican John McCain has his own obstacles :
He 's an ally of an unpopular president and would be the nation 's oldest first - term president .
But Obama faces this : 40 percent of all white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks , and that includes many Democrats and independents .
More than a third of all white Democrats and independents — voters Obama can't win the White House without — agreed with at least one negative adjective about blacks , according to the survey , and they are significantly less likely to vote for Obama than those who do n't have such views .
Such numbers are a harsh dose of reality in a campaign for the history books .
Obama , the first black candidate with a serious shot at the presidency , accepted the Democratic nomination on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. 's " I Have a Dream " speech , a seminal moment for a nation that enshrined slavery in its Constitution .
" There are a lot fewer bigots than there were 50 years ago , but that does n't mean there 's only a few bigots , " said Paul Sniderman , a political scientist at Stanford University , which partnered with The Associated Press and Yahoo News to conduct the exhaustive poll and analysis .
The pollsters set out to determine why Obama is locked in a close race with McCain even as the political landscape seems to favor Democrats .
President Bush 's unpopularity , the Iraq war and a national sense of economic hard times cut against GOP candidates , as does that fact that registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans .
The findings suggest that Obama 's problem is close to home — among his fellow Democrats , particularly non-Hispanic white voters .
Just seven in 10 people who call themselves Democrats support Obama , compared to the 85 percent of self - identified Republicans who back McCain .
The survey also focused on the racial attitudes of independent voters because they are likely to decide the election .
Lots of Republicans harbor prejudices , too , but the survey found they were n't voting against Obama because of his race .
Most Republicans would n't vote for any Democrat for president — white , black or brown .
Not all whites are prejudiced .
Indeed , more whites say good things about blacks than say bad things , the poll shows .
And many whites who see blacks in a negative light are still willing or even eager to vote for Obama .
On the other side of the racial question , the Illinois Democrat is drawing almost unanimous support from blacks , the poll shows , though that probably would n't be enough to counter the negative effect of some whites ' views .
Race is not the biggest factor driving Democrats and independents away from Obama .
Doubts about his competency loom even larger , the poll indicates .
More than a quarter of all Democrats expressed doubt that Obama can bring about the change they want , and they are likely to vote against him because of that .
Three in 10 of those Democrats who do n't trust Obama 's change - making credentials say they plan to vote for McCain .
Still , the effects of whites ' racial views are apparent in the polling .
Statistical models derived from the poll suggest that Obama 's support would be as much as 6 percentage points higher if there were no white racial prejudice .
But in an election without precedent , it 's hard to know if such models take into account all the possible factors at play .
The AP - Yahoo poll used the unique methodology of Knowledge Networks , a Menlo Park , Calif. , firm that interviews people online after randomly selecting and screening them over telephone .
Numerous studies have shown that people are more likely to report embarrassing behavior and unpopular opinions when answering questions on a computer than when talking to a stranger .
Other techniques used in the poll included recording people 's responses to black or white faces flashed on a computer screen , asking participants to rate how well certain adjectives apply to blacks , measuring whether people believe blacks ' troubles are their own fault , and simply asking people how much they like or dislike black people .
" We still do n't like black people , " said John Clouse , 57 , reflecting the sentiments of his pals gathered at a coffee shop in Somerset , Ohio .
Given a choice of several positive and negative adjectives that might describe blacks , 20 percent of all whites said the word " violent " strongly applied .
Among other words , 22 percent agreed with " boastful , " 29 percent " complaining , " 13 percent " lazy " and 11 percent " irresponsible . "
When asked about positive adjectives , whites were more likely to stay on the fence than give a strongly positive assessment .
Among white Democrats , one - third cited a negative adjective and , of those , 58 percent said they planned to back Obama .
The poll sought to measure latent prejudices among whites by asking about factors contributing to the state of black America .
One finding : More than a quarter of white Democrats agree that " if blacks would only try harder , they could be just as well off as whites . "
Those who agreed with that statement were much less likely to back Obama than those who did n't .
Among white independents , racial stereotyping is not uncommon .
For example , while about 20 percent of independent voters called blacks " intelligent " or " smart , " more than one - third latched on the adjective " complaining " and 24 percent said blacks were " violent . "
Nearly four in 10 white independents agreed that blacks would be better off if they " try harder . "
The survey broke ground by incorporating images of black and white faces to measure implicit racial attitudes , or prejudices that are so deeply rooted that people may not realize they have them .
That test suggested the incidence of racial prejudice is even higher , with more than half of whites revealing more negative feelings toward blacks than whites .
Researchers used mathematical modeling to sort out the relative impact of a huge swath of variables that might have an impact on people 's votes — including race , ideology , party identification , the hunger for change and the sentiments of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's backers .
Just 59 percent of her white Democratic supporters said they wanted Obama to be president .
Nearly 17 percent of Clinton 's white backers plan to vote for McCain .
Among white Democrats , Clinton supporters were nearly twice as likely as Obama backers to say at least one negative adjective described blacks well , a finding that suggests many of her supporters in the primaries — particularly whites with high school education or less — were motivated in part by racial attitudes .
The survey of 2,227 adults was conducted Aug. 27 to Sept.
5 . It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points .

Thoughts on Short - Selling By Arnold Kling
What is short - selling ?
How can short - selling destroy a good company ?
1 . Short - selling explained
The easiest form of short - selling to understand is “ naked ” short - selling .
I think that XYZ stock is going down , and so I tell my broker to sell 100 shares for me .
Eventually , I will have to buy 100 shares and either realize a gain or a loss .
If the stock goes down , then it ’s up to me when I buy those shares .
I have a profit on paper , and I take the profit when I buy the shares .
I sold at $ 20 ( say ) and bought at $ 10 ( say ) , so I make $ 1000 .
If the stock goes up , my broker starts pestering me with margin calls .
She asks me to put cash or short - term Treasury bills in my account .
That is because she is afraid I will walk away and leave her to have to buy the 100 shares , and she ’ll have to take my loss for me .
If I do n’t respond to the margin calls , she buys the shares , closes out my position , and makes me take the loss .
I do n’t claim to understand non-naked short selling .
I imagine it works something like this .
My broker gets 100 shares of the stock and gives them to me .
I immediately sell them .
I promise to buy them back later .
Suppose that I did n’t sell the shares .
Suppose I just took shares from my broker , and promised to buy them back later .
Then that would be an ordinary repo loan from me to my broker , using the stock as collateral .
The difference with short - selling is that I dump the collateral !
With non-naked short selling , my obligation to buy shares is with a specific counter - party , my broker .
With naked short - selling , I just have a vague obligation to the “ market . ”
In my opinion , there is no practical difference between naked short - selling and non-naked short selling .
2 . How can short - selling destroy a good company ?
The simple answer is that it can’t .
First of all , short - selling can’t force down your share price .
Short - selling only forces down your share price if buyers do n’t emerge to defend your share price .
Banning short - selling cannot protect a bad stock .
If nobody is willing to buy XYZ at a price higher than $.02 a share , then the price at which XYZ will trade will be $.02 a share ( or lower ) .
It does n’t matter whether you have short - sellers or not .
What drives stock prices down is the lack of people willing to buy them at the higher price .
If the company has sufficient value , there will be sufficient buyers .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republicans say Sen. John McCain and his vice presidential running mate , Sarah Palin , are mavericks .
But in a new ad , Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign says not so fast -- they 're no maverick reformers .
Sen .
John McCain has been criticized for employing top lobbyists in his campaign .
And it 's a point that Obama has been making on the campaign trail in recent days .
" John McCain says that he is going to tell all those lobbyists in Washington that their days of running Washington are over , which sounds pretty good until you discover that seven of his top campaign managers and officials are -- guess what ?
-- former corporate lobbyists , " Obama said recently in Flint , Michigan .
It 's true : Seven top McCain officials were lobbyists , though the campaign stresses that none is currently registered to lobby Congress :
• One : Campaign manager Rick Davis is a major telecommunications lobbyist .
• Two : Senior foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann recently faced scrutiny over his foreign lobbying on behalf of the Republic of Georgia , which has been embroiled in a military conflict with Russia .
• Three : Senior adviser Charlie Black was a foreign lobbyist for dictators in Zaire and Angola in the 1980s , fodder for the liberal group MoveOn.org .
One of the group 's recent ads charged , " Charlie Black said he did n't do anything wrong .
John McCain should tell Black he did .
Call John McCain and tell him to fire Charlie Black . "
Watch the Republicans ' ad calling McCain - Palin mavericks »
• Four : Frank Donatelli , the Republican National Committee 's liaison to the McCain campaign , has had clients including Exxon Mobil .
• Five : Economic adviser Nancy Pfotenhauer has lobbied for corporate giants like Koch Industries .
" Both John McCain and Sarah Palin have challenged special interests , challenged their own party .
That 's the test of courage , " Pfotenhauer has said .
• The final two lobbyists are McCain 's congressional liaison , John Green , and national finance Co-chairman Wayne Berman .
They both lobbied for Fannie Mae , the troubled mortgage giant .
But Obama 's case could be undermined by running mate Sen .
Joe Biden 's close ties to lobbyists , including his son Hunter , who has worked for credit card giant MBNA .
Biden insists that his son's employment had nothing to do with his support of bankruptcy legislation backed by the bank .
Watch Palin criticize Biden 's change argument »
" I can look you right straight in the eye and guarantee you my son has never , ever , ever lobbied me , " Biden said on CNN's " American Morning " on September 4 .
The McCain camp stresses that Donatelli and Berman are technically not officials of the campaign , though they are advisers .
But the bottom line is , both sides have ties to lobbyists , meaning whomever wins will have a hard time backing up the rhetoric about change and shaking up Washington .

I bring you , in no particular order , the Seven Wonders of Japan .
Kiyomizu Temple , Kyoto
Kiyomizu - dera is a Tendi Buddhist temple in Kyoto and is one of the oldest and best - known temples in a historic city filled with temples .
The current building was built in 1633 by the third Tokugawa shogun and temples on the location date back to 798 .
Situated on Mount Otowa , Kiyomizu offers a stunning view of the surrounding area .
Kiyomizu gets its name from a nearby 13 m waterfall .
People would often jump off the temple into the water below ( a practice which is now banned ) .
“ Jumping from Kiyomizu Temple ” has become a saying in Japan for doing something daring .
Himeji Castle , Himeji
Himeji Castle ( Himeji - jo ) is one of the best - preserved castles in Japan .
Construction originally started in 1331 , Himeji was untouched by the devastation in WWII , unlike Osaka and Hiroshima Castles .
Himeji is considered one of the three great castles of Japan , along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle .
Castle holds a commanding view of all the surrounding flat land area , which made it ideal for a military fortification .
In addition to its large keep and thick walls , the paths inside the compounds are a maze designed to confuse potential attackers .
Himeji can be visited via a day trip from Kyoto or Hiroshima via the Shinkansen , and the castle is within walking distance from the train station .
Peace Park , Hiroshima
On August 6 , 1945 , Hiroshima , Japan became the first city ever to be destroyed with an atomic bomb .
As Hiroshima rebuilt after the war , a decision was made to keep the ruins of the Genbaku Dome ( A - Bomb Dome ) standing as a reminder of the devastation , and the centerpiece of the Hiroshima Peace Park .
The dome and the area of the park was ground zero for the blast which killed over 100,000 people .
The park draws visitors from all over the world who come , not only to remember those killed in the war but to hope for future peace .
In addition to the A - Bomb Dome , there are memorials to the children killed in the explosions , a peace library , and museum , an eternal peace flame , as well as several acres of park area .
Visitors should take the time to ring the Peace Bell .
Kinkakuji ( Golden Pavilion ) , Kyoto
The Golden Pavilion ( Kinkakuji ) is one of the most beautiful buildings in Japan .
Built on the grounds of the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in 1397 , the pavilion was created to hold relics of the Buddha .
The top two floors of the building is coated in gold leaf , which is where it gets its distinctive name .
The pavilion was burned down in 1950 by a deranged monk and rebuilt in 1955 .
The pavilion and the surrounding pond and garden are one of the most photographed scenes in Japan .
The Shinkansen
No trip to Japan would be complete without taking a trip on the Japanese bullet train , the Shinkansen .
The Shinkansen is the heart of the extensive Japanese rail system .
While most of the trains in Japan are normal trains , the Shinkansen are kept on a separate rails designed for rapid transit .
The Shinkansen can achieve a top speed of 300 kph ( 180 m ph ) .
There are no road or rail crossing on Shinkansen tracks .
The speed of the train would make an accident devastating .
High - speed Shinkansen trains can be taken from Kagoshima in the far south to Hachinohe in the north , covering most of the country .
Fuji-san ( Mount Fuji )
Could any list of the Seven Wonders of Japan be complete without Mount Fuji ?
Mount Fuji is not only the highest point in Japan but is a symbol of the country which has been used in countless pieces of artwork .
Fuji is an active stratovolcano but has not erupted since 1707 .
Approximately 200,000 people climb Mount Fuji each year , and visiting Mount Fuji is a popular destination for tourists .
On a clear day , the summit of Mount Fuji can be seen from Tokyo .
The most popular months for climbing Fuji are July and August .
Visiting the base of Mount Fuji can be easily done on a day trip from Tokyo .
Ramen in Fukuoka
Japanese cuisine ranks among the best in the world .
While sushi often gets the attention , one of the staple foods of Japan is ramen .
Originally a Chinese dish , ramen first became popular in Japan during the Meiji period in the 19th Century .
Japanese ramen is a far cry from the instant noodles which many westerners think of when they hear ramen .
Ramen was believe to have been brought to Japan by Chinese merchants in Fukuoka .
Fukuoka ramen is known for its rich , pork based Tonkotsu ramen , topped with a pork cutlet .

Initially , content scraping was not taken that seriously , most often , web experts thought that the original domain would be deemed a much trusted source as far as search engine rankings are concerned .
A blind trust on search engine ’s ability to recognize the original source was the main reason behind web experts ignoring content scraping .
And because they let it pass for some time , content scraping has become more and more advanced , and now it is extremely hard to indentify and differentiate between the imposter and original content .
As for search engines , well they are not that good at it as well !
' Pray at the Pump ' activist : ' We shall overcome ' high gas prices Nick Langewis
Published : Sunday August 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Divine intervention , not the market , is bringing gas prices down , one campaigner says .
59 - year - old Rocky Twyman of Rockville , Maryland has garnered worldwide attention after holding prayer meetings at gas stations across the United States since April as part of his " Pray at the Pump " drive .
Recently , to celebrate a drop in the average price of gasoline to $ 3.80 a gallon , Twyman led a group meeting at their inaugural Washington service station , singing a version of " We Shall Overcome " whose words were changed to " We 'll have to lower gas prices . "
" We believe not just in prayer , " Twyman said , " because we believe that faith without works is dead .
So we 've encouraged people to car - pool more and organise their days more , because it's a combination of faith with these other factors . "
" God is the only one we can turn to at this point , " Twyman said during an April stop in San Francisco .
" Take it to the real CEO , " Alabama DJ Todd Baker said during a recent prayer session at a Huntsville Texaco station on the heels of ExxonMobil 's posting of a second - quarter profit of about $ 11.7 billion .
Twyman also recently prayed for Tonight Show host Jay Leno , who mentioned him in a July 29 monologue : " Hey , have you heard about this group called Prayer at the Pump ?
They 're a prayer group that sprang up , and they go to gas stations and they hold hands and they pray for lower gas prices .
Otherwise known as the Bush energy plan . "
Twyman 's involvement in the community also includes the recruitment of about 14,000 minority individuals into the national bone marrow registry since 1992 , for which he received honors from Montgomery County , Maryland in April .
He also led a petition drive in 2005 to nominate Oprah Winfrey for the Nobel Peace Prize .
" We 're just really impressed , " Twyman told People Magazine , " with what she has done to raise the level of consciousness about hunger , poverty , homeless , women 's issues and , of course , the issue of AIDS . "
Georgia used US and Ukrainian mercenaries in its aggression against South Ossetia
Russia has won the war in Georgia .
US - based scientist of politics at Nixon Center , Dmitri Simes , told ITAR - TASS that Russia would now need to win the world in cooperation with the USA .
The expert means that Russia currently needs to try to turn the past events in South Ossetia to advantage of US - Russian relations .
Georgia used US and Ukrainian mercenaries in its aggression against South Ossetia
Simes believes that it is a possible , albeit a hard goal to achieve .
Simes is certain that no one in the US political establishment incited the Georgian president to invade South Ossetia .
Saakashvili simply overestimated his own significance in Washington ’s eyes and misinterpreted messages , which the US administration was sending him , the expert believes .
In its turn , America decided not to fall into Russia ’s confidence , especially when Georgian troops retreated beyond South Ossetian borders .
In addition , Washington wanted not to keep its front going after the debacle it suffered in foreign politics .
In the meantime , the presidents of the unrecognized republics of North and South Ossetia , Sergei Bagapsh and Eduard Kokoity , intend to strive for the international recognition of their small nations .
In addition , they do not exclude that the two republics may become one some day in the future .
Bagapsh believes that they have excellent chances at this point , having referred to the recognition of Kosovo ’s independence .
However , the president reminded that neither North nor South Ossetia insisted on the international recognition of their independence after events in Kosovo .
S. Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity stated that Georgia used mercenaries from several countries during its aggression against his nation .
“ There were many mercenaries from Ukraine and the Baltic states .
We have found dead bodies of African Americans too , ” Interfax quoted Kokoity as saying .
The official supposed that it was exactly the reason why the Georgian side had not provided any reports about the losses , which it was suffering during the military operation .
Presidents Bagapsh and Kokoity also accused Western media outlets of the schemed informational war against South Ossetia .
They believe that the vast majority of Western news agencies provided the biased coverage of events .
“ It was a well - prepared and thought - out action , when there was only one opinion provided – the opinion of the USA , Great Britain and several other countries .
Everyone started to support this opinion , ” Sergei Bagapsh said .
The president said that there were just a few countries which did not follow the fraudulent trend – Spain , France and Germany .
“ The whole of Georgia talks about Russia ’s bombing of Tskhinvali and South Ossetia .
What are they talking about ?
One should not believe what the BBC or CNN said or what they will be saying , ” he said .
“ You may not be a professional , but a Western journalist must have at least an iota of honor and dignity .
One should not lose their conscience and decency behind your profession , no matter whom you work for , ” Bagapsh said .
S. Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity stated that journalists of Western news agencies were as much responsible for the conflict as those , who stormed Tskhinvali .
“ It was the dual informational and armed aggression .
Some were wielding guns , whereas others were armed with microphones and cameras , ” Kokoity said .
The S. Ossetian president said that he was not going to allow Georgian peacemakers in the republic any longer .
“ There will be only Russian peacemakers deployed in South Ossetia and Abkhazia , ” he said .
The S. Ossetian president stated that that the Russian peacemakers did not open fire first .
“ Believe me as an eyewitness .
We were aware of all commands and we heard them all .
I wonder what would happen to citizens of Israel , the USA or France , for example , if they found themselves in Ossetians ’ shoes , ” he said .
Mikhail Gorbachev , the former president of the USSR , said in an interview with CNN that Georgia ’s President Saakashvili deserves to be deprived of the trust of his own nation , although it is a matter of the Georgians .
Gorbachev emphasized that Russia was acting accordingly responding to Georgia ’s aggression .
Mikhail Gorbachev said that US officials should trust their Russian counterparts .
It is absolutely obvious that the USA supports Georgia .
However , Gorbachev is certain that Russia did not have the goal of overthrowing the Georgian president .
Analysts of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies calculated that one day in South Ossetia cost Russia 2.5 billion rubles , the supervisor of the center , Ruslan Pukhov said .
For Georgia , one day of war cost 4.8 billion rubles ( about $ 200 million ) .
However , Georgia ’s defense economy is fully supported by the US budget .
Georgia ’s defense spending in 2007 made up 1 billion dollars .
Georgia does not have this money per se .
This is a picture from a recent Star Wars themed wedding .
They went all out , and every single person at the ceremony was dressed up as a character or in Star Wars fashion .
The marriage was even officiated by Princess Leia herself .
Which totally explains why the groom decided to rock a Mon Calamari mask -- he was ogling those boobies during the ceremony !
Well played sir , I like your style .
Hit the jump for a couple more MUST SEE pictures , including photographic evidence of my claim , the sweet AT - AT cake and Ewok cupcakes , a pretty wicked Han Solo , the obvious mother - in - law , and a much larger picture of Leia , you know , because I love you guys .
There 's also a link to the Flickr gallery , which contains over 1,200 photos of the event .
UPDATE : And did anybody else notice the freakish similarity between this picture and the Comic - Con picture in the So Freaking Cool section to the right ?

Advertisement A once - secret bunker designed to shield communist rulers of the former East Germany from a nuclear attack has opened to the public .
The three - storey complex , finished in 1983 , was intended to house leader Erich Honecker and 400 staff .
At the time it was one of the communist world 's most advanced bunkers .
Now the walls are covered in mould and the decontamination chambers long - defunct .
The bunker , north of Berlin , will be open for three months .
The Berlin city authorities say they will seal it with concrete afterwards .
Honecker , who ruled the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) for almost two decades , is thought to have visited the bunker only once .
" Contemporary witnesses told us that Honecker was more or less frightened or shocked when he walked through here , " said Sebastian Tenschert of the Berlin Bunker Network - a group that campaigned for the bunker to be opened .
Top secret ?
Groups will be given short tours through the ill - lit complex - where they will see offices and control rooms once intended for the elites , now covered in green slime and reeking of mould .
It was said to be the most advanced bunker in the Warsaw Pact countries
They will be led along submarine - like tunnels divided by heavy metal doors , leading on to 170 rooms .
The three storeys reach a depth of 70 m ( 230 ft ) below ground .
The bunker was fitted with a fountain , air conditioning and " springed " rooms able to cushion residents from detonations .
It was built in a forest 25 km ( 16 miles ) north - east of Berlin , near Wandlitz , where the whole East German government was accommodated in a special colony .
The bunker was surrounded by a village occupied almost entirely by members of the feared East German spy agency , the Stasi .
Falko Schewe , who worked on the building , described the project - codenamed 17/5001 - as " not that top secret " .
" My wife and mother knew about the special work which I did , but no - one else knew what I was working on .
" I was a very normal GDR citizen except that I worked for the security ministry . "

What are these ?
ScientificBlogger Matthew Brown had the chance to sit down with Professor Meg Urry , the Israel Munson Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Yale University .
She gives readers a special understanding of the issues affecting women in science ; she offers her opinion on why so few women have gone into physics , and gives advice for aspiring women physicists .
These views have been colored by her own personal experiences as a student , a mother , and as a physicist successful at the highest level :
Before coming to Yale in 2001 , she held a tenured position on the senior scientific staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) , which runs the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA .
In 2007 , she was elected the first woman Chair of the Department of Physics at Yale .
Urry 's scientific research focuses on active galaxies — galaxies with unusually luminous cores powered by super - massive black holes .
She has been the Principal investigator on over 60 approved proposals for space observations , and has authored over 140 publications in peer - reviewed journals .
In addition to these writings , she has written extensively on the subject of gender equality in science , and has worked to promote diversity in the physical sciences .
Urry organized national meetings on women in astronomy in 1992 and 2003 , and is now helping organize a third meeting scheduled for 2009 .
She led the U.S. delegation to the first international meeting on Women in Physics in Paris in 2002 ; chaired the Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy for the American Astronomical Society ; and served on the Committee on the Status of Women in Physics for the American Physical Society .
One of her opinion pieces , entitled “ Diminished by Discrimination We Scarcely See ” appeared in the Washington Post in 2005 , and most recently she has authored a chapter called “ Photons Have No Gender : A Woman ’s View of Physics , ” in the book “ Gendered Innovations In Science and Engineering . ”
ScientificBlogging.com is pleased to present this interview as the first in a series of regular interviews and profiles of women in science .
Brown :
In your 2002 editorial in SCIENCE entitled “ Physics : For Women , the Last Frontier , ” you say that “ No matter how many women start out in physics , a common trend across countries is their attrition in going from undergraduate and graduate studies to permanent positions . ”
Can you explain to our readers what is happening , and if much has changed since you published this article 6 years ago ?
Meg Urry : " For all sciences , the fraction of scientists who are women decreases as you go up in the hierarchy .
So if you start in high school taking science , and then go on to college taking science , and then go onto graduate school , and then professors and so on , at every level the fraction of women in any one field is decreasing .
It ’s slightly different for different fields .
For example , in physics , the big drop is really in college : in high school , the classes are almost fifty - fifty girls to boys .
But when you get to college , only about 20 percent of the physics majors are women .
In other fields of science , the big drop usually comes at a later point .
And the overall dearth of women is especially bad in physics . "
Brown :
What ’s happening specifically with physics ?
Meg Urry : " We seem to be really turning people off of physics in college .
Physics to me today looks like astronomy looked about 20 years ago -- and in terms of improving the situation , there ’s a lot of resistance .
There ’s lip service paid to “ yes , we want more women and minorities , ” but then something has to change .
If you keep running your departments the same way , why would you expect that something has to change ?
" People say things like “ women are n’t interested in physics , ” or “ women want to help people so they go into the medical sciences . ”
I think partly , people come up with hypotheses to explain this stuff .
There ’s a long history of every person — and Meg Urry could be another one — offering their ideas for why things are the way they are .
My feeling about this is , first of all there ’s no one answer .
There are many different things happening .
" What ’s really interesting is that sociologists and psychologists have actually done a lot of research in these areas , and what they find is contrary to what many scientists think .
Scientists are really good at coming up with hypotheses .
For example , people might say , “ the reason there are no women in physics is because graduate school and assistant professorships happen during the years when you should be having a family , and women do n’t think they can do both so they do n’t go into physics .
But the data show this does n't keep women from other demanding professions , for example medicine . "
Brown :
Are you surprised that this is so prominent in a profession where objectivity is so important ?
Meg Urry : " In the science profession , being objective is one of the most important qualities you can have .
You have to be objective as a scientist .
It ’s a core value .
And so most of us really do n’t want to admit we ’re not objective .
It ’s very difficult , and in fact many of my colleagues tell me that they are perfectly objective with respect to gender .
" But come on !
We ’re all biased .
If you grew up in the US , you grew up in a society that is very gendered .
When I was a kid there were no women on the Supreme Court .
Now at least you ’ve got one .
I ’ve grown up in a world where the leaders are men .
We ’ve never had a woman president .
We absorb that .
We internalize it .
And if it did n’t have some effect on us , I ’d be amazed .
" ... most of us really do n’t want to admit we ’re not objective . "
" But many scientists are reluctant to admit that because it ’s unscientific .
" If we can admit that we ’re biased , then we try very hard to compensate for that bias and we try to be objective and to use objective criteria .
But if we ’re quite convinced that we are n’t biased , then we think we do n’t need to articulate why because we ’re sure we ’re unbiased and therefore it must be right . "
Brown :
What do you think about the reasons that people have given for why there are so few women physicists ?
Meg Urry : " The thing about a hypothesis is that you can test it against the data .
Look at the numbers of women in medical school .
Medical school is quite grueling by all accounts , and yet they still have families .
So that ’s demonstrably not a good reason .
There are plenty of professions that demand a lot of their practitioners , and women are numerous in those professions .
" The reason that “ women want to help people ” is also not a reason they should n’t go into physics -- if anything , it 's a great reason to go into physics .
" I had a new graduate student come in to talk to me after only a few weeks into the year .
I asked her how things were going , and she said , ‘it ’s going well , but I ’m not sure I ’m going to do this .
I ’m not sure I ’m going to stick this out . ’
She said she spent last summer working at an NGO in South America helping poverty stricken areas , and she thought that was really important .
So she thought she should be doing that instead of doing physics .
" I told her that a lot of people could do what she did last summer , but it ’s not easy for most people to become a physicist .
And if you ’re a physicist , think of all the things you can do to help areas like that and help people like that in ways that go well beyond handouts .
It takes a very clever engineer or physicist to know how to do that and to think about it .
" ... it turns out that these women are doing very well , that they ’re highly respected .
But the view that they have of themselves is quite low . "
" Somehow we have created this myth that doing science and physics in American universities is an elite ivory tower profession where you ’re pondering questions that do n’t have any practical applications in the real world , and it ’s all about just solving problems and being clever .
And I think it ’s the wrong image — as I tried to tell this young woman — I think you have to look at it as a tool , and I think a physics training is better than almost anything you can think of for helping other people .
It ’s in the same league as medicine .
We should be telling our physics students about how powerful it is to understand physics , and the leverage you have to help the world .
" As for the myth of the ‘ math gap , ’ in high school , girls take as much math and physics as boys and they do just as well .
Because similar skills are needed in other fields with plenty of women , and because the fraction of physicists who are women is different from country to country , the lack of women in physics has to be some kind of cultural phenomenon rather one that can be explained rationally .
" What I ’ve observed in my 25 years in the field is that there are lots of young women who are really excited about physics — who just love it .
They love working in the lab , they love doing physics homework , they love the whole thing — it ’s something particularly noticeable among undergraduates and first year graduate students .
" But if you start talking to senior graduate students , you find a very different picture .
You find people who have lost their confidence and have lost their interest .
And they describe it in very personal terms , as if they are at fault .
They ’ll say things like , ' I made a mistake .
I should n’t have gone into this field .
I ’m not good enough for it .
I ca n’t do it .
I do n’t have any good ideas .
I ’m no good at it . '
" When you talk to the people who actually know them , it turns out that in fact these women are doing very well , that they ’re highly respected .
But the view that they have of themselves is quite low . "
Brown :
What are professors themselves doing to perpetuate this problem ?
Meg Urry : " My personal interpretation of what happens is that we go out of our way to discourage people from pursuing physics .
Even when people persist , we pretty much tell them they ’re not smart enough .
This is probably true in other fields too .
There seems to be this ‘ trial by fire ’ phenomenon where you ‘ haze ’ students to discover who among them has the backbone and the strength to be a great scientist .
" Professors will tell you that you have to go do something else , that you ’re not good enough
The correct response is “ yes I am .
And I ’m going to do it .
And I ’m going to succeed . ”
And , yet , the response for someone like me , and for many women I know would be , “ Oh .
You think I ’m not good enough .
I guess I ’m not .
Let me think about what else I ’m going to do with my life . "
Brown :
Why do you think professors , of all people , do this ?
Meg Urry : " My hypothesis — which is colored by my own perception — is that the more elitist the field , the fewer the women .
Maybe this is why physics is particularly affected .
In fields that talk about themselves in elitist terms , where the language is about how rare the best people are , there are fewer women in those fields .
I think this ‘ elitist ’ talk acts very differently on men and on women : sociologists tell us that after a certain age , men , on average , tend to have over - inflated ideas of their abilities and their prospects , and women tend to have lower than average ideas of their abilities and their prospects .
So you end up with a set of graduate students who are about to finish their theses , where the men think the world is their oyster , and that the piece of work they ’ve done is brilliant and that they ’re ready to hit the road , and the women think their work is substandard and that they ’d better find another occupation .
" We ’re fooling ourselves thinking we ’re getting the cream of the crop .
What we ’re really doing is chasing away really bright people . "
Brown :
You ’ve said before that “ women need to better understand the mechanisms of hiring , funding , and promotions ; that is , how to play the game . ”
How do you suggest that women do this ?
What other advice would you give young women who are aspiring scientists ?
Meg Urry : " I think first of all they have to recognize that that ’s the case … that there is a lot of information that they are not naturally going to get and they have to go out and seek it .
And for many young men , maybe that is n’t necessary .
Maybe they do n’t have to seek it out .
" I think it ’s easiest to talk to somebody — to relate to somebody — who ’s like you .
When student ’s come to talk to me , if they are anything like me , it ’s easy for me to think I know what they ’re thinking .
If I ’m going to offer advice , it ’s easier because I think I have a good shot at understanding what they ’re thinking about their options .
If the faculty are 95 percent male — which is true in physics — it ’s not surprising that a faculty member will get some great rapport with some student , but it ’s harder for young women to get that rapport .
Of course there will always be people who break those generalities , but I think what happens for the guys is they just have a better conduit to how things work and how the game is played and so they pick it up faster — certainly though there are some women who are masterful at it .
" So the advice I give young women is find yourself a bunch of mentors ; first of all , people at your level — peers who are postdocs or faculty or whatever you are .
" And also go to these older guys and more or less force them to mentor you !
You do n’t have to put it in those terms , but just ask them to have lunch with you to talk over what your prospects are or what your experiments have been like .
Make that step to build bridges where it might be more natural or easy not to do it .
" There ’s always something ahead , always something to reach for . "
" If you are an outsider , the way science runs — in the US at least — you really can’t succeed .
In order to do your work , you need support .
You need to be supported by a university , you need to be supported by a federal funding agency , and many of those decisions are made by your colleagues on the hiring committee at a university , or a proposal review committee at the NIH or the NSF has to decide you are worthy , so you have to be networked in .
If you are n’t , you ca n’t succeed .
" There are also organizations within institutions , within companies , within professions , that make this easier .
Every scientific field has a professional society like the American Physical Society , or the American Chemical Society , or the American Astronomical Society .
Every one of those societies has a committee on the status of women — I do n’t think there is a single one that does n’t .
" For women doubting themselves , we all have self doubt , and there ’s always another hurdle ; maybe it ’s getting tenure , but then you want to get elected to fellowship in your professional society .
Or maybe it ’s getting elected to the national academy .
There ’s always something ahead , always something to reach for .
" Men may have many of the same self doubts and concerns about their future , they just do n’t dare think about it .
For most men , you do n’t have that option to not work .
It would n’t be acceptable , and I bet that 's really scary .
" Women are just constantly wondering , 'am I good enough ?
Should I be doing this ?
Maybe I should be doing something else .'
" In terms of having a family and getting married , if you have the kind of relationship where one of you is more important than the other one , then no , I do n’t think you can have a career and a family .
" I have been asked so many times by women , ‘ can I do physics and have a family ? ’
I have never once been asked that by a young man .
Ever .
It ’s just not a question for men . "
What is a question for men , however , is how can men work to promote equality in science ?
To paraphrase one of Urry 's colleagues , excellent men have nothing to fear from doing so .

Layoffs are always difficult , but some of the recent cutbacks have been messier than usual .
Some JPMorgan employees learned that people from Bear Stearns would get their jobs before the bosses said anything .
JPMorgan clients told them first .
Some Lehman Brothers investment bankers found out their jobs were in peril when they saw cardboard boxes and dumpster bins in the hallways in March .
And when Bank of America dismissed some bankers recently , it told them that their annual bonuses had been almost wiped out and that their personal belongings would arrive in the mail .
The bank announced many of the layoffs on Feb. 13 , two days before many employees would be able to start cashing out stock options .
In January , when Ms. Kennedy was temporarily out of the office at JPMorgan because of surgery , her boss called to say her job had been eliminated .
She did not return to her office and ended up asking the bank to send her the photos of her son that she kept on her desk .
“ You do n’t get to say goodbye to people , ” Ms. Kennedy said .
“ It ’s demoralizing . ”
At some banks like Bank of America , many laid - off employees are not allowed to return to their desks , because the banks fear departing employees will try to take valuable colleagues or clients with them .
Officials at all of the Wall Street firms declined to comment .
At Credit Suisse , people who were laid off recently were allowed to say goodbye to colleagues .
But those who stayed responded with a combination of relief and fear  relief that it was n’t them , and fear that it might be soon .
Many people say they are too worried about keeping their jobs to help friends who are out of work .
“ There were mixed emotions because this clearly is n’t the last round , ” said an associate who was laid off by Credit Suisse last month .
“ Banks really are n’t making any money right now , and they have n’t been for a while .
There ’s only so long you can go and not lay off more people . ”
A defiant California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed to veto a budget passed by California lawmakers early Tuesday after a record 78 - day impasse , saying legislators had failed to incorporate needed reforms to deal with the state 's fiscal problems .
The threat by Gov. Schwarzenegger , if he follows through , would be the first time a California governor has ever vetoed an entire budget , though it is n't likely to prevent the spending plan from going into effect .
State leaders from the Democrat - controlled legislature said they were confident they had enough votes to override a veto .
Still , a bigger showdown appears to be brewing between the governor and state lawmakers .
Gov. Schwarzenegger threatened further vetoes of " hundreds " of other bills awaiting his approval to put pressure on lawmakers to enact reforms .
" The budget they passed this morning takes our problems and makes them even worse , " he said at a news conference .
Karen Bass , the Democratic speaker of the California assembly , said she was about " 95 % certain " that lawmakers would be able to muster the two - thirds majority necessary to override the governor 's veto .
The bill passed 28 - 12 in the state Senate and 61 - 11 in the Assembly .
The stalemate over the state 's budget was at risk of deepening a fiscal crisis , causing layoffs , hiring freezes and reduced wages for state employees .
An experimental cancer drug shrank prostate tumors dramatically and more than doubled survival in 70 % to 80 % of patients with aggressive cancers , British researchers reported Tuesday .
Although the study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology covered only 21 patients , the drug is now being tested in more than 250 men with what appears to be similar results , experts said .
“ There is a general sense in the prostate cancer community that this agent is extremely promising and is very likely to have an important role in the management of prostate cancer patients , ” said Dr. Howard M. Sandler , a radiation oncologist at the University of Michigan who is a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
“ It ’s pretty safe to say that we are going to have a lot more to offer patients when this drug gets approved , ” added Dr. Robert Reiter , a urologist at UCLA ’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center who was not involved in the research .

Experts expect the new drug , called abiraterone , to be widely available by 2011 .
It could find use among most of the 28,000 U.S. men diagnosed each year with the most aggressive and almost - always fatal type of prostate cancer .
The trial was sponsored by Cougar Biotechnology Inc. of Los Angeles , which holds the patent rights to abiraterone .
The drug is also being tested for breast cancer , but no results have been released yet .
Key to the excitement is the drug ’s unusual way of working .

Prostate cancer is fueled by the male hormone testosterone .
One method of treatment is known as hormonal deprivation or “ chemical castration , ” in which drugs block production of the hormone by the testes and the adrenal gland .
Yet many tumors continue to grow .
Recent research has shown that tumor cells themselves produce testosterone .
Researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research in London developed abiraterone to block an enzyme called cytochrome P17 , which is crucial in converting cholesterol to testosterone .
The point , Sandler said , is that the drug blocks testosterone production everywhere in the body , including inside the tumor cells .
“ This agent can eliminate virtually all testosterone from the bloodstream . . . which seems to be important for patients because cancer may be sensitized to the presence of minute levels of testosterone , ” he said .

The drug also blocks the production of estrogen , which is why researchers hope it will prove useful in breast cancer .
In the new study , Dr. Johann S. de Bono of the institute and his colleagues studied 21 men whose tumors were resistant to chemical castration .
The men were given once - daily oral doses of abiraterone .
“ The drug is spectacularly effective , ” De Bono said .
“ The tumors shrink , the pain goes away .
Some patients . . . have been on it for up to two years and eight months and are still doing well . ”
Reiter noted that “ these guys were at the end stage of disease , the worst stage of cancer , and 70 % responded in a clinically meaningful way .
That ’s pretty dramatic . . . and is likely to lead to a major change in therapy . ”
Advertisement
Historically , he added , most such patients die within six months .
Side effects were minimal .
Simon Bush , a 50 - year - old retired banker in London , was one of the patients in the trial .
First diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago , he tried all other forms of therapy without success .
“ Last year , I was in severe pain because of my prostate cancer , which had worsened and spread to my bones , ” he said .
Advertisement
He began taking abiraterone in May 2007 , and the improvement began within a week .
Within two months , he said , his PSA level -- a marker of tumor growth -- had dropped by 95 % .
Within three months , he had stopped taking painkillers entirely and was able to resume a normal life .
“ The changes in my life have been dramatic , from managing thousands of people in a major bank to facing a very uncertain future , then to renewed hope , thanks to this drug trial , ” Bush said .
Dr. Glen Justice , director of Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center ’s Cancer Center in Fountain Valley , noted : “ What is exciting about this drug is that it had activity in both earlier and later stages of disease .
. . .
The question is : Can we take people that have a very aggressive disease that was caught early and increase the cure rate by using it upfront ? ”

So in July I wrote a small iPhone app called MailWrangler .
Basically this app enabled a user to add their GMail accounts ( standard and Google Apps For Your Domain ) which they could load and switch between them quickly .
It embedded Webkit in to the app and logged you in to the accounts automagically .
Normally to check multiple Gmail accounts in mobile Safari you would have to log in and out of all of the accounts , typing the username and password for each .
Using just the Apple Mail application you are n’t able to see threaded views , your google contacts , archive ( quickly ) , star , etc without going through the hassles that are present when using Gmail ’s IMAP on the iPhone .
There ’s a similar app for the Mac desktop called MailPlane .
I submitted my application on July 17th .
On August 29th I finally heard back from Apple :
… Your application duplicates the functionality of the built - in iPhone application Mail without providing sufficient differentiation or added functionality , which will lead to user confusion . …
This is an interesting claim since although handing email , my app is simply directly loading and showing Gmail inside of an application .
How you can confuse Gmail with Mail. app I ’m not sure .
There was another issue :
… There is also no way to edit an account once it has been added . …
I agree that this should work .
Currently you have to delete and re-add the account .
You do n’t lose anything since all the account info stores is a username and password .
I felt for a first release this would be fine ( how often do you change your gmail password ? ) .
The number of apps with this specific issue and other issues that apps have which are in the store , mine seems to be on par or ahead of the game .
If you ’re going to have rules about this , enforce them across the board .
The number of shitty apps in the store is off the charts and yet mine that actually works is getting blocked .
What did I pay to be able to do again ?
Oh right , deal with Apple ’s messy bureaucracy .
I guess I should just write another flashlight or glowstick application to actually get published .
That ’s the only apps Apple seems to want in the store .
You could choose to ignore , or somehow explain away , the Hitler - Stalin pact , or be wedded to the original Port Huron Statement instead of the “ compromised second draft , ” but if you seriously considered yourself fiercely loyal to the far left , you believed that the Rosenbergs were not guilty of espionage .
At least you said you did .
For more than 50 years , defending Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was an article of faith for most committed American leftists .
That the couple was framed  by officials intent on stoking anti-Soviet fervor and embarrassed by counterespionage lapses that allowed Russian moles to infiltrate the government  was at the core of a worldview of Communism , the Korean War and the ensuing cold war , and an enduring cultural divide stoked by McCarthyism .
Now , that unshakeable faith has been rattled seismically .
Not for the first time , of course ; in the 1990s , secret Soviet cables released by Washington affirmed the spy ring ’s existence .
But this time , the bedrock under that worldview seemed to transmogrify into clay .
The rattler was Morton Sobell , 91 , the case ’s only living defendant .
He admitted in an interview that he and Julius Rosenberg had indeed spied for the Soviet Union .
His admission prompted the Rosenbergs ’ sons , Michael and Robert Meeropol  self - described magnets for global anguish over their parents ’ execution in 1953  to publicly accept , for the first time , that their father committed espionage .
Ronald Radosh , co-author of “ The Rosenberg File , ” a comprehensive account of the trial , declared that “ a pillar of the left - wing culture of grievance has been finally shattered . ”
It does n’t really come as a surprise to those of us who have watched John McCain over the years that he 's about to make a campaign stop in New Orleans after Hurricane Gustav hits this week .
After all , he 's been exploiting the troops for years , what 's a few hurricane victims after that ?
What does seem odd is that McCain thinks Gulf Coast residents will forget how he , George W. Bush and the then - Republican Congress turned their backs on them so many times in the months after Katrina thundered ashore in 2005 .
Sure , McCain was big on rote sympathy right after the disaster , saying on September 1 , 2005 " American citizens have proven time and again how generous and selfless a people we are , and now we have an opportunity to come to the aid of those in need . "
A week later he stridently said " Our work to help the victims of this national tragedy has just begun , and Congress must do all that is necessary to fund essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in need .
"
It must be nice to have staffers writing that stuff for you .
Too bad he spent the months to follow leading the Republican charge against every Senate bill that would have actually Katrina victims or mandated investigations on how the Bush administration could have blown disaster response so thoroughly .
Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Biden jumped immediately to the aid of hurricane victims in the week after the 2005 disaster , authoring S.Amdt .
1661 " …to provide emergency funding for victims of Hurricane Katrina .
" Biden 's legislation would have provided many things including money to purchaseinteroperable communications equipment to help first - responders dealing with the disaster , $ 10 million " to find , unite , and transport children impacted by Hurricane Katrina to their parents , legal guardian , or next of kin " and funding to assist victims of domestic violence in affected areas .
" The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has revealed the best and the worst about our great Nation .
It has revealed a great economic divide that exists among our citizens , while it demonstrated as well the capacity of the majority of our citizens to be compassionate and even heroic during times of great need , " said Biden in arguing for his bill .
" It also exposed the demons of some who will use any opportunity to prey on the weak .
"
" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has reported that over 1,000 children have been displaced by this storm -- that means they are not with their parents or guardians -- and in this amendment we provide $ 10 million for that effort , " Biden continued .
" We also provide $ 9 million to support domestic violence victims impacted by the storms .
We all heard of the reports of sexual assaults in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , and we will support those victims who have not been moved to new shelters .
" But with John McCain 's help , the Republican - led Senate shot down the funding on a 41 - 56 vote with McCain voting against , while Biden and Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama voted for the funding .
When Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) proposed the creation of a Congressional Commission to " examine the Federal , State , and local response to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina .. and make immediate corrective measures to improve such responses in the future , " John McCain was once again exactly where George W. Bush wanted him to be :
On the " nay " side of a straight party - line vote ( 44 - 54 ) that killed that legislation .
And lest you think it was McCain taking a stand against what might become a Democratic witch hunt on the failures of his bosses in the White House , the bill called for a wholly bipartisan panel , stating specifically of the 10 - member group that " not more than 5 members of the Commission shall be from the same political party .
" Unlike McCain , Barack Obama was one of the cosponsors of that bill and both he and Biden voted for immediate oversight on the bungled Katrina response .
But that 's not all .
As the Democratic minority tried throughout the fall of 2005 to get help for people in Louisiana and Mississippi , the Republicans wanted no part of it and despite his post - Katrina pledge to " do all that is necessary to fund essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in need , " John McCain was right there to shoot down every initiative that would have helped , including the following Democratic - sponsored bills :
So when John McCain makes his grand exploitation trip to Louisiana later this week -- and especially if he follows that stunt by making his convention speech from there -- keep in mind that no matter what words of resolve or sympathy he throws at the latest hurricane victims , he voted down every chance he had to actually provide help and oversight the last time this happened .
The best McCain can hope voters assume is that he simply did n’t care .
The worst -- and probably closer to the truth -- is that he was just doing what he was told .
Various readers wrote us , and it was confirmed by a detailed report on the call at DealBreaker , that the Treasury Department held a conference call this evening for analysts on the bailout bill .
A memo was evidently sent to SIFMA members ; others may have been contacted by other means .
But the report I got from one person who was on the call was the the questions came from financial services industry members .
In other words , this was most assuredly not intended to be a call open to the public at large .
If anyone from the media or other member of the great unwashed was listening in , it was by accident .
This is simply scandalous .
To have a group of interested parties get a privileged briefing by government officials on a matter of keen public interest flies in the face of what a democracy is supposed to be about .
The proper method would either be a published FAQ on the Treasury website or a briefing with the media included .
But why should I be surprised ?
Favoritism has been a staple of the Bush Administration .
There is a live blogging recap at DealBreaker .
Someone who was on the call is going over his notes and other recaps on the Web and sending me his version , which I hope will add some color .
Check back for that update .
Update :
Here are the notes promised .
Calculated Risk had put up the conference call number .
so some of this is the listener ’s notes , some are hoisted from CR .
They are admittedly skeletal at points , but track and enhance the live blogging report at DealBreaker .
You can download a torrent for the call here , which I intend to do post haste and will amend the post accordingly .
I ’ve included the long form notes below , but some items jump out :
1 . The tranching is a mere formality , and the Treasury boys as much as said so .
They could take the $ 700 billion max as soon as the bill has passed ,
2 . However , they do not plan any action immediately , will wait a couple of weeks .
They want to focus their efforts on stronger companies but also made noise about protecting the financial system .
This , by the way , is the Japanese convoy system all over .
3 . There seemed to be a lot of tap dancing about what price they will pay for assets and no straight answer about their policy on warrants .
They did say that if the amount sold was greater than $ 100 million , they would take warrants .
FYI , the current draft allows them to pay up to the price at which the assets were initially booked ( yikes ) .
I wonder if this is obfuscation , if they have an idea of what the plan to do but will not admit it in any public forum .
4 . As the person who listened to the call stressed , DealBreaker was n’t clear on the bifurcated process .
If you come to the Treasury and you are in trouble , you get reamed .
Bear / AIG style treatment , execs probably fired .
But if you participate on a voluntary basis , the intent is to make it very user friendly .
That is consistent with Paulson ’s position during the negotiations .
5 . The exec comp provisions sound like a joke ,
They DO NOT affect existing contracts , they affect only contracts entered into during the two years of the authority of this program and then affect only golden parachutes .
More detail on that point , but I do n’t need more detail to get the drift of the gist .
Further below are the notes , admittedly somewhat cryptic at points , but hopefully helpful .
But if you have time , listen to the download .
Be warned I may revise and add to the post once I have done so .
Update 12:30 AM : Have queued up recording of conference call but not yet listened to it .
But reader and sometime contributor Lune provides a useful take .
Hoisted from comments :
1 ) If even the Treasury is saying tranching is a formality , then it really is nothing .
Not sure why Dems fought so hard for a fig leaf .
2 ) Waiting a couple of weeks because no one has any idea when or where the next bomb will blow up .
In other words , all their doomsday scenarios about Black Monday were B.S.
They screamed the check had to be written by Monday , but now they ’re saying they actually have a few weeks before they need to cash it .
Plus , this will allow them to “ seek guidance ” from GS , JPM , and other selfless public servants about where the money should be funneled .
3 . The tap dancing is because they do n’t want it to get out that they ’ll be giving a sweetheart deal .
The public wo n’t be following each individual transaction to see exactly what price is being paid .
So ridiculously overpriced asset sales can be hidden in the details , and by the time some reporter ( or blogger :-) combs through and analyzes the transactions , the deed will have been done .
But if Paulson makes a statement that assets will be bought at par before the bailout ’s even begun , that will be reported and might kill the deal .
4 . In other words , we need to sweeten the pot to encourage banks to come “ voluntarily ” .
Pardon my ignorance , but why the hell should we be begging banks to borrow from us ?
I thought a bailout should be the absolute last option for a bank .
I.e. , it should be so unpalatable , so unprofitable for a bank and its executives that they exhaust every private means of survival before coming for their public “ reaming ” .
I wonder if foreclosed homeowners would rate their foreclosure process as “ user friendly ” .
5 . Of course the exec comp provisions are a joke .
Who do you think is going to be hiring all those banking cmte staffers and newly retired congresspeople next year during the inevitable post-election turnover ?
Do you really think they ’re going to vote to limit their salaries ?
Remember that for lots of people on the Hill ( including elected reps ) , govt work is merely time you spend accumulating credentials in preparation for your real life ’s work in the vastly richer private world .
Taxpayer losses : “ golly , let ’s just pray to Jesus and hope he ’ll make sure that in a few years our country wo n’t be bankrupt . ”
Oversight : “ let ’s appoint a committee which will file toothless reports that no one will ever read ” .
I ’m glad to see that while much time was spent in Exec comp .
and tranching kabuki theater , the real points of protection of taxpayer losses and implementation of new regulation seem to be afterthoughts .
The notes on the call per our helpful anonymous reader ( and former investment banker , it turns out ) :
he 's earned the pension from the Navy , there is no reason for him to return that .
If you set a precident for taking away a retired military person 's pension , then you 're going to have a lot of trouble with the military .
The check from the Senate is his pay as a senator .
Granted , not all senators and congressmen and women are millionaires and they do need that income to cover thier expenses for what is necessary for them to do their jobs , but I suppose you could set some kind of rule that if they have a certain amount of wealth then they have to use their own money to do the job .
But then would you want to work for someone who decided that since you had " enough " money that they did n't need to pay you ?
If he 's getting social security , right now senior citizens are not required to return their social security checks if they earn additional money from other jobs or investments , but they are required to pay taxes on everything .
McCain does pay taxes .
His 1040 was published in the press a couple of weeks ago .-- now that 's something that I object to .
Those are supposed to be private and not for public consumption , but since the Nixon era , the press has been obtaining the tax forms of politicians and publishing them .
Get your panties in a wad over something more important than what he 's paid .
Object that he was too chicken sh*t to vote on the issues his state sent him to vote on because he was too worried about losing votes in primaries to do his actual job .
For Jason R. , it was an exciting time .
His company was trying to break into the telecom market with a new product that they'd get to build almost entirely from scratch .
The only part that he was n't excited about was that the major customers had very specific requirements that his team would have to meticulously follow .
In this case , some bigtime POTS operators demanded that all servers must come from Sun , and any databases must be built on Oracle 8i .
One of the applications they were building had to interface with the clients ' call data records ( or CDRs ) .
The most important use of CDRs is for phone bill calculation , so naturally they were stored in properly designed and indexed tables .
The CDRs were stored alongside all billing records , and were frequently accessed by mission - critical internal applications , and they were n't prepared to expose all of that to a third party .
So instead , Jason 's company would have to construct CDRs on their own from the signaling message flow .
Because the CDRs would be processed right away , they would n't even need to store them .
The tentative architecture called for an Oracle database for CDR pipelining from the front end to the application backend .
When the analysis was being conducted , the team grew concerned with the costs — both in terms of budget and disk I/O .
Oracle licenses are incredibly expensive , and there would be a huge volume of CDR data written to and read from the database .
Finally , it dawned on someone that the database was completely superfluous since records were processed as they came in .
In fact , a single , low - end Sun server with a few hundred megs of RAM could easily handle the CDR generation and application backend .
Excited about their good news , they called up a meeting with the product managers .
" We 've discovered that we can deliver the product at a fraction of what our original estimates were . "
The managers left the room , some looking happy , others just looking incredulous .
Later that day , Jason got a call from the VP of Engineering .
" Jason , while I understand what you 're proposing is technically valid , you have upset the marketing team . "
" I 'm sorry ... did I say something ? "
" It 's just that they 've promised the customer that our product would use Oracle 8i , and now they 're going to be made liars .
Can you just humor me and add Oracle 8 i to the design somewhere ? "
" Uh ... "
" I have enough trouble politically as it is .
I really appreciate this favor ! "
* click *
After delivering the news to his team , they argued a bit on what to use Oracle for .
Ultimately they delivered the final product with an Oracle database that had a single table which was used to store a handful of configuration parameters .
It was the most expensive individual table Jason had ever created in his entire career .

Biggest shotgun I have ever seen
1 ) All the Good Stuff Has Already Been Written .
Really , how many recycled articles , plagiarized copy / pastes , and kitties with poor grammar does the Internet need .
If it ’s important it ’s already been written .
If it ’s funny , it was funnier the first time .
If a cat said it , well , OK , I admit LOLCats are funny .
And what I said about all the important stuff already being written was a lie too , but I ’m talking about digg here …
2 ) When I DO Write Great Stuff , No One Diggs It .
No , not here , over at Linux Journal .
I ’ve written some really great stuff , and no one at digg gives a crap .
One of our staff bloggers can write a script that makes a “ J ” appear on the screen , and it goes front page .
Maybe that ’s what I need .
Here ya go :
echo “ J ”
3 ) I Bought the Domain ihatedigg.com , Does n’t That Mean I Ca n’t Play Anymore ?
It still amuses me , much more than getting dugg ever would .
Perhaps someday I ’ll do something interesting with it , but for now , owning it is enough .
4 ) They ’d Just Whine Anyway
If this article WERE to appear on digg , all the commenters would complain about how lame it was , and then they ’d digg it anyway .
Or they ’d say “ BURIED ” , and some other guy would want to make THAT guy look dumb , so HE ’D digg the article so the “ BURIED ” guy got angry that it got to the front page .
Then “ BURIED ” guy would get all his buddies to click on the thumbs down thingy so that all the comments disappeared .
That seems like a lot of effort for something so silly .
5 ) I Host on GoDaddy
I doubt my site could handle more than 12 concurrent users .
If you crash my site , you ’ll see that my GoDaddy username is “ trunkboy ” when the fail page comes up , and you ’ll embarrass my kids .
Really , who wants that ?
6 ) I Do n’t Have Ads
Why would I want traffic for this post anyway ?
If I had ads on my site , well then maybe it would makes sense .
Digg traffic is almost never residual , they come , they eat , and they leave .
I ’d just as soon not tidy up after them .
7 ) I ’m Only Writing This To Amuse Myself
I ’m waiting for 1 server to back up , and 2 servers to update .
I ’m standing in a server room next to a rack of noisy servers , so shooting video is out .
It ’s too loud to listen to streaming music , and none of the other servers have good enough video cards to play any fun games .
These words serve only to amuse me , and thus far , they ’ve succeeded . 🙂
Massachusetts One Ups New Hampshire With Cigarette Tax Hike
This has just been kind of interesting to watch .
Massachusetts has approved another $ 1.00 a pack tax on cigarettes , a tax burden that unfairly affects the poor and disadvantaged at a disproportionate level by the way .
A tax that preys on a person ’s weakness seems like an extremely vile tax to me in the first place .
Anyway , once New Hampshire ’s liberal , tax and spend , irresponsible governor , John Lynch , heard that Massachusetts was going to raise it ’s cigarette tax what do you think that he decided to do ?
That ’s right , raise New Hampshire ’s cigarette tax , just not as much as Massachusetts so that Massachusetts residents would still come to New Hampshire for their cigarettes .
This will be New Hampshire ’s third cigarette tax increase since Governor Lynch took office , and Governor Lynch actually DID justify it during his announcement with the third grade mentality of “ I know you are but what am I ” politics .
He basically said , I know this is another tax increase , but hey , at least it is n’t as much as Massachusetts , as if any state policy should be compared to or based on another state ’s policy .
In his excitement , Governor Lynch did n’t even wait for Massachusetts new cigarette tax to be voted on or implemented before he announced his new tax .
He just could n’t wait .
But Massachusetts had a secret little plan in store for New Hampshire to try to slow the tide of residents pouring over the border to feed John Lynch ’s ( not so ) little coffers .
A repeal of the state price regulations law that has been in effect since 1945 .
This little known law made it a fine able offence for stores to sell cigarettes below a state imposed minimum .
That ’s right , the state actually guaranteed a higher profit for tobacco companies by refusing to allow lower prices on cigarettes .
This law was promoted as helping to sway younger people from smoking .
Needless to say , the anti-smoking nazis are up in arms about the repeal of this law , but you know what ?
If it means more people putting tax dollars into the hands of Deval Patrick , than he says to hell with stopping young people from smoking .
Deval Patrick and Massachusetts needs more revenue because the bill to gamble online for real money fell through while Deval was in New York signing a million dollar book deal .
The repeal of the price regulations law in Massachusetts is designed to hopefully lower cigarette prices and keep Massachusetts residents in Massachusetts to buy their cigarettes .
In reality cigarette prices will probably remained unchanged , only more money will be headed to the government instead of the tobacco companies .
It will give those who buy cigarettes a break because the price will probably drop enough to mitigate the tax increase , ” said the amendment ’s sponsor , Sen. Richard Tisei ( R - Wakefield ) .
“ So consumers might not get whacked with a huge increase . ”
I guess I just have a fundamental difference with this type of thinking .
I do n’t find it any more reassuring that smokers wo n’t get wacked , as Senator Tisei puts it , because more and more money is still going to the government that should be left in the people ’s pockets .
Spending should be cut before taxes are increased but both Massachusetts and New Hampshire do n’t seem to understand that simple little point .
Now that Massachusetts has pulled this little fast one on New Hampshire Governor Lynch , who jumped the gun on his tax increase , has been urged to hold off increasing the cigarette tax to study the effects of the combined Massachusetts tax hike and price control deregulation .
Governor Lynch , in an effort to suck Massachusetts residents dry , played his hand way too early , he exposed his aces in the hole and Massachusetts has caught him .
Governor Lunch is being told that New Hampshire may gain more revenue by keeping a larger gap in the price of cigarettes between New Hampshire and Massachusetts than if New Hampshire was to increase taxes which would persuade more to just stay in Massachusetts .
However Governor Lynch is addicted to new taxes and he wont be able to keep his greedy little hands out of the pot .
Cigarette taxes will go up in New Hampshire , Governor Lynch ca n’t help himself .
Governor Lynch got played in this whole deal .
In his uncontrollable urge for more taxes he played his hand too early and Massachusetts pulled one over on him .
Do n’t be so overanxious the next time , it is really unbecoming .
Especially when you consider the groups you are about to screw over the most .
It may seem like an odd marketing campaign but " Come visit Spain , the European point of entry for cocaine " remains apt .
A study of randomly selected Spanish euro notes carried out by chemists at the University of Valencia ( UV ) has shown that they contained traces of cocaine at an average concentration of 155 micrograms , which is the highest rate in Europe , according to an article published in the latest issue of Trends in Analytical Chemistry .
The researchers also carried out a comparative study of the methods currently used in detecting the presence of cocaine on bank notes worldwide .
The most recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime warns that Spain is still the major point of entry of cocaine into Europe .
In 2006 , 41 % of all hauls of the drug made on the continent were made on Spanish soil , where 50 metric tonnes were seized , followed by Portugal , with 35 metric tonnes .
The UN also says the rate of cocaine use doubled in Spain between 1999 and 2005 , increasing from 1.6 % to 3 % of those aged between 15 and 64 , which is more than twice the rate for western Europe as a whole ( 1.2 % ) .
“ I find it profoundly embarrassing that we now all have cocaine in our wallets ” - Miguel de la Guardia .
Graphic : M. de la Guardia et al .
“ The latest technology means we can now carry out quantitative analysis of cocaine traces on any bank note , and as a result we can confirm that – at least in Spain – traces of the drug are found not only on notes that have been in direct contact with it , but on nearly all the notes in circulation , ” said Miguel de la Guardia , co-author of the study and a professor in the Analytical Chemistry Department of the UV , in an interview with SINC .
He explained that this was due to “ cross contamination ” between bank notes , as well as in money counting machines used by banks .
The chemist told SINC that the methods used to extract cocaine from the bank notes and to analyse it depended upon whether it was necessary to detect the drug quickly , in which case direct application methods are used ( in which the drug is not separated from the bank note ) , such as thermal dissolution , with detection by mass spectrometry , ionic mobility spectrometry , or immune testing ( with an antigen - antibody recognition system ) .
Mass spectrometry is also used if the priority is to determine the exact amounts of cocaine on a note .
However , in this case it is necessary to first separate the drug from the notes , using methods such as gas chromatography , liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis , using organic solvents .
The study also analyses previous studies highlighting the concentrations of cocaine found in different currencies around the world , as well as the results of the random sample of Spanish bank notes gathered by the Valencian chemists , which detected concentrations of up to 889 microgrammes of the drug on some notes .
In the United States , which has the most highly contaminated bank notes of any country in the world , dollar bills containing more than 1,300 microgrammes of cocaine have been registered , although the average values were between 2.86 and 28.75 microgrammes , varying according to the year and city .
The study also reveals that German euro bank notes have a cocaine concentration traces five times lower than that of the Spanish ones .
With Irish bank notes , one statistic indicates that of 48 notes studied the highest concentration found was 0.576 microgrammes .
Another study , carried out on 356 Swiss franc notes , found that only 6 % were contaminated with the drug ( at concentrations above one nanogramme per note ) .
The researchers were unable to find any quantitative data in the scientific literature relating to British pounds , but semi-quantitative data from a few years ago suggested that between 40 % and 51 % of bank notes were contaminated with cocaine , at levels of 0.0011 microgrammes per note .
The publication points out that there is an “ unequivocal ” relationship between the high levels of cocaine found in both American dollar bills and Spanish euro notes and the high consumption of the substance in both countries .
De la Guardia believes that cocaine “ has become rooted in Spanish society , and is playing Russian roulette with the neuronal development of an entire generation ” , and that for this reason greater efforts must be made to reduce consumption , as well as to destroy the glamorous image of cocaine “ which is often portrayed by the media ” .
“ I find it profoundly embarrassing that we now all have cocaine in our wallets , ” the researcher added .

Canned tuna , packed in olive oil or in water , is a fixture in my pantry , useful in pasta sauces , salads , as a pizza topping , and even in risotto .
Tuna is a superb source of protein , B vitamins and selenium , and it ’s an excellent source of omega - 3 fatty acids .
Unfortunately , albacore tuna has been found to contain high levels of methylmercury , and for this reason it is not recommended for pregnant women , women who might become pregnant , nursing mothers or young children .
The Food and Drug Administration recommends that people in these groups eat no more than six ounces a week , or no more than 12 ounces of light chunk tuna , which is preferable to albacore .
Some nutritionists advise pregnant and nursing mothers to stay away from tuna altogether .
But the rest of us need n’t avoid canned tuna forever .
Rest assured that this week ’s dishes contain very little tuna per serving , just enough to get the traditional flavor -- and hopefully , some of the health benefits .
Pasta With Tuna and Olives
If you want to make a complete meal of this , add a green vegetable to the mix ( see the variation below ) .
I prefer to use fusilli , because I like the way the tuna gets lodged in the twists of the corkscrews .
Other types of pasta , such as penne or spaghetti , work be just as well .
CHICAGO  Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago on Thursday unveiled perhaps the most aggressive plan of any major American city to reduce heat - trapping gases .
The blueprint would change the city ’s building codes to promote energy efficiency .
It also calls for installing huge solar panels at municipal properties and building alternative fueling stations .
Ron Burke , a director with the Union of Concerned Scientists , which helped shape the plan , said it was “ more robust and quantitative than those in any other city . ”
Like hundreds of other cities , Chicago has pledged by 2020 to reduce the emissions of heat - trapping gases 25 percent from the levels in 1990 , the baseline established by the Kyoto Protocol , an international climate treaty .
Mr. Burke said the Chicago plan offered much more specific ways than other cities ’ plans to measure and cut the emissions .
被相続人が亡くなった後、その子供たちはそれぞれに財産分与を行い遺産相続をすることができます。
兄妹間の中で遺産相続を行う場合、長男が当然のように一番多くの財産分与を受けることができると思っている人もいるようですが、あくまでも兄妹間で分与することができる財産というのは割合が同じものになっていますので、遺言書による指定や相続人全員の合意がなければ長男だからといって、たくさんの相続を受けることはできません。
長男だからといって多くの遺産をもらえるという決まりはどこにもない
長男で被相続人と同居し、被相続人の生活もしっかり面倒見ていたから自分が1番の財産をもらうことができて当然だと言う主張については気持ちの上の部分となってしまい、相続人全員の同意を得ることができなければ、平等な財産分与を受けることしかできなくなってしまいます。
自分自身が長男の立場である人の場合、こうした自分の気持ちの上の問題から相続問題に発展してしまうケースもあるので注意しましょう。
他の兄妹よりも多くの財産分与を受けたいと思っている場合には遺言書による被相続人からの指定が無ければ難しい事だと言えます。
遺産相続は親族間トラブルになりやすいので注意が必要
本当に仲が良く、相続人が全てが合意してくれるようなご家族であればトラブルに発展する可能性も低く、長男の取り分が多くなったりすることもあります。
しかし、遺産相続となれば目の色を変えるような兄妹が出てくる場合もあるので、一筋縄ではいかなくなってしまうようなケースがあります。
また自分の中では長男だからたくさんの財産を引き受けてよいという認識で主張しても、他の兄妹にしてみれば相続税はたくさん支払いたくないから長男に遺産相続をなすりつけてしまうなどというケースもあるので、単純にたくさんの遺産を受けることを考えるのではなく、その後相続税を支払っていかなくてはならない部分を考えた上で自分の取り分について主張しなければなりません。
相続したくない場合は相続放棄を行う
例えば非常にお金持ちのご家庭であったり、その他にも地主でたくさんの土地を持っているなどの場合には遺産相続をする際に、たくさんの相続分があり、羨ましいと周囲から言われたりすることがあります。
しかし、親族内の問題というのは親族同士にしかわからない部分があり、どんなにたくさんの財産が残っていても絶対に相続したくないと思っている人もいるでしょう。
このように思う理由は人それぞれに違うものですが、どうしても相続したくないという理由がある場合には相続放棄を行い、遺産相続をしなくて良い状態にすることができます。
相続の放棄をする際の理由は特に問われてしまったりすることがありませんので、個人的な理由で構いません。
ただ相続放棄をする際には必ず申告しなければなりませんので、これだけは行うようにしてください。
相続放棄をすれば遺産分割協議に参加する必要がなくなる
相続の放棄をすればプラスの分もマイナスな部分も一切自分で受け取る必要がなくなりますので、遺産相続協議そのものに参加する必要がなくなります。
ただ、相続の放棄に関しては口頭で相続を放棄するというだけではなく、上記したように必ず手続きを踏まなければなりませんので正式な形で相続放棄を行い、遺産相続問題とさよならすることが大切です。
相続したくないという理由には様々なものが考えられますが、被相続人と生前から仲たがいしており、一切関わりたくないと思っている場合や、相続協議のトラブルに巻き込まれたくないという場合、またその他、完全な良心から自分が受け取る部分の財産を他の相続人が受け取ってくれると良いと考えている場合などがあります。
遺産相続のトラブル解決は初期に税理士さんに相談
お昼の情報番組などをはじめとして、ゴールデンタイムでも遺産相続問題についてのトラブルが放送されることがあります。
遺産相続問題が起きた時、自分自身がどのように対処すれば良いのかを知らないと本当に大変な思いをしてしまうだけではなく、詳しい知識を持つ他の相続人にたくさんの財産を持って行かれてしまうような可能性さえありますから、基本的な知識をはじめとして自分のおかれている環境なども考えた上で今後、相続問題が発生した場合にはどうすれば良いのかを早い段階から考えておくと良いでしょう。
また親族の中にあからさまな財産目当てのものがいるといったケースではやはり前述の通り、何かしら理由をつけて自分の分与分を多くしようと目論んでいるようなケースが考えられますから、実際に相続問題が発生する前の段階からでも税理士さんに相談しておくと良いかもしれません。
税理士に相談しておけば、基本的な部分でのアドバイスがもらえるほかに実際相続問題が発生したときにすぐにでも対処してもらうことができます。
相談だけならさほど多くの費用が必要にはならない
上記のように被相続人の生前の相続問題についてご家族が相談するということは十分可能になっており、さらには被相続人となるご本人が今後の存続問題について税理士さんに様々な相談をするというケースもあります。
このような相談だけであればあまり費用も高くありませんから、積極的に相談しておくと良いでしょう。
また遺言書を作成していくといった場合についても、どのように遺言書作成すれば良いのか税理士さんも細かなことを教えてくれますが、さらに遺言執行人として弁護士さんを紹介してくれたりすることもあります。
さらには実際に相続問題が発生した場合に必要となる費用に関しても一律で決まっているものではなく、最終的にはどれだけの財産が残っていてスムーズな解決ができるのか、または調停などで争わなくてはいけないのかという違いによっても必要な費用は変わってきます。
もちろん調停で争うことになれば他の相続人と対立しなくてはならないばかりか、弁護士さんに相談しなければならないのですが、あらかじめ税理士さんに様々なことを相談しておくことで極端な話上でも説明したように、財産目当てのものがいると言った心配をしていたことも明確な相談内容として記憶に残りますから、相手の言い分ばかりが通ってしまうようなことはないでしょう。
被相続人が残してくれた財産を平等に分けるためにも相続問題について税理士さんの力は必要不可欠と言えます。
メールで相談できる税理士さんもいる
非常に多くの税理士事務所などがありますが、近年ではインターネット上からメールによって相談ができるといった税理士さんも増えてきました。
忙しくて足を運んでいる時間がないといったケースでも、まずはメールで相談することによって簡単なアドバイスをもらうことができるでしょう。
その上で、実際の相続問題については、当然ながら税理士事務所に足を運ぶことや分割協議に立ち会ってもらうことが必要となるのですが、まずは無料相談などをメールで行うことでどのような対応をしてくれる税理士さんなのかを把握することができます。
参考：神戸の遺産相続に強い法律事務所なら弁護士法人リーセット
ここであまりにもテンプレートのような返答を返してくる税理士さんであればあまり親身になってくれないと判断することもできますが、反対にとても細かく親身になってメールを返してくれる税理士さんであればその分安心感も大きく、ぜひお願いしたいと思うでしょう。
メール相談を無料で行っている税理士事務所もたくさんありますので、どんどん活用していくと良いです。
Forget the Discovery channel ; THIS is the coolest thing they have ever built .

A controversial initiative that pays high - school students for passing Advanced Placement tests has failed to spur more kids to make the grade .
Students at 25 low - income city public schools and six parochial schools were offered private money on a sliding scale – from $ 500 to $ 1,000 – if they passed their five - point AP subject tests by scoring between 3 and 5 .
The new program , largely targeting black and Hispanic students , was meant to prepare more kids for college and give them a financial boost to get there .
Despite the dangle of dollars , the number of students passing their AP tests in the 31 schools actually dipped to 1,476 this year – down five from 2007 , when no cash was on the table , according to data released yesterday by the Council of Urban Professionals , which distributes the money .
The passing rate fell from 35 percent in 2007 to 32 percent this year in a result that surprised even those who have been skeptical of cash - for - kids programs .
“ I would have thought that the kids who were on the margins [ of passing ] – that you would have seen many of them go over the top , ” said Dr. Pedro Noguera , a professor of teaching and learning at NYU who has questioned the long - term viability of incentive programs in schools .
“ Why that did n’t happen – we should look closely at why that ’s going on , ” he said .
Those behind the privately funded initiative said they saw many positive results on which to build , including an 8 percent increase in the number of AP tests taken and a 19 percent increase in students scoring at the top point level .
Passing rates at nine of the 31 schools increased by more than 50 percent .
“ We ’re going to try and figure out what worked at these schools and how we can apply what happened at these schools to some of the other schools , ” said Whitney Tilson , a co-founder of the initiative .
“ Obviously , we ’ll be disappointed next year and in future years if there ’s no increase in the number of students passing , but we ’re not discouraged at all . ”
More than 1,100 students are collecting nearly $ 1 million for their work .
“ It got to the point that we were sitting at breakfast and prepping each other on AP US history trivia , ” said Jason Tejada , 16 , a senior at All Hallows HS in The Bronx .
“ I do n’t see any downside to it , ” he said of the program .
“ It ’s pretty straight and simple : Work hard , we ’ll pay you . ”

MUMBAI , Sept 30 ( Reuters ) - Indian sugar futures eased on Tuesday as overnight falls in crude oil prices spurred expectations that demand for the cane - based biofuel ethanol would fall , triggering profit - taking .
Losses were limited by firm demand in the spot market , which rose after the government , which controls the sector , on Monday allowed millers more time to sell sugar from the September quota .
At 2:44 p.m. ( 0914 GMT ) , October futures NSMV8 on the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange had eased 0.06 percent to 1,770 rupees ( $ 37.7 ) per 100 kg .
November futures NSMX8 fell 0.22 percent to 1,825 rupees .
The contract had risen 6.4 percent in the two weeks to Monday .
Prices in the spot market in Maharashtra , the largest sugar producer , rose nearly 1 percent to 1,716.4 rupees .
U.S. crude oil prices plunged more than $ 10 a barrel late on Monday after the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a $ 700 billion plan to bail out the crisis - hit financial sector .
[ ID:nN29406570 ] .
“ The market is also awaiting government ’s decision on the quantity of sugar to be sold in the three months to December , ” an analyst at ICICI Direct said .
Traders are expecting the government , which fixes monthly and quarterly supplies for the open market , may allow millers to sell a higher quantity in the October - December period .
It released 4.2 million tonnes for the same quarter last year .

In his testimony to the Congress on September 24 , Fed Chairman Bernanke urged the legislators to quickly approve the bailout of the financial sector with a package of $ 700 billion .
Bernanke echoed Treasury Secretary Paulson 's view that the bailout expense , while hefty , is needed to remove from banks ' balance sheets the mortgage - linked assets , which are paralyzing the flow of credit .
I think it 's extraordinarily important to understand that as we have seen many previous examples in different countries and in different times that choking up of credit is like taking the lifeblood away from the economy .
Most experts came out in strong support for the package .
Without the rescue package , many large institutions that are " too big to fail " could go belly up .
Many believe that the consequences of all this could be very severe to the real economy .
It is true that the financial system must be rescued ; it must be rescued from the institutions holding bad debt that are currently draining capital while waiting for a bailout and adding little in return .
It is they that are preventing wealth - generating activities in the financial sector and the other parts of the economy from expanding real wealth .
The Essence of Economic Adjustment
Conventional thinking presents economic adjustment — also labeled as " economic recession " — as something terrible , even the end of the world .
In fact , economic adjustment is not menacing or terrible ; from an economic point of view , it is nothing more than a time when scarce resources are reallocated in accordance with consumers ' priorities .
Allowing the market to do the allocation always leads to better results .
Even the founder of the Soviet Union , Vladimir Lenin , understood this when he introduced the market mechanism for a brief period in March 1921 to restore the supply of goods and prevent economic catastrophe .
Yet for some strange reason , most experts these days cling to the view that the market cannot be trusted in difficult times like these .
If central bankers and government bureaucrats can fix things in difficult times , why not in good times too ?
Why not have a fully controlled economy and all the problems will be fixed forever ?
The collapse of the Soviet Union 's centralized system is the best testimony one can have that controls do n't work .
A better way to fix economic problems is to allow entrepreneurs the freedom to allocate resources in accordance with society 's priorities .
In this sense , the best rescue plan is to allow the market mechanism to operate freely .
Allowing the market to do the job will result in some activities disappearing all together while some other activities will in fact be expanded .
Take , for instance , a company that has six profitable activities and four losing activities .
The management of the company concludes that the four losing activities must go .
To keep them alive is a threat to the survival of the company ; these activities rob scarce funding from profitable activities .
Once the losing activities are shut down , the released funding can now be employed to strengthen the winning activities .
The management can also decide to use some of the released funding to acquire some other profitable activities .
This is precisely what the government rescue package prevents from happening .
The government package is not going to rescue the economy , but it will rescue activities that the economy cannot afford and that consumers do not want .
It will sustain waste and promote inefficiency , draining resources from growth and efficiency .
Remember : government is not a wealth generator ; it can only take resources from A and give them to B .
Can the Rescue Package Prevent Economic Disruptions ?
Some supporters of the package are of the view that the package is necessary in order to prevent economic disruptions .
They mean by this that various phony activities should be kept alive by wealth generators for a little bit longer until a proper system is established .
By " proper , " they mean more controls .
For a while , the government 's package can appear to be working ; this is because there is still enough real savings to support both profitable and unprofitable activities .
If , however , savings and capital are shrinking , nothing is going to help , and the real economy will follow up with further declines .
Hence the rescue package cannot prevent so - called economic disruptions .
If anything , government intervention would make these disruptions much worse .
Again , a better alternative is to let the market do the job .
The market 's ability to make swift adjustments without much drama was vividly illustrated only a few weeks ago when the very large investment bank , Lehman Brothers , was allowed to go belly up .
The world did not come to an end .
Instead , this was a healthy development .
A money loser was eliminated from the market .
This freed up resources to promote growth .
One could have made the case that when Lehman was on the brink it was too big to fail — assets of $ 639 billion and employing over 26,000 people .
Yet in a few days the market , once allowed to do the job , reallocated the good pieces of Lehman to various buyers and the bad parts have vanished .
It was poetry .
Likewise Merrill Lynch , which was bought by the Bank of America , will see the good parts of it reinforced while the useless parts are likely to be removed .
On September 18 , 2008 , Washington Mutual , the largest US saving and loan bank , was forced into liquidation .
The bank had $ 307 billion in assets and $ 188 billion in deposits .
What prompted the closure are heavy losses on its $ 227 billion book of real - estate loans , of which a large portion was in subprime mortgages .
The bank lost $ 6.3 billion in the nine months ending June 30 .
Against this background , and coupled with customers withdrawing $ 16.7 billion over the past ten days , government regulators decided to close the bank .
Observe that this was the largest US banking failure .
Note that the closure of the bank did n't result in the end of the world .
JP Morgan Chase bought some of the good assets of Washington Mutual for $ 1.9 billion .
On this , Jeffrey Tucker made the following observation ,
But as wonderful as the daily shifts and movements are , what really inspires are the massive acts of creative destruction such as when old - line firms like Lehman and Merrill melt before our eyes , their good assets transferred to more competent hands . …
This is the kind of shock and awe we should all celebrate .
It is contrary to the wish of all the principal players and it accords with the will of society as a whole and the dictate of the market that waste not last and last .
No matter how large , how entrenched , how exalted the institution , it is always vulnerable to being blown away by market forces — no more or less so than the lemonade stand down the street .
Most commentators have accepted that the root problem of the current financial crisis is the lack of proper control over mortgage lending .
But the out - of - proportion explosion in the mortgage lending did n't occur out of the blue .
Without the aggressive lowering of interest rates by the Fed , mortgage lending could n't have exploded .
The Fed lowered the federal - funds rate target from 6 % in January 2001 to 1 % by June 2003 .
The 1 % was kept until June 2004 .
The loose monetary stance prepared the ground for various false activities that would n't have been around without the loose stance .
If authorities had kept strong controls over mortgage lending , while at the same time creating money out of thin air , the excesses would have popped up in some other sector .
The banks would have ended up having plenty of bad non-mortgage - related assets .
The Fed 's loose policies are the crux of the problem .
So rather than blaming the symptoms , what is required is to let the market work and close all the loopholes that allow the creation of money and credit out of thin air .
Can Making Banks ' Balance Sheets Look Good " Fix " the Economy ?
Recall that Treasurer Paulson and the Fed chairman are of the view that once banks ' bad assets are removed , the banks are likely to move ahead and start lending .
We suggest that making the balance sheet look pretty is not going to alter the essence of the problem , which is the poor state of capital and savings to support such high lending activities .
The essence of a sound credit market is not lending money as such but lending the real stuff that people require by means of money .
Without the real stuff — the preceding savings and subsequent productivity to fund the lending — no lending is possible .
Decades of nonproductive consumption ( consumption that is not backed up by production ) that emerged on the back of loose monetary and fiscal policies have severely damaged the store of wealth that serves as the foundation for credit markets .
If this is the case , it will be futile to try to boost lending by pushing more money into the banking system .
More money cannot generate real wealth .
If it could , world poverty would have been eliminated a long time ago .
When the market is allowed to take charge , the relationship between savings , lending , and productivity will be brought into proper perspective .
At last we will know which activities are genuine and which are phony .
Does the Fall in Stock Prices Cause an Economic Slump ?
The proponents of government intervention maintain that one cannot allow the market to take charge since this will cause a drop in stock prices , which will be bad for the economy .
Within the confines of this way of thinking , it is not surprising that Bernanke and Paulson panicked on September 18 , once a large money - market mutual fund — the Reserve Primary Fund — was on the brink .
They argue that were it not for the Fed 's injecting $ 105 billion and the subsequent announcement of the rescue package , the stock market would have had a massive fall .
They also believe that the massive monetary injection prevented a run on money - market mutual funds and prevented a major disaster .
They further believe that if people had taken the money out of their money - market mutual funds , banks would n't be able to secure money to fund credit cards and various consumer and business loans .
This in turn would have paralyzed the economy .
So let us think about this .
Say that people take their money from the money - market mutual funds .
What happens then ?
They will have placed it somewhere else , mostly likely with commercial banks .
Hence money would n't disappear and banks could continue to fund activities as before .
If large money - market funds were to go under , some of their assets would be sold and the shareholders would suffer losses ; this however , cannot provide justification for the Fed to pump money and to introduce a rescue package .
Monetary expansion and a rescue package do not undo the bad investment decisions of the money - market - mutual - fund managers .
Why should people who did n't risk investments in the fund pick up the tab ?
A fall in asset prices , including stocks , and a run on financial institutions are just symptoms and not the cause of anything .
The key factor behind the current difficulty in the credit markets is the lagged effect coming from the Fed 's tighter stance between June 2004 and August 2007 , when the federal - funds - rate target was raised from 1 % to 5.25 % .
The tighter stance started to undermine various bubble activities that had emerged from the previous loose stance .
A tighter stance slowed the diversion of real savings from wealth generators towards bubble activities .
Without an adequate supply of real funding , these activities started to crumble .
Obviously , then , banks that have been providing support to these activities by providing loans have ended up holding a large amount of bad assets .
As a result , bank stock prices started to come under pressure .
With a time lag , bubbles in the various other parts of the economy are also likely to come under pressure , and this again is going to hurt financial stocks .
So the fall in economic activity is not the result of a fall in stock prices , but rather comes on account of the tighter Fed stance that throttled the supply of real savings to non-wealth - generating activities .
Would the stock market have come under pressure if the Fed had kept the interest rate at 1 % for an indefinite period of time ?
A prolonged loose stance would have given rise to a much greater amount of nonproductive bubble activities .
As a result , the pace of real wealth generation would have continued to slow , and consequently the growth momentum of profits would have come under pressure .
In response to this , commercial banks would have become more cautious in their expansion of credit out of thin air .
All this in turn would have undermined the existence of bubble activities .
Bubble activities cannot stand on their own feet ; once the rate of growth of the money supply slows down , the pace of the diversion of real savings towards false activities follows suit .
As a result , the survival of these activities is threatened .
From this we can infer that a fall in non-wealth - generating activities — also labeled an economic slump — is not due to a fall in the stock market as such but to the previous loose monetary policy that has weakened the pool of real savings .
" The government package is not going to rescue the economy , but it will rescue activities that the economy cannot afford and that consumers do not want . "
The central - bank policies aimed at preventing a fall in the stock market cannot prevent a fall in the real economy .
In fact , the real economy has already been damaged by the previous loose monetary stance .
All that the fall in the stock market does is inform us about the true state of economic conditions .
The fall in the price of stocks just puts things in a proper perspective .
The fall in the stock price is just an acknowledgment of reality .
Conclusion
Only a few weeks ago , we saw that the liquidation of a large bank such as Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch did not cause massive disruptions .
In fact , the adjustment was swift and almost invisible .
The reason for the smooth adjustment is that the market was allowed to do its job .
If government and Fed bureaucrats had tried to intervene with bailouts , the whole process would have taken much longer and would have been very costly in terms of real resources .

That ’s the message that Denver officials say they hope to convey to its homeless community as the Democratic National Convention approaches .
No one will be swept or bused out of the city in an effort to " clean up " Denver during the event .
But some homeless advocates say that a city program makes the homeless feel particularly unwelcome in public parks , and that the city plans to empty parks of the homeless before the convention .
Called Come On
In , the program , which was launched in 2006 , urges charities that serve outdoor meals to the homeless to move their operations indoors .
If the " feeders , " as officials call them , serve indoors , then the homeless will have access to clean water and toilets , not to mention a plethora of other services .
Plus , the program will placate neighbors who complain that the homeless litter and defecate in picnic areas .
" We want to make sure that people are receiving food that was safely prepared and that they can eat a meal at a table and eat a meal with dignity and be treated in a humane way , " says Deborah Ortega , executive director of Denver ’s Commission to End Homelessness , the city board that created Denver ’s Road Home .
" There were groups that would drive down the street and throw out sandwiches to groups in a park .
How humane is that ? "
In the past year , the Come On In program has cut the number of charities serving outdoor meals from 17 to 5 , and Denver ’s homeless officials say that many of these groups are now serving meals indoors .
Neighbors , they say , have almost completely stopped complaining about garbage in their communities .
Yet some homeless advocates question the impetus behind the program .
Mackenzie Liman of Food Not Bombs , which still serves outdoors in Civic Center Park , says that the purpose of the Come On In program " was to decrease the visibility of homelessness downtown . "
Liman attended city meetings in 2006 and 2007 , where she says the city ’s homeless officials said they wanted the program in full swing by fall of 2008 .
The timing , she says , made her suspicious that Denver wanted to scour its parks of the homeless before the DNC .
" Because of the way the meetings evolved , there was funding and energy put into decreasing feedings in Civic Center Park .
That happened to run parallel to preparations for the DNC , " says Liman , who maintains that the Food Not Bombs meal is an important picnic for Denver ’s hungry , and is not less safe or less sanitary than eating indoors .
" As someone who works with homeless people and with people who depend on services downtown , when I hear that there is a big event that the media is excited about , my heart sinks because it is not going to be good for the people I work with . "
Ortega says that the city never came up with an end goal for the program but instead wanted to implement it as quickly as possible .
" It was an issue we were dealing with before anyone knew that the Democratic National Convention was coming to Denver .
This was part of the work of the 10 - year plan , " she says , referring to Denver ’s decade - long effort to end homelessness , called Denver ’s Road Home , which began in 2005 .
" It has nothing to do with the Democratic National Convention coming here . "
Denver clinched the DNC in January of 2007 .
Denver ’s Commission to End Homelessness initiated discussions with the police department , Denver Human Services , " feeders , " and others in 2006 and named this group the Public Feeding Coalition .
According to Liman and others , Food Not Bombs expressed its concerns with the program early on , but its members felt stymied when they were asked to weigh in on tangential issues , like the design of the Come On In brochures , instead of to address the true purpose of the program .
The Commission to End Homelessness considered banning public meals for the homeless altogether but decided against legislation .
" Just because you have a law on the books does n’t mean that solves the problem , " says Ortega .
" Our goal is to try and get people moved into housing .
As we move down that path , our hope is that we do n’t need to feed people outdoors because the folks are inside .
The Denver Rescue Mission offers free meals for folks that find themselves experiencing hardship . "
Commander Deborah Dilley , who oversees Denver Police Department ’s District 6 , which includes downtown and Civic Center Park , says that she wanted to test the program without legislation first .
It has , indeed , been successful , she says ; neighbors have largely stopped complaining .
Orlando and Las Vegas attempted to outlaw outdoor meals for the homeless , but in Las Vegas the ban was overturned in court .
Dilley warns that Denver police may still ticket the homeless who show up at meals if they engage in unlawful behavior .
And , she says , that ’s reason enough to move everyone indoors .
" Some of the behaviors [ by homeless people ] are illegal .
The homeless person who would sit on someone ’s step or urinate or defecate in someone ’s yard — that is illegal , " she said .
" The feeders would not get in trouble for that , but the homeless people who were there to eat would .
You could put the people you are trying to help in danger . "
For now , Denver police will continue contacting groups that serve meals outside , and ask them to move indoors .
But Liman says that Food Not Bombs , for one , is not going anywhere .
" The [ city ’s ] goal has been to give people food and housing and maintain their dignity , " she says .
" If you say that is what you are about , then do n’t sweep people under the carpet . "
This is part one of a three - part series on the growing controversy between city officials and homeless service programs ahead of the Democratic National Convention .

Clinton releases her tax returns : Bill & Hillary made $ 109 M since leaving WH Nick Juliano
Published : Friday April 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign released her and husband Bill Clinton 's tax returns Friday , showing the couple made more than $ 109 million since leaving the White House in 2001 .
They donated $ 10 million to charity and paid nearly $ 34 million in taxes .
The couple 's tax returns are available here .
According to the campaign , Bill Clinton was responsible for the bulk of the couple 's post - White House income , both from his books -- $ 23 million from autobiography My Life and $ 6.3 million from Giving -- and a lucrative speaking tour , which netted him nearly $ 52 million .
Hillary Clinton had been facing mounting pressure to release the family 's tax returns since last week , when Obama released his .
Questions also arose earlier this year when Clinton loaned her campaign $ 5 million from her and her husband 's joint assets .
" The Clintons have now made public thirty years of tax returns , a record matched by few people in public service , " Clinton campaign spokesman Jay Carson said in a prepared statement .
" None of Hillary Clinton 's presidential opponents have revealed anything close to this amount of personal financial information .
" What the Clintons ' tax returns show is that they paid more than $ 33,000,000 in federal taxes and donated more than $ 10,000,000 to charities over the past eight years , " Carson continued .
" They paid taxes and made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level . "
Clinton earned close to $ 10.5 million from her own memoir Living History and about $ 190,000 from her 1996 book , It Takes a Village .
Earnings from the earlier book were donated to charity .
The Clinton campaign summarized the couple 's earnings as follows : CUMULATIVE TOTAL ( GROSS ) INCOME : $ 109,175,175
Including , among other items :
Senator Clinton 's Senate Salary : $ 1,051,606
President Clinton's Presidential Pension : $ 1,217,250
Senator Clinton's Book Income : $ 10,457,083
President Clinton's Book Income : $ 29,580,525
President Clinton's Speech Income : $ 51,855,599
That summary leaves about $ 18 million unaccounted for , as Politico 's Ben Smith notes .
The returns went out at 4 p.m. Friday , and the Drudge Report apparently got early word they were coming .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder observes some reasons the release 's timing was helpful for Clinton : Good day to get these out .
( a) Clinton 's traveling press corps is exhausted by their travel schedule
( b) Mark Penn 's gaffe goes away temporarily
( c) It 's a Friday
( d ) lots of MLK - related political news
( e ) it 's well before Pennsylvania , as opposed to just days before Pennsylvania .
DEVELOPING ...
In 1933 , Franklin Roosevelt inherited an economic crisis .
He understood that his first job was to restore confidence , to give people a sense that somebody was in charge , that something was going to be done .
This generation of political leaders is confronting a similar situation , and , so far , they have failed utterly and catastrophically to project any sense of authority , to give the world any reason to believe that this country is being governed .
Instead , by rejecting the rescue package on Monday , they have made the psychological climate much worse .
George W. Bush is completely out of juice , having squandered his influence with Republicans as well as Democrats .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a smart moneyman , but an inept legislator .
He was told time and time again that House Republicans would not support his bill , and his response was to get down on bended knee before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
House leaders of both parties got wrapped up in their own negotiations , but did it occur to any of them that it might be hard to pass a bill fairly described as a bailout to Wall Street ?
Was the media darling Barney Frank too busy to notice the 95 Democrats who opposed his bill ?
Pelosi ’s fiery speech at the crucial moment did n’t actually kill this bill , but did she have to act like a Democratic fund - raiser at the most important moment of her career ?
Most animals have sideways - facing eyes that allow for a panoramic view of nearly all that 's around them , both in front and behind .
Credit : Rensselaer / Changizi
The advantage of using two eyes to see the world around us has long been associated solely with our capacity to see in 3 - D. Now , a new study from a scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has uncovered a truly eye - opening advantage to binocular vision : our ability to see through things .
Most animals — fish , insects , reptiles , birds , rabbits , and horses , for example — exist in non-cluttered environments like fields or plains , and they have eyes located on either side of their head .
These sideways - facing eyes allow an animal to see in front of and behind itself , an ability also known as panoramic vision .
Image A : the diagram on the left illustrates the skull of an animal with nearly sidways - facing eyes .
The two orange semicircles show the visual fields of each eye , and the darker orange triangle indicates the small binocular region in front .
The diagram on the right illustrates the regions within which the animal is capable of recognizing objects in a cluttered environment .
Image B represents the visual field and binocular region for an animal with nearly forward - facing eyes .

Humans and other large mammals — primates and large carnivores like tigers , for example — exist in cluttered environments like forests or jungles , and their eyes have evolved to point in the same direction .
While animals with forward - facing eyes lose the ability to see what 's behind them , they gain X - ray vision , according to Mark Changizi , assistant professor of cognitive science at Rensselaer , who says eyes facing the same direction have been selected for maximizing our ability to see in leafy environments like forests .
All animals have a binocular region — parts of the world that both eyes can see simultaneously — which allows for X - ray vision and grows as eyes become more forward facing .
Demonstrating our X - ray ability is fairly simple : hold a pen vertically and look at something far beyond it .
If you first close one eye , and then the other , you 'll see that in each case the pen blocks your view .
If you open both eyes , however , you can see through the pen to the world behind it .
To demonstrate how our eyes allow us to see through clutter , hold up all of your fingers in random directions , and note how much of the world you can see beyond them when only one eye is open compared to both .
You miss out on a lot with only one eye open , but can see nearly everything behind the clutter with both .
" Our binocular region is a kind of ' spotlight ' shining through the clutter , allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it , " says Changizi , who is principal investigator on the project .
" As long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter — as is the case with our fingers , or would be the case with the leaves in the forest — then we can tend to see through it . "
To identify which animals have this impressive power , Changizi studied 319 species across 17 mammalian orders and discovered that eye position depends on two variables : the clutter , or lack thereof in an animal 's environment , and the animal 's body size relative to the objects creating the clutter .
Changizi discovered that animals in non-cluttered environments — which he described as either " non-leafy surroundings , or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animal 's eyes " ( think a tiny mouse trying to see through 6 - inch wide leaves in the forest ) — tended to have sideways - facing eyes .
" Animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are , so there is never any X - ray advantage to forward - facing eyes for them , " says Changizi .
" Because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision , they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways - facing eyes . "
However , in cluttered environments — which Changizi defined as leafy surroundings where the cluttering objects are smaller than the separation between an animal 's eyes — animals tend to have a wide field of binocular vision , and thus forward - facing eyes , in order to see past leaf walls .
" This X - ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward - facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways - facing eyes would allow , " says Changizi .
" Additionally , the larger the animal in a cluttered environment , the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest X - ray vision possible , in order to aid in hunting , running from predators , and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle . "
Changizi says human eyes have evolved to be forward facing , but that we now live in a non-cluttered environment where we might actually benefit more from sideways - facing eyes .
" In today 's world , humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle .
We are n't faced with a great deal of small clutter , and the things that do clutter our visual field — cars and skyscrapers — are much wider than the separation between our eyes , so we can't use our X - ray power to see through them , " Changizi says .
" If we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now , it 's possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes , because by then they might be facing sideways . "
Changizi's research was completed in collaboration with Shinsuke Shimojo at the California Institute of Technology , and is published online in the Journal of Theoretical Biology .

Factgirl 's official verdict : No .
After reviewing the movement and assets of the cult ( the most interesting being Patrick Bellamy 's False Prophet : The Aum Cult of Terror at http://crimelibrary.com/terrorists/aum/main.htm) and doing a little research into Nuclear Science and Geology :
1 . There are no former uranium mines in Western Australia .
2. Uranium is hard to mine but harder to concentrate .
For every 25,000 tons of Uranium ore that is mined from the earth , only 50 tons of Uranium metal can be refined from that , and 99.3 % of that metal is U - 238 which is too stable to be used as an active agent in an atomic detonation .
To make matters even more complicated , no ordinary chemical extraction can separate the two isotopes since both U - 235 ( the bomb kind ) and U - 238 possess precisely identical chemical characteristics .
The only two concentrators in the entire nation are both owned by Anaconda Uranium Corporation a Company with home offices in Canada .
3 . At the time of 1992 - 1993 the cult was still doing its big membership drive and concentrating on its efforts to sell electrical helmets ( to stimulate your spiritual thoughts , $ 70,000 a piece or rent for $ 7,000 a month ) to work up to its big doomsday event .
They had n't the resources or the personnel to build an atomic bomb .
The plans for the bomb are available on this here internet , but as the site 's disclaimer wisely indicates : ( and I paraphrase ) if you do n't blow yourself up along with your neighborhood , you will die of radiation poisoning .
Later that day ...
I am not a chemist or physicist and I promise you if I ever accidently become one I will eat my kids - much respect to Rook for the true facts regarding separation of U235 from U238 !
My info was as much research as my teeny wrinkly brain could comprehend and node within a reasonable time frame ( in this case about 18.2 minutes ) .
The site I quoted , http://serendipity.magnet.ch/more/atomic.html stated :
The only methods that can effectively separate U - 235 from U - 238 are mechanical methods .
I do n't know how to separate Uranium using any method .
I am looking forward to the debate .
Perhaps she will bring a pair of binoculars .

THE dollar recently plunged to a record low against the euro , pushing prices for gondola rides in Venice and beer in Brussels to new heights for American travelers .
The sticker shock has been even worse in Britain , where the ratio of the pound ’s value to the dollar ’s has been more than 2 to 1 .
But you do n’t have to eat at McDonald ’s or stay at a fleabag hotel to afford a European vacation .
Below are 10 ways to save money .
1 . Find the airfare bargains .
Check the low - cost airlines , including Zoom , Flyglobespan and Eurofly , that now fly between the United States and Europe .
Zoom Airlines , for example , recently started daily flights from Kennedy Airport to London Gatwick for as low as $ 199 each way .
On major airlines , look for new flights with low introductory fares .
( When Air France started a new morning flight from New York to Paris earlier this year , for instance , one - way fares started at $ 199 . )
And sign up for fare alerts , which offer a heads - up when airfares drop .
Expedia and Orbitz have automated versions .
If you ’re more concerned with price than what city you fly in to , sign up for e-mail alerts from Travelzoo.com or Airfarewatchdog.com that tell you about all sorts of deals from your home city .
A recent Airfare Watchdog alert for travelers flying out of Newark in August included round - trip fares of $ 593 to Amsterdam , $ 636 to Oslo and $ 623 to Stockholm .
2 . Think twice about hotels .
Eurocheapo.com offers no-nonsense reviews of budget hotels in dozens of cities ; in Rome , it recommends the Suore di S. Elisabetta , a convent on a hill just south of the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore , for anyone who does n’t mind an 11 p.m. curfew or a religious environment .
Doubles start at 64 euros , $ 90 , at $ 1.41 to the euro .
Eurocheapo ’s new CheapoSearch , which shows availability for budget hotels in central neighborhoods , recently turned up 187 hotels in central Paris with rooms for less than $ 150 a night for Aug. 2 to 4 .
And you may do even better by renting a villa or an apartment .
Two - bedroom villas can be reserved for as little as $ 1,200 a week near Florence .
HomeAway.com and Rentalo.com connect travelers directly to property owners and managers .
3. Try Europe ’s budget airlines .
No -frills carriers fly Europeans cheaply from city to city .
Ryanair ran a large summer sale last month , for example , with fares as low as 10 euros to Brussels , Pisa and Dublin from London .
Pack light to keep costs down ; these airlines may charge for checked luggage or bags weighing above specified limits .
Be aware that these airlines often fly out of smaller , somewhat more inconvenient airports , and you should add in the extra travel time to get to them .
( See the Frugal Traveler ’s April 22 , 2007 , column “ Adventures in Low - Cost Travel ” for more information on budget airlines . )
One of the problems with the RIAA 's lawsuit campaign is that it 's heavily reliant on the assumption that tying an IP address to a person sitting at a PC at a particular time is a trivial matter .
The reality is much messier , as a case involving 11 students at Tufts University in Massachusetts demonstrates .
A vice president at the school has written to a federal judge , pointing out the difficulty of tying the 11 IP addresses logged by MediaSentry to specific MAC addresses ( and users ) .
Under a March court order , Tufts ( and other schools and ISPs in that particular district ) are supposed to provide the court with a list of all possible matches when unable to determine the identity of the user sought by the RIAA to a " reasonable degree of technical certainty . "
The judge then reviews the list and makes a determination on how to proceed .
In the case of Zomba Recording v. Does 1 - 11 , Tufts argues that there are just too many possible users involved , which has implications for this particular RIAA fishing expedition .
While Tufts can tie three IP addresses to particular MAC addresses with reasonable certainty , two of the other IP addresses fingered by MediaSentry could have been used by as many as forty users during the time in question .
" It is therefore difficult to conclude with any reasonable level of certainty that any one of those users was actually using the IP address in question at the relevant time , " writes the university .
" We believe , in these two instances , that it would be unfair to identify all possible individuals meeting the plaintiffs ' criteria , given the low likelihood of identifying the guilty party . "
Tufts keeps data on MAC addresses — all of which are registered to particular users — for a period of years .
The IP addresses assigned to those MAC addresses via DHCP , however , are only kept for 10 days before being overwritten .
The school also uses Address Resolution Protocol to grab entries from routers around the campus at various intervals , but as it only records the first and last times a particular user is assigned an IP address , it is an imprecise and incomplete record .
In other cases where a school is only able to narrow down the list of possible P2P users to a dorm room with two or more residents , the RIAA has typically sought to obtain the names of all possible infringers in an attempt to discover the identity of the P2P user in question .
With 40 possible users for two IP addresses , such an approach is impractical .
Moreover , there are privacy implications for the at least 38 innocent students involved .
We asked the RIAA how it would handle the situation with the two Tufts IP addresses .
" As we do in all of our cases when issues are presented , we will work with the school to determine the most reasonable course of action to prevent further abuse of its network , " an RIAA spokesperson told Ars .
One way to solve this problem from the RIAA 's perspective would be tighter record - keeping and networking monitoring by the schools themselves .
Tufts even admits that it could do a better job with data retention : " We recognize the inherent limitations of the network data retention system that we are currently using , and are actively looking at possible adjustments . "
The RIAA has joined the MPAA in pushing for legislation on the federal and state level that would require colleges to crack down on P2P use on campus , which would presumably involve longer retention times for network data .
The recently passed College Opportunity and Affordability Act will require colleges to start working on formal piracy deterrence plans , and Big Content has also been lobbying states to pass more stringent antipiracy laws .

Most affected were the mobile versions of these GPUs because of the on - off usage pattern of notebook users , as well as the constant thermal throttling ( for power management ) .
The more frequent hot - cold heat cycling resulted in many of these GPUs dying far , far earlier than they were supposed to .
NVIDIA flatly denied it , saying that only a small batch of parts delivered to HP was affected by the problem .
Of course , now other notebook manufacturers like Dell and ASUS are also affected .
In fact , practically all notebooks using these GPUs are affected by the problem .
Their solution , though , was not to replace the GPUs .
Rather , they chose a simpler and certainly cheaper " solution " .
Instead of a costly recall , the affected notebook manufacturers sent out BIOS updates that set the internal fan to run at a higher speed and / or all the time , instead of only kicking at a certain temperature threshold .
However , this does not actually solve the problem because we are not talking about overheating GPUs here .
The problem really is about the thermal cycling that the GPUs go through .
To reduce the change in temperature , it is very likely that the BIOS update will also turn off or reduce the GPUs ' power management features so that the GPUs will run at a more stable , albeit higher , temperature .
Even so , such measures can only buy these companies time .
Perhaps that 's all they really care about .
As long as the GPU lasts until your warranty expires , they are in the clear .
Sad to say , it 's the consumer who gets it in the ass ...
AGAIN .
The G92 & G94 Too ?
Unfortunately , not only the G84 and G86 parts are affected .
According to the Inquirer , even G92 and G94 parts are failing as well .
It looks like NVIDIA " cut too many corners " when they developed these GPUs , resulting in GPUs that fail far earlier than they should .
If true , it is really very bad news , as the G92 and G94 are very popular parts , powering the GeForce 9800 GTX , the GeForce 9600 GT , the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB and the GeForce 8800 GT .
Thanks to some spin-doctoring of the issue , some people think that it 's related to the manufacturing process .
Just today , a friend asked me if the G98 part used a different fab process from the G84 and G86 GPUs .
Apparently , he was of the opinion that NVIDIA GPUs using a different fabrication process would not be affected by the problem .
Unfortunately , that is completely untrue .
As much as NVIDIA would like to lay the blame on TSMC ( the guys who actually fabricated the GPUs for them ) , the fabrication process is NOT the cause of the problem .
After all , TSMC makes a lot of other chips for other companies using the same process .
You do not see their other clients facing the same problem .
Obviously , the problem lies closer to home .

Since I posted on April 28 the article " Is There an Army Cover Up of the Rape and Murder of Women Soldiers , " the deaths of two more U.S. Army women in Iraq and Afghanistan have been listed as suicides �the Sept. 28 , 2007 , death of 30 - year - old Spc. Ciara Durkin and the Feb. 22 , 2008 , death of 25 - year - old Spc. Keisha Morgan .
Both " suicides " are disputed by the families of the women .
Since April 2008 , five more U.S. military women have died in Iraq �three in noncombat - related incidents .
Ninety - nine U.S. , six British and one Ukrainian military women and 13 U.S. female civilians have been killed in Iraq , Kuwait and Bahrain , as well as probably hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women and girls .
Of the 99 U.S. military women , 64 were in the Army active component , nine in the Army National Guard , seven in the Army Reserve , seven in the Marine Corps , nine in the Navy and three in the Air Force .
According to the Department of Defense , 41 of the 99 U.S. military women who have been killed in Iraq died in " noncombat - related incidents . "
Of the 99 U.S. military women killed in the Iraq theater , 41 were women of color ( 21 African - Americans , 16 Latinas , three of Asian - Pacific descent and one Native American�data compiled from the Web site www.nooniefortin.com).
Fourteen U.S. military women , including five in the Army , one in the Army National Guard , two in the Army Reserves , three in the Air Force , two in the Navy ( on ships supporting U.S. forces in Afghanistan ) and one in the Marine Corps , one British military woman and six U.S. civilian women have been killed in Afghanistan .
According to the Department of Defense , four U.S. military women in Afghanistan died in noncombat - related incidents , including one now classified as a suicide .
Four military women of color ( three African - Americans and one Latina ) have been killed in Afghanistan .
( Data compiled from www.nooniefortin.com.)
The deaths of 14 U.S. military ( 13 Army and one Navy ) women and one British military woman who served in Iraq , Kuwait or Afghanistan have been classified as suicides .
Two Army women in Iraq ( Pfc. Hannah Gunterman McKinney , a victim of vehicular homicide , and Pfc. Kamisha Block , who was shot five times by a fellow soldier who then killed himself ) and two Navy women in Bahrain ( MASN Anamarie Camacho and MASN Genesia Gresham , both shot by a male sailor who then shot , but did not kill , himself ) have died at the hands of fellow military personnel .
Several more military women have died with unexplained " noncombat " gunshot wounds ( U.S. Army Sgt. Melissa Valles , July 9 , 2003 : gunshot to the abdomen ; Marine Lance Cpl. Juana Arellano , April 8 , 2006 : gunshot wound to the head while in a " defensive position " ) .
Most of the deaths of women who have died of noncombat gunshot wounds have been classified as suicides , rather than homicides .
The Army , the only military service to release annual figures on suicides , reported that 115 soldiers committed suicide in 2007 .
According to Army figures , 32 soldiers committed suicide in Iraq and four in Afghanistan .
Of the 115 Army suicides , 93 were in the Regular Army and 22 were in the Army National Guard or Reserves .
The report lists five Army women as having committed suicide in 2007 .
Young , white , unmarried junior enlisted troops were the most likely to commit suicide , according to the report ( Pauline Jelinek , " Soldier suicides hit highest rate , 115 last year , " Associated Press , May 29 , 2008 , abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=4955043 ) .
From 2003 until August 2008 , the deaths of 13 Army women and one Navy woman in Iraq and Afghanistan ( including Kuwait and Bahrain ) have been classified as suicides ( numbers confirmed with various media sources ) : 2008 �Spc. Keisha Morgan ( Taji , Iraq )
2007 �Spc. Ciara Durkin ( Bagram , Afghanistan ) , Capt. ( medical doctor ) Roselle Hoffmaster ( Kirkik , Iraq )
2006 �Pfc. Tina Priest ( Taji , Iraq ) , Pfc. Amy Duerkson ( Taji , Iraq ) , Sgt. Denise Lannaman ( Kuwait ) , Sgt. Jeannette Dunn ( Taji , Iraq ) , Maj. Gloria Davis ( Baghdad ) .
2005 �Pvt. Lavena Johnson ( Balad , Iraq ) , 1st Lt. Debra Banaszak ( Kuwait ) , USN MA1 Jennifer Valdivia ( Bahrain )
2004 �Sgt. Gina Sparks ( it is unclear where in Iraq she was injured , but she died in the Fort Polk , La. , hospital )
2003 �Spc. Alyssa Peterson ( Tal Afar , Iraq ) , Sgt. Melissa Valles ( Balad , Iraq )
The demographics of those Army women who allegedly committed suicide are as intriguing as the circumstances of their deaths :
-- Seven of the women , being between the ages of 30 and 47 , were older than the norm ( Davis , 47 ; Lannaman , 46 ; Dunn , 44 ; Banaszak , 35 ; Hoffmaster , 32 ; Sparks , 32 ; and Durkin , 30 ) .
( Most military suicides are in their 20s ) .
-- Three were officers : a major ( Davis ) , a captain and medical doctor ( Hoffmaster ) and a first lieutenant ( Banaszak ) .
-- Five were noncommissioned officers ( Lannaman , Dunn , Sparks , Valles and Valdivia ) .
-- Five were women of color ( Morgan , Davis , Johnson , Lannaman , Valles ) .
-- Four were from units based at Fort Hood , Texas , and were found dead at Camp Taji , Iraq ( Dunn , Priest , Duerkson , and Morgan ) .
-- Two were found dead at Camp Taji , Iraq , 11 days apart ( Priest and Duerkson ) .
-- Two were found dead at Balad , Iraq ( Johnson and Valles ) .
-- Two had been raped ( Priest , 11 days prior to her death ; Duerksen , during basic training ) .
--
One other was probably raped ( Johnson , the night she died ) .
-- Two were lesbians ( Lannaman and Durkin ) .
--
Two of the women were allegedly involved in bribes or shakedowns of contractors ( Lannaman and Davis ) .
-- Two had children ( Davis and Banaszak ) .
-- Three had expressed concerns about improprieties or irregularities in their commands ( Durkin�s concerns were financial ; Davis had given a seven - page deposition on contracting irregularities in Iraq the day before she died ; Peterson was concerned about methods of interrogation of Iraqi prisoners ) .
-- Several had been in touch with their families within days of their deaths and had not expressed feelings of depression ( Morgan , Durkin , Davis , Priest , Johnson ) .
The Death of Lavena Johnson
As discussed in my article " Is There an Army Cover Up of Rape and Murder of Women Soldiers ? , " 19 - year - old Army Pvt. Lavena Johnson was found dead on the military base in Balad , Iraq , in July 2005 , and her death was characterized by the Army as suicide from an M - 16 rifle gunshot .
From the day their daughter�s body was returned to them , the parents , both of whom have had a long association with the Army �the father , a medical doctor , is an Army veteran and worked 25 years as a Department of the Army civilian and the mother , too , worked for the Department of the Army �harbored grave suspicions about the Army�s investigation into Johnson�s death and the Army�s characterization of her death as suicide .
As she had been in charge of a communications facility , Johnson was able to call home daily ; in those calls , she gave no indication of emotional problems or being upset .
In a letter to her parents after her death , Johnson�s commanding officer , Capt .
David Woods , wrote , " Lavena was clearly happy and seemed in very good health both physically and emotionally . "
In viewing his daughter�s body at the funeral home , Dr. John Johnson was concerned about the bruising on her face .
He was puzzled by the discrepancy in the autopsy report on the location of the gunshot wound .
As an Army veteran and a long - time Army civilian employee who had counseled veterans , he was mystified how the exit wound of an M - 16 shot could be so small .
The hole in Lavena�s head appeared to be more the size of a pistol shot rather than an M - 16 round .
But the gluing of military uniform white gloves onto Lavena�s hands , hiding burns on one of her hands , is what deepened Dr. Johnson�s concerns that the Army�s investigation into the death of his daughter was flawed .
Over the next two and a half years , Dr. and Mrs. Johnson and their family and friends , through the Freedom of Information Act and congressional offices , relentlessly and meticulously requested documents concerning Lavena�s death from the Department of the Army .
Gradually , with the Army�s response to each request for information , another piece of evidence about Johnson�s death emerged .
The military criminal investigator�s initial drawing of the death scene revealed that Johnson�s M16 was found perfectly parallel to her body .
The investigator�s sketch showed that her body was found inside a burning tent , under a wooden bench with an aerosol can nearby .
A witness , an employee of the defense contractor Kellogg , Brown & Root ( KBR ) , stated that he heard a gunshot and when he went to investigate , he found a KBR tent on fire .
When he looked into the tent , he saw a body .
The official Army investigation did not mention a fire , nor that Johnson�s body had been pulled from the fire .
KBR Women Employees Raped in Iraq
The fact that Lavena Johnson�s body was discovered in a KBR tent raises questions .
Many KBR women employees have been raped in Iraq .
One law firm in Houston has 15 clients with sexual assault , sexual harassment or retaliation complaints against Halliburton and its former subsidiary Kellogg , Brown & Root LLC ( KBR ) , as well as against the Cayman Island - based Service Employees International Inc. , a KBR shell company ( Karen Houppert , " Another KBR Rape Case , " The Nation , April 3 , 2008 ) .
Two female employees of KBR who were raped while in Iraq have testified before Congress .
On her fourth day in Iraq , July 28 , 2005 , Jamie Leigh Jones was gang - raped by seven fellow KBR employees at Camp Hope in Baghdad .
Jones� rape occurred nine days after Lavena Johnson was found dead in a KBR tent at Balad Air Base .
Jones was drugged , raped and beaten , and the injuries she suffered were so severe that she had to have reconstructive surgery on her chest ( " Democracy Now , " April 18 , 2008 , " Two Ex-KBR Employees Say They Were Raped by Co-Workers in Iraq , " www.democracynow.org/2008/4/8/exclusivein_their_first_joint_interview_two).
Jones reportedly was taken back to the KBR area , where she was placed into an empty shipping container under KBR armed guard for almost 24 hours without food or water or the ability to communicate with anyone .
The military doctor who examined her turned over the " rape kit " photographs and statement to KBR .
Jones persuaded a guard to allow her a phone call , which she made to her father .
Her father promptly called their Texas congressional representative , Ted Poe , who then called the State Department in Iraq and demanded her immediate release .
Jones was rescued shortly thereafter and quickly left Iraq .
Congressman
Poe again contacted the State Department and the Department of Justice in an effort to launch an investigation , but both departments ignored the requests and even refused to contact Poe for the next two years .
The " rape kit " and the photographs of and statement from Jones taken by a military doctor disappeared ( ABC News , " KBR Employees : Company Covered Up Sexual Assault and Harassment , " abcnews.go.com/Blotter/popup?id=3948132&contentIndex=1&start=false&page=1 ) .
Jones testified Dec. 17 , 2007 , before the House Judiciary Committee on " Enforcement of Federal Criminal Law to Protect Americans Working for U.S. Contractors in Iraq " ( judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_121907.html ) .
The nonprofit foundation Jones created after her ordeal , the Jamie Leigh Jones Foundation , has been contacted by 40 U.S. contractor employees alleging that they are the victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment on the job and that Halliburton , KBR and Service Employees International Inc. have not helped them or have obstructed their claims ( Karen Houppert , " Another KBR Rape Case , " The Nation , April 3 , 2008 ) .
Dawn Leamon was another civilian contractor employed by KBR who was raped allegedly by KBR employees .
She was the sole medical provider at Camp Harper , a base near Basra in southern Iraq .
Leamon reported being raped anally by a U.S. soldier in January 2008 while a KBR employee forced his penis into her mouth .
She says she was told to keep quiet by her KBR supervisor and by the military liaison officer .
Her laptop computer was seized within hours after she e-mailed a civilian lawyer .
She testified on April 9 , 2008 , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the hearing " Closing Legal Loopholes : Prosecuting Sexual Assaults and Other Violent Crimes Committed Overseas by American Civilians in a Combat Environment " ( foreign.senate.gov/hearings/2008/hrg080409a.html ) .
Johnsons � Quest Continues in Daughter�s Death
After two years of requesting documents , the family of Lavena Johnson received a set of papers from the Army that included a photocopy of a compact disk .
Wondering why the copy was among the documents , Dr. Johnson requested the CD itself .
The Army finally complied after a congressman intervened .
When Dr. Johnson viewed the CD , he was shocked to see photographs taken by Army investigators of his daughter�s body as it lay where her body had been found , as well as other photographs of her disrobed body taken during the investigation .
The photographs revealed that Lavena , barely five feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds , had been struck in the face with a blunt instrument , perhaps a weapon stock .
Her nose was broken and her teeth knocked backward .
One elbow was distended .
The back of her clothes contained debris , indicating she had been dragged .
The photographs of her disrobed body showed bruises , scratch marks and teeth imprints on the upper part of her body .
The right side of her back as well as her right hand had been burned , apparently from a flammable liquid poured on her and then lighted .
Photographs of her genital area revealed massive bruising and lacerations .
A corrosive liquid had been poured into her genital area , probably to destroy DNA evidence of sexual assault .
Despite the bruises , scratches , teeth imprints and burns on her body , Lavena was found completely dressed in the burning tent .
There was a blood trail from outside the contractor�s tent to inside the tent .
She apparently had been dressed after the attack and her attacker had placed her body in the tent before setting it on fire .
Investigator records reveal that members of her unit said Johnson had told them she was going jogging with friends on the other side of the base .
One unit member walked with her to the post exchange , where she bought a soda , and then , in her Army workout clothes , Johnson went on by herself to meet friends and to exercise .
The unit member said she was in good spirits , showing no indication of personal emotional problems .
The Army investigators initially concluded that Pvt. Johnson�s death was a homicide and indicated that on their paperwork .
However , a decision apparently was made by higher officials that the investigators would stop the homicide inquiry and classify her death a suicide .
Three weeks later , a final autopsy report from the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , dated Aug. 13 , 2005 , said the cause of death was an intraoral gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was a suicide .
However , the autopsy report�written after the July 22 , 2005 , autopsy at Dover Air Force Base and signed on Aug. 9 , 2005 by associate medical examiner Lt. Cmdr.
Edward Reedy and by chief deputy medical examiner Cmdr. James Caruso�states much more in its opinion section : " The 19 year old female , Lavena Johnson , died as a result of a gunshot wound of the head that caused injuries to the skull and brain .
The entrance wound was inside the mouth and injuries to the lips and oral mucosa were a direct result of the discharge of the weapon .
The exit wound was located on the left side of the head .
No bullet or bullet fragments were recovered .
Toxicology was negative for alcohol and other screened drugs .
The investigative information made available indicates that this was a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
With the information surrounding the circumstances of the death that is presently available the manner of death is determined to be suicide . "
The medical examiners revealed that they were basing their determination of suicide on " investigative information made available indicat[ing ] that this was a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " not from medical evidence .
They did not address what caliber of bullet entered her body �in fact , they stated that no bullet or bullet fragment was recovered , and they did not offer comments on what caliber of bullet would have made the entry and exit wounds .
The Aug. 25 , 2005 , report from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory in Forest Park , Ga. , stated :
The characteristic gunshot residue particle indicated on Exhibit 5 ( Gunshot residue kit ( Item 9 , Doc 775-05 ) , the number is considered insignificant .
Based on these results , the report concludes that the following possibilities exist , but the report makes no conclusion :
a . The subject did not handle / discharge a firearm .
b . The subject handled / discharged a firearm but an insignificant number of gunshot residue particles were deposited on the hands .
c. The subject handled / discharged a firearm that deposited a significant number of gunshot residue particles on the hand ; however , due to washing , wiping , or other activity , the particles were reduced to insignificant numbers .
The medical examiners who did the autopsy on Johnson�s body did not mention any burns on her body , but when the family had gloves that had been glued onto her hands cut off by the funeral home employees in Missouri , they found her hands had been burned , and further examination showed her back was burned .
A witness statement taken on July 19 , 2005 , states : " The witness [ name redacted ] ... found the victim under the bench and verified there were no signs of life ... related he saw the M16 lying across the victim�s body ... he didn�t know what setting the weapon was on ... he related everything was smoking , including parts of the body .
He called for an ambulance and secured the scene . "
On April 9 , 2008 , Johnson�s parents flew from their home in St. Louis for meetings with members of Congress and their staff .
They again went to Washington , D.C. , in July 2008 and were briefed by Army investigators and the military medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Lavena .
The Army briefers maintained that her death was a suicide and were unable to answer Dr. John and Linda Johnson�s long list of questions .
The Johnsons are asking for a congressional hearing that would force the Army to further investigate their daughter�s death .
Murder of Three Women in North Carolina Some of the circumstances surrounding Lavena Johnson�s death in Iraq three years ago are similar to those of other American servicewomen who died in recent months .
In the six months from December 2007 to July 2008 , three U.S. military women were killed by military males near the Army�s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps� Camp Lejeune , two mega - bases in North Carolina .
Two of the women were in the Army .
Spc. Megan Touma was seven months pregnant when her body was found inside a Fayetteville hotel room June 21 , 2008 .
A married male soldier whom she knew in Germany has since been arrested .
The estranged Marine husband of Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc has been arrested in her death and the burning of her body .
Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach had been raped in May 2007 and protective orders had been issued against the alleged perpetrator , fellow Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean .
The burned body of Lauterbach and her unborn baby were found in a shallow grave in the backyard of Laurean�s home in January 2008 .
Laurean fled to Mexico , where he was captured by Mexican authorities .
He is currently awaiting extradition to the United States to stand trial .
Lauterbach�s mother testified before Congress on July 31 , 2008 , that the Marine Corps ignored warning signs that Laurean was a danger to her daughter ( testimony of Mary Lauterbach to the National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , nationalsecurity.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080731134039.pdf ) .
Two Women Sexually Assaulted Before Their Deaths Remarkably , a rape test was not performed on the body of Lavena Johnson although bruising and lacerations in her genital area indicated assault .
Another family that does not believe their daughter committed suicide in Iraq is the family of Pfc. Tina Priest , 20 , of Smithville , Texas , who was reported raped by a fellow soldier in February of 2006 on a military base known as Camp Taji .
Priest was a part of the 5th Support Battalion , lst Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division from Fort Hood , Texas .
The Army said Priest was found dead in her room on March 1 , 2006 , of a self - inflicted M - 16 shot , 11 days after the rape .
Priest�s mother , Joy Priest , disputes the Army�s findings .
Mrs. Priest said she talked several times with her daughter after the rape and that Tina , while very upset about the rape , was not suicidal .
Mrs. Priest continues to challenge the Army�s 800 pages of investigative documents with a simple question :
How could her five - foot - tall daughter , with a correspondingly short arm length , have held the M - 16 at the angle which would have resulted in the gunshot ?
The Army attempted several explanations , but each was debunked by Mrs. Priest and by the 800 pages of materials provided by the Army itself .
The Army now says Tina used her toe to pull the trigger of the weapon that killed her .
The Army reportedly never investigated Tina�s death as a homicide , only as a suicide .
According to Tina�s mother , rape charges against the soldier whose sperm was found on Tina�s sleeping bag were dropped a few weeks after her death .
He was convicted of failure to obey an order and sentenced to forfeiture of $ 714 for two months , 30 days � restriction to the base and 45 days of extra duty .
On May 11 , 2006 , 10 days after Tina Priest was found dead , 19 - year - old Army Pfc. Amy Duerksen was found dead at the same Camp Taji .
Duerksen died three days after she suffered what the Army called " a self - inflicted gunshot . "
The Army claimed that she , too , had committed suicide .
In the room where her body was found , investigators reportedly discovered her diary open to a page on which she had written about being raped during training after unknowingly ingesting a date - rape drug .
The person Duerkson identified in her diary as the rapist was charged by the Army with rape after her death .
Many who knew her did not believe she shot herself , but there is no evidence of a homicide investigation by the Army .
Women Had Concerns About Job Irregularities
Three women whose deaths have been classified as suicides had expressed concerns about improprieties or irregularities in their military commands .
Army Spc. Ciara Durkin , 30 , a Massachusetts National Guard payroll clerk , was found dead on Sept. 28 , 2007 , from a gunshot wound to the head .
She had gotten off work 90 minutes earlier and was found lying near a chapel on Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
Durkin had called her brother just hours before she died , leaving an upbeat happy birthday message on his telephone .
In previous conversations , Durkin told her sister that she had discovered something in the finance unit that she did not agree with and that she had made some enemies over it .
She told her sister to keep investigating her death if anything happened to her ( " How did Specialist Ciara Durkin Die ? " CBSNews , Oct. 4 , 2007 , cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/04/world/main3328739.shtml ) .
In June 2008 , the Army declared her death a suicide .
Army interrogator Spc. Alyssa Renee Peterson , 27 , assigned to C Company , 311th Military Intelligence Battalion , 101st Airborne Division , Fort Campbell , Ky. , was an Arabic linguist who reportedly was very concerned about the manner in which interrogations of detained Iraqis were being conducted .
She died on Sept. 15 , 2003 , near Tal Afar , Iraq , in what the Army described as a gunshot wound to the head , a noncombat , self - inflicted weapons discharge , or suicide .
Peterson had reportedly objected to the interrogation techniques used on prisoners in Iraq and refused to participate after only two nights working in the unit known as " the cage . "
Members of her unit have refused to describe the specific interrogation techniques to which Peterson objected .
The military says that all records of those techniques have now been destroyed .
After refusing to conduct more interrogations , Peterson was assigned to guard the base gate , where she monitored Iraqi guards .
She was also sent to suicide prevention training .
Army investigators concluded she shot and killed herself with her service rifle on the night of Sept. 15 , 2003 .
Family members challenge the Army�s conclusion .
Maj .
Gloria Davis , 47 , an 18 - year Army veteran , mother and grandmother , was found dead of a gunshot wound on Dec. 12 , 2006 , the day after she reportedly talked at length to an Army investigator about corruption in military contracting .
She had been accused of accepting a $ 225,000 bribe from Lee Dynamics , a defense contractor that provided warehouse space for the storage of automatic weapons in Iraq ( Eric Schmitt and James Glanz , " U.S. Says Company Bribes Officers for Work in Iraq , " New York Times , Aug. 31 , 2007 ) .
Davis� mother , Annie Washington , told the author that military investigators have never located any of the $ 225,000 Davis is alleged to have taken .
Washington said her daughter was right - handed and would have had a hard time holding the weapon in her left hand and shooting herself on the left side of her head ( telephone conversation between Ann Wright and Annie Washington , July 2008 ) .
Federal court documents show that the Army suspended Lee Dynamics from contracting on July 9 , 2007 , over allegations that the company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to numerous U.S. officers in Iraq and Kuwait in 2004 and 2005 to get contracts to build , operate and maintain warehouses in Iraq where weapons , uniforms and vehicles for the Iraqi military were stored .
Reportedly included in the documents was a seven - page statement by an Army investigator who questioned Maj .
Davis the day before she was found dead in her quarters .
The deposition has apparently been used in ongoing federal cases on corruption in military contracting ( Ed Blanche , " Kickbacks , Weapons and Suicide : The US Army�s Battle With Corruption , " March 15 , 2008 , kippreport.com/article.php?articleid=1056&page=1 ) .
The author attempted to obtain a copy of Davis� statement from the Department of Justice , but a DoJ public affairs officer said the statement is not yet in the public domain and intimated that it is being used in other ongoing DoJ investigations into contracting fraud ( telephone conversation on July 28 , 2008 , with DoJ public affairs officer ) .
The Lee Dynamics warehouses were part of a circle of corruption involving military personnel and contractors throughout Iraq and the disappearance of 190,000 U.S. - supplied weapons � 110,000 AK - 47 assault rifles and 80,000 pistols intended for Iraqi security forces for which the U.S. military cannot account .
A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report said that until December 2005 the U.S. - Iraqi training command had no centralized records on weapons provided to Iraqi forces , and although 185,000 AK - 47 rifles , 170,000 pistols , 215,000 sets of body armor and 140,000 steel helmets had been issued by September 2005 , because of poor record keeping it was unclear what happened to 110,000 AK - 47s and 80,000 pistols and more than half the armor and helmets ( GAO Report 07 - 711 , Stabilizing Iraq : DOD Cannot Ensure That U.S. - Funded Equipment Has Reached Iraqi Security Forces , July 2007 , Pages 14 and 15 , gao.gov/new.items/d07711.pdf ) .
In December 2007 , the U.S. military acknowledged that it had lost track of an additional 12,000 weapons , including more than 800 machine guns ( Ed Blanche , " Kickbacks , Weapons and Suicide : The US Army�s Battle With Corruption , " March 15 , 2008 , kippreport.com/article.php?articleid=1056&page=1 ) .
In 2005 , Col .
Ted Westhusing , 44 , at the time the highest - ranking officer to die in Iraq , allegedly committed suicide after reportedly becoming despondent about the poor performance of private contractors who were training Iraqi police , for which he was responsible .
After graduating third in his West Point class and serving as the honor captain for the entire academy his senior year , Westhusing became one of the Army�s leading scholars on military ethics and was a professor at West Point .
In January 2005 Westhusing began supervising the training of Iraqi forces to take over security duties from the U.S. military .
He oversaw the Virginia - based USIS , a private security contractor , which had contracts worth $ 79 million to train a corps of Iraqi police to conduct special - operations missions .
Westhusing was upset about allegations , in a four - page anonymous letter , that USIS deliberately shorted the Iraqi government on the number of trainers it provided in order to increase its profit margin .
The letter also revealed two incidents in which USIS contractors allegedly had witnessed or participated in the killing of Iraqi civilians .
After an angry counseling meeting with the contractor , Westhusing was found dead of a gunshot wound .
Many of Westhusing�s professional colleagues question the Army�s ruling of suicide , despite the note found in his quarters .
They point out that Westhusing did not have a bodyguard and was surrounded by the same contractors he suspected of wrongdoing .
They also question why the USIS company manager who discovered Westhusing �s body was not tested for gunpowder residue .
In the space of three months in 2006 , three members of the U.S. Army who had been part of a contracting and logistics group in Kuwait and Iraq were accused of taking bribes from contractors and allegedly committed suicide .
Two of them were women , Maj. Gloria Davis and Sgt. Denise Lannaman , and the third was Lt. Col. Marshall Gutierrez .
In August 2006 Gutierrez was arrested at a restaurant in Kuwait and was accused of shaking down a laundry contractor for a $ 3,400 bribe .
He was allowed to return to his quarters and was found dead on Sept. 4 , 2006 , with an empty bottle of prescription sleeping pills and an open container of what appeared to be antifreeze .
The second woman soldier who was allegedly involved with bribes and allegedly committed suicide was New York Army National Guard Sgt. Denise A. Lannaman .
Lannaman , 46 , had completed one tour in Tikrit , Iraq , in 2005 .
In December 2005 she decided to volunteer to stay in Iraq longer and took an assignment at a desk job at a procurement office in Camp Arifjan , Kuwait , that purchased millions of dollars in supplies .
She received excellent performance ratings , and her supervisor said that her oversight eliminated misuse of funds by 36 percent .
On Oct. 1 , 2006 , Lannaman was questioned by a senior officer about the death of Lt. Col .
Gutierrez and was reportedly told by that officer that she was implicated in the contracting fraud and would be leaving the military in disgrace .
She was found in a jeep dead of a gunshot later that day .
The Army has classified Lannaman�s death as a suicide .
A member of her family said that Lannaman had a history of psychiatric problems but somehow been allowed to enlist in the military .
She had attempted suicide four times in her life , according to the family member .
In September 2007 , Army spokesman Lt. Col.
William Wiggins told the family that Lannaman had not been the subject of any contract investigations , but he said he could not say whether Lannaman had been threatened by a superior officer with dismissal from the service ( Jim Dwyer , " Letter from America : Journey from New York to Kuwait , and Suicide , " New York Times , Sept. 19 , 2007 ) .
Lannaman�s family said that because of her pre-existing mental state , the threat that the superior officer made to send her home in disgrace could have caused her to take her life .
Soldiers Convicted of Bribery
In June 2008 four persons plead guilty in bribery and kickback scandals concerning military contracts in Iraq .
On June 11 , 2008 , recently retired Army National Guard Col.
Levonda Joey Selph , a key person on Gen. David Petraeus� team that was training and equipping Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy .
She admitted disclosing to the owner of Lee Dynamics International confidential bidding information about a $ 12 - million contract for building and operating U.S. military warehouses in Iraq that stored automatic weapons and other equipment .
Lee Dynamics International is the same company that reportedly gave Maj .
Davis a $ 225,000 bribe .
Col .
Selph helped the company owner , a former Army pay clerk , to submit " fake bid packages on behalf of six companies he controlled to create a false sense of competition , " for which she was given a trailer valued at $ 20,000 ; she eventually returned the trailer , and the contractor then gave her $ 4,000 in cash and paid for air fare and accommodations for a trip to Thailand in October 2005 , valued at about $ 5,000 .
Selph has since agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 9,000 and could serve a prison sentence of up to two years ( Eric Schmitt , " Guilty Plea Given in Iraq Contract Fraud , " New York Times , June 11 , 2008 ) .
After having been in military custody since July 2007 , Army Maj .
John Cockerham , 43 , pleaded guilty last January to bribery , conspiracy and money laundering in awarding illegal contracts for supplies such as bottled water .
He had received more than $ 9 million in bribes from at least eight defense contractor companies , and records found in his home indicated he expected to get $ 5.4 million more .
Melissa Cockerham , Cockerham�s wife , also pleaded guilty to money laundering .
Their plea bargains were kept under federal court seal until June 25 , 2008 , while they cooperated with investigators .
Cockerham faces up to 40 years in prison , while his wife could face up to 20 years in prison ( Dana Hedgpeth , " 2 Plead Guilty to Army Bribery Scheme , " Washington Post , June 25 , 2008 ) .
The Death of Spc. Keisha Morgan Army Spc. Keisha Morgan , 25 , was on her second tour in Iraq .
Just days before her February 22 , 2008 , death , she called her mother , Diana Morgan , and happily told her that she had reenlisted .
Her mother said that Keisha wanted to be a nurse and planned to fulfill that ambition after she got out of the Army .
Assigned to the Fourth Infantry Division , Fort Hood , Texas , Keisha reportedly suffered two seizures in her barracks at Camp Taji and died in a military hospital in Bagdad .
The Army reportedly told Keisha�s mother that Keisha was on antidepressants and may have overdosed .
In a blog , Keisha�s mother said her daughter had never mentioned being on antidepressants .
However , the Army reportedly frequently prescribes antidepressants to soldiers with anxiety from effects of war , and one of the known side effects of some of the depressants is seizures .
The Army�s fifth Mental Health Advisory Team report indicates that , according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops taken in the fall of 2007 , about 12 percent of combat troops in Iraq and 17 percent of those in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants ( such as Prozac and Zoloft ) or sleeping pills ( such as Ambien ) to help them cope , with about 50 percent taking antidepressants and 50 percent taking prescription sleeping pills .
In 2007 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the warning on antidepressants that the drugs may increase the risk of suicide in children and young adults ages 18 to 24 , the age group most taking prescribed drugs in the Army .
The Army should question whether there is a link between the increased use of the drugs by military troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and the rising suicide rate , which is now double the Army�s suicide rate in 2001 .
Deception or Just Incompetence ?
It �s now well known that there was deception by the U.S. military in the friendly fire death of Pat Tillman and the decision to make a heroic character out of Pvt. Jessica Lynch ( oversight.house.gov/documents/20080714111050.pdf ) .
But there are many other cases of deception and of misinformation given to families .
After much pressure from the families for more information on the deaths of their sons in 2004 , the parents of Army Spc. Patrick McCaffery and 1st Lt. Andre Tyson were finally told by the Army two years after the death of their sons that they were not killed by insurgents but by Iraqi army recruits with whom they were training and patrolling ( democracynow.org/2006/6/23/army_lies_to_mother_of_slain ) .
The parents of Spc. Jesse Buryj were initially told their son died in an accident .
After relentless pressure on the Army for a copy of the autopsy , his mother read that Buryj had died of a gunshot wound .
She had to request through the Freedom of Information
Act a copy of the incident report , which states he was killed by friendly fire from coalition Polish troops .
And later a soldier from Buryj�s unit came to her home and told her he had been killed by " one of our own troops " ( democracynow.org/2006/3/15/sunshine_week_newspapers_and_broadcasters_challenge ) .
Karen Meredith had to request the report on the May 30 , 2004 , death of her son , 1st Lt. Ken Ballard , through the Freedom of Information Act .
Ballard did not die in a firefight with insurgents as she was originally told ( arlingtoncemetery.net/kmballard.htm ) .
He actually died in an accident when a branch fell on a tank in which he was riding and set off an unmanned gun ( mydd.com/story /2005/9/12/14492/7912 ) .
On Sept. 9 , 2005 , Meredith met with an Army colonel in the Pentagon and received a letter of apology from the Army for its misinformation on her son�s death .
On Sept. 27 , 2005 , she met with Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey and asked him to promise that soldiers � families would promptly be told the truth about casualties .
As the Beaumont , Texas , newspaper the Enterprise stated in its June 20 , 2008 , editorial , " There is no excuse for the U.S. Army�s shabby treatment of Kamisha Block�s parents and others who cared for her .
Her commanders knew right away that she had been killed by a fellow soldier in Iraq , who had been harassing her .
It was a standard murder - suicide .
Incredibly , the Army first told her parents that it was an accidental death due to friendly fire . "
A few days later , the Army changed its story and told the parents of Spc. Block that their daughter had been murdered by a shot to the chest .
At the funeral home in Vidor , Texas , Block�s mother noticed her daughter had a wound to her head , not mentioned by the Army .
Six months later , after numerous phone calls to the Army and enlisting help from Congressman Kevin Brady , Block�s family was told by the Army that she had been murdered by a fellow soldier in her unit , a man who had physically assaulted her three times .
His unit had disciplined him once but kept him in the same unit where he assaulted Block two other times before he murdered her by firing five shots into her and then killing himself in the same barracks room .
After many attempts , the parents finally received a 1,200 - page investigation that gave the name of the murderer .
Our Soldiers � Families Deserve Better
The families of slain soldiers deserve the truth about how they served and how they died .
A professional military should handle each case with utmost care and concern .
Tragically , in the past seven years , too many families have been faced with unanswered questions and a military bureaucracy that closes ranks against those who are trying to find answers .
I appeal to those in our military who know how these women died to come forward .
Hopefully , the House Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee , chaired by Rep. Susan Davis , ( 202 ) 225-2040 , will hold hearings on military suicides in the next two months and provide protection from retaliation for those willing to testify .

Alltel , the fifth largest US mobile operator , is strong in rural areas Verizon Wireless has said that it is buying Alltel in a deal worth $ 28.1 bn making it the largest mobile phone network in the US , overtaking AT&T .
Verizon Wireless - which is 45 % owned by Vodafone - is paying $ 5.9bn for the firm and taking on $ 22.2 bn of debt .
The deal comes about seven months after Alltel was bought by TPG Capital and GS Capital Partners for $ 27.5 bn .
The combined company would have more than 80 million subscribers , with Alltel focused mainly in rural areas .
Consolidation trend Analysts said that the deal could be a sign of wider consolidation in the sector , coming on the day that France Telecom made a proposed offer for Swedish firm Teliasoneria , which was rebuffed as too low .
This is a way of getting growth from a market that 's becoming fully saturated

See Vodafone shares See Verizon shares UK - based Vodafone has been under pressure from some investors to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless and focus on markets in Asia and Europe .
But outgoing chief executive Arun Sarin has always insisted that Vodafone has no plans to sell its stake , citing the potential for further growth in the US .
Welcoming the Alltel deal , Mr Sarin said it would " reinforce " Verizon Wireless ' leading position in the US market , with annual sales of more than $ 52bn .
The market appeared to welcome the deal , with shares in Verizon rising more than 6 % and Vodafone gaining 3.5 % .
" This is a way of getting growth from a market that 's becoming fully saturated and beginning to slow down in growth , " said Joseph Bonner , analyst at Argus Research .

Rumor : Dead Rising confirmed for the PS3 ?
On comment # 121 of the official Playstation Blog , John Diamonon replys to a comment talking about Dead Rising for the PS3 , stating " You have n't seen the last of Dead Rising . "
Could this be an unofficial announcement that Dead Rising is indeed coming to the PS3 ?
While many know Capcom supports multiplatform games and has a Dead Rising Wii version coming soon , can this only mean that its coming to the PS3 also ?
I worried what this momentous night would bring .
In the event I think it was somewhere between bad and disastrous for President Trump .
The most important fact about this debate is that going into it President Trump was clearly behind .
He needed to shift the dynamic of the race , force some major error , introduce some new factor .
That did n’t happen .
I saw nothing tonight that seems at all likely to improve things for President Trump .
Nothing .
Biden did fine .
Not great .
But fine .
I ’d say he had a B performance with some B+ or even A- minus moments .
But for him that ’s fine .
He ’s ahead .
He ’s not running as best debater .
He ’s not running as most dynamic figure .
He ’s not competing for most unstable affect .
He ’s running as the guy who will end the nightmare .
If that ’s the goal he turned in just the right performance .
The Phoenix Mars mission has found water in a soil sample after spending the last two months examining the red planet for evidence that it could support life , NASA scientists said today .
The spacecraft 's robotic arm has dug several trenches in the Martian soil near the planet 's north pole and been heating soil samples in a series of small " ovens . "
It had earlier spotted chunks outside the rover that scientists had identified as ice , but data sent back by the most recent soil sample for the first time showed water inside Mars ' dirt , researchers said .
" We 've seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the Mars Odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by Phoenix last month , but this is the first time Martian water has been touched and tasted , " University of Arizona scientist William Boynton said .
Phoenix had also earlier identified minerals necessary for life in soil samples .
Being a philosopher requires you to engage in the practice of relentless inquiry about everything , so it ’s not surprising that Jolley has spent untold hours puzzling over how to best teach the discipline itself .
What he has decided is that philosophy can’t be taught  or learned  like other academic subjects .
To begin with , it takes longer .
“ Plato said that you become a philosopher by spending ‘ much time ’ in sympathy with other philosophers , ” he told me .
“ Much time .
I take that very seriously . ”
We were sitting in his office , which was dark with academic books and journals ; a large paperweight reading “ Think ” sat amid the clutter on his desk .
“ Plato , ” he went on , “ talked about it as a process of ‘ sparking forth , ’ that as you spend more time with other philosophers , you eventually catch the flame .
That ’s how I think about teaching philosophy . ”
Image Credit ... Jessica Nelson / Minneapolis College of Art and Design
Jolley says he thinks of his relationships with his students less as teacher - student than as master - apprentice .
His goal , as he sees it , is n’t to teach students about philosophy ; it is to show them what it means to think philosophically , to actually be a philosopher .
When the approach works , the effect can be significant .
Several years ago , a student named Zack Loveless wandered into one of Jolley ’s classes and very nearly dropped it after the first day .
“ I was expecting a survey course , and in walks this big scary guy , using words I ’d never heard before , talking about Hume as background for Kant , telling us how hard the class was going to be , ” Loveless told me .
Loveless , who grew up in a working - class home in a small town in Alabama , stuck with the course and soon switched his major from psychology to philosophy .
He took at least one class with Jolley for each of his remaining semesters at Auburn and did several independent projects with him and is now getting a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Chicago .
He describes Jolley as more of a collaborator than a professor ; rather than answer his questions , Loveless said , Jolley tried to work through philosophical problems with him .
Jolley is always on the lookout for students with a philosophical bent , and has urged his colleagues to recruit aggressively as well .
While I was at Auburn , he introduced me to one of the department ’s current top prospects for graduate school , a rising senior named Benjamin Pierce .
Jolley told me that Pierce ’s gift for reasoning was first identified a couple of years ago in an entry - level logic class .
“ If A is greater than B , and B is greater than C , then A is greater than C , ” the professor said , introducing the so - called transitive relation .
“ Not in rock , paper , scissors , ” Pierce volunteered .
Pierce is now majoring in philosophy .
“ We have high hopes for him , ” Jolley told me with the pride of a football coach talking up a strong tackler with great open - field speed .
“ I would bet that he ends up in a Top 10 graduate program . ”
Jolley grew up in Gallipolis , Ohio , a small town in the Appalachian Mountains .
He first felt the tug of the philosophical life during his freshman year in high school , when a teacher gave him a copy of Plato ’s dialogues .
An intellectually unfocused but precocious student , Jolley instantly took to the challenge of wrestling with such a difficult text .
“ Until then , I ’d been clever enough to do whatever I wanted to do , to read with one eye , ” he told me .
“ Then all of a sudden I ran into philosophy , and it was like running into a brick wall . ”
But it was the substance of Plato ’s meditations  the radical nature of the philosopher ’s quest for self - knowledge  that really grabbed hold of Jolley .
This was partly a function of his religious upbringing .
His parents attended a Church of Christ three times a week .
Listening to all those sermons about heaven and hell turned Jolley inward , made him wonder about what kind of person he was .
But the church , he felt , had n’t given him the tools he needed to grapple with that question .
Philosophy did .
“ I ’ve never been able to shake the feeling that the old Delphic instruction , know thyself , applied to me , ” he said .
It ’s hard to know what sort of rough music
Could send our forgetfulness back into the ground ,
From which the gravediggers pulled it years ago .
The first moment of the day we court forgetfulness .
Even when we are fully awake , a century can
Go by in the space of a single heartbeat .
The life we lose through forgetfulness resembles
The earth that sticks to the sides of plowshares
And the eggs the hen has abandoned in the woods .
A thousand gifts were given to us in the womb .
We lost hundreds during the forgetfulness of birth ,
And we lost the old heaven on the first day of school .
Forgetfulness resembles the snow that weighs down
The fir boughs ; behind our house you ’ll find
A forest going on for hundreds of miles .
Robert , it ’s to your credit that you remember
So many lines of Rilke , but the purpose of forgetfulness
Is to remember the last time we left this world .
Pictured :
The incredible ' Stone Nudes ' who rock climb completely naked
It is a breathtaking - and death - defying feat - which redefines the term extreme sport .
Battling both gravity and the elements , the climber claws her way up a granite boulder by just her fingertips .
For most , the lack of ropes and safety equipment would be a perilous step too far .
But this woman has gone even further and abandoned her clothes to take part in the new sport of naked rock climbing
Death defying : The Stone Nudes abandon equipment , clothes and shoes in a bid to capture the ' true essence of the climbing spirit '
The climber is one of a series of super - fit ' Stone Nudes ' captured in action on the cliffs and mountains of America .
Without clothes , specialist shoes or other equipment , participants say the experience captures the ' true essence of the climbing spirit . '
It is the latest extreme sport craze to sweep the US , and is now tipped to become a popular pastime in the UK .
Incredible :
One of the women attempts a tricky overhang , clinging on by just her fingertips and toes
And as these incredible pictures taken in America show , exercise has never been so attractive .
The ' Stone Nudes ' idea is the brainchild of California - based photographer and rock climber Dean Fidelman .
His photographs have now been used to create a new 2009 ' Stone Nudes ' calendar , which he is selling on his website .
Fearless :
The sport is a hit in America and is expected to take off in Britain
Dean said : ' This kind of climbing is the sport at its purest , and is intended to inspire and celebrate the human form .
' It requires no equipment which means climbers of all abilities can take part .
' Hundreds of people are now participating in a sport that captures the true essence of the climbing spirit . '
Unconventional : Naked rock climbers view their hobby as the purest form of the sport
Jason Fried ( left ) and David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals helped develop much of the software that has enabled Web 2.0 . *
Photo : Jessica Wynne *
To the 300 software developers packed into a Vancouver conference room , David Heinemeier Hansson was more than a programmer .
He was a visionary , the creator of Ruby on Rails , a software template that powered an increasing number of hot Internet applications .
He was a philosopher - king whose minimalist ethos suggested a new way of thinking about business and software .
And he was a celebrity , with boyish good looks , precocious self - possession , and fans who invoked his name so frequently they used his initials as shorthand : DHH .
As Hansson took the stage at the British Columbia Institute of Technology for this , the first Ruby on Rails conference , the room was filled with the kind of giddy excitement that greets the opening chords of a Hannah Montana concert .
The program billed Hansson 's keynote as a collection of " beloved rants " and " favorite tales from the land of righteous indignation , " and he did n't disappoint .
He began by congratulating the nascent Ruby on Rails community ( and , by extension , himself ) , citing a litany of impressive achievements : 500,000 downloads of the code , 16 how - to books , mentions in Wired and other publications , and several industry awards — including , for Hansson , the prestigious Hacker of the Year title , bestowed by Google and O'Reilly Media .
But not everyone was convinced of Rails ' revolutionary potential .
Critics had been saying that Rails was n't versatile enough , that it could n't handle large amounts of traffic , and that Hansson himself was arrogant .
" Arrogant is usually something you hurl at somebody as an insult , " Hansson said .
" But when I actually looked it up — having an aggravated sense of one 's own importance or abilities ' — I thought , sure . "
Then he clicked over to the next slide , white letters against a dark background that spelled out his response to the naysayers : fuck you .
The crowd erupted into laughter and applause .
Hansson 's programmer - with - a - messiah - complex shtick may be a hoary cliché .
But in the nearly two years since he delivered this presentation , he and his partners at software developer 37 signals have backed up the big talk .
Rails has continued its run of popularity ; over the years , tens of thousands of programmers have used it to create countless online applications , including podcasting service Odeo and microblogging phenomenon Twitter .
And Basecamp , 37signals ' Rails - powered , easy - to - use online collaboration software , boasts more than 2 million account holders .
Signal vs. Noise , the 37signals blog , pulls in 75,000 readers a day .
Hansson and 37signals cofounder Jason Fried are " revered , " says business author Seth Godin .
" They are as close as we get to demigods online . "
What 's more , the pair 's once - heretical vision — that there is beauty and wisdom in Web - hosted , bite - size software built to accomplish narrow tasks — has become conventional wisdom .
In the two years since Hansson 's keynote , Google released Apps , the relatively feature - free alternative to Microsoft 's bulky Office suite ; Facebook opened its platform to independent developers , unleashing a stream of mini-applications that offer everything from playlist - swapping to Boggle bouts ; Salesforce.com 's AppExchange gave corporate software developers a platform for selling tiny , downloadable programs ; widget wunderkinds like Slide 's Max Levchin and RockYou 's Lance Tokuda became Web celebrities ; and venture capitalists opened their wallets in the hunt for the next little thing .
" Simplicity is the most important thing in technology , " says Paul Graham , cofounder of early - stage venture firm Y Combinator .
" And it 's only getting more important . "
None of this has helped Hansson discover any hidden wellsprings of modesty .
He has called Microsoft " entirely optional , " referred to Java as " grossly overused , " and described Flash applications as " horrid . "
But if Hansson has n't changed much , neither has the programming framework he created or the business he heads .
For some , that 's a problem .
Hansson and Fried have steadfastly refused to grow their company , beef up their products , or explain their plans for the future .
Now , critics argue , the pair 's reactionary embrace of all things minimal has made their products less useful and could cost them influence , customers , and millions of dollars .
Hansson has a predictable response to such charges .
" I do n't usually go around saying ' Fuck you ' to everyone I meet , " he says .
" But sometimes it's the appropriate answer . "
The defining characteristic of Ruby on Rails is , as the name suggests , speed .
Using Rails , an adept programmer can create a simple blogging application in 15 minutes or a photo database in five .
Two guys built Twitter in two weeks .
In exchange for that speed , programmers accept a Hansson - knows - best approach to software design .
While most programming languages require coders to build every new application from scratch , Rails gives developers a set of configurations that lets them bypass the busywork .
That makes Rails ideal for quickly creating lean , sparsely designed Web - based applications , which coincidentally enough is exactly what Fried and Hansson think software should look like : as Fried puts it , " stripped down to the absolute bare necessities . "
Fried developed his theory of streamlined software design in 1994 as a junior at the University of Arizona .
He was looking for a simple database program to catalog his music collection .
" I downloaded a bunch and they all sucked , " Fried says .
Instead of focusing on the relatively easy task , they were overloaded with options that only complicated the process .
" I said , I can make this way better . ' "
So he created his own program , dubbed Audiofile , and peddled it as $ 20 - a - pop shareware , earning enough to keep himself in beer money .
After college , Fried returned to his native Chicago , where he formed 37signals — a Web design firm , named in esoteric reference to SETI — and posted a manifesto on his homepage that railed against the shortcomings of most software .
( " The Web should empower , not frustrate , " he wrote .
" Just because you can does n't mean you should . " )
On his protoblog , Signal vs. Noise , he further developed his philosophy .
" Remember — size does matter : A small group of 10 great people will outproduce , outwork , outthink a large group of 50 average people . "
Fried 's missives struck a throbbing nerve , and before long Signal vs. Noise was drawing a dedicated readership of programmers and designers similarly fed up with bulky , inelegant code and enthralled by Fried 's edicts .
It was through his blog that Fried met Hansson :
In 2002 Hansson , then a student at Copenhagen Business School , provided some programming advice after Fried posted a question about the best way to handle pagination using a programming language called PHP .
The two became fast friends .
" Our outlook was the same , " Fried says : " Keep it simple . "
So when Fried wanted an online collaboration tool for his employees , he again turned to Hansson .
Working 10 hours a week over four months , Hansson wrote the code to support Fried 's spare , airy interface .
Hansson used a little - known language named Ruby — which most developers felt was too slow and limited to be of much use — and developed a series of shortcuts to help him build the program quickly and easily .
The result was Basecamp , a lean but effective platform requiring no costly servers , tricky installations , or technical support .
Although he 'd developed it for in - house use , Fried realized the commercial potential of the program after showing it to friends and clients who wanted an inexpensive and simple way for small teams to work together .
When he released Basecamp in February 2004 , Fried expected the monthly subscription fees , which today range from $ 12 to $ 149 , to generate sales of $ 5,000 a month by the end of Basecamp 's first year ; they reached that target in six weeks .
Five months later , Hansson packaged his Ruby shortcuts and released them as Ruby on Rails , which started winning converts almost immediately .
At the same time their software was taking off , so was the duo's cult of personality .
In 2005 , Fried gave a 10 - minute presentation at Tim O'Reilly 's Web 2.0 Summit , the influential confab of some of the Internet 's biggest minds .
The blogosphere lit up with praise .
( The response was so overwhelming that Fried himself posted a blog entry wondering if 37signals had " jumped the shark . "
Commenters leapt to his defense . )
In 2006 , the company compiled a list of contrarian dictates — do n't plan , do n't hire , do n't fix every bug — and published it as Getting Real , to rave reviews .
Greatest Fits
The 37signals blog , Signal vs. Noise , is famous for its indelicacy .
Here , a few choice rants from company staff .
" If BusinessWeek wants to say it only takes $ 50 and an internet connection to be the next mogul they may want to cite a valid example .
It 's certainly possible , but Digg is n't that example . "
" Windows in general has been like a confused and slow person .
Vista is like a person who lost their meds and is trying their best to ignore the voices . "
" What 's with the social bookmarking icons at the bottom of every single friggin ' blog post out there ?
...
The hectoring is tiresome , it results in extraneous visual noise , and the benefits are dubious at best . "
" An open letter to people who wear those Bluetooth headsets that blink : ...
That blue light that blinks incessantly can't actually be seen by you .
The rest of us , however , do see it .
And it annoys us .
Stop . "
" Only in the perverted world of the Web can something as simple and fundamental as making money be in need of a fancy word like monetize . ' "
But the key to Fried and Hansson 's burgeoning celebrity may have been their $ 895 - a- seat workshops at which acolytes celebrated the gospel of radical simplicity .
After attending one , Ryan Norbauer was inspired to tear down Lovetastic.com , a successful personals site that he had spent eight months creating in PHP , and rewrite the entire thing using Rails .
Now Norbauer runs a Rails consultancy .
" Rails has become a very big part of my life , " he says .
" I do n't think I would be doing programming for a living without it . "
That kind of devotion is common .
After Sean Tierney read Getting Real , he bought 10 copies for his employees at Grid7 , an application development shop , and insisted they read it .
" Jason Fried is a genius , " says Tierney , who today runs a software startup called Jumpbox .
" He 's the opposite of everything corporate . "
Tucked away on a grubby side street in a gentrifying loft - and - warehouse neighborhood about a mile west of downtown Chicago , 37signals ' offices hew to the company 's small - is - beautiful edict .
Actually , offices is a strong word : Headquarters consists of four desks shoved up against a wall .
37 signals leases its 500 square feet of floor space from a design firm whose employees surround 37 signals 's work area .
There is no 37 signals sign , no receptionist , no indication that 37 signals even exists .
The company has just 10 employees , five of whom telecommute and none of whom are expected to work more than 40 hours a week .
But 37 signals has n't remained small out of sloth or through lack of opportunity ; indeed , it 's taken some effort to keep it from growing .
Fried says he has rebuffed numerous inquiries from venture capitalists looking to invest in his company .
( The sole exception : Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos , whose investment firm , Bezos Expeditions , took a minority stake in 37signals in 2006 for an undisclosed amount .
The company has said it accepted the deal because it offered access to Bezos , not because of the money . )
Neither will Fried entertain acquisition offers .
" Someone on the outside would look at what we do and say , Let 's ratchet it up to some enterprise level , ' " he argues .
" I do n't want to make our software more complicated .
I really do n't understand why everyone 's interested in Fortune 500 customers .
I just do n't get that . "
37signals may not be targeting corporate behemoths , but its pared - down offerings may be inadequate for even its smaller clients , some of whom have urged Hansson to adapt Rails so it is better suited to handle popular applications .
In March 2007 , a Twitter engineer told an interviewer that he was having difficulty getting Rails to handle his company 's massive spike in traffic .
Hansson responded by sending a heated email to Jack Dorsey , Twitter 's CEO , and chastising the company on his blog for playing the " blame game " instead of solving its scaling problems itself .
( The two firms have since resolved the dispute . )
In January , an executive from hosting provider Dreamhost mused about the difficulty some of his clients were having running Rails applications .
Again , Hansson responded on his blog : " Wipe the wah - wah tears off your chin and retract the threats of imminent calamity if we do n't drop everything we 're doing to pursue your needs . "
This sort of hostility can't come as a surprise to anyone who has followed Hansson or Fried , but there are signs that their churlishness is beginning to generate some backlash .
The Basecamp message boards are filled with complaints from unhappy users , fed up with the software 's paucity of features — functionality of the Opera browser , say , or better version tracking of uploaded files — who have switched to competing products .
" They take the position that they 're right and everyone else is wrong , " says Douglas Karr , director of technology for an Internet marketing firm , who stopped using Basecamp in April .
" It really just put me off the company . "
Harper Reed , CTO of online T - shirt retailer Threadless , says that the belligerence of Rails ' followers soured him as well .
" It 's very much like a religion , " he says .
What 's more , 37signals ' ideological objections to outside funding could make them less able to withstand competition .
Nicholas Carr , author of The Big Switch , says companies like 37 signals wo n't have the resources to fight should larger firms with huge economies of scale and backend infrastructure decide to take them on .
" They 're going to have a very tough challenge , " he says .
Fried says he does n't worry about losing individual Basecamp customers , since none of them pay more than $ 149 a month .
He points out that the company 's total revenue doubled in 2007 .
And in addition to Basecamp , 37signals ' other products — subscription - based programs like group - chat app Campfire , content management tool Highrise , and information manager Backpack — pull in hundreds of thousands more users .
But , faced with a seemingly endless buffet of appetizer - size software , industry insiders have begun to question the basic philosophy that Web - based mini-applications are inherently better than their bulkier but more powerful competitors .
" Running your application on Rails places a huge limit on what you can do , " says Charles Forman , founder of iminlikewithyou.com , who has abandoned the framework for Merb , a rival programming tool .
That promises more scalability .
A recent survey by the NPD Group found that fewer than 1 percent of desktop PC users had replaced a desktop application — such as Microsoft Office — with a streamlined online alternative like Google Docs , even though the latter is free .
Design expert Don Norman , a consultant for Microsoft , says that one reason for the disparity is that customers actually like and use the extra features .
" Complexity is a necessary byproduct of the modern age , " he says .
" When you actually sit down and analyze what you need to get the job done , it 's not simplicity . "
That 's heresy to Fried , Hansson , and their followers .
Call it arrogance or idealism , but they would rather fail than adapt .
" I 'm not designing software for other people , " Hansson says .
" I 'm designing it for me . "

Huh ?
I do n’t get it .
That ’s what I was left saying to myself after watching the latest logically bereft John McCain ad .
This one continues on with the ‘ Obama - is - a - celebrity - therefore - he ’s - unfit - to - lead ’ theme by asking if he is “ ready to help your family ? ”
The narrator goes on to say , “ The real Obama promises higher taxes , more government spending – so , fewer jobs . ”
Wait , what ?
The ad then goes on to flash the iconic images of wind turbines and John McCain at some sort of manufacturing plant and the narrator says : “ Renewable energy to transform our economy , create jobs and energy independence .
That ’s John McCain . ”
Now you understand why I was dumbfounded , right ?
Here , watch it for yourself .
Please , if you can help me understand it , I invite your comments .

Cathy Duval , the Sierra Club ’s political director was quick to pounce on the ad :
“ John McCain could ’ve been the deciding vote on this issue twice — something that would ’ve truly helped America ’s workers and moved us toward energy independence — but he was the only Senator who did n’t even bother to show up and vote .
And just last week , John McCain ’s allies in the Senate blocked extending these energy incentives twice because they were determined to hold Congress hostage in order to push the Bush - McCain - Big Oil energy agenda at all costs . ”
The Sierra Club also released a fact - check of the new McCain .
Here are the highlights :
John McCain Offers Nothing More Than Empty Rhetoric on Renewable Energy
John McCain opposes a Renewable Electricity Standard and has consistently voted against such a standard in the past .
( Sources : 2005 Senate Vote # 141 , 6/16/2005 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 50 , 3/14/2002 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 55 , 3/21/2002 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 59 , 3/21/2002 )
. ( Sources : 2005 Senate Vote # 141 , 6/16/2005 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 50 , 3/14/2002 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 55 , 3/21/2002 ; 2002 Senate Vote # 59 , 3/21/2002 ) John McCain believes the renewable energy industry is “ doing fine ” and does n’t need any incentives .
While he offered a $ 300 million gimmick on electric cars , he has voted against $ 290 million for clean energy .
Meanwhile , John McCain favors billions in new and existing subsidies for dirty , dangerous , and distracting nuclear power .
( Sources : Grist , 10/1/07 ; 2006 Senate Vote # 42 , 3/14/2006 )
If key clean energy incentives that are in danger of expiring soon are not renewed , it could cost more than 116,000 hardworking Americans in the wind and solar industries alone their jobs and sacrifice $ 19 billion in economic growth .
Twice , when every single other Senator voted and measures to renew these critical incentives lost by just a single vote , John McCain did n’t even show up to vote when he could have made the difference .

COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) 
In a defeat for Republican challenges , state and federal courts have cleared the way for a weeklong period in which new voters can register and cast an absentee ballot on the same day in Ohio .
The early voting begins Tuesday and runs through Oct. 6 . The Ohio Supreme Court and a federal judge in Cleveland on Monday upheld the weeklong voting period .
Later in the day , Judge George Smith of Federal District Court in Columbus declined to rule , deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court decision .
But Judge Smith ruled that counties must allow party poll observers during early voting .
The disputed voting window results from an overlap between Tuesday ’s beginning of absentee voting 35 days before Election Day , and the Oct. 6 end of voter registration .
The decisions were a victory for Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat whom Republicans had accused of interpreting state law to benefit her party .
" Breaking the buck " is what happens when a firms assets are no longer adequate to cover that $ 1 per - share value .
At that point , the fund has to close up and distribute what it has left .
If you have a money market deposit account through your bank , my pet expert assures me that it is insured .
However , if you have a money market fund in your brokerage account , those losses are not covered by the SIPC .
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation ( SIPC ) has been described as the brokerage equivalent of the FDIC , which insures your bank account up to $ 100,000 in the event of a collapse .
This is not quite accurate .
When a bank goes down , if you had $ 10,585 in a checking account , you 're supposed to get $ 10,585 back with the help of the FDIC .
When a brokerage folds up , it 's supposed to return all your securities and cash to you .
Basically , the SIPC makes accounts good if the brokerage runs out of money to pay off its clients .
But it does n't insure you against losses -- all it guarantees is that you 'll get back the assets ( cash and securities ) that you had in your account .
If AT&T has dropped from $ 100 to $ 6 , that is not the SIPC 's problem .
All they guarantee is that they will give you either $ 6 or a share of AT&T .
The SIPC will make investors whole up to $ 500,000 worth -- but only by replacing assets at current market value , not the original asset value .
Nor will they , as far as I can tell , compensate you if your broker 's failure leaves you unable to sell a plummeting asset until it is too late .
Thus with a money market fund , the job is to make sure that you get however many shares of the fund you are entitled to .
But if your 10,000 shares are now only worth $ 3,500 , it will not give you back the $ 6,500 you lost .
If your fund is with a big house like Vanguard or Fidelity , this should n't worry you too much ; even if they 've got a lot of Lehman paper , their pockets are deep enough to write a check to cover the loss .
And they almost certainly will , because allowing investors to lose money on their money market funds would do terrible damage to the company 's reputation .
However , if you 've got a mutual fund with a smaller house , they might not be able to stump up the money .
That 's why spooked investors are rushing to redeem shares in smaller funds , mostly the kind that institutions park their excess cash in ( the fund Putnam is closing up had a minimum investment of $ 10 million ) .
Most money market funds are only required to disclose their holdings once per quarter -- and at that , the information is 60 days old by the time its filed .
God knows what kind of toxic waste they 've accumulated in the meantime .
I 'm told that a number of institutions have been topping up their mutual funds for months rather than let them break the buck and put the firm in line for investor lawsuits .
The fund that failed the other day was apparently one of the unfortunate few that clued in its investors more often .
In a fast - paced business culture of " get everything done yesterday , " it 's easy to admire and reward those busybusy people who always seem to be juggling 14 things at once .
But business coach Dave Crenshaw argues that the most common kind of multitasking does n't boost productivity — it slows you down .
In his new book , The Myth of Multitasking : How " Doing It All " Gets Nothing Done , Crenshaw explains the difference between " background tasking " — like watching TV while exercising — and " switchtasking , " juggling two tasks by refocusing your attention back and forth between them , and losing time and progress in the switch .
Crenshaw's on a mission to reduce distractions , interruptions , and fire - fighting at work , and create environments that let employees see through tasks with their full attention before moving onto the next thing .
Here 's what Crenshaw had to say when I asked him a few questions about changing perceptions and habits around multitasking .

Lifehacker : People who have done any kind of reading about personal productivity already know that there 's a high cost involved in switching from task to task during your workday .
But knowing something intellectually and making changes in your routine to reduce " switchtasking " are two different things .
What do you think has to happen for folks used to switchtasking to actually make the changes to their regular routine ?
Advertisement
Dave Crenshaw : Switchtasking is a largely cultural problem .
I 've found that most people actually still believe that multitasking is a productive activity .
It is culturally acceptable to switchtask .
Smoking is on the decline in the U.S. because it has become less culturally acceptable .
As multitasking becomes more and more of culturally unacceptable behavior , people will makes changes .
However , I find that the best way for people to ultimately make a lasting change is through one - on - one training or therapy .
It is a big part why I created the TimeGym program .
The worksheets in the book are also helpful because they help readers experience the impact of their own personal switchtasking .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Lifehacker : Many mid-level employees today work in an open office layout without their own office or even cubicle — their desk is just out in the middle of the floor with everyone else's .
When you work in this kind of setup , often you 're expected to attend to interruptions as they happen .
Co-workers stop by your desk to ask a question , you get pulled into a conversation happening two desks down , there 's a culture of a quick turnaround on email messages and constant monitoring of the inbox ... how can someone who 's not an exec or in management reduce their switchtasking without looking like a slacker ?
Do you run the risk of looking less responsive ?
Dave Crenshaw :
The situations you are describing really are a huge drain on productivity .
It is very difficult for someone in a middle - management or " front line " position to change that kind of environment .
Ultimately , a business or an organization is a reflection of its leader .
The leader has to make personal changes before an organization as a whole can improve productivity systems .
If not , the leader will constantly undermine any systemic improvements .

I can offer a couple of suggestions .
First : see if you can set up recurring meetings with the people who are interrupting you .
In my experience working with people , establishing a recurring meeting at a set place and time is like magic , and it really does cut down on a huge number of interruptions very quickly .
Second : find a way the leadership of your organization to pay attention to the impact of switches in the workplace .
A few people have commented that they are going to give the book as a gift to their boss because it presents the issue in a casual , non-threatening way .

Lifehacker :
Do you think companies are getting better or worse at creating environments that discourage switchtasking ?
Dave Crenshaw : I think we are at the beginning of a very long process of change .
The large companies working on the problem are only in the very preliminary stages of attacking this issue .
Most small businesses are n't even aware of the source of the problem .
In general , companies recognize they have productivity issues , but are unsure as to how to proceed .
Awareness is increasing , however .
Over the next decade I expect we 'll see a lot more attention on this issue and a great deal of improvement .

Lifehacker :
You 've said that technology is n't the reason why we switchtask more , it 's the way we use it that 's the issue .
However , turning off technology ( like silencing your ringer or closing down your email inbox ) is one of the best ways to focus on something .
What do you think about the approach taken by guys like Don Knuth , the computer science author who has eschewed email entirely in order to write books ?
Or folks who opt out of getting the BlackBerry or Treo because they do n't want to deal with the expectations it comes with ?
Is purposefully refraining from using certain kind of technology extremist , or evolved ?
Dave Crenshaw :
This is a bit like an amateur carpenter , who , after hitting his thumb with his hammer , curses the tool and tosses it aside .
Was the pain caused by the tool , or by the lack of skill of the person using the tool ?
Advertisement
A big part of how we use technology comes down to the big WHEN .
Shutting technology off completely certainly is not the answer just as it would n't be the answer to try to use a rock or your hands to put nails in boards .
What we need is more skill training and development .
For instance , I know Lifehacker advocates the principle of " firewalling " one 's attention .
That 's a great skill .
It helps minimize switches .
There are many , many of these new skills that we need to acquire .
They have become essential not only to our productivity but to our mental and emotional survival .
Finally , Crenshaw offers a few tips for reducing switchtasking and making better use of your time .
Take control over technology — Your cell phone ringer ( even on vibrate ) does n't need to be on all the time .
You can turn off email notification on your computer as well .
Become master over the nagging beeps and buzzes by creating some silence .
Schedule what you can schedule —
Set regular times in the day and week to check your voicemail and email .
Let others know that you will be using that schedule so they know when to expect a reply .
Focus on the person — When you switchtask when dealing with a computer , you simply lose efficiency .
But if you switchtask on a human being , you additionally damage a relationship .
Be present , listen carefully , and make sure everything has been taken care of before moving on .

Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign suffered an embarrassing defection Thursday when former Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew , a superdelegate , switched his support from her to Barack Obama , warning other party leaders that the negative tone of the prolonged campaign was becoming a “ catastrophe ” that would help Republicans .
The announcement by Andrew , a former Indiana party chairman chosen by President Clinton to head the national party in 1999 , was aimed at urging voters in his home state -- as well as the party ’s uncommitted superdelegates -- to rally around Obama and prevent further battling over the nomination that he said only helped the presumptive GOP nominee , John McCain .
“ While I was hopeful that a long , contested primary season would invigorate our party , the polls show that the tone and temperature of the race is now hurting us , ” Andrew wrote in a lengthy letter released by the Obama campaign .
“ John McCain , without doing much of anything , is now competitive against both of our remaining candidates .
We are doing his work for him and distracting Americans from the issues that really affect all of our lives , ” Andrew wrote .

Andrew ’s home state of Indiana will , along with North Carolina , hold the next round of presidential primary contests Tuesday .
The decision by the longtime Clinton loyalist makes Andrew a leading voice among top Democrats who have expressed fears that the longer the campaign continues , the more divisive it will become .
They worry that backers of each candidate will grow more hardened in their support and less likely to vote for the other .
“ Should this race continue after Indiana and North Carolina , it will inevitably become more negative , ” Andrew wrote .
“ The polls already show the supporters for both candidates becoming more strident in their positions and more locked into their support .
Continuing on this path would be a catastrophe . ”
Andrew had endorsed Clinton in November .

At a news conference Thursday , Andrew said Clinton ’s support for a federal gas - tax holiday over the summer was symbolic of a poll - driven candidacy proposing something “ politically expedient to give a quick pander to Hoosier voters , ” in contrast to what he called the “ principled ” campaign Obama has run .
Obama has labeled as a “ gimmick ” a summertime suspension of federal gas taxes , which McCain also supports , and said it would provide little relief to motorists and would not wean the nation off of foreign oil .
Clinton ’s campaign rejected Andrew ’s contention that the continued battle was damaging the party .
“ We just could n’t disagree with that more , and more importantly voters could n’t disagree with that more , given the fact that this process has attracted a record number of voters into the Democratic Party primary process , ” said Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson .

Tribune correspondent Mike Dorning contributed to this report .
The mainstream media ( MSM ) spin on the recent events in Georgia runs something like this .
Georgia ’s young leader Mikheil Saakashvili , the Columbia Law School graduate who came to power after the heroic “ Rose Revolution ” in 2003 , is a great friend of America ( providing the third largest detachment of “ Coalition ” troops to Iraq ) .
His commitment to democracy and Georgian independence have annoyed Moscow , which still retains aspects of Soviet - era authoritarianism , still cherishes ambitions to dominate border states once part of the USSR , and is ( for unexplained reasons ) suspicious of U.S. hopes to integrate Georgia into NATO .
It has taken advantage of separatist movements in Georgia to weaken the Tblisi government .
Saakashvili , in an effort to establish effective control over his whole country , sent troops into the breakaway region of South Ossetia August 7 ( just before the Olympic Games opening ceremony in Beijing ) .
Russia used this as an excuse to flex its muscle , invading a country for the first time since the USSR invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 .
It not only drove Georgian troops from South Ossetia but along with allies in the separatist Abkhazia region attacked targets throughout Georgia .
It ’s a clear case of unwarranted aggression .
This narrative has been effectively challenged or at least contextualized in columns by Charles King in the Christian Science Monitor , Brendan O’Neill on Spiked , and Justin Raimondo on Antiwar.com , among others .
Here I ’d like to list some of their main points , along with some historical background :
1. Saakashvili , who owes his position to U.S. interference in Georgian politics , is no liberal democrat but an autocrat who jails political enemies and media critics and uses force to quash anti-government demonstrations .
He accuses foes of coup plots which he equates with “ aiding terrorism . ”
2. Russia is alarmed at the unceasing expansion of NATO , an alliance formed to secure western Europe against a Soviet attack that never happened .
Russian leaders expected NATO to dissolve along with the Warsaw Pact at the end of the Cold War .
Instead it has expanded to include Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary in 1997 and Bulgaria , Estonia , Lithuania , Latvia , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004 .
Inclusion of the Baltic states brings NATO right up to the Russian border .
Washington is pushing for the eventual inclusion of Ukraine ( another country where Washington has been meddling politically ) and Georgia in the alliance .
Russia has repeatedly warned that it can not tolerate this .
3 . The whole of Georgia was part of the Russian Empire from 1801 , and was absorbed into the USSR in 1922 .
It became independent with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
During the Soviet period , South Ossetia and Abkhazia ( as well as the Adjara region ) had autonomous status within the Soviet Republic of Georgia .
Use of the native languages was encouraged by the state and South Ossetians , Abkhazis , and Adjaris favored over Georgians or Russians for bureaucratic posts in their regions .
In the last couple years of the USSR , new laws imposing the Georgian language nationwide and banning regional - based political parties caused South Ossetians to declare a Soviet Democratic Republic .
In 1991 polls showed that they overwhelmingly favored the preservation of the Soviet Union and opposed integration into a new Georgian state .
At the time Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia called South Ossetian separatists “ direct agents of the Kremlin , its tools and terrorists . ”
In 1992 the new regime of Eduard Shevardnadze in post -Soviet Georgia announced its intention to restore a 1921 constitution stripping these regions of autonomy .
In response the South Ossetians conducted a referendum , voting overwhelmingly for independence .
Violence in the region drew Russian concern and in June , after hundreds had died , Tblisi agreed to the creation of a tripartite peace - keeping force of Russians , Georgians and South Ossetians in the region .
The following month Abkhazia proclaimed itself independent , and Tblisi sent 3000 troops into the poorly defended region and engaged in wanton destruction .
The majority in both regions apparently want a divorce from Georgia and either independence or incorporation into the Russian Federation .
In 2002 South Ossetia ’s elected president , Eduard Kokoity , officially requested that Moscow recognize the Republic of South Ossetia and its absorption into the Russian Federation .
4 . While Vladimir Putin was president , Russia conferred citizenship and passports on most South Ossetians and can thus argue that it has an obligation to defend them from aggression .
Russia can also argue that it has an obligation to defend its peace - keeping troops from attack .
5. Saakashvili has cultivated an alliance with the U.S. , even supplying the third largest detachment of troops ( 2000 ) to the “ Coalition forces ” in Iraq .
( Georgia has only a population of 4.7 million people . )
The Georgian Army has been trained by U.S. and Israeli forces .
Saakashvili has sought membership in NATO , depicting Georgia as a European democracy confronted with a bullying undemocratic neighbor .
Moscow finds Saakasvili ’s rhetoric provocative .
6 . While the MSM has depicted the Georgia crisis as the result of Russian aggression , the initial large - scale military action was a surprise aerial attack on the regional capital of Tskhinvali on August 7 followed up by a tank and mortar assault August 8 .
This produced a prompt Russian military response .
However , it does not appear to have been planned well in advance .
A senior U.S. official told the New York Times , “ It does n’t look like this was premeditated , with a massive staging of equipment .
Until the night before the fighting , Russia seemed to be playing a constructive role [ in maintaining peace between Tblisi and the Ossetians ] . ”
7. Georgia plays an important role in the geopolitics of oil , since the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline completed 2005 passes through it , connecting the Caspian Sea oil fields to NATO member Turkey , bypassing Russia .
Many Russian officials feel it an effort to diminish Russian influence in the Caucasus and justify the stationing of U.S. troops in the region .
It may be that Saakashvili believed Georgia so valuable to the U.S. bloc , because of the pipeline , military cooperation and political allegiance , that he could assault South Ossetia counting on the U.S. to restrain any Russian response .
But as the MSM reports , a U.S. military response is highly unlikely .
8 . The Russians have justified their actions by making pointed references to U.S. actions in recent years .
In February , when the U.S. recognized the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo , split off from then - Yugoslavia by a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 , the Russians denounced the move .
They stated that the U.S. - led attack ( the first war in Europe , including the first aerial attack on a national capital , since 1945 ) and the detachment of part of a sovereign state , ostensibly to protect an ethnic group , was a dangerous precedent .
One can thus read the Russian actions of the last week as a tit - for - tat response to the arrogant use of American power in Russia ’s immediate backyard .
I wrote after Kosovo ’s U.S. - backed declaration of independence six months ago :
[ The Russians ’ ] opposition to Kosovo ’s independence might be perceived as a slight irritation in Washington among those eager to establish a new client - state and drag it into NATO .
But this move comes on the heels of U.S. meddling in Georgia , Belarus , and the Ukraine , the relentless eastward expansion of NATO , and moves to locate missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic .
The Russian government is in effect saying : “ Look , you intervene at will in Latin America , forming and toppling governments as you will , arguing it ’s necessary for your ‘ national security . ’
We who have been invaded many times from the west have legitimate reasons to support our friends in the Balkans , including the Serbs whom you ’ve maligned and mistreated disgracefully .
Do you really think you can just wrench away a province from a Slavic country friendly to us , through brutal military force , and expect us to take it lying down ? ”
I have the feeling that Washington blew it here–and that there will be some blowback .
Here ’s indeed some blowback .
The Georgian regime is humiliated , and Washington embarrassingly impotent to go to Saakashvili ’s aid .
Quite likely the young president ’s constituents will turn on him , shocked by the utter folly of his provoking the Russian bear .
And the MSM take will be : Russia is flexing its muscles , secure in the knowledge that Europe needs its oil and natural gas and so the West cannot prevent its bullying antidemocratic actions .
Some will call it a new Cold War .
But do n’t expect much genuine historical analysis .
*****
The parallel between Kosovo and South Ossetia is not of course exact .
Kosovo plays a more important role in Serbian history than South Ossetia in Georgian history .
It experienced a far more dramatic ethno - demographic change in the last century and a half than South Ossetia .
( A 1871 report by an Austrian officer indicates that Kosovo was 64 % Serb , 32 % Albanian , whereas the Kosovars are now 92 % of the total . )
Serbs can protest that the mere reproduction rate of Albanians in Kosovo should n’t have entitled the Kosovars to seize the Serbian heartland with its churches , monasteries and battlefields rich in heroic historical memory .
I do n’t think Georgians can make a similar argument about South Ossetia ; the Ossetians ( who may be related to Iranians ) seem to have predominated in the region since around the fourteenth century .
The premise for the U.S. / NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 was that Kosovars were being persecuted by Serbian authorities .
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen declared , “ We ’ve now seen about 100,000 military - aged men missing …
They may have been murdered , ” while a State Department spokesman warned , “ There are indications genocide is unfolding in Kosovo . ”
( One thinks of the Russian accusation of “ genocide ” as it was reported 1500 - 2000 Ossetian civilians had been killed in the Georgian attack . )
Actually it turns out only about 2000 civilians were killed in Kosovo between 1998 and 1999 – around the number of South Ossetians killed by Georgians in just a few days .
( To put this into perspective , there are about 100,000 South Ossetians in a region measuring 3,900 square kilometers and about two million inhabitants of Kosovo measuring 11,000 square kilometers . )
A German court determined in March 1999 that , “ Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have neither been nor are now exposed to regional or countrywide group persecution in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . ”
Does it not look as though the premise of persecution justifying outside intervention is much stronger in the South Ossetia case ?
Before commencing the bombardment of Yugoslavia ( again , the first such bombardment in Europe since World War II ) , the U.S. presented Belgrade with the “ Rambouillet Accords ” ultimatum : either allow NATO forces to operate at will and tax - free throughout the entire territory of Yugoslavia ( once proudly non-aligned during the Cold War ) , while they secured Kosovo as Yugoslav federal troops withdrew–or be subject to attack .
The U.S. made demands no sovereign state could accept .
Russia in contrast has not demanded the right to move its troops at will throughout Georgia .
It gave Tblisi no ultimatum before responding to what appears to have been a brutal sneak attack .
NATO bombed Belgrade for three months in 1999 .
The bombing of the Serb Radio and Television ( RTS ) headquarters in Belgrade on April 23 killed 16 RTS civilian technicians .
Russia has reportedly attacked the Vaziani military airbase outside Tbilisi and military targets in the capital city to “ punish ” Georgia for the South Ossetia attack and , no doubt , its embrace of an unofficial military alliance threatening to Russia .
Perhaps if the proposed cease - fire does not hold , Tblisi will encounter the same fate as Belgrade .
But I think it more likely that the Georgian authorities will capitulate immediately to the invaders ’ demands , which are more measured than the demands presented Milosevic .
Regardless of these differences between Kosovo and South Ossetia , Moscow seems to be saying :
You cannot violate international law with your constant aggressions and provocations of Russia–a country seeking warm ties with the U.S. and Europe–without expecting us , at some point , to respond in kind .
You cannot say it ’s fine , as a “ special exception ” to violate the sovereignty of our traditional Serbian allies by delivering a state to the Kosovars while damning us for invading Georgia to defend the Ossetians .
You have created this problem , and more to come .
Saakashvili explains Russia ’s actions by saying , “ They just do n’t want freedom and that ’s why they want to stamp on Georgia and destroy it . ”
The buffoon seems to echo Bush ’s explanation for the 9 - 11 attacks : “ They hate our freedoms . ”
Some see here the re-emergence of a Cold War , a pitting of democracy versus the specter of communist totalitarianism .
Surely there are policy wonks nostalgic for the Cold War era and its simplicity .
But it really has little to do with “ freedom , ” and we do not have here a clash of systems and ideologies .
Russia is in its own way as capitalistic and imperialistic as the U.S. Rather , there ’s a clash between those governing the U.S. and Russia , comparable to the inter - imperialist clashes and turf - battles of the past century and a half .
Like those it has a lot to do with competition for the control of raw materials and markets .
Within that big game , Russia suddenly seems much more competitive .
Roger Bennett Riggle : Hello , my name is Roger Bennett Riggle and I am a professional , licensed makeup artist .
I have been a makeup artist since 1985 .
I own a company called Faces by R & R , and we supply makeup , consultations , on - location shoot , makeup labor , and things like that through our company .
So , we turn to fantasy makeup , and Halloween today and we are going to shoot a series of makeup techniques , simple enough for you to be able to do and to actually transform your face into a Halloween design to go with your costume .
Now we move on to a design that we are going to call , the scarred joker .
We are going to do a joker face that has a deformity to it and we are going to try to create something for you that would be easy for you to copy and extremely effective for Halloween .
Let 's start with the products that we need for a scarred joker face .
Again , we need the cotton pads and the astringent to wipe down the face because again , we are going to be using molding wax , which we have already done a segment on , when we did making a wound .
Here is the molding wax and do n't forget that it comes in light and dark colors , depending on your skin tone .
With the molding wax , we use either a very dull kitchen knife or a makeup artist spatula , palette knife .
Also , we have got colors here , and the joker is basically in white .
This is a clown white , this is a cream based makeup .
We can also use , if you prefer a water - base cake makeup .
This is a cake makeup and it's in white .
There is just the remnant of it left right now , this is my personal one and you can dig a wet sponge in there and pat on the makeup and get the same exact design for the white face .
Also , we are going to sink in the eyes and make them rather black or dark grey and in that case , I have picked out a dark grey and the black color liner and a cream to use , and we are going to make the mouth red , but I decided that we will make it not red and make it different .
So , we 'll use a shade that we are going to call dark teak .
This is an orangey red .
So , it 's not quite as red-red as a clown red would be , and so this is going to give us a more kind of slimy look .
So , you want to select your colors and again we are going to use the molding wax , and the Vanessa and I , before this shoot sculpted some pieces that we are going to put on the side of the mouth .
The idea here is that the mouth is rather deformed for this particular joker face .
We are also going to use liquid latex , which is the liquid rubber that we talked about and I have a little palette on to which to pour the liquid latex and use that .
You will also a need a non-latex sponge and the makeup remover or the baby oil , do n't forget , is a product that we use to mold the wax and keep it from sticking to us , and then we actually molded them on this little piece of plexiglass , which is the palette .
You can also the use plastic plate , and then what I just discovered was , when I dip the palette knife into the makeup remover , I was very easily able to run it up underneath the molding wax and lifted it up , off of the piece of plexiglass and not ruin the design of the molding .
By the way , the molding of wax and making pieces on the face is called moulage , and that is a French term meaning to mold .
So , it 's actually to take wax and to mold .
So , the process is called moulage .
Now , we 'll jump to applying these prosthetics and showing you exactly how to do them .
A lot of this is repeated in the wound segment that we did , but we will be applying these and then I am going to show you a new technique for using liquid latex when applying makeup for your joker Halloween costume .

According to a new poll by Public Policy Polling released today , Barack Obama leads John McCain 48 % - 40 % in the state of Ohio .
Twelve percent of those surveyed were undecided .
As has become the trend in many of these state polls , Obama leads with women and African Americans , while McCain does best with men .
There is quite a gender divide in the state as Obama leads with women 54 % - 34 % , but McCain leads with men 48 % - 41 % with 11 % undecided .
McCain leads narrowly with white voters , 46 % - 42 % , but Obama dominates with African Americans 91 % - 6 % .
Another sign of Obama doing really well in the Buckeye State is that he leads McCain with all age groups , except senior citizens .
The age groups that I pay the most attention to in every state poll are voters age 30 - 45 , these are the voters that were heavily split between Clinton and Obama during the Democratic primary , and this is a group that will likely determine the outcome in several swing states in the fall .

In Ohio , Obama leads McCain 48 % - 41 % among voters age 30 - 45 .
The Democrat has a large lead with voters age 18 - 29 , 59 % - 26 % .
He has a much smaller lead with voters age 46 - 65 , 48%- 43 % , and McCain leads with seniors , 44 % - 40 % .
This continues a trend that has been visible in state polls throughout the country .
McCain is having a hard time expanding his base beyond older , white , male voters .
In Ohio , as is also the case in Pennsylvania and Michigan , the economy is the critical issue .
If McCain is to have any chance of winning the election , he needs to win Pennsylvania or Ohio and Michigan , and neither state looks good for him currently .
Ohio is in a different mood than it was in 2004 because in the interim the state was rocked by a Republican political scandal .
All things considered , Ohio should be ripe territory for Obama and his message of change .
It should not be anywhere near as close as it was in 2004 .

Cancer cells keep dividing Scientists say they have taken a big step towards blocking a chemical vital to the growth of many cancers .
They have unpicked the structure of telomerase , an enzyme which , when active , helps keep cells in an " immortal " state .
The chemical is at work in more than nine out of ten types of tumour .
Researchers from Philadelphia 's Wistar Institute , writing in the journal Nature , say their efforts could lead to drugs which switch it off .
All cells in the body have a natural clock - the telomeres - which shorten every time the cell divides .
The idea is that you could convert immortal cancer cells back into mortal ones by blocking telomerase in this way
Professor Rob Newbold
Brunel University
After a fixed number of divisions in most cells , the telomeres are reduced to a certain length , and the cell cannot continue dividing .
This change is responsible for changes within the ageing body , as cell division slows down .
Some cells , such as stem cells within the embryo , use the chemical telomerase to maintain telomere length .
Many tumours have hijacked the telomerase system to fuel their uninhibited growth .
The Wistar team has found a new way to map the structure of the most active part of the chemical .
' Few side effects '
Dr Emmanuel Skordalakes said that this detailed picture would help provide molecular targets for drugs .
" Telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumours , but inactive in most normal cells .
" That means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers , with few side effects . "
Professor Rob Newbold , from Brunel University in Uxbridge , said it was a " very important " achievement .
" Telomerase controls the evolution of cancers - and is a key characteristic of human cancer cells .
" The idea is that you could convert immortal cancer cells back into mortal ones by blocking telomerase in this way .
" Having discovered the structure now , it will certainly help the development of drugs . "

Back - room dealings in the European Parliament have resulted in a " three strikes " rule being included in a new telecoms bill — the rule would force ISPs to kick people who 've been thrice accused of copyright infringement off the Internet .
If this bill passes , then Europeans ' access to the network that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , access to medicine , family , civic engagement , banking , government services , and the whole sweep of human online endeavor would last only so long as they avoided three unsubstantiated accusations of downloading music or video or software without permission .
Worse still , the bill is set to be voted upon on July 7 — that 's this Monday .
The Open Rights Group has instructions for contacting your MEP .
If you live in the EU and you care about your future as a citizen of the information society , call right away and make sure your MEP knows that this matters to you .
" One week before a key vote in the reform of European law on electronic communications ( " Telecom Package " ) , La Quadrature du Net ( Squaring the Net ) denounces a series of amendments aimed at closing the open architecture of the Internet for more control and surveillance of users .. … this set of amendments creates the unprecedented mechanism known as graduated response in European law ; judicial authority and law courts are vacated in favour of private actors and " technical measures " of surveillance and filtering .

Three false copyright accusations and we 'll cut off your Internet access
Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web .
One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search .
To answer this question , over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers .
Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us .
We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio.us : how many bookmarks exist ( about 115 million ) , how fast is it growing , and how active are the URLs being posted about ( quite active ) .
We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers .
We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains , and vice versa .
We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate , and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text , backlink page text , or forward link page text of the pages they annotate .
We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources , though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact .
McCain sources tell Politico that they believe Romney could raise $ 50 million in 60 days .
Romney tops McCain veep list
In a surprise to many Republican insiders , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is at the top of the vice presidential prospect list for John McCain .
But lack of personal chemistry could derail the pick .
“ Romney as favorite ” is the hot buzz in Republican circles , and top party advisers said the case is compelling .

Campaign insiders say McCain plans to name his running mate very shortly after Barack Obama does , as part of what one campaign planner called a “ bounce- mitigation strategy . ”
The Democratic convention is in late August , a week ahead of the Republican convention .
That means McCain can size up the opposing ticket before locking in his own .
McCain campaign staffers declined to comment , saying McCain has made it clear they are not to discuss the matter .
One of the chief reasons the Massachusetts governor is looking so attractive is his ability to raise huge amounts of money quickly through his former business partners and from fellow members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , the Mormons .
McCain sources tell Politico that they believe Romney could raise $ 50 million in 60 days .
One close Romney adviser said it could even be $ 60 million .
Romney ’s other advantages , according to people involved in McCain ’s screening process :
— He is squeaky - clean and fully vetted by the national media .
— He has presidential looks and bearing and immediately would be a strong campaigner who could be trusted to stay on message .
— His family ’s Michigan roots would help in a swing state that went Democratic in 2004 .
But there ’s one big problem : Despite the buddy - picture choreography of a McCain - Romney campaign swing , McCain remains less than enamored with Romney .
And it ’s not just the candidate .
Some of McCain ’s closest confidants evince little enthusiasm for Romney , feelings that are owed in part to lingering bad blood from the GOP primary , a genuine skepticism that such a conventional pick could bolster the ticket in a grim year for the GOP and concerns about whether his Mormon faith could imperil McCain in Southern states that Obama hopes to put into play .
McCain sources also say he ’ll pick his vice presidential candidate based more on ability to govern than ability to help in the election .
So two other names are in the top tier :
— Rob Portman , a former congressman from Ohio , member of House leadership , U.S. trade ambassador and White House budget director .
— Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) , who would delight conservatives and is at the top of the list of the party ’s prospects for the presidential race in 2012 or 2016 .
He was described to Politico by a McCain confidant as a possible “ compromise ” if the senator ca n’t stomach picking Romney .
Then there ’s a second tier of candidates who are less likely , but possible : former Pennsylvania Gov .
Tom Ridge , who dropped out of the top tier because of recent revelations about his lobbying ; Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ; Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ; and Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , who is one of McCain ’s most energetic and successful fundraisers .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is frequently included in veep news stories but was not mentioned by McCain insiders .
Their view is that his youth would accentuate , not mitigate , the age issue .
Especially if McCain is far behind later this summer , he could do something truly unorthodox such as pick his strong supporter Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , who was the Democrats ’ vice presidential candidate back in 2000 .
Party leaders do n’t expect that .
But McCain remains , after all , a maverick .
Jonathan Martin contributed to this story .
Obama on Palin : ' You ca n't just reinvent yourself '
Not long after the Obama campaign signaled it would n't go directly after Sarah Palin , the candidate goes right at her .
Well , how about Gov. Palin ?
She 's you know , an up and comer from Alaska .
She - they 're starting to run an ad now saying she opposed the bridge to nowhere .
Well now , let 's get the facts clear here .
When she was mayor , she hired a Washington lobbyist to get earmarks - pork barrel spending - all the things that John McCain says is bad , she lobbied to get !
And got a whole lot of it .
When it came to the bridge to nowhere , she was for it until everybody started raising a fuss about it and she started running for governor and then suddenly she was against it !
You remember that ?
For it before you were against it ?
I mean you can't just make stuff up .
You can't just recreate yourself .
You can't just reinvent yourself .
The American people are n't stupid .
It 's unusual to see the presidential nominee so focused on his rival 's running mate , and a sign that her wattage is changing the race a bit .
On the other hand , Obama may have felt compelled to go at her directly in part because Palin is now starring in a McCain ad that touts , and overstates , her opposition to the " Bridge to Nowhere . "
After supporting the project , and seeing it founder , she decided to spend the money elsewhere .

During a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee today , former Attorney General John Ashcroft falsely claimed that waterboarding has “ consistently ” been defined as “ not torture ” and refused to agree that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques — including waterboarding — on captured U.S. soldiers is “ unacceptable ” or “ criminal . ”
REP .
MAXINE WATERS :
Do you think that if these techniques were used on American soldiers that they would be totally unacceptable and even criminal ? [… ]
ASHCROFT : My job , as Attorney General , was to try and elicit from the experts and the best people in the Department definitions that comported with the statues enacted by the Congress and the Constitution of the United States .
And those statutes have consistently been interpreted so as to say , by the definitions that , waterboarding , as described in the CIA ’s request , is not torture .
Watch it :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( Article continues below )
In fact , waterboarding “ has been prosecuted in U.S. courts since the late 1800s and was regarded by every U.S. administration before this one as torture . ”
Further , Ashcroft ’s non-answer with regard to the torture of captured American service men and women is reminiscent of State Department Legal Adviser John Bellinger ’s refusal to condemn “ the use of water boarding on an American national by a foreign intelligence service . ”
His comments are also in line with the sentiments of Guantanamo Bay ’s legal adviser , Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann , who refused to answer whether or not the use of waterboarding by Iranians on U.S. service men and women would constitute torture .
In the words of former JAG officer Lt. Cmdr. Andrew Williams , Ashcroft and his fellow travelers have “ sold all the soldiers and sailors at risk of capture and subsequent torture down the river . ”
Transcript :
WATERS : Based on all of that information , those descriptions , your understandings , and the conclusions , if in fact these pactices were applied to American soldiers do you think that conclusion would be a good one or do you think that if these techniques were used on American soldiers that they would be totally unacceptable and even criminal ?
ASHCROFT : My subscription to the memos and my belief that the law provides the basis for these memos persisted even in the presence of my son serving two tours of duty overseas in the Gulf area as a member of our armed forces .
I know that his training included a number of activities that I think would be very , very difficult for any of us to sustain , including having to deal with evil chemistry and the like .
But my job , as Attorney General , was to try and elicit from the experts and the best people in the Department definitions that comported with the statues enacted by the Congress and the Constitution of the United States .
And those statutes have consistently been interpreted so as to say , by the definitions , that waterboarding , as described in the CIA ’s request , is not torture .

Comment on this article
The Dead Sea has been a religious and cultural landmark of the Middle East for thousands of years .
Saltier than the oceans , the lake is like none other in the world .
But in the past 30 years , the Dead Sea has lost about a third of its surface area .
As much as 95 percent of the flow of its main tributary , the Jordan River , has been diverted for agriculture and domestic use .
Excessive mineral mining for potash and magnesium chloride is removing water at a rate of 150 million cubic meters per year .
As water levels drop by as much as one meter per year , the combination of diversion and evaporation is threatening both economic development and the natural oases that support the Dead Sea 's unique ecosystem .
In an effort to halt the sea 's rapid disappearance , Jordan , Israel , and the Palestinian Authority , with the help of the World Bank , are proposing a project to import water from the Red Sea in the south .
While dramatic engineering may be necessary to save this timeless attraction , environmentalists warn that less - risky alternatives are being ignored .
If built , the Red - Dead conduit is expected to cost $ 15 billion .
Projects of this scale are not unprecedented , especially as water demand grows rapidly in many regions of the world .
According to the United Nations World Water Development Report , water withdrawals have increased sixfold since the 1990s , twice the rate of population growth .
Costly projects to meet demand - the $ 60 billion Chinese South - North water transfer , for example - have come under fire by environmentalists for failing to address the underlying causes of water stress , such as a lack of conservation .
The World Bank says the proposed 180 - kilometer conduit would carry 2 billion cubic meters of water to the Dead Sea .
It would also provide desalinated water , generate energy , and build a symbol of peace and cooperation between Israel , Jordan , and the Palestinian Territories , the Bank says .
" Given the fact that the flow of the Jordan River is largely appropriated for what are viewed as key economic and social uses , good water management within the basin may have to be combined with a water transfer from outside the Jordan Basin to restore the Dead Sea level to a reasonable level , " the World Bank noted in a background document .
By introducing water of a different density and composition to the Dead Sea , however , engineers may drastically alter the very thing they are trying to save .
The Dead Sea is rich in calcium , while the Red Sea is rich in sulfate ; mixing the two could create a surface layer of gypsum .
New algae growth might also change the buoyancy of the water and alter its blue water to appear red .
These critical changes could damage the tourism industry in both Israel and Jordan .
Two weeks ago , the World Bank held three public hearings in Israel , Jordan , and the Palestinian Authority as part of its preliminary study into the feasibility of a Red - Dead transfer .
The Bank came under intense fire from a coalition of six organizations : the Israel Union for Environmental Defense , Tzalul , Life and Environment , Friends of the Earth Middle East , the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel , and Green Course .
The environmentalists said the project 's feasibility study , to be completed in 2009 , is not dedicating enough resources to researching the environmental implications of the water transfer and assessing alternative methods for resuscitating the Dead Sea .
These critiques coincide with a recent World Bank internal review reporting the Bank 's insufficient attention to long - term sustainability .
Separate from the feasibility study , the World Bank is conducting an environmental assessment of the water transfer , led by a team of three specialists nominated by each country and selected by the Bank .
But some environmentalists and water experts argue that the assessment should be performed not by representatives of the three governments already in favor of the project , but by independent , international consultants .
" It 's like asking a cat to guard a bowl of milk , " Gidon Bromberg , Israel director of Friends of the Earth Middle East , told the Jewish Review .
As an alternative to the diversion project , environmentalists and local geologists propose rehabilitating the Jordan River .
According to Dan Zaslavksi , a former Israeli water commissioner , regenerating the flow of the river to bring water to the Dead Sea will cost no more than $ 800 million , substantially less than the $ 15 billion estimated for the Red - Dead plan , Al Jazeera reported .
Critics also suggest reforms in the chemical industries on both sides of the sea .
Alexander McPhail , task - team leader of the Red - Dead feasibility study , said the Jordan River rehabilitation plan , as well as alternatives such as a Mediterranean - Dead Sea canal or a water pipeline from Turkey , have merit .
Should no solution be found , there is also the alternative of doing nothing , McPhail notes in the China Review .
The World Bank will use the results of its feasibility study to determine whether the Red - Dead plan is a viable solution to save the Dead Sea .
But without objective research into the plan 's environmental consequences , wrote Friends of the Earth 's Bromberg in a recent op - ed , " the World Bank vision may lead to ecological disaster . "

The world ’s oldest man celebrated his 113th birthday today in southern Japan , telling reporters he wants to live another five years .
Tomoji Tanabe , who was born Sept. 18 , 1895 , received birthday gifts , flowers and $ 1,000 cash from the mayor of his hometown of Miyakonojo , on Japan ’s southern island of Kyushu .
Tanabe told reporters he wants to live “ another five years or so , ” according to city spokesman Akihide Yokoyama .
That was a slight downgrade from last year , when he said he wanted to live “ for infinity . ”
The former city land surveyor , who lives with his son and daughter - in - law , is in good health and sticks to the habits that have gotten him this far .
He rises early and reads the newspaper each day , drinks milk every afternoon and eats regular meals .
He also avoids alcohol and does not smoke .
On Tuesday he woke up early in the morning to eat breakfast before walking out to meet the mayor and members of the press at his home , Yokoyama said .
The cash gift he received is given annually to the city ’s oldest resident .
Japan has one of the world ’s longest life expectancies , nearly 86 years for women and 79 years for men , which is often attributed to the country ’s healthy diet rich in fish and rice .
The number of Japanese living past 100 has more than doubled in the last six years , reaching a record high of 36,000 people this year .
The country ’s centenarian ranks are dominated by women , who make up 86 percent of the total .
Japan ’s centenarian population is expected to reach nearly 1 million — the world ’s largest — by 2050 , according to U.N. projections .
The world ’s oldest person is 115 - year - old Edna Parker , who was born on April 20 , 1893 , and lives in a nursing home in Indiana .
After 30 years , one of America 's most intractable social problems is finally turning around : Overall homelessness has fallen 12 percent since 2005 .
Thanks goes to a eureka insight , followed by a coordinated nationwide push .
The progress proves that Americans at all levels can tackle difficult challenges if they commit to them .
The light - bulb idea is pretty intuitive , though it took decades to settle on it : Instead of merely managing the homeless – shuttling them between shelters , detox centers , hospitals , and jails – local officials now work to first give them a long - term residence .
Case workers then make sure they get the services they need , and that they do n't again end up on the street .
The concept , known as " housing first , " has been mostly directed at the chronically homeless , a term the federal government defines as mentally ill or otherwise disabled people who have been without a residence for at least a year , or who have been homeless several times over several years .
From 2005 to 2007 , the number of chronically homeless fell 30 percent , to 123,833 , according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) report last month .
The overall number of homeless fell to about 672,000 people .
( Merely counting the homeless is quite a feat . )
Congress began to push " housing first " in 1999 by ordering HUD to funnel a third of its homeless funds into permanent housing .
Then , under President Bush , HUD began to provide incentive money to communities that focus on the chronically homeless .
Now there are 345 such communities – local governments , charities , and businesses – working with 10 - year plans to reduce or end homelessness .
But what 's progress without the critics , or the reminder that there 's much more to do ?
Some advocates for the homeless complain that HUD 's numbers are not an apples - to - apples comparison , because the agency narrowed its definition of the homeless in the time covered .
HUD itself admits to " large " sampling errors .
Maybe the real picture is not as " wow " as it appears , but the important thing here is that the trend is downward – and solutions are at hand .
A more legitimate complaint is that HUD is focusing too heavily on the chronically homeless , who make up about 18 percent of the homeless population .
In New York City , for instance , this group has declined since 2005 , but overall homelessness has increased .
The HUD report also covers a period mostly in advance of the fallout from the spike in housing foreclosures .
Anecdotes from shelters and food pantries indicate the mortgage crisis and its attendant high rents are now being felt , with families one of the fastest growing homeless groups .
HUD had a good reason to focus on those who keep circulating through shelters .
They 're the most expensive and difficult group to take care of – especially if they remain on the street .
Local governments can make substantial savings by stopping this cycle , and cities such as Denver are proving that .
But it 's time now to apply the lessons of " housing first " to families and the working poor .
Government can learn from its mistakes .
It did this with welfare reform in the 1990s , and it 's doing it now with the homeless .
You probably think you 're doing everything you can to stay healthy : you get lots of sleep , exercise regularly and try to avoid fried foods .
But you may be forgetting one important thing .
Relax !
Stress has a bigger impact on your health than you might realize , according to research presented yesterday at the annual conference of the American Psychological Association in Boston .
Ohio State University psychologist Janice Kiecolt - Glaser and her partner , Ronald Glaser , an OSU virologist and immunologist , have spent 20 - odd years researching how stress affects the immune system , and they have made some startling discoveries .
An easy example comes from their work with caregivers , people who look after chronically ailing spouses or parents ( no one would argue that this role is quite stressful ) .
In one experiment , Kiecolt - Glaser and her colleagues administered flu vaccines to caregivers and control subjects and compared the numbers of antibodies — proteins involved in immune reactions — that the two groups produced in response .
Only 38 percent of the caregivers produced what is considered an adequate antibody response compared to 66 percent of their relaxed counterparts , suggesting that the caregivers ' immune systems were n't doing their jobs very well — and that the stress of caregiving ultimately put them at an increased risk of infection .
If stress affects immune responses , then it should also affect how well the body heals itself .
In one particularly cringe - worthy study , Kiecolt - Glaser and her colleagues afflicted a group of caregivers with small arm wounds using a tool dermatologists use to perform skin biopsies .
The caregivers ' wounds took 24 percent longer to heal than wounds that they had afflicted to non-caregivers .
Okay , but what if caregiving is n't an accurate proxy for stress ?
To explore other stressful situations , Kiecolt - Glaser and colleagues performed another experiment in which they produced tiny lesions in the mouths of — quite appropriately — 11 dental students at two different points in time .
Once was during their summer vacation , when they were relaxed , and once was during the fall , several days before a difficult exam .
The lesions done before the exam took from two to eight days longer to heal than the summer wounds .
For some subjects , the exam wounds took nearly twice as long to get better .
Ouch .
How Stress Hurts
It might seem counterintuitive , but Kiecolt - Glaser believes that stress makes our immune systems less effective because it actually elicits an immune response itself .
Stress , she says , causes the body to release pro-inflammatory cytokines , immune factors that initiate responses against infections .
When the body produces these cytokines over long periods of time — for instance , as a result of chronic stress — all sorts of bad things can happen .
Not only does it hamper our body 's ability to fight infection and heal wounds , but chronic inflammation also increases our risk of heart disease , osteoporosis , and autoimmune diseases including type 2 diabetes .
What 's more , because regular stress causes a chronic immune response , it can also increase a person 's risk for allergies , which occur when the body elicits a chronic immune response against something that 's not really dangerous ( like pollen ) .
In her most recent study , announced yesterday , Kiecolt - Glaser found that when people are under lots of stress — for instance , when they are forced to deliver a speech or do difficult math problems on the spot — their allergies worsen over the course of the next day .
I admit , this post may not exactly have the intended effect — worrying about the danger of stress is definitely stressful — but take a deep breath .
If you ask me , learning a few relaxation techniques sounds like a more appealing illness - prevention strategy than many other alternatives .
( Go ahead and throw away that cod liver oil . )
Indeed , the next time you feel guilty about enjoying a lazy Sunday , or taking a day off from work for the heck of it , think again .
Your body will thank you for it .

Prosecutors seek to slash Abramoff prison term Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department on Wednesday recommended a dramatic reduction in the prison sentence of imprisoned lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who became the key witness against lawmakers and congressional aides he spent years corrupting .
Prosecutors asked federal judges in Washington and Florida to shave years of prison time off his sentence , citing his work in an FBI investigation that sent numerous powerful people to prison and contributed to the Republican Party 's loss of Congress .
" It is appropriate given Abramoff 's extraordinary cooperation to date , cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of Congress , five high - level legislative branch officials , one high - level executive branch official and two other mid- to low - level public officials , " Justice Department prosecutors said in documents filed in Washington 's federal court .
In 2006 , Abramoff began serving nearly six years in prison for a fraudulent Florida casino deal .
On top of that , he faces about 11 years in prison when he is sentenced next week for corrupting Capitol Hill lawmakers with expensive meals , golf junkets , luxury sports tickets and other gifts .
The Justice Department is asking for a much more lenient sentence .
Prosecutors asked that the Florida sentence be reduced to less than four years .
They asked a federal judge in Washington to sentence Abramoff to five years and four months , with credit for the two years he has served in the Florida case .
That means Abramoff could be eligible for release sometime in 2011 .
Defense attorney Abbe Lowell asked for even less time , saying Abramoff has reviewed more than 500,000 documents and spent more than 3,000 hours working with the Justice Department over the past three years .
Abramoff 's cooperation helped send former Rep. Bob Ney , R - Ohio , and former Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles to prison .
In court documents , Lowell hinted that others may soon follow , saying Abramoff " assisted with the government 's investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged . "
Abramoff 's sentencing Sept. 4 will be his first court appearance in years .
Because nearly everyone in the corruption case has so far pleaded guilty rather than going to trial , Abramoff has not had to take the witness stand and tell his story .
He will get the chance to speak next week before U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle .
She has shown leniency in the case when defendants show genuine remorse , but she has shown little patience for those who arrive in court with excuses .
She chastised Griles for ducking responsibility and issued a 10 - month prison sentence that was twice what had been proposed .
David Safavian , the former chief of staff for the General Services Administration , is the only person to go to trial in the case .
He was convicted of lying about his relationship with Abramoff , but an appeals court threw out some of the charges and ordered a new trial on others .

Children and teenagers are five times more likely to get brain cancer if they use mobile phones , startling new research indicates .
The study , experts say , raises fears that today 's young people may suffer an " epidemic " of the disease in later life .
At least nine out of 10 British 16 - year - olds have their own handset , as do more than 40 per cent of primary schoolchildren .
Yet investigating dangers to the young has been omitted from a massive £ 3.1 m
British investigation of the risks of cancer from using mobile phones , launched this year , even though the official Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research ( MTHR ) Programme – which is conducting it – admits that the issue is of the " highest priority " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Despite recommendations of an official report that the use of mobiles by children should be " minimised " , the Government has done almost nothing to discourage it .
Last week the European Parliament voted by 522 to 16 to urge ministers across Europe to bring in stricter limits for exposure to radiation from mobile and cordless phones , Wi-fi and other devices , partly because children are especially vulnerable to them .
They are more at risk because their brains and nervous systems are still developing and because – since their heads are smaller and their skulls are thinner – the radiation penetrates deeper into their brains .
The Swedish research was reported this month at the first international conference on mobile phones and health .
It sprung from a further analysis of data from one of the biggest studies carried out into the risk that the radiation causes cancer , headed by Professor Lennart Hardell of the University Hospital in Orebro , Sweden .
Professor Hardell told the conference – held at the Royal Society by the Radiation Research Trust – that " people who started mobile phone use before the age of 20 " had more than five - fold increase in glioma " , a cancer of the glial cells that support the central nervous system .
The extra risk to young people of contracting the disease from using the cordless phone found in many homes was almost as great , at more than four times higher .
Those who started using mobiles young , he added , were also five times more likely to get acoustic neuromas , benign but often disabling tumours of the auditory nerve , which usually cause deafness .
By contrast , people who were in their twenties before using handsets were only 50 per cent more likely to contract gliomas and just twice as likely to get acoustic neuromas .
Professor Hardell told the IoS : " This is a warning sign .
It is very worrying .
We should be taking precautions . "
He believes that children under 12 should not use mobiles except in emergencies and that teenagers should use hands - free devices or headsets and concentrate on texting .
At 20 the danger diminishes because then the brain is fully developed .
Indeed , he admits , the hazard to children and teenagers may be greater even than his results suggest , because the results of his study do not show the effects of their using the phones for many years .
Most cancers take decades to develop , longer than mobile phones have been on the market .

The research has shown that adults who have used the handsets for more than 10 years are much more likely to get gliomas and acoustic neuromas , but he said that there was not enough data to show how such relatively long - term use would increase the risk for those who had started young .
He wants more research to be done , but the risks to children will not be studied in the MTHR study , which will follow 90,000 people in Britain .
Professor David Coggon , the chairman of the programmes management committee , said they had not been included because other research was being done on young people by a study at Sweden 's Kariolinska Institute .
He said : " It looks frightening to see a five - fold increase in cancer among people who started use in childhood , " but he said he " would be extremely surprised " if the risk was shown to be so high once all the evidence was in .
But David Carpenter , dean of the School of Public Health at the State University of NewYork – who also attended the conference – said : " Children are spending significant time on mobile phones .
We may be facing a public health crisis in an epidemic of brain cancers as a result of mobile phone use . "
In 2000 and 2005 , two official inquiries under Sir William Stewart , a former government chief scientist , recommended the use of mobile phones by children should be " discouraged " and " minimised " .
But almost nothing has been done , and their use by the young has more than doubled since the turn of the millennium .

Laxmi Das saved the money for her old age When 60 - year - old Laxmi Das recently deposited her earnings in an Indian bank in Calcutta , it was a bit more than the usual mundane money transfer .
Ms Das handed over 91kg ( 200 lb ) of coins - the produce of 44 years of hard begging - enabling her to open an account and qualify for a credit card .
Laxmi began begging near Hatibagan , a busy road junction in northern Calcutta , at the age of 16 .
Officials say she could have saved as much as 30,000 rupees ( $ 692 ) .
" She would spend frugally from her daily collection and save the coins .
She was very possessive about them , " says her sister Asha .
Ms Das saved the coins in iron buckets covered with jute bags at her home in a shanty town near the crossing .
In all , she collected four buckets of coins - of all denominations - some even minted as far back as 1961 and now clearly out of date .
" But we will accept those coins as well because she is poor and needs all our support , " said Central Bank of India spokesman Shantanu Neogy .
He says there is a directive from India 's Reserve Bank to accept all such outdated coins and reimburse the depositor in full .
' Unique savings '
Ms Das told bank officials that she had stored the coins for when she reached " old age " and needed a pension plan for when she was too old to beg .

She was encouraged to deposit the money by police who feared it could have been stolen from her home .
" It is not safe for her to have the coins in the shanty any more , now that people have come to know , " said police officer Baidyanath Saha .
" A bank account would be the best option for her unique savings . "
Bank officials say they are still counting thousands of her coins and still do not know the exact amount .
They say that there are " a lot of coins to count " .
Once her account is eventually opened , officials at the Central Bank of India will give her advice on how to use her money .
Ms Das chose to ignore - or did not know about - a thriving racket in this part of the world in which old Indian coins are smuggled and melted down in Bangladesh to make razor blades that sell for up to seven times their value as coins .
The scam has caused an acute coin shortage in eastern India , forcing government mints to cut down on the amount of metal they now use to make the coins .

Telecom - related stocks plummeted Monday after the $ 700 - billion rescue bill was voted down by the House of Representatives .
The $ 700 billion proposal championed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and

Chairman Ben Bernanke failed to garner sufficient votes to make it through the House .
The package , which would have set up a facility to use government money to buy troubled assets from financial firms , was voted down with an initial tally of 206 votes supporting the bill , and 227 against .
Without a bailout , fear swept over Wall Street that financial markets would seize , affecting any company that depends on banks to keep floating money .
Investors quickly fled from equities to the so - called safe haven of credit markets , sending shares lower .

Reusable Django apps have a sore spot right now : media .
Introduction
Django takes a hands - off approach to your media files .
Your project has two settings , MEDIA_URL ( the base URL where your media is located ) and MEDIA_ROOT ( the filesystem path where media files are stored ) .
The only thing it does with these is put FileField files under MEDIA_ROOT .
The rest – collecting the required files , serving them up somehow , and ensuring that they ’re loaded from MEDIA_URL in templates – is completely up to the developer .
This mostly works out great , since many sites will have a dedicated media server , and developers probably know better than Django which media files should be loaded where .
It is n’t perfect , however , because there is one thing Django could help with : collecting the required files .
The problem
Some Django apps – batchadmin , for example – distribute media ( CSS , images , JavaScript ) that is necessary ( or recommended ) for the app to work .
Doing this is currently ad hoc and annoying for both the app developer and the app user .
Since there is only one MEDIA_ROOT , the app ’s files have to get in there somehow .
How do they get there ?
Who knows , but the person installing the app has to do it manually .
Okay , now the app should be able to access its media , right ?
Maybe .
It depends , where did the user copy / link / move those files to , anyway ?
The app must now define its own settings so the user can tell it where they put the app ’s media files in MEDIA_ROOT .
The solution
The approach I propose is hopefully the simplest thing that could possibly work .
I think that approach is to just find all media files in the project ’s INSTALLED_APPS and put them in MEDIA_ROOT .
This idea has resulted in a collectmedia management command that can be run once by the user at installation or deployment time .
This way , if you have apps laid out like :
app1/media / app1/media/app1/ app1/media/app1/css/style.css
app1/media/app1/js/forms.js
app2/media / app2/media/app2/ app2/media/app2/css/fonts.css
app2/media/app2/img/icon.png
… then running collectmedia will let the apps reference their media like so ( in a template , for example ) :
{{ MEDIA_URL }}app1/css/style.css {{ MEDIA_URL }}app2/css/fonts.css
Just like with reusable app templates , it should be best practice to make a subdirectory under media with the same name as the app .
This way , app2 can override app1 ’s style by including a file with the path app2/ media / app1/css/style.css .
And just like with templates , when multiple apps provide a file with the same relative path , the app listed in INSTALLED_APPS first is selected .
This approach avoids having Django try to do any sort of dynamic dispatching of media files , because that would eliminate the advantage of using a media server completely independent of Django .
Speak up
If you have ideas or opinions on this matter , and especially if you want to see something like this included in Django , check out the relevant thread on the django - developers mailing list .
Laure Manaudou French Olympic Swimmer 's Photo Scandal
21 has been called the French Mermaid .
The Olympic swimmer currently holds the world record for the 400 M freestyle .
She won the gold medal at the 2004 Athens Games and became France 's first even gold medal winner in women 's swimming .
She also took home a silver and bronze .
The Olympian had a photo scandal after her ex boyfriend reportedly posted 20 photos and a video on the internet .
These events occurred in December 2007 , hours after she split with Italian swimmer Luca Marin .
Manaudou will compete in four events at Beijing : 400 M freestyle , 100M and 200 M backstroke and 4 x 100M Medley .

Safa 'a had a 12 - pound tumor that nearly took over all his body .
Doctors in Iraq had given up on the boy .

AMMAN , Jordan ( CNN ) --
Two - year - old Safa 'a gently holds his mother 's hand , a 12 - pound tumor bulging from his frail body .
The tumor is nearly as big as he is .
The Iraqi boy has come to Jordan for surgery with help from a most unlikely source : an 85 - year - old liquor tycoon living on the other side of the world .
" There is a real chance that Safa 'a may die during the operation , " Dr. Iyad Sultan tells the boy 's parents .
His mother , Manal , cradles her son's hand as she trembles inside the King Hussein Cancer Center .
His father , Mohammed , struggles with his words .
" We are afraid , " he says softly .
See photos of Iraqi children being saved at the Jordan facility »
Safa 'a was diagnosed in Iraq with Wilms ' tumor , the most common kidney tumor in children .
If caught and treated early on , the cancer has a high survival rate .
But by the time Safa 'a arrived in Jordan , Sultan says , it was a miracle the boy was alive .
" The tumor is massive , " Sultan says .
" The liver , kidney , intestines are all squished to the sides .
His lungs are very small .
It 's hard to believe he is able to breathe . "

The tumor prevented him from developing like other children .
" Sometimes when we see other children play , he starts to cry , " his father says .
" I do n't buy him certain toys like soccer balls .
Because he looks at me and when he throws it far away , he can't go and get it .
Even at his age , he understands . "
Safa 'a had received chemotherapy in Baghdad for a year , but the tumor kept growing , and doctors said there was nothing else they could do .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
" You know , he is my first baby , " Mohammed said from his modest Baghdad home at the time .
" I used everything I have to rescue my baby .
I tried to do something , but I can't . "
The boy 's treatment in Iraq became even more volatile as sectarian violence flared .
The family is Sunni , and the hospital treating Safa 'a fell under the control of the Mehdi Army , a Shiite militia loyal to radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
Traveling to the facility for something as simple as picking up the child 's medical records became impossible .
Watch the struggles of getting help inside Iraq »
About 6,000 miles away , in Boston , Massachusetts , Safa 'a came to the attention of Ray Tye .
A liquor distributor and philanthropist , Tye runs the Ray Tye Medical Aid Foundation with his wife , Eileen .
Their motto : " We will never stop caring . "
With the help of their friends , the couple formed the foundation five years ago after their son died of multiple myeloma , a cancer of the plasma cell that is incurable .
" I found out that all the money in the world could n't save him , but I did realize that money could save lives , " Tye says from Boston .
The foundation offered to foot the bill for Safa'a to travel to Jordan , even if the boy only had the slightest chance of survival .
The foundation also is paying the medical expenses of at least three other Iraqis at the Amman cancer center .
" The mission is to bring people to hospitals who have life - threatening problems and do n't have money .
I do n't care where they come from , " Tye says .
The Iraqi family then began the journey to neighboring Jordan .
Safa 'a is considered lucky to have a donor .
Each month , about two dozen desperate Iraqis end up at the doors of the King Hussein Cancer Center with little or no money for treatment , officials say .
See how you can make a difference
" The center is almost the only beacon of hope for patients seeking treatment for cancer , " says Princess Dina , director - general of the hospital 's foundation .
" We said we can not turn a blind eye to these patients .
They are pleading , ' Please help . '
So we can not just ignore that .
We do n't have the millions to cover so many Iraqi patients , so we said let 's try something else . "
The scope of the crisis prompted the foundation to establish the Iraqi Goodwill Fund .
It has raised more than $ 1 million and helped dozens of patients , but the need for such care far surpasses what the fund can do .
For many parents , the knowledge that their children did n't have to suffer so much is often too much to bear .
Iraq 's decrepit medical institutions can't deliver even the most basic health care , and the emigration of skilled medical professionals means that many curable diseases inside Iraq end in death .
" In many cases , children come with diseases who have just advanced to a level that you can't give any curable treatment , " says Sultan , Safa 'a 's doctor .
" If you saw the patients months earlier -- six , eight , 10 months earlier -- you can do many other things that now just are n't doable . "
One patient is 2 - year - old Mariam , who was born with an extreme and potentially fatal tumor on the side of her face .
Her young mother , Rasha , 22 , was deserted by her husband .
She had to fight to get her daughter seen by a doctor in Iraq ; the staff was too overwhelmed with the daily casualties .
" We tried to get her into a hospital in Iraq , and the doctor kicked us out , " Rasha says .
" There was shooting and firing outside .
We fought with the doctor ; we fought to get her in .
I lost all hope . "
The tumor grew to such a mass , it displaced Mariam 's eye , broke her jaw and burst through her scalp .
" I was watching my daughter die in front of me slowly , and there was nothing I could do , " Rasha says .
U.S. troops discovered Mariam , and through a joint effort with the Jordanian government , she ended up in Amman .
Now , little Mariam gurgles at her favorite nurse .
Small smiles play across her deformed face as her mother tickles her .
Back in the operating room , Safa 'a whimpers as his parents kiss him tearfully , fearing that it could be a final goodbye .
" We do n't know what will happen when we open Safa 'a 's abdomen and we take this tumor out , " the doctor says .
" Safa 'a has a chance of survival definitely , if he survives today .
So today is the most critical day in Safa'a 's life . "
The surgery lasted five hours , and the doctors called it a success .
The massive tumor was removed completely .
Safa 'a 's parents could barely express their happiness and gratitude .
" I can not put my happiness into words , " his mother says , laughing .
The boy 's father adds , " this is such a happy occasion .
You brought happiness into the hearts of parents . "
Safa 'a has a lengthy recovery ahead of him , but his parents know he is lucky to have a chance at life , thanks to the kindness of strangers .
" I will tell you the truth .
Tears come to your eyes .
You 're saving a life , " Tye says after hearing about Safa 'a 's successful surgery .
" When you look at somebody that had a life - threatening problem and you could , with money , save that life , you 've got to sit back and say you helped make this world just a little better , and that 's what it 's all about . "

Sociological research also shows that children from small immigrant communities and children of politically motivated immigrants are at educational disadvantage
WASHINGTON , DC -- Immigrants who seek a better life in Western countries may not be able to escape the influence of their home country when it comes to their children 's academic performance , according to findings from the October issue of the American Sociological Review .
Sociologists Mark Levels , Jaap Dronkers and Gerbert Kraaykamp find that large - scale influences such as country of origin , destination country and immigrant community play a role in educational outcomes for immigrant children in their host country .
The research , which looked at the mathematical literacy scores of thousands of 15 - year - old immigrants to 13 Western nations from 35 different native countries , indicates that economic development and political conditions in an immigrant 's home country impact the child 's academic success in his or her destination country .
Counter - intuitively , immigrant children from countries with lower levels of economic development have better scholastic performance than comparable children who emigrate from countries with higher levels of economic development .
Children of immigrants from politically unstable countries have poorer scholastic performance compared to other immigrant children .
" Adult political immigrants are known to face serious negative consequences that can be related to the political situations in their origin countries , " said sociologist Mark Levels , junior researcher in the Department of Sociology at Radboud University , Nijmegen , in the Netherlands .
" We found that these consequences carry across generations to affect their children 's educational chances as well .
Our findings therefore have urgent implications in countries that receive a large number of these immigrants . "
" Specific educational programs designed to counter the negative effects of political migration may be essential to ensure that the children of politically motivated immigrants achieve their full potential , " Levels said .
The study authors also analyzed the impact of policies and political conditions in destination countries .
In traditional immigrant - receiving countries such as Australia and New Zealand , they found that immigrant children academically outperformed their counterparts in other Western nations .
The authors theorize that this finding is likely the result of restrictive immigration policies that ensure that better qualified adults emigrate ( e.g. , those with employment and high levels of education ) , rather than a receptive climate toward immigrants or education policies designed to meet their needs .
The size and socioeconomic characteristics of immigrant communities also played a role in the academic performance of their children .
Children from immigrant communities with higher socioeconomic status relative to the native population had higher scholastic performance than those from other immigrant communities .
Likewise , children from large immigrant communities were more likely to perform better academically than children from smaller immigrant communities .
Data for this study came from the 2003 wave of the Project for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the first large cross-national OECD dataset to contain information on the origin of first - and second - generation migrants .
The sample was comprised of 7,403 15 - year - old immigrant children from 35 different native countries living in 13 destination / host countries .
Scholastic performance was based on PISA measurement of mathematical literacy scores .
Jaap Dronkers , professor of social inequality and stratification at the European University Institute in San Domenico di Fiesole , Italy , and Gerbert Kraaykamp , professor of empirical sociology at Radboud University , Nijmegen , co-authored the report with Mark Levels .

Judge Judy has a great aphorism : " If it does n't make sense , it is n't true . "
I could n't help thinking of Judge Judy - who is now the only person I really want to cross examine Sarah Palin - when reading this :
HANNITY : One last question that I did n't ask you : Did you watch Tina Fey on " Saturday Night Live " ?
PALIN : I watched with the volume all the way down and I thought it was hilarious , she was spot on .
HANNITY : Do you think you could play her one day ?
PALIN : Oh absolutely .
It was hilarious .
Again , I did n't hear a word she said , but the visual was spot on .
Do you believe a word this person says ?
I guess it 's obvious that at this point , I do n't .
Increasngly , she seems like a character in a Ricky Gervais comedy : caught in endless confabulations and not skilled enough to get away with them .

Why does it keep nagging me that the McCain Campaign is pimping Palin as McCain 's whore ?
The only benefit that she brings is that she is a novel candidate for the office .
Oh , and she is hot looking .

It bothered me why they picked her because although it looks like christian fundy kookiness ... there has to be more .
Then it hit me .
The Vice President is in charge of the NATIONAL ARCHIVES .
Who better than a puppet who obeys orders to destroy any traces Dick Cheney may have left behind ?
You know .
erase the evidence so he can't be tried in a court of law ?
In case he missed anything with that shredder truck parked at his house .
They also know McCain is going to die .
I wonder who their pick is for the next fill in when he does ?
It will obviously be another puppet presidency .
So tell me why we are feeding this crime syndicate another $ 700 Billion to shore up this next move ?
Why ?
Regarding the article here ?
I think it is simply WONDERFUL that you were able to reconstruct it .
Many have parked plenty of stories off line for use after they sweep Google .

It is becoming blatantly clear that any thought that Palin may face actual journalistic scrutiny will not happen .
The Fox and McCain spin machines will propagate some crisis ( probably a continuation of the economic crisis .
They felt free to put themselves first instead of country this last week ; watch for some GOP conspired collaboration to extend the crisis and therefore the Thursday debate must be suspended to devote all the similar desperately needed assistance of John McCain , blah , blah ..... ) .
McCain is such a drama queen ( aka : maverick in their spin ) and the game will continue ; they will not allow Palin to debate just as they have n't allowed her to face the media to date .
It 's the " God save the queen " strategy .

I 'm a Pat Buchanan " paleocon " who was swept up in the initial hype about Sarah Palin .
But it 's obvious that she 's not the least bit intellectually curious .
It 's painfully clear that she has no idea what she 's talking about .
She 's simply not smart enough to hold her own against the torrent of manipulators and ideologues infesting Washington .
Ann Coulter suggests that we " true " Republicans need to " get drunk and vote for McCain " .
I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to " get high and vote for Obama " .
I think I 'm going to be sick ...

Hmm ..
It seems to me that we should have Kucinich be the Speaker of the House .. cause we all know that McInsane is n't going to last more than a few months .. and if something bad happened to Palin at that point , well .. then Kucinich would be president .
I like that thinking ..

I ahve no doubt that Palin is not evil incarnate .
Heck , I 'm not sure I would n't mind having her as my own mom .
But as she has shown in her last couple of speaking engagements ( think interview with Couric ) , she 's not the most educated politician we 've seen in awhile .

Sarah Palin is simply as dumb as a plank .
She 's a useless fraud and a rotten person by any and all accounting .
She 's a joke .
No Right to be in the position she 's in what so ever .
And there is no excuse for her in any language .
She is a bad person for honestly thinking she Could do the job she 's applying for .
Plank .
She is n't attractive , hot or pretty , she 's a lot of cosmetics over a plain face .
Nothing special .
Stop saying she 's hot .
She is n't .
She 's a brittle , unintellegant hoax .
And we 're allowing it to be considered as Plausible .
Our standards have fallen to the basement and smashed a hole in the floor 1/2 way to hell .
And it is utterly contemptable for the equaly rotten McCain to actualy present her as the peoples # 2 and then lock her away from Scrutiny .
So we 're supposed to what , take your word for it John ?
You do n't want an informed electorate , John ?
You think she is n't ... ready ?
John ?
Hmmmm .
He thinks we 're stupid , like he is , and she definately is .
Send her back to her job at Burger King in Alaska and leave her out of the adult world of politics

Brad and the rest of you ,
We need someone to start looking into a new development .
The Social Security Administration has announced that it is shutting down it 's computer system for FOUR DAYS from Oct 10th through the 13th at the very time poll workers all over the United States will be racing against deadlines to verify new voter registrations by checking their social security numbers as required by law .
The Bush Administration has a proven track record of using the federal bureaucracy to sabotage the voting process ( see Justice Department , Lurita Doan , etc. , etc. ) and their doing it again .
You can read Sen .
Diane Feinstein 's letter to the head of the SS administration requesting reconsideration of that shut down at this link :
http://brennan.3cdn.net/...0d73f1d0d8_xfm6bl0sc.pdf
The burning question , of course , is who is behind this shutdown and why it has to happen at THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT JUST BEFORE THE DEADLINES FOR REGISTRATION !!!
This could cost lots of new votes - most of which are Democratic .
Pass this on to anyone you think should know .

I love Fox News .
They are so cool over there .
When I watch CNN or check other stations they are so into Obama that it makes you want to puke !
Look people .
Do you think that for one minute that any of these politcians make decisions for themselves .
They have all kinds qualified people in all aspects of government that they rely on .
After getting opinions from them then they base their decision .
Have you all been in a closet for years or what ?
Sarah Palin is a decent and moral and very smart lady .
All this national scene stuff is new to her but she is learning .
Right ?
Obama is still learning .
LOL
All politicians have TOP ADVISERS that they rely on .
She will be just fine if John McCain wins the White House this year .
John is a national hero and he loves his country and has all his life not just this year .
LoL
He does not hang out with crooks , liars and thieves and people who G damn America .

I watched Governor Palin in a debate with two other contenders in the Alaska Governor ’s race .
She held her own against both , one of whom was a former governor of the state .
She is no slouch , and those who continue to debunk her qualifications for the presidency really are n’t giving her a chance .
Sure , she ’s going to make mistakes , but she ’s been in the race for only a month .
Obama refused to give formal press conferences for many months , and I recall one he gave this year that was particularly disastrous .
On that occasion , he fled the stage after just a handful of questions .
Yet she ’s supposed to be a pro from day one and give unlimited contact to the press .
Why is the standard set so high for her and not for him ?
He ’s notoriously poor when speaking without a tele - prompter and needs to prep for days in advance of interviews or debates .
There ’s nothing to indicate that she wo n’t be able to do the job .
She just needs a little seasoning .

The Prince of Wales has warned the development of genetically modified crops risked creating " the biggest disaster environmentally of all time " .
In a passionate intervention on the issue of GM food , Charles accused multi-national corporations of conducting an experiment with nature which had gone " seriously wrong " .
He told the Daily Telegraph : " What we should be talking about is food security not food production - that is what matters and that is what people will not understand .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" And if they think also that somehow it 's all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out , because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time . "
Charles said relying on gigantic corporations for the mass production of food would threaten future food supplies .
And he said small farmers would be the victims .
" If they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable , unmanageable , degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out .
I think it will be an absolute disaster . "
Charles ' intervention comes at a time when soaring food costs and shortages are putting more pressure on the GM debate .
The price of food has been pushed up worldwide by poor harvests , some of which may be due to climate change , rising fuel prices , market speculation and the diversion of land into biofuel production .
The biotech industry says GM technology can be used to tackle hunger and poverty by delivering higher yields and reducing the use and therefore cost of pesticides .
And earlier in the year Environment Minister Phil Woolas suggested opposition to genetically modified crops may have to be rethought in the light of the global food crisis .
But green groups and aid agencies fear claims about the potential benefits are not being borne out in practice .
Critics say there is no evidence to show GM crops boost yields .
And they warn that rather than tackling poverty in developing countries , much of the GM crops grown - the vast majority of which are in North and South America - are used for animal feed or biofuels .
Charles , who has an organic farm on his Highgrove estate , told the newspaper he wanted to see more family run co-operative farms .
He denied this was trying to turn back the clock and said farmers must work with nature and not against it .
At the end of last month , scientists told the Government field trials of GM crops in the UK need better protection to allow researchers to assess their benefits .
They said the location and details of small - scale trials could be kept from the public to prevent them being vandalised by anti-GM protesters .
And they said the number of field trials had declined in recent years because of sabotage , damaging the UK 's ability to inspire innovation and commercial investment .
A Defra spokeswoman said : " As we have said many times , there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of GM crops in the future , and we welcome all voices in that debate .
" Safety will always be our top priority on this issue . "
I 've risen up and out of the ex-gay movement and have shaken off one lie at a time while embracing my innate wholeness and truth .
VLADIKAVKAZ , Russia , Aug 9 ( Reuters ) - Fighting gripped Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia for a third day on Saturday , but it remained unclear just who was in control of the rebel capital Tskhinvali .
Russia announced it had seized control of the city , but Georgia denied that , saying Tskhinvali was in its hands .
Separatist officials , who are supported by Russia , appeared to contradict each other .
Eduard Kokoity , self - styled president of the separatist region , said a " second attempt " by Georgian forces to retake the town had been beaten back .
" We set ablaze a lot of their military hardware , " he told Russia 's Interfax news agency .
But , as he spoke , Boris Chochiyev , deputy head of the South Ossetian government , told reporters that Tskhinvali was now in the hands of Georgian forces .
" The city has been lost .
We have been betrayed , " said Chochiyev , visibly shaken .
He gave no details .
A Tskhinvali resident calling himself Soslan said by telephone that Russian troops had never actually entered the city to take control of it .
" The Russians , their tanks and artillery , are outside the city .
They have not entered it , " he said , adding that he had seen several dead bodies on the streets .
" Everyone is hiding in basements .
No one is taking care of the bodies .
There are snipers everywhere . "
Russia said the death toll stood at 2,000 , and 30,000 refugees had fled across the border to North Ossetia in Russia .
A correspondent for Russia 's state Vesti television said there had been no fighting inside Tskhinvali , but that bouts of firing were resounding in the town .
Clashes erupted periodically on the outskirts .
Television footage showed scenes of destruction and commotion throughout the town , its streets strewn with rubble , burned out tanks and smashed vehicles .
Rubble and twisted metal piled up on street corners and in parks .

El secretismo que guarda Seat con su Exeo es infinito .
Los prototipos camuflados ruedan de noche en circuitos privados ( de día son mulas de prueba totalmente discretas ) .
Pero si los documentos que tenemos son reales , el secreto se hace público de un modo muy corriente últimamente : el registro del diseño en una oficina de patentes .
Haz click en la imagen para ampliarla .
Como ya sabíamos , el nuevo Exeo ( que no sustituirá al Toledo , es un modelo nuevo ) estará basado en la antigua generación del Audi A4 ( concretamente la B7 ) .
Seat ha personalizado su estética exterior , básicamente en las partes frontal y trasera .
La parte delantera tiene un aspecto bastante novedoso , con unos pocos rasgos del nuevo Ibiza .
En la parte trasera , los pilotos se parecen a los que monta el Altea XL .
El diseño en general es bastante fiel a aquellos primeros bocetos que la misma
Seat hizo públicos hace bastantes meses .
Pero no es la única filtración que ha habido .
Haz click en la imagen para ampliarla .
Para romper aún más el secretismo , tenemos también la estética de la carrocería Sportourer , destinada a la familia .
Su estética difiere del Exeo sedán en la parte trasera , que hasta ahora no habíamos visto si no en recreaciones .
Los pilotos posteriores son semejantes a los que monta la otra carrocería .
Este hecho seguramente hará daño a Seat .
Pero ¿quién sabe ?
Quizá gracias a eso la marca se anima a publicar las fotos oficiales ( que seguro que ya están hechas ) más temprano .

Bicycle advocate Alex Thompson wrote on his blog that he ran various red lights last night in Santa Monica .
He explains his actions .
" Because the decrepit signals would n’t change for me .
Every time I visit Santa Monica City Council I run the light in front of the Police Department .
I wait and wait and wait before I realize that the signal is not going to change for me .
Then I look around , make sure there are n’t any police about , and I run it . "
He noted that there was " supposedly " a law allowing people to run a red light if it is not changing .
" I ’m not looking to have that conversation with a cop , " he said .
It 's true , the California Vehicle Code does have something for this :
21800 ( d ) ( 1 ) The driver of any vehicle approaching an intersection which has official traffic control signals that are inoperative shall stop at the intersection , and may proceed with caution when it is safe to do so .
This subparagraph shall apply to traffic control signals that become inoperative because of battery failure .
Of course , it 's very interpretive .
How long does one have to wait for it to equal inoperative ?
How does one know when it is battery failure ?
If a light changes for a car , but not a bicycle , does that make it inoperative ?

Metal Gear * creator Hideo Kojima would n't be averse to seeing the PSP's Metal Gear Acid series eventually make the jump to the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title .
" I 'll say yes to that idea , but not because it is already running or anything , " Kojima told Eurogamer when asked whether he was planning on porting the games over to the PS3 .
" I 'm just saying yes because it 's possible , I think it is possible .
Sorry to say we do n't have specific plans at the moment , but it is possible , yes . "
The Metal Gear Acid series has you controlling Solid Snake in a turn - based stategy game in which all moves are done by use of a deck of playing cards that you build before going on missions .
It 's not much of a confirmation , or even a promise , but yes , it sounds like he 's certainly be open to the " possibility " of an eventual port .
I 'm a big fan of the games , especially the sequel , and though
I would n't really care for a port , I 'd definitely love to see the series continue on the PS3 with an updated graphical look .

Click to viewWill we see Maggie Gyllenhaal 's Rachel Dawes in any potential sequel to The Dark Knight ?
Certain rumors are saying that we will , although she may be going under a much more familiar guise than we 've seen her so far .
Explanations and Dark Knight spoilers under the jump .

Hollywood Newsroom is claiming that any and all rumors that Angelina Jolie may be playing Catwoman in a potential third Chris Nolan Batman movie are false ... because Maggie Gyllenhaal will be taking on the catcowl next :
Regarding Batman 3 rumors , we 're not going to guess if the next super villain is the Riddler ( Johnny Depp ) or the Penguin ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) .
That 's all speculation at this point .
But we do know two facts , Maggie Gyllenhaal and Aaron Eckhart signed on for two Bat - pictures .
We 're not going to talk The Dark Knight spoilers , but hmmm .
Nine lives indeed .
Our source close to Maggie Gyllenhaal confirmed that she 's excited about the next movie , " why else would she , or Katie Holmes for that matter , take on the thankless roll of Rachel Dawson ?
After Katie left the roll , they could 've create a new character .
But that was n't part of Nolan 's plan .
This is the trajectory he 's planned for Rachel since the first movie .
Not only is Maggie contractually obligated , but she 's already getting in shape for Batman 3 . "
Advertisement
Before you get too excited , bear these two things in mind : Firstly , Rachel got blown up and is dead , people .
Okay , so there are some ways around that ( Ra 's Al Ghul , the villain from Batman Begins , has a certain way around death in the comics , after all ) , but so far Nolan has stayed away from openly superhuman / supernatural elements .
More importantly , however , screenwriter on the movies David Goyer has already said that we wo n't be seeing Catwoman ( or , for that matter , the Penguin ) in the next movie :
Batman has been published for 70 years .
In the first movie , we used Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow , who had not been in the movies before , and had not been in the '60s TV show before ...
There are dozens if not hundreds of other characters that fit that bill .
Everyone says it 's got to be the Penguin or Catwoman [ in the next film ] ... well I completely disagree .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
So , there you go : No Angelina Jolie , no Maggie Gyllenhaal , and no Catwoman at all .
Now , Johnny Depp as the Riddler ?
Unlikely ... especially considering that Nolan has said that he's not even thinking about a third movie right now .
But who could 've seen Ledger as the Joker before it was announced ?

Code reviews are the single biggest thing you can do to improve the quality of your code , as Jeff Atwood says .
Code reviews force you to show your code and justify your design decisions to someone else , and the extra set of trained eyes can reduce a large number of costly defects .
But how can you be sure that your code reviews are as effective as many claim them to be ?
Of course , this is entirely dependent on if they are done right .
I generally distrust the “ bring the coworker to your desk and explain your code by talking at them while they nod ” approach .
Code reviews done right are the ones where your peer has to actually read the code and understand it for themselves .
I like the approach of zipping up the changed files and emailing them to the reviewer with a short summary of the changes .
Not only is this a non-blocking operation that lets me go on to other work , but it forces me to write clear comments and documentation that will make sense to someone who does not have the luxury of asking questions to the original author .
A good visual diff program to compare the changed source file to the one currently checked into source control lets the reviewer surmize the changes .
After a while , they email me back a few questions and suggestions or the code with changes of their own .
Sometimes .
Most of the time , they send me an email that looks like this :
Al ,
Looks good .
Check it in .
These emails are a nice ego boost and reinforce the idea that I am the world ’s best programmer .
But after a while , the neurotic paranoid in me began to wonder how close of an eye they were putting on my code .
Especially after a few times where I noticed bugs right before I checked in the supposedly reviewed code .
So I came up the concept of Jester bugs .
Jester is a unit test tester for Java .
It works by making a syntactically correct change to the original source code under test , compiling it , and then running the unit test suite .
If the unit test suite results in everything being A - okay , then you know that the test suite is flawed because it missed the monkey wrench that was thrown into the code .
Jester bugs are bugs that you intentionally introduce into your code , to see if your code reviewer is really spotting bugs in your code or just giving it a pass .
I ’m open to suggestions , but I ’ve nailed the process down to the following :
Back up your original changes before adding any Jester bugs to them .
Flip a coin .
Heads means you add one bug , tails means you add two bugs .
Having a predictable number of bugs will signal the reviewer at what point they can stop “ really ” looking for bugs in your code , so change up the number of Jester bugs .
Add some bugs to your code .
These bugs should produce runtime errors , and should not produce any compiler / linker warnings or errors .
Some of my traditional ones are : Forgotten break statements in switch statements
Infinite loops
Adding completely unused parameters
Substituting subtraction for addition ( or vice versa )
Get ideas for bugs from actual bugs that you ’ve made that were spotted in previous reviews .
Change them up , and use appropriate bugs for whatever language you are using .
A very subtle bug would be code comments that describe the opposite of what the code really does .
Write down your bugs somewhere .
I keep a work log that I type up my daily notes in .
You want this recorded somewhere , so that you can see if all of the Jester bugs were found by the reviewer .
Or so you can undo your Jester bugs if you lose your backup from step 1 .
Send your code to the reviewer .
If the reviewer comes back with saying everything is A - okay , then you know that the code needs to be reviewed again , either by that same person or by someone else .
The entire concept of Jester bugs is a bit sneaky , which is why its better to have it as a general policy instead of a unilateral decision by a developer .
There are some objections to this practice , but I do n’t see the merit in them :
Adding bugs to reviews will slow down the review process – Not really .
These bugs are the same things that developers should be checking for already .
Adding the bugs to the code takes minutes , so the only way this process slows us down is by forcing reviewers to actually review rather than skim .
Developers may accidentally check in code with Jester bugs – Also not really .
Writing down the bugs before sending the code off for review can ensure that all of them are removed before checking them into source control .
If Jester bugs are standard policy , then developers are less likely to forget whether they added them or not .
Reviewers may have their feelings hurt by missing Jester bugs in their reviews –
This attitude is what keeps many organizations from doing code reviews in the first place : developers do n’t like to have their work criticized and torn down .
But this unprofessional attitude is what keeps organizations from improving their quality in the first place .
After a while , reviewers will know the common types of Jester bugs and be able to spot them , making the whole point moot – Great .
Jester bugs are the identical the types of bugs that developers make by accident anyway .

Anyone who says their business " runs itself " probably owes a great debt of gratitude to a small army of software applications and Web services that tirelessly feeds the machine from behind the scenes .
From creating and storing documents and staying on top of e-mail to keeping the books and getting teams working together , it takes a lot of code to run a business , or at least to run it well .
But setting up your company is n't as easy as just fishing apps out of a barrel .
You want the best you can get , and at a price that is n't through the roof .
With capability and frugality firmly in mind , we rounded up 25 of our favorite software tools and Web services that we deem the best for powering small and medium - size businesses .
Of course , not every business needs every type of program or service , but if your small business could use some help in any of the categories below , our list will give you a pretty good shot at picking a winner .
Accounting Software
Intuit QuickBooks Pro

Two Russian strategic bombers have landed in Venezuela as part of military manoeuvres , the Interfax news agency reported today , at a time when US - Russian relations are at their most strained since the cold war .
Interfax cited a Russian defence ministry statement as saying the two Tu-160 strategic bombers landed today to carry out training flights over neutral waters in the next few days before returning to Russia .
The arrival of the Russian strategic warplanes in what the US considers its backyard followed a statement at the weekend by the Venezuelan government saying that four Russian ships would participate in joint exercises in the Caribbean this year .
The US sought to make light of that announcement .
A US state department spokesman , Sean McCormack , said that if Russia really intended to send ships to the Caribbean , " then they found a few ships that can make it that far " .
Venezuela said a taskforce including four Russian naval ships and 1,000 Russian military personnel would take part in mid-November exercises with Venezuelan frigates , patrol boats , submarines and aircraft .
News of the planned exercise came shortly after Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister and former president , warned that Nato 's deployment of several warships to the Black Sea in the aftermath of Russia 's invasion of Georgia last month would not go unanswered .
The Russian agreement to send planes and ships could be seen as part of a campaign by the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chávez , who never loses an opportunity to take a jab at the US , to build up his military .
Chávez has been on an arms - buying spree and has proposed a hemispheric South American defence council aimed at the US .
Thanks to high oil prices , Venezuela – a member of the Opec oil cartel - has been able to spend $ 4bn ( £ 2.2bn ) on weapons since 2004 .
Bought mostly from Russia , the arms included the purchase of 53 Russian helicopters and 24 Sukhoi fighter jets .
Venezuela is buying the rights and technology for a Kalashnikov assault rifle factory near Caracas .
During a visit to Russia in July , Chavez said the two countries had formed a strategic partnership and he was buying a Russian missile defence system to thwart a potential US air attack .
Venezuela is reported to be considering buying as many as five diesel - powered Russian submarines .
The deal would make Venezuela the region 's top naval force .
Last year when he was still president , Putin said Russia would permanently resume long - distance patrol flights of strategic bombers , which were suspended in 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Since then , there have been several incidents in which British fighter planes have scrambled to intercept Russian warplanes .
( Adds details on term auctions , swaps from Fed statement )
WASHINGTON , Sept 29 ( Reuters ) - Major central banks threw more resources at a deepening credit crisis on Monday , announcing a $ 330 billion expansion of reciprocal currency swap arrangements to boost U.S. dollar liquidity .
The Federal Reserve said in a statement that the action will increase the swap lines with the European Central Bank and eight other central banks to $ 620 billion from $ 290 billion previously .
The Fed also said it would expand term funding auctions to head off a possible year - end cash crunch at financial institutions .
“ Central banks will continue to work together closely and are prepared to take appropriate steps as needed to address funding pressures , ” the Fed said in the statement .
For its part , the Fed said it would increase the size of 84 - day maturity Term Auction Facility loans to $ 75 billion per auction from $ 25 billion , beginning with the Oct. 6 auction .
This will double the amount of term auction credit available in the 84 - day and 28 - day loans to $ 300 billion from $ 150 billion .
In addition , the Fed said it will hold two “ forward ” TAF auctions totaling $ 150 billion that will be conducted in November to reassure market participants that term funding will be available over year - end .
The timing of these auctions will be determined after consulting with institutions that use the TAF program .
The increased central bank swap lines will allow dollar liquidity of up to $ 240 billion provided by the ECB , $ 30 billion by the Bank of Canada , $ 80 billion by the Bank of England , $ 120 billion by the Bank of Japan , $ 15 billion by Danish central bank , $ 15 billion by Norway ’s central bank , $ 30 billion by the Reserve Bank of Australia , $ 30 billion by the Swedish central bank and $ 60 billion by the Swiss National Bank .
Dollar funding rates outside the United States have are higher than those available domestically , reflecting a structural shortfall abroad .
“ The increase in the amount of foreign exchange swap authorization limits will enable many central banks to increase the amount of dollar funding that they can provide in their home markets , ” the Fed said .
“ This should help to improve the distribution of dollar liquidity around the globe . ” ( Reporting by David Lawder ; Editing by Tom Hals )
Consider it McCain ’s own personal bail - out plan for Wall Street .
From David Corn at Mother Jones :
[ T ]he Democratic National Committee , using publicly available records , has identified 177 lobbyists working for the McCain campaign as either aides , policy advisers , or fundraisers .
Of those 177 lobbyists , according to a Mother Jones review of Senate and House records , at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks .
These are high - paid influence - peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation ’s capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks , securities firms , hedge funds , accounting outfits , and insurance companies .
Their clients have included AIG , the newest symbol of corporate excess ; Lehman Brothers , which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin ; Merrill Lynch , which was bought out by Bank of America this week ; and Washington Mutual , the banking giant that could be the next to fall .
Among these 83 lobbyists are McCain ’s chief political adviser , Charlie Black ( JP Morgan , Washington Mutual Bank , Freddie Mac , Mortgage Bankers Association of America ) ; McCain ’s national finance co-chairman , Wayne Berman ( AIG , Blackstone , Credit Suisse , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac ) ; the campaign ’s congressional liaison , John Green ( Carlyle Group , Citigroup , Icahn Associates , Fannie Mae ) ; McCain ’s veep vetter , Arthur Culvahouse ( Fannie Mae ) ; and McCain ’s transition planning chief , William Timmons Sr. ( Citigroup , Freddie Mac , Vanguard Group ) .
Less a manifesto , and more a notverymanlyfesto , as this is very much a tech - centric list .
If you want thoughtful game theory , you ’ve got the wrong nitpicker .
The PC is the best gaming platform in the world – but it could be better still .
While it ’s great that the PC does n’t have to suffer quite the same degree of standardisation as its locked - down console brethren , we have nevertheless fallen into certain patterns of how we game .
There are things we take for granted and thus expect , like WASD controls in FPSes and patches for bad bugs .
There are others still we should be able to take for granted , but ca n’t because the same damn - fool oversights happen again and again .
Even outside of the more obvious annoyances like referring to Xbox controls or including ridiculously draconian DRM ( which are both more a question of money than of thoughtlessness ) , a ton of stuff that any gamer could have told the developer was a glaring screw - up keeps on turning up in otherwise great games .
Here are just 10 of the worst offenders , 10 things that every single modern PC game should get right and has no excuse not to .
Please do suggest others in comments below .
1. Alt - tab support .
Perhaps the single greatest , but so often neglected , Must - have there is .
Just having rudimentary task - switching support in there is n’t enough ( hello - o Valve games ) – it needs to be fairly quickly and smooth , and included in the original release of the game , not in a patch down the line .
This should be as big a priority as graphics or sound .
Do n’t care if it ’s a massive pain to code in .
Do n’t care if you have to re-start the entire game from scratch to put it in .
Alt - tab is absolutely integral to the way we all use our PCs .
Half of us essentially live at our computers – we need to be able to task - switch to an IM window or an inbox or even another game in moments , not be locked into one program .
Frankly – if your game does n’t alt - tab , it ’s not really a PC game .
Possibly deserving an entry of its own , but in the name of keeping this list to 10 I ’ll include it here – all PC games should be able to play in a window .
I ’ve missed social events because someone ’s instant messaged me about going to the pub , but not bothered to phone or text when I do n’t get back to them right away because I ’m off in a game .
One day , the girl of my dreams will magically message me , and by the time I ’ve exited the game she ’ll have got bored of waiting and declared her love for my arch - nemesis ( I do n’t actually have an arch - nemesis , but I ’m working on it ) .
Then I will hunt down and kill the developer of whichever unwindowable game I was playing at the time .
They will appreciate why .
Window play is also necessary for 2D games whose resolutions ca n’t be changed – 800×600 pixels of pretty hand - drawn art look like roadkill in toontown when they ’re stretched over a 1680 × 1050 panel .
2 . Use standardised install and savegame folders
Everything goes in Program Files by default , please ( and , just as importantly , there needs to be an option to install anywhere the player would rather ) .
Do n’t have your game install itself into the root of C : \ or an obscure sub - folder , and when you do put it in Program Files do n’t stick it inside [ Publisher name ] \[ Developer name ] – just stick a folder directly in there under the game ’s name .
Gamers want to be able to find their game files easily , not have to Google for everyone involved in its creation just so they can work out what folder it ’s in .
This is doubly true of savegames .
We need to be able to back those suckers up in case of disaster or a Windows reinstall .
Know where STALKER hides its savegames in Vista ?
C: \Users\all users \documents \stalker -shoc , that ’s where .
Here ’s where games whose developers are n’t crazy stick their saves on my PC – C : \Users \Alec\Documents \My Games .
In other words , the standard My Games folder inside ( My ) Documents , a two - click , standard process to reach .
To find STALKER ’s saves , I have to dig through five separate sub - folders , in something I ’d never otherwise look at .
Who are these mythical ‘ All Users ’ ?
They ’re not me , that ’s who .
Even our beloved World of Goo fails at this .
The game goes into Program Files \World of Goo .
The savegame – and the savegame alone – goes into C: \ProgramData \2DBoy\WorldOfGoo. ProgramData ?
Worse , that ’s actually a hidden folder by default .
Gah !
3 . Automatically set themselves to your desktop screen resolution
Do n’t default to something horrid and archaic like 640×480 .
The vast majority of PC gamers use flatpanel monitors , and games running at anything other than their native resolution tend to look horrible .
Save us the hassle of changing the setting ourselves , but most of all save the less tech - savvy from having to work out what a resolution even is in the first place , or just putting up with a blurry screen because they ’ve no idea how to fix it .
Clearly , still allow the resolution to be easily changed to whatever the gamer wants , however : the game needs to support every res the monitor does .
4. Support widescreen resolutions .
Widescreen is n’t the future – it ’s the present .
Just look at the consoles for proof of that , or at the top hits for ‘ monitor ’ on Amazon .
And expecting us to edit an ini file or type in command lines does n’t count as widescreen support .
5. Uninstall in seconds .
Do n’t have it laboriously check every single damn file before it has the grace to remove ’em – just wipe the folder , pull the main hooks out of the registry and be done with it .
I uninstalled the FIFA 09 demo today , and it all but locked up my PC for ten minutes while it did its ridiculous , disc - churning thing .
Then I uninstalled the King ’s Bounty : The Legend demo , and it was gone in the blink of an eye .
That ’s the way to do it .
When I want someone to leave my house , I just want them gone – I do n’t want them hanging around on the doorstep making tedious chit - chat for half an hour .
Tied into this is installing neatly in the first place to ensure removal is simple – the game should all end up in one place , not explode tiny bits of itself all over the hard drive .
6 . Do n’t require the CD / DVD in the drive to play .
Again , we ’re talking about a PC , a device with hundreds of gigabytes of storage .
A game needing to look at a plastic disc entirely external to the game install folder whenever it runs is openly ludicrous .
I know it ’s for copy protection ’s sake ( and even so is of debatable effectiveness in this day and age ) , but the annoyance to legit customers surely outweighs a few extra lost sales before the inevitable no CD crack turns up anyway .
Requiring PC gamers to scrabble through a vast pile of discs just to play the game they ’ve already installed is contrary to the nature of the platform , and lures people towards less than legal solutions that may ultimately push them further towards piracy .
And you would n’t want that , would you publishers ?
7 . Keep the quicksave and quickload keys far apart .
Accidents happen , whether it ’s sausage - fingered gamer stereotypes or just furious keyboard - slapping in rage at another defeat .
Hitting quicksave when you ’re reaching for quickload is the worst thing in the world , including being licked to death by a pack of hobos .
If you set quicksave and quickload to F5 and F6 , you are not fit to be developing PC games .
F6 and F9 are fine – that ’s enough space to blame quicksaving just as you get killed on the player being stupid , not on developer thoughtlessness .
8. Escape means menu / pause
The button ’s actually called ‘ Escape ’ , for heaven ’s sake .
Why on Earth would a game ever bind a request to leave or pause the action to anything else ?
This needs to be standardised .
No -one wants to be miserably jabbing at random buttons one - by - one because the phone ’s ringing but they ’ve got no idea what brings up the pause menu .
And , because I want to keep this list PC - centric rather than generalist to all games , I ’ll mention cutscenes here rather than as a separate point .
Pressing Escape during a cinematic means I want to end that cinematic .
Literally , I want to escape this movie you are making me watch .
Please respect that button ’s purpose .
Please respect your players – and if you make any of your cutscenes unskippable , you do n’t .
9. Auto - backup quicksaves
Again , accidents happen .
Excited gamers hit quicksave when they think they ’re out of danger but a giganto - beast is just about to feast on their ankles .
Files get corrupted .
And then you ’re screwed , with no option than to rewind potentially hours of progress .
So whenever the player hits quicksave , the game should keep a copy of the last one in case of disaster .
The last two , ideally .
It ’s just common sense , and surely an incredibly simple process .
10 .
Patches should fix , not break
If your patch renders savegames from previous versions of the game inoperable , it ’s just not ready for release .
If people have to restart a game from the very beginning because of this , they will hate and distrust you for it .
If there ’s honestly no way around this , because the under - the - hood changes really are that absolute , then the patch needs to say as much in giant red letters when it ’s run : “ INSTALLING THIS WILL BREAK YOUR SAVES . OK ? ” A footnote in the readme file is not enough .
Better yet , the lead designer should show up at the door of anyone installing the patch with a box of chocolates and an apologetic hug .
Stepping away from savegames , if your patch introduces new problems then it ’s hardly a patch , is it ?
Test it to death before you let it into the wild – remember that Eve update which deleted critical Windows files ?
Such a thing can not be allowed to ever happen again .
The Speed Vest
September 18 , 2008 By Paul Wagorn
Sometimes someone comes up with something that makes everyone else think “ Why did n’t I think of that ? ”
Have you ever outpaced cars and been honked at ?
Had a car almost wipe you out while making a turn ?
Do you ever ride your bike so fast that you wish that everyone else could know how close to the speed of light you were ?
Or sometimes are you riding your bike , cars honking impatiently behind you , wishing that they knew you were actually going more than 10 mph ?
Or maybe you just want to show off to your buddies that you left in your dust !
Enter … the speed vest !
Brady Clark and Mykle Hansen have invented a wearble speedometer which displays your current speed in large numerals on your back .
Made for cyclists , it uses a sensor on your wheel to send a signal to a microcontroller that then turns the numbers on and off on the back of the vest
When asked about the inspiration for the vest , Brady said “ [ I was ] riding my bike down a steep hill one day and “ taking the lane ” ( riding in the middle of the traffic lane ) so that no cars could pass me too closely , I thought -
Some people must really be pissed at me - I wonder if they knew I was going 25 + mph they ’d think the same . ”
“ we ’re trying to learn how it can best be used as an advocacy tool for bicycling .
I do n’t mean racing - I ’m talking about sharing the road safely with motorists .
Mykle and I are both lucky to live in cities that have invested in building and retrofitting streets to be more amenable to biking on .
Unfortunately even in Portland ( # 1 bike city in the nation ) and Minneapolis ( # 2 ) there are missing connections in what would be an ideal network .
I ’m hoping that by riding the Speed Vest in these areas of deficit that we could lay the groundwork for making these connections before any pen hits paper or paint hits the street . ”
Here ’s a video demonstrating the speed vest in action :
The speed vest is n’t yet available commercially and only a limited number of speed vests have been made as Brady and Mykle are still trying to decide on whether or not they wish to put more energy into the project as a commercial venture ; however they are talking to manufacturers and other companies who are excited about the project , so we might see something in the near future .
Mykle has a fantastic site that describes the speed vest in more detail , including pictures describing how it was made and how it works .

Then maybe people would stop getting so pissed off at me for riding at the speed limit .
Hey , that not only helps cars to know your speed , it also helps them to SEE you - so it's also a great safety invention !

Reader Michael forwarded the current issue of The Energy Report by Phil Flynn at Alaron .
It contends that demand destruction is proceeding at a rapid pace .
It also highlights an issue discussed in a recent research report by Deutsche Bank , that energy demand forecasts by recognized bodies such as the EIA have been high , and by a considerable degree .
From The Energy Report :
It seems like Mother Nature is the only thing supporting this market as demand destruction might have more long term impact on the market than anything Gustav can throw at us .
Even after Katrina oil demand dropped and so too did prices ….
Take for example the news from the Energy Information Agency that revised downward its June oil demand by a stunning number .
The EIA said that US oil demand in June was 793,000 barrels a day less than previously reported .
That is down a whopping 1.17 million barrels a day from the same period a year ago and the lowest level for any June since 1998 .
That comes out to be 5.6 % less than a year ago … .
What is becoming clear to the market is the demand pullback in the US is rising to the level of historic proportions .
Even the EIA is now saying that the drop in demand should send oil below $ 100 a barrel .
The Chief of the EIA , Guy Caruso , said that prices could fall below $ 100 a barrel on slowing global demand and rising production in the US , Brazil and Canada , and from OPEC states such as Saudi Arabia and Angola .
While Caruso said “ most of the risk is on the upside , ” and that it was not the official EIA prediction but added that a scenario of falling oil prices is “ now closer to 50 - 50 ” if worldwide spare production capacity continues to increase from the current 1.5 million barrels per day ( b/d ) to 3 - 4 million b/d while global oil demand softens .
Caruso then says that that scenario is now more realistic than any time in the past five years .

If after reading the above , you think you have a real bug , file it - Going back to a more stable channel
If you decide to switch from Dev to Beta or from Beta to Stable , the new channel will be on an earlier version of Google Chrome .
You wo n't get automatic updates on that channel until it reaches a version later than what you 're already running .
You can uninstall Google Chrome and re-install from https://www.google.com/chrome to go back to an earlier version .
If you re-install an older version , you might find that your profile is not compatible ( because the data formats changed in the newer version you had been running ) .
You 'll have to delete your profile data .
Delete the User Data\Default folder ( see the Before You Change Channels section above for the location ) .
If you made a back up of your Default directory , you can then rename it to Default so that you at least restore some of your previous bookmarks , most visited pages , etc .
If the installer fails when you attempt to install an older version with a message indicating that your computer already has a more recent version of Chrome or Chrome Frame , you must also uninstall Chrome Frame .
After doing so , the newer version of Chrome should install without difficulty .

The release channels for chrome range from the most stable and tested ( Stable channel ) to completely untested and likely least stable ( Canary channel ) .
On Windows , Android , and Linux , you can run all channels alongside all others , as they do not share profiles with one another .
On Mac , you can run the Canary channel builds alongside any other channel , as they do not share profiles with other channels .
This allows you to play with our latest code , while still keeping a tested version of Chrome around . :
Early access releases ( Canary builds and Dev and Beta channels ) will be only partly translated into languages other than English .
Text related to new features may not get translated into all languages until the feature is released in the Stable channel .
Before you switch , you should make a backup of your profile ( bookmarks , most visited pages , history , cookies , etc ) .
If you ever want to switch back to a more stable channel , your updated profile data might not be compatible with the older version .
Make a copy of the User Data \Default directory ( for example , copy it to ' Default Backup ' in the same location ) .
The location depends on your operating system : Note :

Local governments in California and the United States have long had the power to declare property a public nuisance when their owners allow their land to become denizens of drugs , gangs , prostitution and gambling .
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors , following New York 's lead , is adding a new category : music and video piracy .
In an ordinance just adopted , the five - member board is declaring that piracy " substantially interferes with the interest of the public in the quality of life and community peace , lawful commerce in the county , property values , and is detrimental to the public health , safety , and welfare of the county 's citizens , its businesses and its visitors . "
The regulation was crafted at the urging of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America .
The county retains the right to shutter a property for up to a year for violating ordinance 13.90.010 and also gives local authorities the right to bring a civil action to " temporarily restrain , preliminarily enjoin , and / or permanently enjoin the person or persons intentionally conducting , or knowingly maintaining or permitting the public nuisance from further conducting , maintaining , or permitting such a public nuisance . "
Property owners who knowingly permit such activity can also be dinged $ 1,000 for each counterfeited work produced on the property .

Based on what I am seeing now , we are likely to see significant gasoline outages in the next few weeks .
These may not be as long - lasting as those with Katrina , but they may temporarily be more severe , at least in some parts of the country .
Diesel may or may not be a problem .
We are an exporter of diesel , so can theoretically reduce exports if need be .
Also distillate ( used for diesel ) supplies are currently at a more adequate level than are gasoline supplies .
Jet fuel stocks seem to be at a relatively adequate level , so shortages may not be a problem .
Shortly after Hurricane Ike hit , I wrote an article called Implications of a Ten - Day Refinery Outage .
It is a few days later , and we know a little more .
The purpose of this article is to give an update on the situation .
The DOE provides information with respect to refinery outages .
After examining these reports more closely , I realized that there are really three categories of refinery problems we should be concerned about ( I only considered two of these categories in my earlier analysis . ) :
(1) Shut Down = 100 % off line
(2) Starting Up =
This can continue for several days .
I have estimated that refinery capacity listed as " starting up " is 80 % off line .
(3) Reduced Runs =
This can occur either after starting up or when crude inputs are not available .
As in my earlier analysis , I have estimated that production is one - third off line .
I also discovered that by adding together refineries , it is possible to look at state subtotals .
This is helpful for seeing how quickly production is getting back online in Louisiana where production was primarily affected by Hurricane Gustav .
A graph of refinery shortfalls shows that only now , 19 days later , is production getting back to close to normal .
Figure 2 . Louisiana Refinery Shortfall
A graph of Texas refinery shortfalls shows that Hurricane Gustav ( September 1 ) had relatively impact .
Since Hurricane
Ike hit , refinery availability has been reduced by more than 3 million barrels a day .
Figure 3 . Texas Refinery Shortfall
If the pattern in Louisiana holds in Texas , it may take as much as 20 days after Hurricane Ike before all of the production is back on line .
It will certainly be at least 10 days .
This would put full production at something between September 23 and October 3 .
Pipeline delays of up to 18 days could delay full distribution of petroleum products until something between the first and third week in October .
Amount of Refinery Input Shortfall
How much of a shortfall have we been seeing to date ?
Suppose we compare the amount of crude oil used as refinery inputs in June , July , and August , with the amount of crude oil used as inputs during the week ended September 5 and the week ended September 12 ( both after Hurricane Gustav , before Hurricane Ike ) .
The calculation would indicate a shortfall in crude processed of 1.7 million the week of September 5 , and 2.0 million the week of September 12 .
( This calculation is based on the following : During the months of June , July and August , crude oil used as a refinery input averaged 15.2 million barrels a day .
During the weeks ended September 5 and September 12 , crude oil used as a refinery input averaged 13.5 and 13.2 million barrels a day .
Subtraction would suggest a shortfall of 1.7 million barrels the week of September 5 , and 2.0 million barrels the week of September 12 . )
In the future , as the impact of the Hurricane Ike shortfall feeds its way through they system , the shortfall of all products combined can be expected to be higher the weeks ended September 5 and 12 -- especially the weeks of September 19 and September 26 , when the Texas refinery outages are added in .
I would expect the shortfalls of crude inputs to be in the 2 to 3 million barrels a day range during these weeks , and possibly even into the beginning of October .
These shortfalls will take a while to work their way through the system , so we are likely to continue to see shortages for a few weeks .
Figure 4 . Refinery and Blender Net Inputs
Figure 4 shows that in 2005 , when Hurricane Katrina and Rita hit , refinery and blender net inputs dropped by about 1.7 million barrels as day between August and September , and then dropped another 300,000 barrels a day in October .
This reflected the combination of Hurricane Katrina ( August 29 ) and Hurricane Rita ( September 24 ) Based on my calculations , the drop in refinery and blender inputs between August and September of 2008 is likely to be a little over 2 million barrels a day .
( This assumes in the refinery capacity calculations shown in Figures 2 and 3 , the refineries would not be operating at full capacity if open , and that some of the shortfall can be made up with refineries elsewhere . )
This drop would be even greater than the Katrina decline , and would occur from a much lower base .
Assuming there is not another major hurricane in late September or October , production should bounce back more quickly than with the Katrina - Rita combination .
Gasoline Shortfall
As can be seen from Figure 1 , stocks of gasoline were at critically short levels by September 12 , the last date shown in the gasoline stock report .
Based the rate at which gasoline ( and blending stocks ) were dropping , gasoline supplies during the first two weeks of September were about 700,000 barrels a day short of keeping inventories at a constant level .
The next two or three weeks are likely to have even higher shortfalls of gasoline -- more in the range of 1 million barrels a day .
WIth the very low recent inventories , it is hard to see how there will not be shortages some places around the country .
How about Gasoline Imports
If we look at historical data , it becomes clear that we are already importing about as much gasoline as is available , and there is little room to ramp up imports .
Figure 5 . EIA Gasoline Imports ( No reduction for exports )
In 2005 , the US was able to increase imports by about 500,000 barrels a day in October .
In 2008 , we are already importing at a very high level .
The reason we are able to import gasoline is because European countries tend to use diesel as fuel for their cars , and because of this , there is gasoline left over form the refining process .
The amount that is left - over is not going to suddenly increase greatly , so it is unlikely that we could increase our imports of gasoline without drawing down the reserves of the exporting countries .
There was an article yesterday , US will not seek emergency supplies from IEA : DOE .
The reasons given were that the rate of recovery from Hurricane Ike should be fairly good , and importing gasoline from Europe will take until October , given the time needed to transport fuel across the Atlantic .
By that time , our supplies should be back up .
If there really is n't likely to be much available , that adds a third ( unstated ) reason .
Evidence of Gasoline Shortfalls
A map published by Gasbuddy shows that gasoline prices are higher in the Southeast and in the central part of the country .
Both of these are areas where pipelines are operating at reduced rates , or are partly shut down , according to recent DOE reports .
The reason why the pipelines are operating at reduced rates is because there is not enough refined products available , because of refinery closures .
Figure 5 . Gasbuddy Map showing variations is gas prices ( red is high )
There have been reports of $ 5 gallon gasoline in Connecticut .
One newspaper reports that 85 % of Nashville gasoline stations are without gas now .
Diesel and Jet Fuel
Both of these started with better inventories , so may have a little ways to go before shortfalls .
Also , with diesel ( actually distillate , from which diesel is made ) , we are a net exporter .
If we want more diesel , the easiest way would be to reduce our exports .
( If we were to ask IEA for distillate imports while we were exporting it , they would probably laugh at us . )
At ASPO - USA Conference
I am leaving for the ASPO - USA conference shortly after writing this , so will not be able to comment as much as usual .
Please forgive a few extra typos .
I wanted to get this posted before I left .
Edit
There are a lot of issues that I might have mentioned , but did n't .
One of the more important is the possibility that the pipeline system may be near minimum operating level , and that some sections will no longer function if the level gets too low .
The areas that would seem to be most at risk are the ones at the ends or lines , or on small spur pipelines .
If this should happen , residents in the areas affected areas might find themselves out of all types of refined products ( including diesel and jet fuel ) , unless they had extra supply stored in local supply tanks .
Additional supply could theoretically be trucked in , but we have a limited number of trucks for transporting fuel .
Colonial pipeline is one of the pipelines that has had difficulty with adequate supply .
The supply begins in Texas / Louisiana .
The areas I would expect to be most at risk are on the spur pipelines and farthest north .

I decided to try out this BlogHer that everyone 's so keen on .
So here 's a lil post I did especially for those folks .
( But I would never deprive you all of my rants .
That would be cruel . )
I feel as though I am beating a dead horse -- apologies to PETA -- but I just can't over how many people in this country act like truculent teens .
When you confront a teen about a mistake , chances are that they 'll apologize in a half - hearted way ( if they bother at all ) .
Then they want you to clean it up for them .
Because , after all , they 're still just kids , right ?
If you try to make them understand the gravity of the mistake , they roll their eyes .
Exasperation .
Maybe we did n’t push enough , and so they assumed someone would always clean up after them .
Or maybe it ’s just from living in a society that dips youth in gold and places it on an altar .
Maybe it ’s that adults now act more like children than ever :
Always buying new , flashy toys ; playing video games ; eating unhealthily .
Whatever the reason , this society is disinterested in owning up to mistakes – particularly if it means making things right .
It 's so much easier to blame others .
Obese ?
Fast food chains are at fault .
Upside down on your mortgage ?
The lenders gave you too much mortgage .
This sort of thinking is awfully convenient .
It allows you to walk away with no guilt .
Because it was n’t your fault to begin with .
Unfortunately , it also means you do n’t learn from your mistakes .
I know that some folks were duped into adjustable - rate mortgages but , by and large , people just wanted things that were previously out of their grasp .
And once it was within reach , they did n’t ask questions , did n’t look critically .
They just bought into the advertisers ’ hype that they “ deserved ” these things .
Here ’s my final bit of exasperation : “ Upside - down on your mortgage . ”
What does that mean exactly ?
Well , I know what it means .
But why does that situation somehow absolve you of any wrongdoing ?
Even with the housing price inflation of the past few years , how “ upside - down ” can you really be ?
I would be shocked to find anyone who can answer more than $ 50,000 .
My guess is , most people are maybe $ 10,000 - $ 20,000 short .
So why do they get to walk away from that responsibility ?
Why do they get to think that if they do n’t break even , they have no options other than giving up ?
They decided to get a house .
There ’s always risk with that : disability , prolonged illness , unemployment .
With most kinds of investment there is risk .
And they accepted that when they signed the papers .
Yes , $ 10,000 is a lot of money .
So is $ 50,000 .
But you can pay it back .
It will take time .
And they will be forced to cut back and do without .
But it ’s money they owe .
Why do they think they 're allowed to opt out because things did n't go according to plan ?
If you lose money in the stock market , you ca n’t walk away .
When you lose at a casino , you ca n’t go ask for a do - over .
You accepted the chance of losing at the same moment you accepted the chance of winning .
But in this country people think that they are owed a happy outcome .
When the unhappy news comes calling , they have plenty of excuses why they can't be bothered .
They point to children and say , “ We have to live somewhere . ”
Fine , rent .
Go for a small apartment .
They say they have too much “ stuff ” to fit into an apartment .
Uh , is n’t that part of what got us into this problem ?
Sell whatever you can and put the money toward the debt .
They say their kids need to go to college .
The kids will have to save on their own : holiday money , babysitting and a part - time job during the school year ( full - time in the summers ) .
They may still need to take out loans .
It happens .
We need to start convincing people to take responsibility .
We owe it to ourselves and to our children to stop this cycle .
Teach your kids that debts should be honored and that mistakes do have consequences .
Otherwise our future is not only full of annoying whining , but also pretty bleak .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Forget the Royal Navy and the U.S. Marines -- the ' computer navy ' is on its way , and digital media on the high seas are set to make a steaming comeback .
New home ?
Barges like this one could soon play host to Google 's massive data centers .
It seemed that floating media firms were a thing of the past when the United Kingdom 's last major offshore pirate radio station , Radio Caroline , followed other European and American examples and died out in the early 1990s .
But , fast - forward 20 years and enter Internet giant Google .
According to a patent application seen by London newspaper " The Times , " Google is considering launching barges up to seven miles ( 11 km ) offshore to host the massive data centers required to run its Internet search engines .
The plan would likely see the data centers -- which consist of huge supercomputers -- use wave energy to power and cool themselves while stationed at sea .
In the application Google states : " Computing centers are located on a ship or ships , anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured , and turned into electricity and / or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away . "
Energy consumption is undoubtedly a massive issue for these giant data centers .
The servers within each data center need to be air - conditioned to prevent overheating -- and considering a company such as IBM runs approximately eight million square feet of servers -- that 's a lot of required cooling .
According to a 2005 study by Stanford University consulting professor and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs staff scientist , Jonathan Koomey , the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005 .
The total annual worldwide power bill for the servers at the time was an estimated $ 7.2 billion , according to Koomey .
The Internet has continued to grow at a rapid rate and other major companies have also been searching for a more efficient method of maintaining their data centers .
Microsoft has looked into taking advantage of a cold climate by constructing a data center in Siberia , while Sun Microsystems is reported to be sending its computers down a former coal mine , using water below the ground as a coolant .
But , how workable is Google 's project , really ?
And does it mark a potential new future for the maritime industry ?
Dr Brad Karp , reader in Computer Systems and Networks at University College London , described the move as " an audacious risk " that will push the boundaries for major companies in future .
Karp said the project would carry significant risks , but potentially very high rewards .
" Anytime you take on several new technologies at the one time -- and you are trying to build something highly reliable -- there are going to be real technical challenges , which there will be for these data centers , " he said .
Some major benefits of Google 's project include being able to save money on rent and property taxes by being positioned offshore , as well as saving money on electricity bills .
" If you look at the percentage of power being used by these centers ... it seems like a good long - term bet for the future , " Karp told CNN .
Karp believes
Google could also benefit from snaring a " green " image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems , in addition to providing a quality service to users .
" One of the reasons Google has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are .
This will still allow them to do that . "
He said there were some logistical issues , but if the ships were stationed not far from the coast , they should not have too many operational concerns .
" At that distance ( 11 km ) you would want to provide wired network activity -- some sort of under - sea cable .
The sheer bit -rate needed for an operation like this is usually too high for most wireless systems , " Karp said .
Karp does point out there could be plenty of maintenance required on such a system : " The sea is not exactly a friendly environment for cables . "
Although some commentators have raised concerns about the ships leaving themselves open to attack , Karp did not feel it was a major issue .
" It 's not the kind of thing you see reported on very often .
Typically the kind of things we worry about more is network - based attacks . "
Current data centers are defended by corporate - type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances .
Karp envisages a similar level of protection for the centers at sea , potentially using a protective barrier or guarding vessels .
If this project is realized , it offers the potential to alter not only online commerce , but also introduces the potential for new strands of business in the maritime industry .
Maritime eCommerce Association spokesman Ake Nilson said : " So far as I know there is n't anything quite like it .
We have n't really seen anything like this since the old pirate radio stations . "
Nilson says that if the project goes ahead -- and more companies attempt to adopt a similar program -- it could provide a sizable boost to the maritime industry through the ships and workers required to establish , run , protect and maintain such operations .

A series of tough choices must be made at ground zero , which will delay some projects and raise the cost of completing the Sept. 11 memorial , the office towers and transportation center , according to a report released on Monday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The 34 - page report [ pdf ] offers a stark reassessment of the challenges that continue to face the reconstruction of the former World Trade Center site , nearly seven years after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Moreover , authorities revealed at a meeting of the Port Authority ’s board of commissioners on Monday afternoon that the planned National Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum would not be completed by 2011 — when the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks will be observed .
The new report detailed problems that have been known for some time , but with a tone of unsparing candor .
“ While significant progress has been made , the schedule and cost estimates of the rebuilding effort that have been communicated to the public are not realistic , ” the report ’s author , Christopher O. Ward , who is the Port Authority ’s executive director , wrote in a cover letter to Gov. David A. Paterson .
The report identified “ at least 15 fundamental issues ” that had not been resolved , among then the lack of final designs for the proposed World Trade Center Transportation Hub , which is intended to be the city ’s third - largest such hub , and for a proposed Vehicle Security Center ; the still - unfinished decontamination and dismantling of the former Deutsche Bank tower ; and the resolution of a land - rights issues involving the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church , which was destroyed on 9/11 .
Perhaps most pressingly , the report identified a need for “ a more efficient , centralized decision - making structure — a steering committee — with authority to make final decisions on matters which fundamentally drive schedule and cost . ”
In addition to the Port Authority , an alphabet soup of public entities are involved with the reconstruction , among them the Federal Transit Administration , the State Department of Transportation , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation — not to mention City Hall .
In response to those findings , the Port Authority , which owns the 16 - acre site , plans to establish a governing board that will for the first time involve all the various parties involved in what is currently a $ 15 billion rebuilding effort , including the developer Larry A. Silverstein , the memorial foundation , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , Goldman Sachs and Brookfield Properties .
The board will revise the budget and timetable and then coordinate the work .
Mr. Ward wrote in his cover letter :
We now stand at a crossroads in the rebuilding effort to achieve a fully rebuilt site on an acceptable schedule and within an acceptable budget .
This will require a new way of doing business as we move forward : a set of aggressive yet realistic schedule and cost estimates ; established priorities and intermediate milestones to which you and the public can hold us accountable ; a focused effort to control costs and identify sources to close funding gaps ; and a transparent , inclusive and central decision - making structure to coordinate this incredibly complex program and the work of the many stakeholders going forward .
The authority had embargoed the public release of the report until the start of its board meeting at 1:30 p.m. Monday .
Two officials who had read the report described it for The Times beforehand , and some details had already been published over the last week , most recently in The Wall Street Journal this morning .
According to the report , the schedule of each project on the site affects other projects on the crowded patch of land ; adjusting one , in turn , affects what happens at adjacent sites .
The report does not say how long some projects could be delayed or how much more the rebuilding effort will cost .
Construction on much of the site is affected by the long - delayed demolition of the former Deutsche Bank building , at 130 Liberty Street .
Only after the demolition is completed can work begin on a vehicle screening center , which serves the entire site and affect construction of three office towers on Greenwich Street , between Vesey and Liberty Streets .
The Port Authority and the other groups must also come up with a plan for rebuilding the Greek Orthodox church , which was destroyed in the terrorist attack .
A reconstructed church is planned for a portion of the site where the former Deutsche Bank building now sits .
The new governing board will also decided what to do with a reconstructed station for the No. 1 subway line and a train trestle that crosses ground zero .
The fact that the rebuilding of ground zero is behind schedule and over budget has long been known by top government officials but rarely acknowledged in public .
Indeed , a year - old report for the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center also suggested that there would be delays and cost overruns .
“ The World Trade Center site is so complex because of the infrastructure that runs underneath it and the requirements for rebuilding that no one should be surprised that the commercial development and the memorial will take longer than originally anticipated , ” said Mitchell L. Moss , a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University .
“ There was an overemphasis on speed which is being superseded by a more realistic timetable . ”
Professor Moss praised Governor Paterson , saying that he was “ taking prudent and responsible approach , which has been missing at the state level . ”
Many planners , officials and local residents insist that the dates and budget numbers were unrealistic the day they were announced by the Port Authority and former Gov. George E. Pataki , who made the rebuilding of ground zero a cornerstone of his administration .
Still , Julie Menin , chairwoman of Community Board 1 , which covers the former World Trade Center , said she was dismayed by the latest news .
“ For years , unrealistic deadlines were set , ” Ms. Menin said .
“ There seemed to be more interest in having press conferences declaring how Lower Manhattan would be rebuilt better than ever , than in establishing realistic deadlines and budgets .
Now we ’re in a situation where projects could be stalled , or years away from being completed . ”
Mr. Paterson said in a statement :
For the first time we have a candid , honest analysis of where the rebuilding effort stands and we have a roadmap for getting us on track .
I want to thank Chris and his staff for their excellent work .
Today this report will be made public for everyone to see .
Progress has been made – Ground Zero has gone from a standstill to a busy construction site but the rebuilding effort is not where it should be and it is not where we promised it would be .
I am not interested in assigning blame .
Instead , I am interested in fixing the problem so we can move forward .
That is why I have charged Chris Ward and the Port Authority with working with all of the various stakeholders to address the fundamental questions raised in this report and to provide me with a set of real schedules and budgets by September 30 to which both the Port Authority and I will be held accountable .
I believe that the victims ’ families deserve a memorial that is equal to the sacrifice and heroism displayed on that day and I believe that the City of New York deserves a reinvigorated site that secures our position as the economic capital of the world .
We have a profound responsibility to the families , survivors and everyday Americans who come to the World Trade Center site to mourn and remember .
We will fulfill that responsibility by finishing this project and we will tell the truth every step of the way .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , said in a statement :
After seven years of Alice in Wonderland fantasy plans , it ’s refreshing to finally be presented with a no - nonsense , realistic look at the challenges to progress at Ground Zero .
We will never get this done unless we take a good hard look at the facts and chart a sensible way to move forward with renewed vigor .
Governor Paterson was right to ask for this report and I am glad the Port Authority responded quickly and thoroughly .
Only by acknowledging these challenges head on will we be able to complete the rebuilding .
Sheldon Silver , a Manhattan Democrat and the speaker of the State Assembly , said in a statement :
I am pleased that the Port Authority ’s preliminary report on the state of the World Trade Center rebuilding effort is now in the public domain .
The report verifies what I have been warning for years : that the deadlines and estimates originally pronounced by the Pataki Administration were never achievable , and that the biggest obstacle to reconstruction was and is the inability of the City and the State to provide the unified and focused leadership necessary to advance this historic undertaking to completion steadily and efficiently .
If we have learned anything from the past , particularly from the tragedy at the Deutsche Bank building , it is that the community must be involved in every step of the rebuilding process .
There are difficult choices to be made and real progress must occur .
One of the first projects that must be completed for the men , women and the families who live in , work in and who visit Lower Manhattan is the construction of the Fulton Transit Hub .
We should not have to wait years and years for a project that can be moved forward now .
I am pleased that Governor Paterson is strengthening the state ’s commitment to Lower Manhattan and I am committed to working with Port Authority Director Chris Ward , the steering committee , and the LMCCC in bringing greater progress to the rebuilding effort .
I am confident that our ongoing discussions along with the requisite public hearings will produce a plan that will make wise choices , lead to real results , and place the rebuilding and revitalization of Lower Manhattan back on track .
Scott M. Stringer , the Manhattan borough president , said in a statement :
The truth is out there now – and as we all suspected the project is far behind schedule .
I give credit to the Governor and the Port Authority , who have proposed three things Ground Zero has lacked all along : a clear governance structure , a transparent way for the public to measure progress , and a direct line of political accountability .
They ’ve also prepared us for the fact that we are going to have to prioritize and make some very tough choices in order to achieve success .
We ca n’t have any more years of blaming and delay .
The impasse at Ground Zero is an international embarrassment that we must resolve .
Joseph C. Daniels , president of the National Sept. 11 Memorial & Museum , said in a statement :
The depth and candor with which Chris Ward and the Port Authority conducted this assessment is an important step forward in addressing the complexities of the rebuilding .
Confronting the challenges head - on and laying out a clear decision - making structure provides the best chance to expedite progress on the Memorial .
Doing everything possible to ensure we have a publicly accessible Memorial in time for the 10th anniversary of the attacks must be a critical part of this process .
Mr. Silverstein , whose real estate development firm is a key part of the reconstruction effort , said in a statement :
New Yorkers are entitled to an aggressive , reliable schedule for rebuilding the World Trade Center , backed by absolute accountability from the people responsible for getting the job done .
Governor Paterson and Chris Ward have shown real leadership in committing to candidly and openly address the challenges the Port Authority faces with the projects under its control .
As of today , my company ’s projects – Towers 2 , 3 and 4 – are fully designed and on schedule .
Construction of Towers 3 and 4 is underway , and all three buildings are slated for completion , as projected , by the end of 2012 .
As demonstrated by the success of 7 World Trade Center , as well as other recent developments in the area , Downtown is energized like never before .
It is vital that we maintain that momentum and finish the rebuilding .

There are no guardrails in Iceland .
At Gullfoss , a waterfall taller than Niagara Falls and a major international tourist attraction , there is only a thin rope stretched at shin height around the edge of the rock 6 inches away from white pounding oblivion .
The rock leading up to that rope — where all the best photos can be taken — has never been dry .
It ’s been slick with cold waterfall mist for thousands and thousands of years .
That rope might a well be made out of dental floss for all the protection it ’s offering .
Remarkably , nobody seems to mind .
There are only 300,000 people in all of Iceland , and not many of those are lawyers .
Our guide on a glacier tour said “ all the guides in Iceland have a joke .
We say that if you get into an accident and there ’s an injured American lawyer in your group , just finish him off right there .
Push him into a geyser or something and save us all the trouble of a long , drawn - out lawsuit . ”
Our snowmobiling guide told us before we headed up onto the ice : “ You may want to zig - zig on the ice on these things , maybe go real fast and spin around .
I ’m not telling you not to .
What I am telling you is that only 2 meters away from this track are crevasses and ice holes that go down to the bottom of the glacier , and they ’re really hard to spot .
If you fall in , nobody will come after you and anthropologists will find your body in a few hundred years .
If you do n’t fall in , but your snowmobile does , you ’re replacing the snowmobile .
And if you think beer is expensive in Iceland , try replacing a snowmobile . ”
I like that idea a lot .
Imagine : a society that assumes its members have a fundamental sense of personal responsibility and a basic intelligence .
There are no warning labels on toothpicks here , no giant CAUTION signs cluttering up the landscape .
The average Icelandic person is fairly intelligent , thoughtful , well - educated and gorgeous .
Even the drunken yobs in Reykjavik that punch billboards at dawn after a night of drinking have a sense of current events , of history , of cause - and - effect .
It could be that the public education here is vastly superior to the United States .
Or it could be that all the serious bozos are allowed to take themselves out of the gene pool by chucking themselves off of cliffs whenever they like .
If you happen to meet a stupid , ugly person in Iceland , be respectful but get away as fast as you can … they ’re marked for death .
Admittedly , this sense of libertarian freedom can go too far , too .
At Geysir , where hot cauldrons bubble and powerful geysers surge out of the earth , there is the same bit of dental floss urging the public to keep a respectful distance .
Nobody does .
People traipse right up to the edges , crushing delicate flora under their boots .
One family took their little girl up to the edge of a cauldron and encouraged her to dunk an egg into the sulfurous water in a butterfly net , boiling it instantly .
A family of Japanese tourists posed for photos at the edge of another hot cauldron , smiling and waving as the water gurgled and farted ominously .
There were no signs saying which hot puddle was a geyser and which was just a pool of volcanic water — no warnings of an imminent , forceful blanching .
As you ’ll see in the photo , I was unimpressed with the Japanese family :
Of course , it ’s easy for me to point the finger — but unfortunately , I nearly proved my own theories today at Skogarfoss .
Skogarfoss is a gigantic and utterly drinkable waterfall ( it ’s true , it ’s all lava filtered glacial melt ) on Iceland ’s South coast , sort of near the town of Vik .
It ’s postcard perfect , the sort of waterfall that millions of classy clocks and inspirational calendars are based on , and there ’s a narrow , winding and muddy trail that winds to the top edge .
I was standing where Dave is in this picture :
and taking this photo .
Everything seemed fine , and honestly , the danger of it did n’t even occur to me .
The path was well worn from thousands of years worth of Vikings and other tourists marching up to marvel .
I was so rocked by the power and beauty of the falls ( the suffix “ foss ” means falls in Icelandic ) that my self - preservation instinct just kinda powered down .
If you look here , you can actually see my ankle giving out in this photo Dave took :
Everything froze .
My life did n’t pass before my eyes , exactly , I just felt a bump and the purest dose of adrenaline and terror as I hit the earth and one of my legs stuck out into space for a second .
Then I got up and hustled down the path as fast as I could without risking another fall .
Here ’s
Dave ’s second shot of me getting up — taken once he realized I was okay :
We got off the falls and left , drove until we hit the beach at Vik and took a long walk on the black sand , watching the surf pound in and drinking a few Viking beers .
I think we were both thinking about our own mortality .
At least I was .
But that ’s the thing that makes
Dave the perfect male friend : even though he documents you being an idiot , then calls you an idiot and helps you laugh it off , he does n’t rub it in when it ’s over .
And I mean , really — if I had gone over the edge and into the falls , who could my family sue ?
Nobody maintains that site , it ’s just people tromping up , having a look and going back .
There ’s no negligence when nobody claims responsibility in the first place .
My parents could sue the water , or the lava flows that made the ridge the falls were on , maybe — or the nearest farmer for not putting down astroturf over the mud .
One thing ’s for certain : if I had gone over that edge , the fall would have taken so long through so much incredible moss - covered rock that I ’d have had time to say my goodbyes and enjoy myself a little before hitting the bottom .
The FDIC announced the ninth bank failure of 2008 last night ; Columbian Bank and Trust Company , of Topeka , KS .
To put that into context , here is a graph of bank and thrift failures since the FDIC was created in 1934 :
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The huge spike in the ' 80s was due to the S&L crisis .
The nine bank failures so far in 2008 barely show up .
It 's interesting to note that even with the failure of almost 3,000 banks and thrifts during the S&L crisis , the overall economy stayed fairly healthy with only a mild - to - moderate recession starting in July 1990 .
During the Roaring ' 20s , 500 bank failures per year was common with depositors typically losing 30 % to 40 % of their bank deposits in the failed institutions .
The number of bank failures soared to 4000 ( estimated ) in 1933 .
It 's important to note that the housing bust has n't hurt most small banks and institutions , because the banks did n't hold many of the residential mortgages they originated .
Instead the small to mid-sized institutions focused on commercial real estate ( CRE ) , and construction and development ( C&D ) loans .
And it appears that bad C&D loans took down Columbian Bank and Trust Company .
From iStockAnalyst on August 2nd : Columbian Bank Aims to Boost Capital , Overcome Loan Troubles
[ Jim Helvey , former CEO ] said many of the bank 's loans financed real - estate developers ' purchases of land .
He said Columbian 's loans typically were paid off as developers sought and gained construction lending from other banks .
" The problem started creeping in when commercial real - estate loans fell out of favor and there was no ' Bank B ' to take us out of our acquisition loan , " Helvey said .
The crunch in real - estate lending has left Columbian with $ 92 million in problem loans , which includes some construction and residential loans .
Although Columbian is small , and the losses to the FDIC will pale in comparison to IndyMac , Columbian is probably more representative than IndyMac of the type of institutions that will fail in this cycle .
David Brooks : Palin ' will rise to the level of mediocrity '
RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 28 , 2008
Print This Email This New York Times columnist David Brooks ripped into Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Sunday morning , describing her as unprepared for the debate with Democratic opponent Joe Biden .
NBCs Chris Matthews played a clip of Palin citing Alaska 's proximity to Russia as foreign policy experience followed by a speech where she falsely states that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were supported by taxpayers .
Matthews asked Brooks for his verdict after showing an excerpt from his recent editorial titled " Why Experience Matters . "
" I admire Sarah Palin for many things ... but is she ready to be vice president ? "
Brooks said .
" Based on what we 've seen with the Katie Couric interview , it 's embarassing , it 's painful to watch those things , you want to turn them off . "
Brooks also said Palin " is smart " and could eventually " rise to the level of mediocrity . "
Gwen Ifill of PBS will host the debate between Palin and Biden this week , but Matthews asked whether it should be Ifill 's questions or Biden 's attacks that force Palin to try to prove her readiness .
" I suspect Joe Biden is not going to be in attack mode , " Robinson said .
" Gwen is a skilled interviewer , I 'm sure she 'll ask the questions and we 'll get the answers . "
The McCain / Palin campaign and advisers to Biden agreed on a stricter debate format unlike that of Obama and McCain , which allowed for direct argument between the candidates .
McCain advisers were concerned Palin would be left at a disadvantage because she does not enough experience with debate .
Brooks said many aides to the McCain campaign had told him off - the - record that Palin has understood the foreign policy taught to her in preparation for the debate .
But BBC correspondent Katty Kay on the show said many Republicans had become disenfranchised with Palin and mentioned a senior GOP member who told her : " We can not say country first and have Sarah Palin up there as our vice president . "
Matthews mentioned an editorial in conservative publication National Review that asked Palin to step down as Sen.
John McCain 's running mate so he could be saved from further embarrassment .
Yet Kay also acknowledged the impressive following Palin has garnered and cited a Florida rally that drew 60,000 people .
" She is still hugely popular with the Republican base , " Kay said .

“ I ’m not seeing clear patterns of distinct periods of being accelerated and talking and moving and thinking with an intensity of mood that just overflows and then goes back to his usual state , ” Axelson said .
“ The intense anger outbursts can happen in kids with bipolar disorder , but they can happen with other mood disorders , or with A.D.H.D. and severe oppositional behavior .
He ’s only 7 years old .
This could be the very early signs of bipolar , and it may not be until two , three , four , five years from now that we ’d have a clear idea .
That does n’t mean that he does n’t need intensive treatment  he really does . ”
( Joe is currently in treatment at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic , but the right medication has proved elusive . )
It ’s possible that a different doctor might have identified Joe as bipolar .
In an influential 1995 paper that began the paradigm shift toward bipolar disorder within child psychiatry , Janet Wozniak  the director of the pediatric bipolar - disorder program at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of “ Is Your Child Bipolar ? ”  working with the chief of pediatric psychopharmacology , Joseph Biederman , revealed that 16 percent of the children who came to the clinic met the D.S.M. criteria for mania .
This was shocking news ; it was widely believed until then that mania in children was extremely rare .
Wozniak reported that the children ’s mania most often took the form of an irritable mood rather than an elevated one , and that the mood was often chronic : the norm , rather than the exception .
All but one of the manic children in the study also suffered from A.D.H.D .
Wozniak told me that the discovery of mania in so many of the kids she was treating came as a shock to her too .
“ It was like I opened up my eyes : Oh , my goodness , these children have bipolar disorder , ” she said .
“ And I realized that what I ’d been treating them for had n’t been working well .
I was often treating them for bad A.D.H.D. , using different stimulant medicines or higher doses .
I was often treating them for their depression and not getting anywhere .
In those days , the teaching was that we had a group of medicines that could be used for ‘ aggression ’ in children .
What ’s interesting is that these were the anti-manic agents ; they were lithium and antiseizure medicines . ”
In other words , many of the children in Wozniak ’s clinic went unrecognized as bipolar , but they were inadvertently being treated for bipolar .
The tricky part , diagnostically , is that out of those seven symptoms , three  distractibility , activity increase and talkativeness  are also symptoms of A.D.H.D.
Which means that a severely irritable child who has A.D.H.D. could be , theoretically , only one symptom away from a bipolar diagnosis .
Does it even matter whether or not we call Joe or James bipolar , since the drugs used to treat irritable , aggressive children are often the same as those used for bipolar disorder ?
Critics of the more widespread use of a pediatric bipolar diagnosis say it does .
For one thing , being bipolar makes certain medications extremely risky to use ; stimulants can intensify a manic episode , and antidepressants like Zoloft or Prozac can make bipolar patients not just manic but psychotic , even suicidal .
In fact , some clinicians say that a number of young patients who become suicidal while on antidepressants  occasioning the “ black box ” warning currently mandated for drugs like Prozac  in fact suffer from undiagnosed bipolar disorder .
Gabrielle Carlson , the director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine , has studied childhood mania for many years and says bipolar disorder is uncommon in children under 10 , revealing itself in the same discrete episodes of mania and depression that we see in bipolar adults  not in chronic irritability .
According to Carlson , a large group of aggressive and explosive children , who in fact are “ diagnostically homeless , ” are being relabeled as bipolar , which is a development she says is unhelpful both to the children and the field .
“ Diagnostically it ends up being a very important consideration of what the kid really has , ” she told me .
“ If he really has A.D.H.D. and it ’s not mania , then you give him medication for his A.D.H.D.
You also give him behavior modification . ”
One patient she saw that day , who was thought to have bipolar disorder , actually had autism , she said .
“ If you say , ‘ Hey , his problem is bipolar disorder , ’ then you ’re not going to treat his language disorder , you ’re not going to give the social - skills treatment he needs , ” she said .
Problematic conditions in a child ’s home life are also less likely to be addressed if the child ’s behavioral issues are attributed to bipolar disorder , Carlson said .
“ Many people , when they hear bipolar disorder , their brain slams shut . ”
Afternoons at the Pittsburgh bipolar clinic are the time when ongoing patients come in for shorter appointments to assess the impact of their medication regimes on their mood and check for side effects .
On my visit in March , Axelson ’s last appointment of the day was with a pair of bipolar siblings : Phia , 9 , and Lucas , 6 , both of whom he had been treating for the last year and a half .
They were a dynamic and appealing pair , if slightly overcharged ; there was constant climbing and prowling in the small office .
Phia , who wore a pink sweater , black cords and red wool - lined Crocs , had begun taking lithium just a few weeks before , after two different antipsychotic drugs produced an uncomfortable muscular sensation in her legs called akathesia .
Now that she was on lithium and a lower dose of one of the antipsychotics , the akathesia had stopped , and both Phia ( a family nickname ) and her mother , Marie , agreed she was doing well .
On the other hand , Lucas , a vigorous , bullet - headed boy who that day wore camouflage pants , was behaving oddly , Marie said .
“ Throughout the course of a day , there ’s a shift from a whole lot of bravado to limp , ” she told Axelson .
His advisers said that combative edge was essential to blunt any progress Mr. McCain was making as he sought to encroach on Mr. Obama ’s trademark message of change .
Or perhaps it is in response to cries of alarm from Democrats who believe he is being too mild - mannered .
But Mr. Obama ’s remarks are curiously reminiscent  right down to that mocking tone  to words he spoke nearly a year ago when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton suddenly tried to swipe the mantle of change and Mr. Obama demonstrated a fight that many Democrats had doubted he could muster .
Mr. Obama has been in this place before : finding the proper temperature to aggressively critique  or attack  his rival without tarnishing his own image of trying to remain above traditional politics .
As he enters the final eight weeks of the race , advisers said , the lessons from the Democratic primaries are alive in his head .
Mr. McCain and his running mate , Ms. Palin , seem to be there , too .
“ A month ago , they were all saying , ‘ Oh , it ’s experience , experience , experience , ’ ” Mr. Obama said , speaking over booming applause the other night in a high school gymnasium .
“ Then they chose Palin and they started talking about change , change , change .
What happened ?
What happened ?
What happened ? ”
For one of the few times in his presidential candidacy , Mr. Obama is suddenly not the freshest and most telegenic figure on the ballot .
While he seems to have settled on a line of attack against Mr. McCain , his campaign appearances in the past 12 days make clear that he is still grappling with his approach to Ms. Palin .
He has declared her family off limits .
He has praised her biography , telling an audience , “ Mother , governor , moose shooter  that ’s cool . ”
But he has taken sharp aim at her record as Alaska governor , vigorously questioning her evolving stance on the state ’s so - called bridge to nowhere .
“ She was for it until everybody started raising a fuss about it and she started running for governor and then suddenly she was against it , ” Mr. Obama said , speaking over an applauding crowd in Michigan .
“ I mean , you ca n’t just make stuff up .
You ca n’t just recreate yourself .
You ca n’t just reinvent yourself .
The American people are n’t stupid . ”
A fantastic new study which looked at the ‘ connectedness ’ of the human brain has identified which aspects of the underlying network are the most important routes of communication .
The research was led by neuroscientist Patric Hagmann and combines brain imaging with network mathematics to not only visualise the brain ’s network but also to understand which are the most important hubs and connections .
The study used diffusion spectrum imaging or DSI to map out the white matter wiring of the brain in five healthy individuals .
It ’s a type of diffusion MRI that identifies water molecules and tracks how they move .
In a glass of water , water molecules will move randomly , but when trapped inside nerve fibres , they move along the length of the fibre , allowing maps to be created from the average paths of the moving molecules .
The researchers then took the maps of fibres , as illustrated by the top image , divided the brain up into sections , and created a simplified network map , shown in the bottom image , which allowed them to mathematically test how connected the different areas were .
They used network theory , more typically used in social network analysis , which allows mathematical measures of network properties .
The researchers calculated which areas were the most connected to the rest of the network in terms of connections going directly in and out of the area , but also which areas were the most strategically important ‘ hubs ’ .
This meant the researchers could identify areas of the cortex that are the most highly connected and highly important , forming a structural core of the human brain .
You can see two of the maps on the right .
The one in red illustrates which brain areas are the most highly connected .
You can see it ’s the area at the top and back of the brain .
As you can see better on the original image , its very centrally located , like a neural mohawk .
The image in blue on the right shows the network ‘ backbone ’ , the information highways of the brain .
What ’s perhaps most interesting it that the most connected brain areas are many of those which are more active when we ’re at rest , compared to when we ’re engaged in a mental task that requires concentration and effort .
This has been dubbed the ‘ default network ’ in the scientific literature , and , rather annoyingly , the ‘ daydreaming network ’ by the popular press .
It ’s not entirely clear what the network is for , with some studies directly linked it to ‘ stimulus independent thought ’ ( yes , daydreaming ) , while others more explicitly define it as internally focused , rather than externally focused thought and cognition .
Unfortunately , most cognitive neuroscience experiments work by measuring the effect of tasks on brain function , so a brain network which seems to be switched off by any sort of task is quite hard to study .
A recent study found that even the noise of the brain scanner affects it .

ABC has a new story on this silly ' controversy ' :
“ Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck , ’’ Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager , said in a statement .
“ It ’s divisive , negative , shameful and wrong . ’’
Mr. Davis was alluding to comments that Mr. Obama made Wednesday in Missouri when he reacted to the increasingly negative tone , and negative ads that have been coming his way from the McCain campaign in recent days .
“ So nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face , so what they ’re going to try to do is make you scared of me , ’’ Mr. Obama said Wednesday in Springfield , Mo. , in remarks that he echoed throughout the day .
“ You know , he ’s not patriotic enough .
He ’s got a funny name .
You know , he does n’t look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills , you know .
He ’s risky .
That ’s essentially the argument they ’re making . ’’
ABC thinks it has gotten to the essence of the ' controversy ' :
[ David ] Axelrod told [ " Good Morning America " Obama 's comment ] meant , " He 's not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the United States .
He 's new to Washington .
Yes , he 's African - American . "
ABC very helpfully generated the goofy illustration above of a cheerful Obama on the 100 dollar bill .
Presumably it 's meant to show what a sorehead Obama is for complaining that anybody is picturing him unflatteringly on US currency .
What ABC does not acknowledge is that is exactly what McCain 's campaign did one month ago .
In this mocking advertisement released on June 27 , McCain 's campaign pretended that Obama wanted to put his face all over American icons , including the 100 dollar bill .
It 's not a flattering picture , as this still shows .
Apart from suggesting that Obama is arrogant , it strikes me as an exercise in illustrating how out of place he would be in the presidency .
Obama looks slightly dazed or hesitant , and the very white T - shirt like thing is both jarring and heightens the contrast with his skin color .
And just in case that was n't sufficiently scary , the McCain campaign turned Obama 's visage into this ghoulish image just before cutting away .
As the 100 dollar bill image grows large on the screen , bright lights begin to stream out of his eyes , his face turns a deathly yellow and finally explodes in a burst like fire .
You would have thought that a simple fade would have been a heck of a lot easier to produce .
Obama was exactly right , McCain was trying to make him look scary .
What 's ABC 's excuse for trying to make him look like a fool ?
Last year , Tom Becker won the Waterstone 's prize for children 's fiction with his first novel , Darkside ; last week he won another award , the Calderdale children 's book prize .
The talk among agents and publishers has been about his suspenseful prose , his great potential .
But few people have been talking about a more salient fact : that the book 's concept and story was generated not by Becker , but by focus groups .
The company behind Darkside is Hothouse , a London - based business that aims to give children what they say they want from stories , rather than what adults think they want .
Becker 's book was the company 's first attempt at book - by - focus - group , and it is part of a successful supernatural horror series aimed at boys aged up to 12 , published by Scholastic .
In April , Puffin books launched a new series , Fright Night , also conceived and delivered by Hothouse .
Hothouse uses a market research company to put story ideas to children , who are observed from behind a one - way mirror .
Using dummy covers , short excerpts and blurbs to prompt conversation , researchers ask the children their opinions on which characters , plots and ideas they enjoy most .
Each child is also visited at home by a researcher , who finds out what kind of books they already own and read .
Drawing on this research , Hothouse commissions a team of writers accordingly .
You could ask whether Hothouse is publishing books that will endure , or merely pushing products .
Consensus , surely , takes us somewhere far away from art .
Creatives are meant to work in isolated , inspired flashes , fuelled by long nights of the soul - not by means of spreadsheets and a scientific research process .
But publishing is n't the only area of the arts dabbling in focus groups .
EMI 's new owner , Guy Hands , had musicians choking on their Red Bull this January when he revealed that focus groups would play a more significant part not only in promoting his company 's records , but in creating them .
" When you look at which car companies are succeeding , it 's the ones which work with their customers , " he said .
" Are clothes not creative ?
Is fashion not creative ?
Is food not creative ?
The only real difference is that these industries have learned to work with the customer and not force - feed them . "
The theatre has long used previews to test plays on audiences before opening night .
Much can be done to improve a production even in those late stages , and many experimental companies are now looking to try their ideas on a live audience at the very start of the artistic process .
At BAC , the renowned south London fringe venue , monthly " scratch nights " offer theatre practitioners the chance to try out work in development - anything from a loose collection of scenes to a vague notion they had in the bath .
More important than the performance itself is the after - show event , nattily titled A Beer for an Idea , where audience members are invited to give feedback in the bar .
" It 's a really good trade - off , " says Harun Khan , who gave a scratch performance of a work in progress , The Twins .
" It ups the ante because the artists are taking more risks , the audience get to see something born - or flop - and directors get an audience response without having to risk financial or critical disaster . "
Past successes have made it a popular event : Stewart Lee 's Jerry Springer - the Opera emerged from the BAC programme , as did his What Would Judas Do ?.
" You can tell the audience what you want to know from them , and you can be specific whether it's which characters they identify with , or how clear they found the story , " says Khan .
" Sometimes you just want a really open response . "
BAC can rely on an audience with a taste for the avant garde , but what constitutes development strategy there could look like crowd - pleasing elsewhere .
" There is a danger of that , " admits Khan .
" But creativity and good ideas do n't belong just to artists and creatives .
The more people allowed into your process , the more potential you have for getting one of those great ideas - even if it 's from someone who does n't normally go to theatre .
The more open you are , the bigger your resources . "
Andrew Therkelsen , who works for market research company Discovery , says he has noticed a growing interest in focus groups from the art world .
" Editors , producers and those in more creative genres always tended to shy away from using research in this way , mainly because it does n't always get it right .
But increasingly , they are using it to define and develop their ideas .
Traditionally , any audience feedback done in the creative world is reactive rather than pre-emptive .
But we 're saying we can help decide the best outcome before you do it . "
Could focus groups help democratise art ?
Reg Wright , CEO of Hothouse , points out that one of the great advantages of listening to young readers is that they have a surprisingly good feel for where a story should go .
" We 've had children come up with great ideas for plots , " he says .
" They may not be sophisticated , but they 'll make it their own .
Our job , in the end , is n't to implement what they say , but to interpret what they want . "
Wright 's company has also developed Rapport , an online focus group that gives publishers access to the opinions of 10,000 readers .
He believes it is good for publishers to be challenged on their assumptions about what readers want .
" We are not our target audience , " he points out .
" You see publishing houses full of 28 - year - olds who say , ' We know what people want . '
No : they know what they want .
At least we admit we do n't know anything .
The kids ' feedback is a great example .
Even what parents think their kids would like is often wildly wrong . "
In the film industry , production companies hire whole audiences to give their verdict on a movie before the final edit .
Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner was famously lumped with an ending he hated after focus groups found his original ending too negative .
But then the critics hated it , and it was n't until 10 years later , when Scott released a director 's cut , that the happy ending was removed and the film got the acclaim it deserved .
Sometimes it does n't pay to give people what they want .
David Livingstone , president of marketing at Working Title films , makers of Notting Hill and United 93 , argues that " the director is n't a puppet " and that test screenings fulfil a vital function .
" When you make a film , there are a lot of points of view .
But 400 people in a screening is a consensus . "
He adds that some directors are better at interpreting audience response than others .
" Those who have more experience in TV tend to be better at knowing how to use that information . "
Of course , television already has the pilot - the single first episode that is tested on an audience to see if it 's worth going ahead with the rest of the series .
However , piloting a show is prohibitively expensive .
Instead , broadcasters are increasingly looking to pre-emptive focus groups , and encouraging commissioners and programme - makers to pay more attention to their results .
The BBC used focus groups before launching Holby City ; even independent producers now commission their own market research , although it remains costly enough that only the larger indies can afford it .
At a Royal Television Society seminar , Clare Salmon , a former marketing director of ITV , said she was hoping to usher in a " new era of marketeers and programmers working together creatively " .
ITV are considered to be at the forefront of audience research ; they use " segmentation " , categorising their viewers by attitude rather than by the more traditional model of age and gender .
By dividing audiences into 16 different segments , based on lifestyle and beliefs , researchers can help suggest what kind of storylines and characters will appeal - or flop .
" It 's not about turning programme - makers into analysts , " says Salmon .
" It 's not about saying that a certain segment likes gardening and vicars , so we must put a gardening vicar in every programme we make for that audience .
But we can help commissioners avoid collisions where they pick on something that 's an attitudinal divide . "
She uses The Real Good Life as an example of a show that flopped because it failed to take account of the tension between its subject matter - how to live ethically - and a " segment " audience that believes environmental threats are overstated .
However , producer Alex Graham , who worked on Who Do You Think You Are ? for the BBC , believes creatives need to keep a healthy distance from focus group material .
" It 's like internalising the rules of a sport before you play it , " he says .
" There 's a point where you put it all in a drawer and lock it away .
The wrong amount of information at the wrong time can cripple creativity stone dead . "
Perhaps the best examples of this are the paintings created by Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid , two Russian conceptual artists who emigrated to the US in the late 1970s .
In 1994 , they collaborated on USA 's Most Wanted , a painting created in response to a survey of 1,001 Americans that asked people what they considered to be good art .
The result , a kitsch landscape featuring two deer and a hippopotamus ( the poll put a premium on wildlife ) , is dominated by a mountain lake and is " the size of a dishwasher " - the favourite size , apparently , for a work of art .
The pair went on to do similar projects in a range of other countries , from Poland to China , and the results were unnervingly similar .
Large expanses of water featured on almost all their canvases .
From which we can deduce that good art is , well , blue .
Perhaps it 's no wonder market research has never held much sway in the art world .
Emma Dexter , director of exhibitions at Timothy Taylor Gallery and a former Tate curator , says : " The point of art is to imagine the unimaginable , and the worst possible scenario would be the idea of an artist making what people thought they wanted to see .
Increasing globalisation means we should treasure the sense of locality and specificity about artists ' work , rather than looking for a lowest common denominator . "
She does , however , think that galleries and museums can and do benefit from focus groups : " Learning what people come to it for , how they experience it , how they move through a building . "
Therkelsen , of Discovery , agrees .
" At the high end of art , that 's always going to be led by the artists - quite rightly .
But where we can help is in the more mainstream , consumer - led entertainments . "
As Tom Becker 's awards prove , the method can work .
Perhaps " popular art " will not always be a paradox ·
Emma John sits in on a focus group creating a show
6.30 pm Eight people meet for the first time in a London studio , on the wrong side of a one - way mirror .
Drawn from the databases of Criteria Fieldwork , they 're as diverse as you could wish .
A policewoman who loves musicals .
A graphic designer who wo n't go to the theatre unless there 's a Hollywood star .
A cool - looking dude who raves about an avant - garde , site - specific work he recently saw , until a middle - aged woman next to him interrupts : " You 've just described my worst nightmare . "
It 's like Big Brother already .
6.55 pm : Andrew and Vicki of market research company Discovery take the group through an exercise they call " psycho drawings " .
Everyone is asked to recall their best ever theatrical experience , then draw how they felt about it .
Doodles include an alarm , a firework and a disturbing cartoon of a brain transplant ( the avant - garde dude , naturally ) .
7.15 pm : Now Andrew wants the group to identify what makes bad theatre .
Poor acting , underestimating an audience , plays that go on too long all take a kicking .
As , inexplicably , does Jeremy Irons .
7.30 pm: The group brainstorms subjects for a play .
Global warming and terrorism are high on the list ; current issues are considered the most exciting because , as one woman says , " You feel you 're paying attention to important topics , which makes you feel good about yourself . "
8 pm : The musical theatre lovers want an R&B love story for the Asbo generation .
" It could show how kids have no real role models now , " says the policewoman .
8.15 pm : Our Asbo play has scrapped romance for a tougher theme : a young lad from the estates who keeps getting in trouble , but whose love of music redeems him .
Someone points out that they 've just written 8 Mile : the Musical .
The ideas are gathered together , and passed on to playwright Ben Yeoh , who has had plenty of experience writing synopses for Radio 4 and the Gate Theatre in London .
Here 's what we came up with :
Asbo : the Musical
Jake always wanted to be a singer like his dad , who left home when he was young , but he has been getting into trouble on his estate .
One fight leaves Steve hurt : Jake , though blameless , ends the night in the cells .
He meets Fats , who knew Jake 's dad and tells him how his dad wanted to be a great soul singer but died on tour .
Fats convinces
Jake to live the dream his father could n't .
On his release , Jake impresses at an open mic night , and a record producer asks to meet him .
On the way to the meeting , Steve 's brother - desperate to show his crew that he is a man - knifes Jake in revenge .
Jake is rescued by bouncers and signed by the record producer ;
Steve 's brother ends up in jail , his talents wasted .

Omaha has never been known as a beer destination let alone a craft beer friendly town .
However , this perception is slowly changing ... While I admittedly harbor some bias I do believe " Beer Corner USA " is one of the beeriest spots in the country , let alone Omaha .
On the corner of 36th & Farnam , in the heart of Midtown Omaha , resides the epicenter of all things beer in Nebraska .
Three bars and a package beer store are the residents of Beer Corner USA , each is unique and yet they are all interrelated .
The anchor of Beer Corner USA is Crescent Moon Ale House .
Since 1996 Crescent Moon has been home to Omaha ’s best draft beer selection .
With 31 taps , and the vast majority devoted to American craft beer , " the Moon " is one of the few bars in Omaha that does not offer one light beer on - tap or any Budweiser / Miller / Coors beers ( ok , Blue Moon is on - tap ) .
Boulevard Brewing Company and New Belgium Brewing Company provide the foundation of the draft selection but seasonal beers and Nebraska brewed beers add depth .
A few of the newest draft beers include Odell IPA , North Coast Old Rasputin and Sierra Nevada Summerfest .
Crescent
Moon is the type of bar that feels like home , it feels used and enjoyed .
It is not sterile or stuffy but it is n’t rundown and dingy .
Crescent Moon is like your favorite pair of jeans , comfortable and reliable .
With a knowledgeable staff , tasty pub grub and delicious beers in a friendly environment , Crescent Moon is a suitable destination for causal beer drinkers and beer geeks alike .
Crescent Moon is only 1/4th of the equation .
In the basement of Crescent Moon is another world or better yet another country .
Huber - Haus German Beer
Hall has become one of Omaha ’s hottest beer drinking establishments since opening in April of 2005 .
The walls are covered in rock and wood paneling ; decorations are minimal and consist of German bier signs , cans , and neon lights .
With eight German beers on - tap the variety rotates readily , there is always at least one Hefeweizen , Helles Lager and Dopplebock but rare styles show up to like Keller Bier , Rauchbier , and Schwarzbeir .
Fans of German beer flock to Huber - Haus ( and often join the Mug Club ) as there is no other place in town to drink Spaten , Weihenstephaner , and Ayinger on - tap ( let alone in bottles ) .
The newest bar to the " Corner " is Max and Joe ’s Belgian Beer Tavern .
Max and Joe ’s opened in November of 2006 and also doubles as Crescent Moon ’s party room .
When not booked for a private party , Max and Joe ’s is opened Thursday , Friday , and Saturday nights .
The featured beers are Belgian , five on - tap and another 35 in bottles .
The two heavy hitters on draft are St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Delirium Tremens .
The décor is " 1950s neighborhood bar " with vintage signs of long past Nebraska breweries like Falstaff and Storz .
Max and Joe ’s provides a totally unique drinking experience , in comparison to its sister bars .
It is more laidback and , often , quieter .
The identity of the three bars remains different and yet they are all under the same roof .
All told , Beer Corner USA offers 44 different beers on - tap in three distinct bars .
No other bar in Omaha can boast such a quality selection .
Likewise , no package store can boast the bottle selection of Beertopia .
This is where I enter the picture .
I am the resident beer specialist at Beertopia which is a nice way of calling me a beer geek .
Beertopia is home to some 560 beers and as the name suggests there is no wine or spirits sold here ( we do carry 6 ciders ) .
Our clientele enjoys craft beer and more obscure imports as such the store carries no Budweiser , Miller or Coors .
Inch for inch Beertopia is one of the best beer stores in the Midwest .
However , arguably , the most special aspect of Beer Corner USA are the major beer events .
Huber - Haus hosts
Omaha ’s largest , most authentic Oktoberfest in the fall .
The two day event boasts live polka music , German food and lots of German Oktoberfest beer .
On a slightly cool fall night nothing tastes better than a malty Oktoberfest beer .
Really , there is nothing else quite like it in Omaha .
The closest competition is Bockfest in the spring , replace Oktoberfest beer with Bocks and subtract 20 degrees from the temperature add a few fire pits for warmth and welcome to Bockfest !
Beertopia / Crescent Moon co-sponsor three large beer festivals a year , the Holiday Beerfest in the winter which features Christmas and winter seasonals , the Extreme Beerfest in early spring which features beers all above 7 % ABV .
This summer Sunfest is in its second season .
This year the event is being held outside on July 12 .
Some 36 breweries are participating featuring 125 beers .
Those who are attending ( and tickets do remain ) get unlimited samples from 3 pm - 8 pm .
Frankly , the landscape of the Omaha ’s beer scene would be so remarkably different without Beer Corner USA it would be unfathomable .
Yes , the Omaha metro area is lucky to have two excellent brewpubs ( Nebraska Brewing Company and Upstream ) and a handful of bars and restaurants provide a solid selection of beer but frankly , nothing in Omaha compares to Beer Corner USA .
Clearly Omaha residents are becoming more aware of good beer and are demanding a greater selection and better quality .
A year from now I expect Omaha ’s beer scene to be even better with Beertopia and Crescent Moon leading the way .

Go is perhaps the oldest board game in the world .
The rules are very simple , and you can learn them in a few minutes - but they lead to a countless number of intriguing patterns and clever maneuvers .
Learning to play is easy , but learning to play well requires much study and practice .
The best way to learn , especially at the beginning , is simply to play games and become familiar with the patterns .
Bien qu'ils soient très régulièrement fustigés , les paradis fiscaux sont aujourd ' hui tout sauf des places financières marginales .
La mondialisation aidant , ils sont devenus l'un des piliers de la finance mondiale et des milliards de milliards de dollars y transitent chaque année .
Tout circule via les paradis fiscaux : de l'argent propre , sale , des sommes provenant de l'évasion fiscale ...
Et après les avoir laissés prospérer , les grandes puissances économiques s'inquiètent aujourd ' hui de leur essor .
A la suite des attentats du 11 - Septembre , les Etats - Unis ont réalisé que l'argent du terrorisme y avait en partie transité .
Ces derniers mois , plusieurs scandales sont aussi venus démontrer comment ces places favorisaient la fraude fiscale à grande échelle , comme au Liechtenstein , où il a été découvert que plus d'un millier d'Occidentaux - dont 200 Français - y avaient placé leur pécule .
Lors du sommet du G8 d'Hokkaido au Japon , du lundi 7 au mercredi 9 juin , les paradis fiscaux vont faire partie des grands sujets abordés .
Qu'est -ce qu'un paradis fiscal ?
L'imaginaire collectif résume volontiers les paradis fiscaux à des îles dorées , dont la fiscalité est au moins aussi attractive que les cocotiers .
C'est parfois le cas , mais c'est souvent plus subtil .
Il n'existe pas de définition unique .
Christian Chavagneux et Ronen Palan , auteurs des Paradis fiscaux ( La Découverte , 2007 , 122 pages , 8,50 euros ) , distinguent dix critères pour identifier ce type de place .
Parmi eux : une taxation faible ou nulle pour les non-résidents , un secret bancaire renforcé , des procédures d'enregistrement souples pour les entreprises qui désirent s'y installer ...
La variété des définitions engendre de facto des listes plus ou moins longues de paradis fiscaux .
Légal ou pas légal ?
Instaurer un régime fiscal attractif n'est pas illégal en soi .
Ce sont les types de capitaux attirés qui suscitent généralement les critiques ou la suspicion , car une part non négligeable de l'argent circulant dans les paradis fiscaux correspond à de l'évasion fiscale .
Dans une moindre mesure , les criminels utilisent aussi ces places pour blanchir les sommes illégalement gagnées .
Les " paradis " se sont souvent dotés d'un régime fiscal avantageux pour développer un territoire sans ressources , sans industrie , et souvent isolé ( Bahamas , Andorre ... ) .
Pour certains pays comme la Suisse ou Singapour , c'est le résultat d'un pari stratégique qui consiste à baser l'essentiel de leur développement économique sur " l' industrie de la finance " .
Comment sont - ils nés ?
Ils sont apparus dans les années 1880 , aux Etats - Unis .
A l'époque , les Etats du New Jersey et du Delaware jalousaient New York et le Massachusetts qui concentraient la plupart des sièges sociaux des entreprises et enregistraient , en conséquence , de fortes rentrées fiscales .
Pour les concurrencer , le New Jersey a instauré une législation plafonnant l'impôt sur les sociétés .
En 1898 , le Delaware a fait de même .
Aujourd ' hui , selon MM .
Chavagneux et Palan , " la moitié des entreprises américaines cotées en Bourse ont leur siège social dans le Delaware " .
Dans les années 1920 , suite à des différends commerciaux , des juges britanniques ont considéré qu'une entreprise anglaise installée à l'étranger et faisant affaire hors du Royaume - Uni ne devait pas être assujettie à l'impôt anglais .
Le principe de résidence fictive pour raison fiscale a alors de facto été créé .
L'instauration par la Suisse , en 1934 , d'une loi punissant pénalement la violation du secret bancaire a parachevé les principes qu'imitent aujourd ' hui de nombreuses places .
La première vague de création de paradis fiscaux a eu lieu dans les années 1930 .
C'est à cette époque , par exemple , que se développent le Liechtenstein ou Gibraltar .
La deuxième remonte aux années 1960 .
Leur expansion est allée de pair avec la mondialisation .
Le phénomène se poursuit aujourd ' hui , particulièrement en Asie , avec l'essor de Singapour , pays devenu une sorte de " Suisse asiatique " ...
Pour ou contre les paradis fiscaux ?
Depuis 2002 , l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques ( OCDE ) a lancé un vaste programme - le Forum mondial pour la fiscalité - visant à instaurer une " équité et une concurrence loyale " en matière fiscale .
A terme , le but est d'obliger les paradis fiscaux , par la négociation , à limiter leur " dumping fiscal " .
Pour de nombreuses associations , comme le réseau Tax Justice , et les grands argentiers de tout bord , les paradis fiscaux constituent - en plus d'un risque criminel - une vaste incitation à l'évasion fiscale , et donc un manque à gagner pour les Etats .
Toutefois , la démarche de l'OCDE ne les satisfait pas toujours , car jugée par certains trop " diplomatique " .
Pour de nombreux libéraux , l'action de l'OCDE est au contraire une ingérence inacceptable dans les affaires des pays concernés , voire une forme de " néocolonialisme " .
Ils estiment que la concurrence fiscale est saine et que les paradis fiscaux ne devraient pas être tenus d'amender leur législation .
A leurs yeux , le secret bancaire relève du droit au respect de la vie privée .
Ils minimisent les aspects criminogènes , et considèrent que les richesses dégagées par les paradis fiscaux sont , à leur manière , des sources de croissance .
Combien pèsent - ils ?
Rares sont les données officielles sur le poids économique des paradis fiscaux .
Ils communiquent peu sur les flux qui transitent chez eux , et lorsque certains le font , les experts considèrent que leurs données sont peu fiables .
Il faut alors s'en remettre aux estimations régulièrement réalisées par la Banque des règlements internationaux ( BRI ) , la Conférence des Nations unies sur le commerce et le développement ( Cnuced ) , des cabinets d'audit ou des chercheurs .
Ces études , forcément approximatives , donnent cependant une idée de l'importance des montants financiers en jeu : des milliards de milliards de dollars .
Les poids économiques des paradis fiscaux sont très variables .
Certains ont leur spécialité .
Les Bahamas sont le domicile privilégié des fonds spécialisés , la Suisse est en tête pour la gestion de fortune ...
Peut - on lever leur secret bancaire ?
Au nom du " respect de la vie privée " , la plupart des paradis fiscaux ont mis en place un secret bancaire renforcé .
Les menaces américaines de rétorsion , lancées après les attentats du 11 - Septembre , ont toutefois amené la plupart des places offshore à lever leur secret bancaire en cas d'enquêtes pénales ( avec plus ou moins de restrictions ) .
Il s'agissait ainsi de disparaître de listes noires internationales , préjudiciables à leur réputation .
Aujourd 'hui , l'OCDE incite les paradis fiscaux à signer le plus grand nombre possible de " conventions d'échange de renseignements " , accords bilatéraux entre un paradis fiscal et un pays sur les conditions de levée du secret bancaire .
Mais certains pays , comme les Bahamas , n'en ont signé qu'une seule , avec les Etats - Unis , leur plus gros client .
Même chose pour Monaco avec la France .
D'autres ont paraphé quantité de conventions , mais les conditions pour lever le secret bancaire sont très restreintes .
Ainsi , Singapour en a signé avec 53 pays , mais n'autorise l'échange de renseignements que si un " intérêt fiscal national " est en jeu .
Soit pratiquement jamais .
Les paradis fiscaux continuent donc de recourir à des artifices pour préserver la confidentialité de leur clientèle : c'est la clé de leur succès .
Et , dans certains paradis fiscaux comme la Suisse , l'évasion fiscale n'est pas considérée comme un délit .
Aussi refusent - ils de communiquer toute information , en cas d'enquêtes fiscales .
Quelle est la position de l'Union européenne ?
L'UE a adopté en 2005 une directive imposant l'échange d'informations fiscales entre ses Etats membres .
Cependant , une clause permet aux pays le désirant de ne pas s'y soumettre : auquel cas , les fonds déposés par des non-résidents doivent êtres taxés à hauteur de 25 % ( 35 % à partir de 2011 ) .
La plupart des paradis fiscaux européens ( Luxembourg , Belgique , Autriche ... ) ont préféré taxer les revenus de l'épargne plutôt que de lever leur secret bancaire .
Le Liechtenstein , qui a adopté ce texte , a en outre réussi à exempter de cette règle toutes ses " fondations " , structures opaques sur lesquelles repose l'essentiel de son attractivité .
Comment les entreprises les utilisent - ils ?
La plupart des banques possèdent des filiales dans les paradis fiscaux , de façon légale .
En principe , tous les bénéfices dégagés dans ces places sont donc déclarés à leur pays d'origine .
Mais , selon les détracteurs des paradis fiscaux , ces banques , malgré les précautions qu'elles peuvent prendre , contribuent à la circulation de capitaux d'origine douteuse via leurs filiales .
De nombreuses grandes entreprises ou fortunes individuelles ont aussi recours aux paradis fiscaux dans le cadre des savants montages juridiques d'optimisation fiscale .
Totalement légales , ces pratiques sont cependant très critiquées .

Sorting Dictionaries by Value in Python ( improved ? )
Sorting dictionaries by value in Python is a chronic annoyance .
The dictionary implementation is very efficient , well - thought out , and easy - to - use , but sorting by value is n’t part of the spec .
So , I was pretty excited when read this post on sorting by value at Digital Sanitation Engineering , I was excited .
Finally , a method that “ is the fastest way to do this and it uses the least amount of memory .
Enjoy . ”
Oh , enjoy I will .
But then , a wrench in the works .
I ’m not sure the claim in true .
PEP 265 has a different opinion on the matter , and suggests a different idiom , so I decided to do a little testing .
( Preview for time impatient : the PEP 265 version is 10 x faster than any others in this test . )

I ca n’t speak to memory use , but I can speak to speed ….
itemgetter , and functions in the operator module in general , are fast .
Use them .
As usual , the overhead of function calling kills performance , and eliminating those calls makes all the difference .
Good luck , pythonistas !

Oil , Coal , Natural Gas , Nuclear , Wind , Solar Energy ?
The world ’s energy appetite will at least double by the end of this century ( some claim it will triple ) .
If we attempt to meet this burgeoning global demand exclusively with fossil fuels , the environmental consequences are difficult to predict .
We are products of a world where energy was long assumed to be cheap , unlimited and readily available .
Today , all three assumptions are in question .
In a few short years , the problem of energy has emerged as one of the defining — and most difficult — challenges of the 21st century .
Economic activity is clearly the single most important driver of the energy demand of a country .
This demand does change as countries gradually shift from more energy - intense manufacturing industries to service activities or when technological advances make energy use more efficient – but these processes take time and with oil reaching all time highs the effects are already being felt .
Oil ; Countries with a high dependency on oil are already suffering higher relative inflation against their peers which will subsequently damage their exports .
Spain , Greece or Belgium are already suffering from inflation above the average Euro zone inflation of 3.3 % , already way above the 2 % untries nuclear and alternatives seem to be the most viable energy sources in the not so distant targeted by the ECB .
What alternatives do we have in Europe other than oil ?
Coal , the main source of energy in both China and India , is cheaper to extract compared to oil and gas but is highly polluting .
Although , vast reserves are still available , rail and harbour bottlenecks , as well as a sharp increase in demand is making supply fall behind .
Read
The price of coal from South Africa , the main exporter to European utility companies , has increased by 20 % so far this year .
Besides , in the short term , South Africa may limit exports to avoid power supply crises like they suffered in late January when some mining houses were ordered to stop mining to avoid blackouts .
These would have large implications as it is one of the main producers together with Australia and Indonesia .
For the longer term , enforcing the Kyoto agreement should end up curbing demand of coal , at least , on the treaty signing countries like Germany , where more than 20 % of energy demand is still coming from coal .
Natural Gas produces the least carbon dioxide of the fossil fuels , which makes it very attractive for the production of electricity by power companies in Europe .
Its demand has grown steadily outside its traditional use for heating and it is already a major source of energyfor the UK , Italy and Germany .
Most of the gas coming into Europe flows from Russia ( providing Germany ) , Norway ( the UK ’s main provider ) and Algeria which through its two main pipes , supplies the Iberian Peninsula and Italy , too .
However , diameter , operating pressure , length of the current pipes , as well as the limited number of storage facilities available limit supply – which has not been able to keep up with demand .
The price of natural gas coming in to the UK has gone up by 130 % in the last 12 months .
Nuclear seems to be the medium term solution which some European countries like the UK or Italy are willing to pursue .
Italy has recently announced it will go back to nuclear energy after 20 years as it will allow them “ the production of clean energy , at low cost , on a large scale and without damaging the environment ” .
However , nuclear energy still generates safety concerns and challenging problems related to the disposal of its radioactive waste .
Countries like France , Sweden , and some of the former Soviet Union allies already rely heavily on nuclear energy .
Within renewable energies Hydropower is by far the largest source of energy .
It generates no carbon dioxide and produces electricity less expensively than energy coming from both fossil fuel and nuclear .
However , supply depends on water reserves and the topography and weather of countries and while it is a major source in Austria and Norway it is less of an option for countries like the UK .
Other alternative sources like Wind or Solar Energy – although growing very rapidly in countries like Germany and Spain – are still heavily dependent on state subsidies and the deployment of improved technologies .
In the medium term , these alternative sources are , however , set to play an important role with the European Commission targeting 20 % of energy coming from wind , wave and solar sources by 2020 .
Overall , cheaper access to energy will be a large competitive advantage for some European countries .
Countries like France , Norway and even the UK stand out to be in a much better position than Spain , Italy or Ireland , which are yet not on track to fulfill their part of the Kyoto agreement .
This rules out coal as an alternative for these countries which will likely increase their dependency on gas in the short term , but there are some risks as Algeria is the main provider for both Italy and Spain .
For these countries nuclear and alternatives seem to be the most viable energy sources in the not so distant future .

They preach prosperity - that God can make you healthy and wealthy .
Every year some of America 's best known TV evangelists bring in hundreds of millions of dollars from donors all over the world .
But as Jonathan Beale reports , some of the TV evangelists ' own lifestyles have begun to ring alarm bells and prompted a Senate investigation into their activities .

Wired.com 's survey of iPhone 3G users suggests that widespread data speed problems have more to do with carriers ' networks than with Apple 's handsets .
Recently Wired.com asked iPhone 3G users all around the world to participate in a study , which involved testing their 3G speeds and entering their data on an interactive map .
The purpose ?
To gain a general idea of how 3G was performing – where it 's best and where it 's worst – in light of widespread complaints about the handset 's network performance .
More than 2,600 people participated ( wow ! ) and we 've diligently cleaned up the data to present it to you here .
In the map above , each colored bar indicates the relative 3G download speed for an individual respondent .
Purple dots represent several respondents clustered together geographically .
( If you do n't see many colored bars , zoom in on an area until the purple dots disappear and are replaced by colored bars . )
To speak very generally , the data overall shows that 3G is performing faster than EDGE ( which is expected ) .
In the best scenarios , 3G is up to seven times faster than EDGE ; in worse scenarios , 3G performed just as slowly as EDGE ; at worst , some users could n't connect to 3G at all – which is n't surprising since 3G towers are not yet ubiquitous .
__Detailed observations from the survey follow .
__
By country : Participants in Australia reported the slowest average 3G download speeds of about 759 Kbps .
The most " 0 " results for 3G download speeds came from U.S. participants – presumably those dropped from the 3G network .
In the United States , 63 participants reported " 0 " Altogether there were 80 " 0 " figures reported .
Users in Germany and the Netherlands reported the fastest average 3G download speeds – about 2,000 Kbps .
In some major metropolitan areas that are supposedly 3G - rich , 3G performance can be very slow .
For example , zooming in on San Francisco , you 'll see that 10 out of 30 participants reported very slow 3G speeds – barely surpassing EDGE .
This pattern is linear with femtocell developer Dave Nowicki's explanation that in major metropolitan cities where the most iPhone users reside ,
3G towers are getting overloaded , resulting in slowdowns or delivering
EDGE - like performance as a result .
By carrier : European T- Mobile users reported the fastest 3G Download Speeds : 1,822 Kbps on average .
Factoid : Europe has some of the most mature 3G networks , which have been in development since 2001 .

Canadian carriers Rogers and Fido tied for second fastest with an average download speed of about 1,330 Kbps on average .

Assess what you will , Gadget Lab readers .
In our view , this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carrier 's network is affecting the iPhone 3G more than the handset itself .
Correlating with our study 's findings , Teknik & Trender reported that iPhone 3 G 's reception performed roughly the same as other handsets when run through a test chamber .
Altogether , this furthers our thesis that it 's highly unlikely that Apple is going to wave a magic wand and say , " 3G problems , be gone , " with a software update .
Before Apple can make such a claim , it needs to wait for all of its carriers to optimize 3G network behavior – in terms of number of towers , how they 're positioned and how much bandwidth each tower can handle .

Veteran actor Christopher Plummer is livid an injury he suffered during from a one - night stand meant that William Shatner played his part in Henry V - because it made the Star Trek actor a star .
Plummer was lined up to perform in the Shakespeare play in 1956 - but an unplanned romp left him unable to take to the stage , according to New York gossip column PageSix .
He says in his autobiography In Spite Of Myself : " I woke up alone the next morning ... ( pain ) all around my groin and lower abdomen ...
I started to whimper like a whipped dog .
' So this is what syphilis is like ? '
I thought .
' I suppose I deserve it , but Christ , how the hell was I to know ?
' But instead of being struck down by the disease , Plummer had dislodged a kidney stone and had to undergo a medical procedure with a surgical wire to resolve the problem .
He adds , " It began to sink in ...
Shatner , my understudy , would have to go on ... ( It ) instantly brought back the pain .
I screamed for a nurse who jabbed me with more morphine .
" I knew then that the Sob ( son of a b** ch ) was going to be a ' star . ' "
Medieval Churches : Solar - Powered Nanotech Pioneers
August 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
As I recently discussed , sometimes we need to look to the past for solutions to our current problems .
Queensland University professor Zhu Huai
Yong has done just that , noting that painting glass windows with gold particles can purify the air .
Zhu came across this realization after studying medieval painted church windows , which were often decorated using glass colored with gold nanoparticles .
Though people likely did not realize it at the time the churches were built , the sun-energized nanoparticles destroy air - borne pollutants , as sunlight creates an electromagnetic field that resonates with the gold particles ’ oscillations .
While CO2 is a byproduct of the filtering process , it only occurs in small amounts and is not as harmful as volatile organic compounds that the nanoparticles destroy .
Zhu ’s discovery is n’t just trivia fodder — the researcher believes that it could be applied to produce specialty chemicals at room temperature that are both cost - effective ( despite the high price of gold ) and have minimal environmental impact .

Computer engineer keeping quiet on lockout SAN FRANCISCO
He appears in court on 4 felony charges - $ 5 billion bail hit
The San Francisco computer engineer charged with masterminding a cyber -coup of the city 's network is being paid as he sits in jail , refusing to allow other administrators to get into the system that controls e-mails , law enforcement records and payroll documents , authorities said Tuesday .
Terry Childs , 43 , of Pittsburg , who earns a six - figure salary with the city Technology Department , appeared in court Tuesday on four felony counts of computer tampering before being returned to his jail cell .
He is being held in lieu of $ 5 million bail , an amount his lawyer called " crazy . "
According to prosecutors , Childs , who has a 25 - year - old criminal record in Kansas for aggravated robbery , locked out all other administrators from the city 's computer system after they started asking questions about a run -in he had with his agency 's head of security .
Mayor Gavin Newsom described Childs as a formerly well - liked employee who " got a bit maniacal . "
Childs was part of the team that built FiberWAN ( wide area network ) , the backbone of the city 's computer network , said Ron Vinson , chief administrative officer for the Technology Department .
The system stores about 60 percent of all city government data .
By the time Childs was done with his alleged criminal deeds , he had created a password that gave him exclusive access to that data , prosecutors said .
When police asked him to divulge the password , Childs first gave a bogus code and then refused to provide the correct one even under the threat of arrest , authorities said .
Childs ' bosses ordered him to leave work July 9 for alleged insubordination , but they continue to pay his $ 127,735 - a- year salary .
Vinson insisted that was standard procedure , even for a city employee accused of four felonies .
A hearing to determine whether Childs will be placed on unpaid leave has yet to be scheduled but could be held as early as Thursday , Vinson said .
On Tuesday , Childs appeared calm as he stood next to deputy public defender Mark Jacobs at a brief hearing in San Francisco Superior Court .
Childs spoke only once , when he agreed to appear again in court Thursday .
From jail , he declined a request for an interview .
Outside court , Jacobs suggested the case against Childs was overblown and the result of a misunderstanding , and called the $ 5 million bail " crazy . "
" I do n't think he 's a threat , " Jacobs said .
" He did n't kill anybody , and murderers usually get a $ 1 million bail , so you do the math .
Someone out there is really scared of something , and I do n't know what that is . "
Erica Derryck , a spokeswoman for District Attorney Kamala Harris , said that " there seems to be a threat to public safety , and bail was set accordingly . "
She did not elaborate on what that threat was .
Officials have said they feared that Childs may have enabled a third party to gain access to the computer system by telephone or other electronic device and order the destruction of hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents .
However , they have found no evidence of such a device in searches of his home and car .
Newsom said Tuesday that Childs ' actions prevented administrators from making changes to the city 's computer network , so if the system were to crash , workers could not undertake repairs or upgrades .
" There 's nothing to be alarmed about , save the inability to get into the system and tweak the system , " Newsom said .
" Nothing dramatic has changed in terms of our ability to govern the city . "
He said the city has brought in experts from Cisco Systems to try to break back into the network .
If the city has to rebuild the network from scratch , Newsom said , it could take up to eight weeks at an uncertain cost .
Childs could be liable for the damages .
The mayor said that until recently , Childs was highly regarded in the Technology Department .
Now , he said , Childs is a " rogue employee that got a bit maniacal . "
" He was very good at what he did , and sometimes that goes to people 's heads , " Newsom said , " and we think that 's what this is about . "
According to authorities , Childs had been becoming more and more protective of the system he worked on in recent months .
He was hired five years ago , even after telling officials on a job application that he had a felony conviction .
According to court records in Kansas , Childs was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary stemming from charges filed in 1982 .
He was on probation or parole until 1987 , records show .
On June 20 , authorities said , Childs started taking photographs of the Technology Department 's new head of security after she began an audit of who had password access to the system .
The woman became frightened by Childs ' behavior and locked herself in an office , authorities said .
His supervisors ' concern grew when it became clear that Childs had not only given himself exclusive access to the system , but had created a way to spy on his bosses ' e-mails related to his conduct , authorities said .

Perl 6 Type System Overview
General
You might be surprised to learn that the Synopses does not say much about the Perl 6 type system .
Rather , it is more of a requirements document with some examples of what it ought to be able to do , and some statements of guiding principles .
So , my work in fleshing this out is n’t proposing radical changes to the existing work , but is defining the stuff in the first place .
This page summarizes the state of affairs .
What the Synopses Say
See
What the Synopses say for a listing of what the Synopses say about the type system .
This does n’t cover matters of syntax or features that use types , but things that must be true on a deep level about the type system itself .
Notice how little is says .
Yes , we have classes .
We know that you can optionally check parameter types .
Well , the rest is in the details !
Highly Abstracted Metaclass
Fundamentally , Perl 6 syntax allows for named method dispatch on objects .
But it does not demand anything of the type system to do it !
Classes are ruled by metaobjects that do n’t have to be of specific types , or be organized in any specific way .
Basically , you can write your own method dispatcher and drop it in , with any representation and feature set you like .
Fundamentally , each object points to its metaobject which Perl talks to in order to do a regular dispatch .
Objects do n’t have to belong to classes in the traditional sense .
Rather , each object could be one - of - a- kind like in Self or Javescript .
The concept of the object ’s metaobject is purposefully more general than that of a type .
Each object knows how to perform dispatches on itself , and that ’s about all there is to it .
This can be used to supply different object systems , such as the standard Perl 6 class system , a Perl 5 compatibility system , a COM / CORBA interface , whatever foreign object support , or whatever .
I ’m sure some day there will be a Self - like object system on CPAN , and you can code with those and never touch the class keyword .
The rest of this article is about the standard Perl 6 type system , which is supported by the built - in class mechanisms , grammar , library , etc .
But remember , you can change anything .
What are Types ?
What does Perl 6 the language think about types , in general ?
Single Dispatch
To ordinary ( single dispatch ) method calls , the “ type ” is simply what the metaobject decides to do .
The object contains an internal hidden pointer to the metaobject , and that ’s all there is .
For normal classes , each class is a type , represented by a distinct metaobject which dispatches to the methods defined for that class .
Type annotations on variables have nothing to do here .
Methods dispatch based on their metaobject , and no “ type checking ” is done anywhere .
This is the Perl 5 model , and it will continue to work if you do n’t declare types on your variables or parameters at all .
Multi Dispatch
On the other hand , for “ multi ” subs and methods , types have meanings .
In order to resolve to the correct multi choice , the multimethod dispatch ( MMD ) system built into Perl 6 has a detailed awareness about certain aspects of types .
Obviously , it needs to know that values have particular types .
It needs to compare this to the declared parameter types , and work out partial ordering relationships and better / worse match rules .
So it knows that some types may be substituted for another , and that some substitutions are better than others .
Some type substitutions are valid only depending on other details of the parameter declarations .
For example , a read - only parameter can accept more than a by - reference parameter .
Static Type Checking
If you declare types on your variables , Perl 6 will validate that only compatible objects are stored in those variables .
This is a subset of what is known by the MMD system .
It does n’t care how good a match is , only that it is indeed allowed .
Besides checking assignments and parameters for legality , Perl can use its knowledge to perform conversions automatically .
Instead of saying “ You ca n’t do that ” , it will know how it can work , and take care of the details for you .
Optimization
If a variable is known to hold a particular type , method dispatch can be highly optimized .
Instead of looking up a method by name , it can use a direct pointer to the proper code .
So typing your variables can make code run much faster , not just catch mistakes at compile time .
Relationships Between Types
The big question is , “ Just what are the relationships between types ? ”
The relationship tells whether or not I can store a particular object in a typed variable , whether or not a parameter is of the correct type for a call , and which multimethod ( if any ) is matched by a particular set of actual parameter types .
The questions of “ can this substitute for that ? ” , “ if so , how ? ” , and “ is this better or worse ? ” describes the meat of the type system .
This is not discussed in any manner whatsoever in the synopses , except to assume that “ isa ” subtyping is assumed to work like in Perl 5 .
Thinking it through , it provides for simple dispatch , but does n’t work once you add types to parameters .
This is discussed in detail on my page “ isa ” relationships and inheritance .
The learned opinion among those who have pondered the issues in the Perl6 - language mailing list for a few years is that research has been done on this topic since the mid 1980s , and lessons can be learned from seeing how templates in C++ provide a different kind of reuse , and from the work in other languages faced with similar issues .
You might want to check Wikipedia on Type polymorphism for a summary .
The higher - order concept of substitutability that takes in both “ isa ” inheritance and generics is called “ Function - bounded quantification ” , or simply “ F - bounds ” .
My introduction to performing F - bounds in the Perl 6 type system is described in Advanced Polymorphism in Perl 6 — Features of a second - generation type system ( PDF ) or ( ODT )

Despite the massive federal stimulus package , national GDP only grew 1.9 percent from April to June , the Commerce Department announced Thursday , and it actually shrank in the last quarter of 2007 .
Meanwhile , high gas prices , supposedly reflecting costs , spiked profits of oil companies , with Exxon recording its most profitable quarter ever .
In fact , reports the NYT , “ It was the highest quarterly profit ever for any American company , as Exxon made nearly $ 90,000 a minute . ”
New York Times :
Such profits have made Exxon Mobil a target of politicians in recent years , propelling calls for windfall profits taxes to finance research and development for renewable fuels to replace oil .
The principal reason for the company ’s banquet of riches is rising fuel prices .
Crude oil prices in the second quarter averaged more than $ 124 a barrel , 91 percent higher than the same quarter in 2007 , according to Oppenheimer & Company .
Natural gas prices averaged $ 10.80 per thousand cubic feet , up 43 percent from the quarter a year ago .
But while high energy prices brought Exxon $ 10 billion in earnings from selling oil in the quarter , up about $ 4.1 billion or nearly 70 percent , not everything in its earnings report heartened investors .
The company reported that its oil production decreased 8 percent from the second quarter of 2007 , largely because of an expropriation of Exxon assets by the Venezuelan government and labor strife in Nigeria .
The company spent $ 7 billion , or nearly 40 percent more than the same quarter last year , to find and produce oil from new fields .

One of the leading researchers in the United States has committed suicide after finding out that criminal charges were almost filed against him over the anthrax assaults that caused traumas to Americans after September 11 tragedy .
Bruce Ivins , 62 , was a biodefense researcher .
Shortly before the suicide he was informed about the awaiting trial .
After being warned about criminal charges against him , Ivins swallowed a huge dose of painkillers .
For the last 18 years the researcher was one of the employees at the U.S. government 's biodefence laboratories , located at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
The FBI started an investigation of the anthrax assaults that led to the death of five people .
The FBI 's center of attention was the laboratory where Ivins worked .
The acute infectious disease was sent via mail to media organizations and politicians .
This happened in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC .
The virus managed to kill five people and infected 17 others , disabled national postal services and a Senate office building .
The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr Ivins was considered to be a talented microbiologist who provided help to FBI in examining materials contained in one of the envelopes that included the disease sent to the Washington office of the U.S. senator .
The scientist died at Frederick Memorial Hospital in Maryland .
The official cause of death has not yet been revealed .
According to the Los Angeles Times , quoting one of its anonymous colleagues , the U.S. researcher had taken a deadly dose of a Tylenol mixed with codeine .
" People here are pretty shook up about it , " said Caree Vander Linden , a spokeswoman for the agency where Ivins worked .
One of Ivins ' former colleagues mentioned that the scientist suffered from depression and had warned of suicide .
One of the man 's brothers , Thomas Ivins , said that it was n't a surprise for him to find out about the suicide of his brother .
" He buckled under the pressure from the federal government , " said Thomas Ivins , who also mentioned that the FBI agents arrived to Ohio last year to interrogate him and he had " sung like a canary " about the personality of his brother .
" He had in his mind that he was omnipotent , " added Thomas Ivins .
Previously another scientist was under suspicion .
His name is Steven Hatfill and he worked in the same laboratory as Ivins .
The scientist filed lawsuits against officials from the Justice Department .
One of his " targets " was Attorney General John Ashcroft , who in 2002 described Mr Hatfill as " person of interest " in the investigation .
In order to drop Mr Hatfill 's lawsuit , the Department agreed to pay him $ 5.85 million .
Head of FBI , Robert Mueller , recently stated that the agency is currently registering " great progress " in its investigation over anthrax attacks and that it was " in no way dormant . "

PAUL  The Democratic National Convention significantly boosted Americans ' views of Barack Obama as a strong leader who " shares your values " and can manage the economy and Iraq , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Saturday and Sunday finds .
Republican John McCain 's advantage in handling terrorism was dramatically reduced , and his " unfavorable " rating ticked up to its highest level this year .
" This is a convention bounce , " said Robert Eisinger , a political scientist at Lewis & Clark College and author of The Evolution of Presidential Polling .
The results reflected the impact of themes the Democrats hammered at their convention in Denver last week .
Eisinger cautioned , " The Republicans have n't yet had their convention , and John McCain will be exposed to a large segment of the population as well " with their convention this week .
The GOP has had to deal with competing events , however , including Hurricane Gustav and Monday 's news that vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's teenage daughter is pregnant .
In the head - to - head race , Obama leads 50 % - 43 % among registered voters .
In the USA TODAY Poll taken Aug. 21 - 23 , the Illinois senator held a 4 - percentage - point lead .
The new survey shows Americans settling into their choices .
Twenty - one percent of registered voters say they either have n't decided or might change their minds .
In a USA TODAY Poll before the convention , 30 % were swing voters .
Among other findings :
• Obama eliminated McCain 's advantage as " a strong and decisive leader . "
By 46 % - 44 % , those surveyed says that characteristic applies more to Obama than McCain .
Before the convention , McCain held an 8 - point advantage .
Obama has a 13 - point advantage as someone who " shares your values , " almost double the edge he held before .
He has an 8 - point advantage as someone who is " honest and trustworthy " ; pre-convention , they were equal .
• On handling issues , Obama and McCain are rated equally in handling Iraq — 47 % prefer Obama , 46 % McCain — while McCain has a 9 - point advantage in handling terrorism .
Before the convention , McCain had a 22 - point lead .
Obama has a 19 - point lead in managing the economy .
• Obama has eased concerns about experience , but they remain a significant factor .
Fifty percent of those surveyed say they are very or somewhat concerned about his experience .
Before the convention , 57 % were .
•McCain 's favorable - unfavorable rating was 54%- 38 % , a healthy mark but his highest unfavorable this year .
Obama 's rating was 61%- 32 % .
In the poll , Democrats continue to benefit from an " enthusiasm gap . "
By 57 % - 28 % , Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents say they are more enthusiastic than usual this year .
By 47%-39 % , Republicans and Republican - leaning independents say they are less enthusiastic than usual .
The poll of 2,035 adults has a margin of error of +/— 2 percentage points .
The sample of 1,835 registered voters has an error margin of +/—3 points .
Sarah Palin has , at times , sounded a cautionary note on earmarks despite the fact that Alaska receives more earmarked federal money per capita than any other state .
Palin 's earmarks :
Not just for the halibut
Senator John McCain recently told reporters that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has “ learned that earmarks are bad . ”
But not that bad , apparently .
According to a “ summary of requests for federal appropriations ” posted to her budget office ’s website earlier this year , Palin requested millions of federal dollars for everything from improving recreational halibut fishing to studying the mating habits of crabs and the DNA of harbor seals .
Advertisement
It ’s a position at odds with her recasting as an anti-earmarking champion , and with the tone of the biting scorn she ’s employed toward the budgetary practice this week .
“ In just three years our opponent has requested nearly one billion dollars in earmarks .
That ’s nearly a million dollars for every working day , ” Palin told a crowd in Lebanon , Ohio , Tuesday .
“ So as we reform the abusive earmarks in our state our opponent was requesting nearly a billion dollars in earmarks as a senatorial privilege as I was vetoing half a billion as an executive responsibility . ”
Palin ’s earmark requests are n’t unusual , of course .
Every self - respecting mayor and governor in America seeks federal dollars for local projects .
And Palin has , at times , sounded a cautionary note on earmarks despite the fact that Alaska receives more earmarked federal money per capita than any other state and is unusually reliant on those funds because of its geographic isolation , massive size and extreme climate .
Indeed , in her January state of the state address , Palin said the state “ must not rely so heavily on federal government earmarks . ”
But the document summarizing Palin ’s earmark requests was created the next month , and it suggested a still - healthy appetite for earmarks .
Soon afterward , Palin wrote an op - ed in a local newspaper outlining her not - so - reticent posture on earmarks .
“ My role at the federal level is simply to submit the most well - conceived earmark requests we can , ” she wrote .
Obama 's campaign has responded by challenging Palin 's reform credentials .
" Senator McCain said Governor Palin ‘ learned that earmarks are bad ’ , but in 2008 alone Gov. Palin requested $ 256 million in earmarks for Alaska , and her state received more earmarks per person that any other state , " said spokesman Tommy Vietor .
" The fact is that Governor Palin is n’t just good at getting pork projects , she ’s one of the most successful pork barrel politicians in history . "
Alaska has indeed been spectacularly successful in getting earmarks , largely through the efforts of its senior senator , Ted Stevens , who is now fighting corruption charges .
( Stevens ’ requests include far more than those listed by Palin . )
And Palin ’s office has actively backed some of its legislators ’ requests , according to the document , which covers requests for the fiscal years of 2008 and 2009 .
Her campaign did n’t respond directly to the question of whether Palin still supports those specific earmarks , or how she would defend them .
Though McCain has avoided this campaign year saying which earmarks he'd cut from the federal budget , he is recognized in general as a consistent opponent of earmarks who has focused on the cumulative effect of pet projects written into the federal budgets by parochial - minded legislators .
Some on Alaska ’s list are the kind of uncontroversial projects that make most earmarks hard to cut – even if it ’s difficult to see their importance to the nation , rather than the state : construction of Alaska National Guard facilities , for instance , to stop drug abuse , and to improve a crime database .
Many others , though , are of exactly the sort that McCain has made a career of mocking — like animal research .
“ We ’re not going to spend $ 3 million of your tax dollars to study the DNA of bears in Montana , ” McCain has said during this year ’s campaign , referring to a study he ’s mocked for years of whether grizzlies need to keep their status as an endangered species .
Palin , meanwhile , has requested $ 3.2 million to be spent in part researching the “ genetics of harbor seals , ” in one of the state ’s many requests for federal funding of research into Alaska ’s fauna .
She ’s seeking $ 1 million , for instance , for a project to investigate rockfish fisheries , a request that , according to the Alaska document , was presented to and refused by Congress last year .
“ Our state 's economy depends a certain amount on tourism … and there are a lot of charter fishermen who have clients that want to come up fish for halibut , and likewise when they 're fishing for halibut they 're catching … rockfish as a by - catch in that fishery , ” said Cleo Brylinsky , who heads up the rockfish project at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game .
“ So it 's important to our tourism economy that we have sustainable fisheries and well - managed fisheries , ” she said .
The rockfish research is one of several requests for federal help studying marine wildlife , which , coming from another candidate , might have drawn McCain ’s mockery .
Here are a few , with the state ’s description of the project :
• $ 400,000 : Alaska Invasive Species Program : Continues to comprehensively prevent , identify , and respond to the threat of invasive species on the Alaska environment .
• $ 494,900 : Assessment of Recreational Halibut Harvest in Alaska :
This is an ongoing effort to collect data on the recreational halibut fishery that is conducted by federal agencies though relying on the state for data .
• $ 2 million : Bering Sea Crab Research and Management : Researches Bering Sea crab productivity and sustainability as necessary to restore crab stocks .
• $ 3.2 million : Seal and Steller Sea Lion Biological Research : Funds monitoring of ice seal populations in Native villages , research on the species delineation and genetics of harbor seals to understand the declines in population and provide for population restoration , and continues research into Steller Sea Lion population decline .
The McCain - Palin campaign did n’t respond to the questions of whether Palin still backs those specific requests , or how she would defend them in light of her opposition to earmarks .
In response to those questions , McCain - Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said the governor believes in “ open , transparent , and efficient government ” and criticized Obama for making extensive earmark requests .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives on Tuesday night passed an energy bill clearing the way for more oil drilling off U.S. coasts , but not nearly as much as Republican leaders wanted .
The bill was passed by a vote of 236-189 .
Many Republicans opposed the bill because it would allow new oil drilling only between 50 and 100 miles offshore .
Republicans generally want to allow new drilling starting 3 miles from shore .
Republicans also objected to provisions repealing tax cuts for the oil industry and what they said was a lack of incentive for states to allow drilling on their land .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , told reporters Tuesday : " The American taxpayers have been ripped off for years on offshore drilling .
This bill changes that . "
Before the vote , Pelosi said the bill presented a choice between " the status quo , which is preferred by Big Oil , " and " change for the future to take our country in a new direction . "
Fifteen Republicans voted for the largely Democrat - backed bill .
Thirteen Democrats voted against it .
The Senate , meanwhile , could vote on various energy proposals , including more offshore drilling , as early as this week .
The House bill would require states to give their permission for drilling on their land .
It also would offer incentives for renewable energy , require the government to release oil from its emergency reserve , and force oil companies to drill on federal lands they already lease from the government .
Democratic leaders had previously opposed Republican - led efforts to repeal a 1981 law barring most offshore drilling .
But they changed course over the August recess , saying their new plans would allow some expanded drilling .
See where U.S. offshore drilling is banned »
But Republicans say the House bill would n't expand offshore drilling enough .
Before the vote , Rep. Mike Pence , an Indiana Republican , called the bill " a charade , " denying it would do what its backers claim .
" This is not ' yes ' to drilling .
This is ' yes , but , ' " he said .
" This is 'yes , but no drilling in Alaska , no drilling in the Eastern Gulf , no drilling inside 50 miles , ' " Pence said .
" This is 'yes , but no litigation reform that will prevent radical environmental attorneys from tying up leases even before a single shovel of dirt is turned . ' "
Democrats and Republicans traded harsh words on the House floor Tuesday in the debate over the bill .
Rep. Anthony Weiner , a New York Democrat , said President Bush 's " idea of an energy policy is holding hands with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia , embracing him with a big smooch . "
When the Republicans " controlled Congress , [ they ] passed their own energy bill , signed into law by the president .
We got into this mess , " Weiner said .
But Rep. Jeb Hensarling , a Texas Republican , shot back that the Democrats ' bill is a " sham " and a " fraud . "
" This is a bill designed to ensure Democrats ' re-election , not designed to ensure affordable energy in America , " Hensarling said .
Hensarling also complained about how the bill was brought to the floor : " No amendments , no substitutes , no committee hearings .
Is this democracy ?
No . "

BUFFALO , New York , July 21 ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain appeared to leave a door open on Monday to a large - scale drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq in the next two years .
McCain , who has wrapped up his party 's White House nomination , has long argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal .
But the discussion on troop levels has shifted in recent days after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki seemed to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's call for troops to be gone within 16 months of his taking office .
Obama met with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad on Monday , and an Iraqi government spokesman said Maliki told the Illinois senator conditions on the ground should dictate troop withdrawals .
After a meeting with former President George H.W. Bush , McCain was asked whether it was conceivable for U.S. troops to be fully pulled out of Iraq in about two years .
" I think they could be largely withdrawn , " the Arizona senator replied , citing the success of the " surge " strategy of increasing U.S. troop levels in increasing security in the country .
" As I 've said , we have succeeded .
This strategy is not ( just ) succeeding , we have succeeded .
And of course as we all know it has to be based on conditions on the ground . "
McCain said U.S. military success had made it possible for troops to return .
" When you win wars , troops come home .
And we are winning , " he said .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said the senator 's comments did not reflect a shift in position .
" The two years in his answer today is consistent with his position that we can begin to responsibly discuss the reduction of troop levels in Iraq as long as they are based on maintaining the security and stability of the gains we made , " Bounds said .
SHIFTING ATTENTION
Obama 's trip to the Middle East and Europe has drawn significant media attention , to the frustration of the McCain campaign .
Columnist Robert Novak , citing sources close to the McCain campaign , reported in the Evans - Novak Political Report that the Republican senator may announce his vice presidential pick this week to draw some attention away from the Obama trip .
Bounds declined to comment on the report .
Earlier , the campaign said a McCain opinion article about Iraq offered to The New York Times as a rebuttal to Obama had been rejected .
The McCain camp had submitted the article to The Times as a response to a piece by Obama published by the newspaper last week .
Obama 's piece , " My Plan for Iraq , " had detailed his goal of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 16 months if he is elected on Nov. 4 .
The McCain article was largely a critique of Obama 's position , arguing against establishing a set timetable for pulling out U.S. troops .
" During the course of eight visits to Iraq , I have heard many times from our troops what Major General Jeffrey Hammond , commander of coalition forces in Baghdad , recently said : that leaving based on a timetable would be ' very dangerous , ' " McCain wrote .
An e-mail sent to the McCain staff by a Times editor said it would be terrific to have an article from McCain but that the one sent in was not acceptable as written and that a new draft should articulate how McCain defines victory in Iraq .
The McCain campaign , which does not feel McCain gets equal treatment in the U.S. news media , expressed dismay at the Times ' decision and suspected it was because the Times did not agree with McCain 's policy .
The New York Times said it was standard procedure to have a " back and forth with an author about his or her submission " and looked forward to publishing McCain 's views .

McCain opts for Obama Iran plan
John McCain , Republican presidential candidate , has said he would authorise his secretary of state to talk to Iran about its nuclear programme , in a break with Bush administration policy and his own previous stance .

Dell is actively promoting a Microsoft licensing loophole to channel partners eager to keep selling PCs installed with Windows XP , after Microsoft 's official cut off .
The Dell channel blog is pointing resellers to the loophole in the Windows Vista license that enables business customers to downgrade from the unwanted Windows Vista to its dated , but comfortable and better - supported predecessor .
According to the blog : " Dell can sell what we 've branded ' Windows Vista Bonus ' which allows us to preinstall XP Professional with a Vista license ( on select system categories ) .
This lets customer 's upgrade to the Vista platform when they 're ready .
And yes , Dell will support both OSs . "
Dell 's blog points resellers to further information here .
Dell , meanwhile , is also making Windows XP available as an image to those partners using the company 's Custom Factory Integration service .
The blog was designed to coincide with the last day Windows XP was officially available from Microsoft .
From now on , you can only get Windows Vista .
Officially .
Dell has taken a leading position in continuing to offer Windows XP .
Earlier this month Dell vowed to keep selling PCs running the operating system until " at least 2009 " .
Dell 's stance of not just offering Windows XP directly but actively telling its huge ecosystem of resellers how they , too , can game Microsoft 's system and continue selling Windows XP demonstrates a significant shift in the OEM 's relationship with Microsoft .
With chief software architect Bill Gates ' departure fresh in the air , it should be remembered how , under Gates ' tenure last decade as chief executive , Microsoft exploited its position as supplier of a popular PC operating system to play hardball with PC OEMs on licensing Windows .
During the US Department of Justice 's antitrust trial , IBM revealed that Microsoft had delayed giving IBM access to Windows 95 simply because IBM refused to kill its own OS / 2 operating system or agree to not bundle its SmartSuite rival to Office on IBM PCs .®

Colin Beavan , aka No Impact Man , had a run-in today with a NY state senator today .
Or , I guess , you could call it a near run in ?
Here ’s his open letter to Senator Jeff Klein :
September 17 , 2008
Senator Jeff Klein
Legislative Office Building
Room 313
Albany , New York 12247
Dear Senator Klein ,
RE : My request , as a member of the board of Transportation Alternatives , to meet with you to discuss transportation policy as it relates to bicycle safety , carbon emissions , the cultivation of New York City quality of life , breathable air , and traffic congestion .
Though you may not know my name , you may recall that you and I met today under rather unpleasant circumstances on New York City ’s Broadway , just north of City Hall .
You were driving your black Mercedes .
I was riding a small folding bicycle and wearing a purple helmet .
To refresh your memory :
Traffic was moving rather slowly and you were heading in the downtown direction , as was I .
You were in the far left lane and I was riding on the curbside of that lane , near your rear passenger door .
Suddenly , you began to veer your Mercedes to the left , potentially crushing me between your car and the cars parked on the side of the road .
With nowhere to go to get out of your way , and to avoid serious injury or death , in desperation , I chose to knock on your window to let you know that I was there and that you should avoid veering further in my direction .
At this point , you brought your vehicle to an abrupt halt , not to avoid hitting me , but because you apparently needed to communicate something to me .
You rolled down your window and said , “ Get your hands off my car , you [ f *** ing a ** hole ] . ”
I said , “ You were veering into me and going to crush me . ”
You said , “ You better not touch other people ’s cars .
You might find that touching other people ’s cars is more dangerous than traffic . ”
This gave me the impression that you were threatening me .
I said , “ I think my life is more precious than your car . ”
You said , “ I did n’t see you . ”
I said , “ If you ’re driving a car , it ’s your responsibility to see what ’s in road space before you veer into it .
That ’s what your driver side mirror is for . ”
You said , “ I looked in my mirror . ”
I said , “ You should also turn and look over your shoulder since you know there could be a bicyclist . ”
You said , “ Yeah .
Well , maybe you should watch where you ’re going . ”
I said , “ Where was I supposed to go ?
I was there .
And you were veering into me . ”
I was about to remind you that , in the past week , two cyclists have been killed by automobiles in New York City , but you made a gesture which implied you considered this conversation a waste of time and drove off .
That is when I saw that your car had special license plates proclaiming your membership of the New York State Senate .
A red light stopped you at the next intersection .
I rode alongside you and , more cautiously , tapped again on your window .
You rolled it down .
I could tell by your face that you were n’t happy to be talking again to this particular New York State citizen , on whose behalf you govern .
I asked you , “ What is your name , Senator ? ”
You said , “ Senator Jeff Klein . ”
This is how I know it was you .
Now , the thing is , Senator , I do n’t particularly call you to task for calling me a [ f *** ing a ** hole ] .
If the roles had been reversed , and I had a big black Mercedes and you came up in a purple helmet , knocking on my window , and I did n’t realize I was on the verge of crushing your legs , I might have called you a [ f *** ing a ** hole ] , too .
I ’d like to point out , however , that , as mad as you were about my touching your car window with my hand , you could double or triple that strength of emotion when it comes to how frightening it is to be on the other side of the Mercedes driving wheel , especially when that particular Mercedes is coming toward you .
Weigh it up : “ he might scratch my black Mercedes ” against “ he might cause my little girl to be left fatherless . ”
Weigh it up again :
One guy is riding a bike that weighs a grand total of 22 pounds and has a relatively small potential to harm others .
The other guy is in charge of a powerful machine that weighs a couple of tons .
Which person has the greater responsibility to watch out for the care and welfare of people who may get in their path , by their own fault or not ?
As a State Senator , I ’m sure you especially feel the weight of the obligation to look out for the welfare of others , no ?
Again , this is not to say you did not act like many other humans in the same situation .
But it is to say that transportation policy in New York City currently falls way too short of making sure that unintended confrontations like ours–and worse ones that end in fatalities – do n’t occur .
Proper policy , which provided ubiquitous segregated bike lanes or which limited traffic congestion , could reduce such incidents without having to depend on drivers of black Mercedes , for example , remembering to look in their driver side mirror or over their shoulders .
It is for this reason that I hope you will honor my request to visit your office , along with Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Paul Steely
White , to ask you to reconsider your current platforms on transportation and traffic congestion in New York City .
As you know , the United States ’ dependence of foreign oil contributes significantly to our current economic crisis and is a matter of national security .
Furthermore , the planet ’s future ability to support human life is in peril because of global warming caused , in large measure , by the overuse of the same foreign oil .
At the same time , countless studies show that making the streets of New York and other cities safer and more convenient for bicyclists and pedestrians would reduce automobile use , dependence on foreign oil , carbon emissions , and traffic congestion while contributing to breathable air and livable streets , improved retail business , and the physical health of New Yorkers .
Yet , until now , your platform has presented obstacles to the adaptations that might bring these benefits to New York City .
Not only did you oppose congestion pricing , a measure intended to decrease vehicular traffic , but you proposed eliminating the tolls on bridges and tunnels into Manhattan on holidays , which would bring more traffic into the City and further encourage automobile use , just when it should be decreased .
I hope you ’ll consider that these policies are out of step with the current times .
I hope , too , seeing , in the case of our confrontation , the result of your policies when it comes to impact on personal lives , in general , and the safety of bikers , in particular , might also give you cause to reconsider your position .
Policies that make New York City safe for bicyclists and pedestrians –the people who live on the streets as opposed to the people who just drive through them–is best , both for our citizens and the planet .
I look forward to hearing from you regarding my request to meet in person to discuss these issues .
Yours sincerely ,
Colin Beavan
aka No Impact Man ,
Board Member , Transportation Alternatives
Charlie and Sarah , sitting in a tree …
You may have read that ABC ’s Charlie Gibson got the first real interview with Sarah Palin following her being chosen as McCain ’s VP .
Well , okay , that ’s not entirely true .
An AMERICAblog reader got the first real interview with Sarah Palin , and Palin apparently got flustered and refused to answer the question .
Anyway , as Greg Sargent at TPM Election Central notes , Gibson thinks the only relevant questions to ask Palin are about her positions on issues .
No questions about her husband ’s membership in the fringe Alaskan Independence Party .
No questions about her own membership in that party ( the McCain campaign has denied that she was ever a member , but several others have said she was , and in any case , she courted the party repeatedly even though they ’re rabidly anti-American ) .
No questions about what actual vetting Palin underwent .
And Gibson says he ’s REALLY not going to get into the issue of Palin ’s daughter ’s pregnancy – you remember that issue , it ’s the pregnancy the McCain campaign leaked to Reuters and then turned around and blamed everyone else for writing about .
Yes , Palin subsequently said she was proud of her daughter ’s choice in keeping the baby .
So she gave her daughter a choice , but opposes giving YOUR daughters a choice .
No , Charlie Gibson wo n’t ask about that , because that would be a fact , and facts are mean .
DIGG THIS
The " official " debt of the United States is only around $ 10 trillion dollars as of August 6 , 2008 .
This is a manageable number ; we could pay it off in a few decades if we quit buying luxuries like food and clothing , and take a few other minor economy measures .
Unfortunately , the " $ 10 trillion " number was produced by government accounting , which among other things allows one to ignore Social Security , Medicare , and the new prescription drug benefit .
This is like ignoring rent , food , and utilities in your household budget … it will lead to a few bounced checks .
Our real debt is about ten times higher .
Who says so ?
The President of the Dallas Federal Reserve , Richard W. Fisher .
In a May speech at the Commonwealth Club of California , he states that the US national debt is close to $ 100 trillion .
You can read his whole speech at the Federal Reserve web site .
The Real Debt
Here is what he said regarding the actual US debt :
" Add together the unfunded liabilities from Medicare and Social Security , and it comes to $ 99.2 trillion over the infinite horizon .
Traditional Medicare composes about 69 percent , the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and Social Security the remaining 14 percent . "
Interested readers will notice that the new prescription drug benefit is projected to be more fiscally crushing than all of Social Security .
Mr. Fisher points out that this $ 99.2 trillion will be a bit of a burden to pay off :
" Let ’s say you and I and Bruce Ericson and every U.S. citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump - sum payments from our own pocketbooks , so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity .
How much would we have to pay if we split the tab ?
Again , the math is painful .
With a total population of 304 million , from infants to the elderly , the per-person payment to the federal treasury would come to $ 330,000 .
This comes to $ 1.3 million per family of fouru2014over 25 times the average household ’s income . "
You do have $ 1.3 million in your pocket , right ?
What , are you some kind of deadbeat ?
Speaking of deadbeats , the " $ 99.2 trillion " estimate does not include the subprime bailout .
So for those who like large round numbers , by the end of 2008 the real National Debt should be large , round , and about $ 100 trillion .
Other Unfunded Liabilities
The Fed ’s numbers do not include some other liabilities the US has acquired over the years .
One massive but unquantifiable liability is the probability of future wars .
If it cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars to invade the fifth - rate kleptocracy of Iraq and the foreign - aid regime of Afghanistan , how many trillions would wars against real powers cost ?
Perhaps I should ask " how many US cities " such wars would cost .
Some nations could legitimately plan for peace .
Sweden has not fought a foreign war since 1814 ( as many Swedes have pointed out in emails regarding my Swiss article ) .
Switzerland , not since 1815 .
The US record is less hopeful .
The US is rarely not in foreign wars , and the current Administration has openly announced that the " Global War On Terror " will never end .
Yet our government accounting is predicated on perpetual peace , on an ever - increasing flow of money into the official pyramid schemes .
In any case , whether you are pro- or anti- Empire , real accounting demands some reserves for future war contingencies .
When even a few US cities are burning radioactive pyres , the flow of funds to Social Security and Medicare will suffer some interruption .
Any fiscal plan demands amortization of the accumulated hatred our foreign adventures have accumulated .
The US taxpayer has aided every evil dictator since 1945 .
Stalin , Castro , Pol Pot , Nyerere , Idi Amin , go right down the roster and US money helped pay for the barbed wire and bullets ( and the nuclear reactors , in the case of the Kim Dynasty rulers of Korea ) .
So far blowback has been quite mild .
But in a world full of easy do - it - yourself WMD technologies , our luck ca n’t hold forever .
If the US were a private company , the " badwill " on our books would reach into the tens of trillions .
Tearing Up The Credit Cards
Most likely , the US will simply continue into bankruptcy .
This is the most common pathway for nations with fiat currencies and unchecked ruling classes .
But let ’s assume that somehow a Clone Army of 435 Ron Pauls gets into Congress , while genetic technology brings back Jefferson and Gallatin to their old offices .
Can the US be made solvent again ?
I think so .
Most of the unfunded liability is medical .
We know why the medical system does not work .
So if we eliminate the FDA , guild restrictions on medical professions , and the ridiculous tax laws that force us into medical - insurance serfdom to employers , we could cut medical costs enough to phase out Medicare and the new " drug benefit . "
In this way more than half the shadow debt can be wiped out .
The answer for the Social - Security pyramid scheme is well known .
Chile fixed its Social Security disaster decades ago , by giving large IRA - style allowances and phasing out the government payments to younger recipients .
The sooner we do this the easier it will be … the Boomers start retiring soon .
Most important , we have to listen to the Founder ’s calls for free trade with all nations but entangling alliances with none .
The US cannot stop every quarrel in the world even if we wished … and the actual record of our foreign - policy geniuses has been to send a couple of trillion dollars out to the very worst criminals in human history .
Aid To Dependent Dictators must stop .
None of this will happen while Mordor - On - The - Potomac still possesses its plutonium credit card , the Fed .
Just as we would for any other bankrupt relative , we must help Uncle Sam cut up his credit cards .
The Best of Bill Walker
Key differences in immune system signaling and the production of specific immune regulatory molecules may explain why some primates are able to live with an immunodeficiency virus infection without progressing to AIDS - like illness , unlike other primate species , including rhesus macaques and humans , that succumb to disease .
Following the identification of HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) as the cause of AIDS 25 years ago , an extensive search was undertaken to identify the source of the virus .
These studies led to the discovery that chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys are infected in the wild with simian immunodeficiency viruses ( SIV ) , whose transmission to humans and macaques leads to AIDS .
Surprisingly , the natural hosts for the AIDS viruses , such as the mangabeys and numerous other African primate species who have been found to harbor SIVs in the wild , remain healthy despite infection .
Understanding how the natural hosts evolved to resist the development of immunodeficiency disease has long represented a key unsolved mystery in our understanding of AIDS .
Furthermore , definition of the mechanisms by which they resist disease could help explain the mechanisms underlying AIDS progression in humans .
A team of scientists from Yerkes National Primate Research Center and the Emory Vaccine Center has discovered that the immune systems of sooty mangabeys are activated to a significantly lower extent during SIV infection than are the immune systems of rhesus macaques , and that this difference may explain why SIV and HIV infection leads to AIDS in some primate species but not others .
" During both HIV infection in humans and SIV infection in macaques , the host immune system becomes highly activated , experiences increased destruction and decreased production of key immune effector cells and progressively fails as a result .
In contrast , natural hosts for SIV infection , like sooty mangabeys , do not exhibit aberrant immune activation and do not develop AIDS despite high levels of ongoing SIV replication .
Our studies sought to understand the basis for the very different responses to AIDS virus infections in different species , " says Mark Feinberg , MD , PhD , the paper 's senior author .
Feinberg is a former investigator at the Emory Vaccine Center and the Yerkes Research Center and a professor of medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine .
He currently serves as vice president of medical affairs and policy for vaccines and infectious diseases at Merck & Co. , Inc .
The reasons are found in significant differences in immune signaling in a specific type of dendritic cells in AIDS - susceptible or resistant host species .
Dendritic cells are part of the immune system that play a key role in alerting the body to the presence of invading viruses or bacteria , and in initiating immune responses that enable clearance of these infections .
They detect the invaders using molecules called Toll - like receptors .

Feinberg 's team found that in sooty mangabeys , dendritic cells produce much less interferon alpha -- an alarm signal to the rest of the immune system -- in response to SIV .
As a result , the dendritic cells are not activated during the initial or chronic stages of SIV infection , and mangabeys fail to mount a significant immune response to the virus .
In contrast to mangabeys , dendritic cells from humans and macaques that are susceptible to developing AIDS are readily activated by HIV and SIV .
The difference in whether or not dendritic cells become activated upon AIDS virus exposure in specific primate hosts appears to result from species - specific differences in patterns of Toll - like - receptor signaling .
Because host immune responses are unable to clear AIDS virus infections , ongoing virus replication leads to unrelenting activation of the immune system in humans and macaques .
Unfortunately , rather than promoting clearance of the infection , chronic dendritic cell stimulation may result in chronic immune activation and significant unintended damage to the immune system in AIDS - susceptible species .
Such chronic immune activation is now recognized to be a major driving force for the development of AIDS .
The observation that mangabey dendritic cells are less susceptible to activation by SIV may explain why mangabeys do not exhibit abnormal immune activation and do not develop AIDS .
Thus , in mangabeys , the generation of a less vigorous immune response to SIV may represent an effective evolutionary response to a virus that is so resistant to clearance by antiviral immune responses .
The authors suggest new treatment strategies that would steer the immune system away from over - activation , thereby protecting against the unintended damage caused by host immune responses .
Such treatment approaches that focus on the host response to the AIDS virus may provide a valuable means of complementing the use of antiretroviral drugs that focus directly on inhibition of virus replication .
advertisement
Understanding the particular details of Toll - like receptor signaling pathways in the mangabeys may help guide the development of specific therapeutic approaches that could beneficially limit chronic immune activation in HIV - infected humans .
" Better understanding of the biological basis by which sooty mangabeys and the numerous primate species that represent natural hosts for AIDS virus infections have evolved to resist disease promises to teach us a great deal about the emergence of the AIDS pandemic , and about the mechanisms underlying AIDS progression in humans .
In addition , such insights will hopefully help inform new approaches to treat HIV infection most effectively . "
Feinberg says .
" Also , better understanding how natural hosts for SIV remain healthy may provide clues as to the future evolutionary trajectory of human populations in response to the profound selective pressures now being felt in regions of the world where the tragic consequences of HIV infection are most severe .

Tandis que les exobiologistes s'interrogent sur la possibilité de découvrir une vie extraterrestre fondée sur le silicium et non sur le carbone , les électroniciens envisagent le chemin inverse .
Pour Igor Lukyanchuk , professeur au département de physique de l'université de Picardie ( Amiens ) , la puissance des ordinateurs pourrait être multipliée par 1 000 grâce au remplacement du silicium par le graphite - une forme cristalline du carbone - pour la fabrication des puces .
De quoi améliorer la traduction vocale simultanée ou la compression d'images , par des méthodes plus efficaces mais grandes consommatrices de puissance de calcul .
En 2004 , Igor Lukyanchuk , associé au physicien Yakov Kopelevich ( Sao Paulo , Brésil ) , découvre une propriété remarquable : dans le graphite très pur , certains électrons se comportent comme des photons .
Il en résulte un phénomène proche de la supraconductivité , cette propriété qu'ont certains matériaux à perdre toute résistance au passage du courant électrique à la température de l'azote liquide (- 196o C ) .
Or , dans le graphite , cette aptitude existe à température ambiante .
De quoi le transformer en concurrent du cuivre pour les câbles et autres connexions électriques .
En 2005 , une autre découverte ouvre de nouvelles perspectives .
Les équipes d'André Geim ( université de Manchester ) et de Philip Kim ( université de Columbia ) parviennent à isoler des monocouches de graphite - des feuillets appelés graphène .
Un matériau ne possédant que deux dimensions ( longueur et largeur ) , dont l'épaisseur est celle des atomes de graphite , soit quelques angströms ( 10 - 10 m ) .
La physique descend ainsi en dessous de l'échelle du nanomètre ( 10 - 9 m ) , ouvrant la voie à une toute nouvelle électronique , dans laquelle le carbone pourrait prendre le relais du silicium .
L'agence de recherche militaire américaine ( Darpa ) ne s'y est pas trompée , qui a amorcé un programme de recherche baptisé CERA ( Carbon Electronics for RF Application ) .
Avec pour objectif l'obtention d'un film de graphène de 50 mm par 50 mm .
André Geim , lui , a franchi une autre étape , en fabriquant le premier transistor en graphène .
Le composant de base des puces électroniques de l'ère du graphite ?
Les fabricants de microprocesseurs en silicium , Intel et IBM en tête , sont en tout cas sur le pont .
Et Igor Lukyanchuk se réjouit de cette effervescence , qui donne à sa découverte toutes les chances de participer à une véritable révolution .

This artist 's illustration was originally released by the Venus Express spacecraft team .
Wickramasinghe included the image as a figure in his article with the caption , " Evidence of solar wind excavating the atmosphere of Venus . "
Some scientists have objected to its being labeled as " evidence . "
Venus , with its boiling - hot surface , does n't seem a likelyplace to find ET .
But a new paper argues not only that Venusian clouds could harbormicrobial life , but also that the life there could potentially hitch a rideaboard the solar wind to Earth .
The possibility for microbial life on Venusianclouds has been suggestedbefore , though it 's still not widely thought to be likely .
However , the assertionthat this life could potentially float from Venus to Earth is novel , andcontentious .
The clouds on Venus are thought to be the planet 's best betfor life because the temperatures there are cooler than at the too - hotsurface , and water vapor has been detected in the atmosphere .
" The temperature and pressure there are entirelycongenial to the survival of certain types of microbes , " said researcher ChandraWickramasinghe of the Cardiff Centre for Astrobiology at Cardiff University in Wales .
" Microbes are known to survive in similar environments on Earth . "
In particular , bacteria that have been found in extremeconditions in sulfurous hot springs on Earth would also thrive in the Venusianclouds , he said .
Wickramasinghe , writing with co-author Janaki Wickramasinghein the June 2008 issue of the journal Astrophysics and Space Science , further suggests that these microbes could potentially be transferred fromVenus to Earth by the solar wind , the stream of charged particles that is continuouslyejected from the sun .
This stream is known to sometimes carry chargedparticles , called ions , from Venus ' upper atmosphere off the planet , though noone has ever suggested it could carry heavier dust particles or microbes .
" We point out that Venus and Earth are very close interms of proximity , " Chandra Wickramasinghe told SPACE.com .
" Thereare occasions where Venus and Earth are aligned , which would be the bestpossible time for any exchange of material from Venus to Earth . "
The last such alignment took place in 2004 and the next willhappen in 2012 , he said .
Skeptics
But other scientists are skeptical that the solarwind would be able to carry these particles between the two planets .
First of all , the possibly life - harboring clouds are muchtoo low , said David Grinspoon , an astrobiologist at the University of Arizona who was on the science team for the European Space Agency 's Venus Express satellite mission .
" It ? s a much higher altitude where the solar wind issweeping ions away from the planet , " he said .
" There 's a hugephysical disconnect between the clouds and the material that 's being swept awayby the solar wind . "
But Wickramasinghe contends that convection in theatmosphere could be enough to lift these particles to the heights needed to bepicked up by the solar wind .
Too heavy ?
Another issue is whether the dust particles and microbes , ifthey did manage to be lofted to the upper atmosphere , would be too heavy to becarried away by the solar wind , which has only been observed to lift up lightions .
" Dust particles are orders of magnitude heavier than theseions and there 's not enough energy in the solar wind to be knocking them out ofthe atmosphere , " Grinspoon said .
" I 'm skeptical that you could reallyget them up to that height but even if you could you would still need a way toeject them .
That ?s a whole different ballgame .
It 's like saying because I 'vegot a window open and there 's air leaking out , therefore my bed might somehowfly out the window into my backyard . "
Janet Luhmann , a geophysicist at the University of California , Berkeley , calculated that the heavy microbes would need vastly more energy toescape Venus ' gravity than the ions do , which is probably beyond the capabilityof the solar wind to provide .
" While this idea is interesting , it does n't look too goodwhen the numbers are applied , " she said .
Wickramasinghe maintains that the process is reasonablethough , if the force of the solar wind combines with pressure from the sun'sradiation to pull the particles off Venus .
" I concede that the processes are speculative and needto be discussed more carefully , but the fact remains that if there is microbiallife on Venus , being lifted to high enough altitudes through convective motion , then the transfer is a possibility . "
Grinspoon countered that while speculations are fine , it 'simportant to back it up with reasonable science .
" It 's OK to pursue speculative ideas because we don ? twant to be too cozy and safe and assume that we know everything about life inthe universe , " he said .
" However , we have to be rigorous and carefuland honest and logical and scientifically meticulous when we speculate .
Theyhave not done that .
When somebody does this and calls it astrobiology , it risksdiscrediting the entire field and associating this necessary speculative edgeof astrobiology with complete pseudoscience . "
Evidence or drawing ?
He took special issue with one figure in Wickramasinghe 's paper .
The caption reads , " Evidence of solar wind excavating the atmosphere ofVenus . "
" Evidence ?
There 's no evidence there , it 's just adrawing ! " he said .
" I can't believe , if this was peer reviewed , that somebodydidn ?t point this out . "
Indeed , David Brain , a University of California , Berkeley scientist on the Venus Express team who released the image , said it was " definitely an illustration . "
But Wickramasinghe defended calling the picture evidence .
" The color picture is a representation of data , " he said .
" I would n?t call it an artists ' depiction .
If it was an artist 's depiction , it was based on data from the satellite . "
While Brain said the image itself was n't evidence for solarwind excavation of the Venus atmosphere , he did confirm that the Venus Expressmission found ample proof that this process is going on .
" [ Wickramasinghe 's ] paper was fun to read anddemonstrates thinking outside of the box on some big picture science related tolife in the solar system and on Earth , " he said .
'[ The paper 's thesis ] relieson several assumptions and steps , each of which would need to be individuallyverified before this idea was broadly accepted . "
Nearly 300 people agree to the five months , after being hustled through mass hearings , with one lawyer for 17 people , each having about 30 minutes of consultation per client .
The plea deal is a brutal legal vise , but the immigrants accept it as the quickest way back to their spouses and children , hundreds of whom are cowering in a Catholic church , afraid to leave and not knowing how they will survive .
The workers are scattered to federal lockups around the country .
Many families still do not know where they are .
The plant ’s owners walk freely .
This is enforcement run amok .
As Julia Preston reported in The Times , the once - silent workers of Agriprocessors now tell of a host of abusive practices , of rampant injuries and of exhausted children as young as 13 wielding knives on the killing floor .
A young man said in an affidavit that he started at 16 , in 17 - hour shifts , six days a week .
“ I was very sad , and I felt like I was a slave . ”
Instead of receiving merciful treatment as defendants who also are victims , the workers have been branded as the kind of predator who steals identities to empty bank accounts .
Accounts from Postville suggest that that ’s not remotely what they were .
“ Most of the clients we interviewed did not even know what a Social Security number was or what purpose it served , ” said Erik Camayd - Freixas , a Spanish - language interpreter for many of the workers .
“ This worker simply had the papers filled out for him at the plant , since he could not read or write Spanish , let alone English . ”
The harsh prosecution at Postville is an odd and cruel shift for the Bush administration , which for years had voiced compassion for exploited workers and insisted that immigration had to be fixed comprehensively or not at all .
Now it has abandoned mercy and proportionality .
It has devised new and harsher traps , as in Postville , to prosecute the weak and the poor .
It has increased the fear and desperation of workers who are irresistible to bottom - feeding businesses precisely because they are fearful and desperate .
By treating illegal low - wage workers as a de facto criminal class , the government is trying to inflate the menace they pose to a level that justifies its rabid efforts to capture and punish them .
That is a fraudulent exercise , and a national disgrace .
INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana ( CNN ) --
One night last spring , Conor Mather - Licht was celebrating the end of his freshman year in college .
Out to dinner with friends , he started to read the menu , but could n't .
Conor Mather - Licht , 19 , lies awake during surgery to remove a brain tumor .
He saw the pictures , and the words , but he just could n't comprehend what was in front of him .
The feeling lasted just a moment , but he knew something was wrong .
When he returned home to Indianapolis , Indiana , a few days later , he mentioned the episode to this parents .
They took him to the doctor immediately .
The diagnosis was n't good .
Mather - Licht had a brain tumor , known as a glioma , situated above his left ear .
Not only was it causing severe headaches , which he had attributed to everyday stress , but the tumor was pressing on the area of the brain that controls the ability to read and speak .
It needed to come out .
Because of his age , Mather - Licht 's doctors suspected that his tumor was benign .
But they needed a biopsy to make sure , and the tumor needed to come out .
Because the tumor was located in a very delicate area of the brain , his surgeon recommended a procedure called " awake craniotomy with mapping . "
It 's much like standard brain surgery , with one critical difference :
The patient is awake .
The brain is a map , said Mather - Licht 's neurosurgeon , Dr. Aaron Cohen of Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis .
Different areas help us read , walk , talk , even cry and smile .
So if a tumor is located in a crucial part of the brain , as in this case , doctors perform surgery on patients who are awake in order to see what functions the surgeon may be affecting while eradicating the tumor .
CNN was allowed to be present during the surgery .
Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports on Conor Mather - Licht 's awake brain surgery »
During the procedure , Mather - Licht was heavily sedated but remained conscious so Cohen could talk to him while mapping the brain 's sensors .
Once Mather - Licht 's skull cap -- a large chunk of bone from his head -- was removed , he remained alert even though his brain was fully exposed .
By communicating with the patient as he gently touched the brain with electrical probes , Cohen could tell what sections were sensitive and needed to be avoided .
Mather - Licht remained attentive through the procedure , actually reading a book by Kurt Vonnegut aloud .
If Cohen pressed on a sensitive region , Mather - Licht 's reading was affected , which let the neurosurgeon know it was an area to avoid .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Brain tumor
The mapping alone took a couple of hours .
Based on the information entered into a computer during mapping , the " hot spots " or risky areas , were displayed on a monitor .
Once mapping was complete , Cohen took a paper list of groups of letters that represented basic brain functions , such as expression and movement .
With a pair of scissors , a nurse cut out the letters that corresponded to Mather - Licht 's " hot spots . "
Cohen then placed the lettered pieces of paper directly on Mather - Licht 's brain , distinctly identifying the areas of risk .
Once those were marked , he opened the brain 's outer membrane and , layer by layer , removed the tumor .
Mather - Licht felt no pain -- the brain itself has no pain receptors .
The entire procedure lasted about five hours .
After the skull fragment was put back in place , Mather - Licht was wheeled into his hospital room , still conscious , but exhausted .
It took Mather - Licht about a week and a half to recover .
Most patients stay only a few days in the hospital .
But because his tumor was relatively large , his recovery took longer .
At first he had difficulty speaking , mini-seizures and trouble reading .
Little by little , as his brain healed , he regained all his functions .
And the best news was that his tumor was benign , which meant he would n't need chemotherapy or radiation .
This month , Mather - Licht is preparing to return to college .
This year , he 'll have quite a story to tell about what he did on his summer vacation .
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , the last big independent investment banks on Wall Street , will transform themselves into bank holding companies subject to far greater regulation , the Federal Reserve said Sunday night , a move that fundamentally reshapes an era of high finance that defined the modern Gilded Age .
The firms requested the change themselves , even as Congress and the Bush administration rushed to pass a $ 700 billion rescue of financial firms .
It was a blunt acknowledgment that their model of finance and investing had become too risky and that they needed the cushion of bank deposits that had kept big commercial banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase relatively safe amid the recent turmoil .
It also is a turning point for the high - rolling culture of Wall Street , with its seven - figure bonuses and lavish perks for even midlevel executives .
It effectively returns Wall Street to the way it was structured before Congress passed a law during the Great Depression separating investment banking from commercial banking , known as the Glass - Steagall Act .
By becoming bank holding companies , the firms are agreeing to significantly tighter regulations and much closer supervision by bank examiners from several government agencies rather than only the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Now , the firms will look more like commercial banks , with more disclosure , higher capital reserves and less risk - taking .
But surely in their insatiable curiosity and desire to put knowledge above all things , science would never , say , inadvertently set off a chain of events that lead to some sort of disaster that ended the world .
Right ?
Let 's face it , we really trust science .
In fact , studies suggest that the vast majority of people will murder another human being , if a guy in a lab coat tells them it's OK .
5 Recreating the Big Bang

Scientists are kind of pissed that they were n't around when the Big Bang happened .
Here we had an event that holds all of the secrets to reality , and we missed it because we were lazy enough not to evolve for another 13 billion years .
The solution , science says , is to make it happen again .
They assure us that they can stage a new Big Bang if they smash some protons together really , really fucking hard .
In fact , they can make a million of them per second , which is 999,999 more than God managed .
God , 1 . Science , 999,999 .
What Could Possibly Go Wrong ?
Well , first imagine an apocalyptic nuclear holocaust .
Multiply that by about one hundred and twenty thousand billion , and then multiply that by around the neighborhood of infinity .
That equals around one eighth of the magnitude of the Big Bang .
Nevertheless , scientists are pretty sure they can contain their Big Bang in an erlenmeyer flask , just so long as they remember to cork it .

So , Basically It 's Like ...
Imagine you have a huge tanker truck parked outside a children 's hospital .
You do n't know what 's inside it , but you 're fairly confident that it 's either a cure for cancer , or 20,000 gallons of explosive nitroglycerin .
To find out which , you have to shoot at it with an AK - 47 .
How Long Have We Got ?
Meet the Large Hadron Collider .
This is not only the largest particle accelerator ever built , it 's the largest anything ever built .
Originally set to come online in 2005 , then delayed until September 2008 , the LHC will fire very small objects around its 17 - mile circumference at close to the speed of light , before smashing the shit out of them and watching what comes out .

The problem , of course , is that even the eggheads do n't really know what 's going to happen , which is sort of why they 're doing it in the first place .
That 's also why a lawsuit was filed to put a stop to it .
Scientists on the LHC project insist there is no danger , and predict that the resulting observations could revolutionize science and send us into a golden age of knowledge , in the event that we actually survive .
Risk Level : 3
Experts assure us that based on everything we know about science , the chances of doom are fairly slim .
Experts also say LHC will change everything we know about science .
So there is a certain chance that one of the brand new things they learn about the LHC is that the LHC has the ability turn the entire planet into a fine cloud of particles .
Now that the June 20 , 2008 California lightning fires are nearly contained , talk has turned to salvage logging the burned areas .
Two years ago , an Oregon State University study has called into question the practice of salvage logging after a fire as a means of promoting forest rehabilitation and future fire safety , as well as the US government loses money on these salvage sales .
With Representative Wally Herger already calling for expedited NEPA procedures to allow unrestricted salvage logging in burn areas , we need to take a hard look at this practice .
Four years ago , a devastating fire spread across my property .
We were told by locals , foresters , loggers , and USDA conservationists that we needed to log the burned land .
We were told that the bugs would come and ruin the timber anyways and then kill the trees that had survived .
We were told that our property would be in greater fire risk danger if we did not remove dead timber , and we were encouraged to take out living trees that were predicted not to survive .
The loggers told us we would make about $ 60,000 logging 80 acres , but they did n’t tell us that sawmills automatically lower prices when a fire occurs and it would cost $ 40,000 to replant this same land .
We proceeded with the expedited timber harvest plan , only to pull the plug on the salvage operation after 12 acres .
Our property is now the perfect case study of what happens when a burned area is left alone or salvage logged .
In the areas that were logged , invasive species of brush have grown enthusiastically , and we had to replant with nursery stock .
Natural regeneration was wiped out by the heavy logging equipment , and this part of our land is a mess .
In the areas that were left alone after the fire , the rate of natural regeneration of mixed conifer species was incredible and required no replanting and little removal of invasive weed species .
The living trees in the burn that were predicted to die by the foresters are still living today , and the bugs came and went .
The unlogged , burned areas of Forest Service land near our home turned out to be our best defense against this year ’s firestorms .
When the lightning fire hit the old burn where it had not been salvage logged , it stopped .
Firefighters were able to put in a direct fire line and did not perform any burnout operations along this fire boundary .
The dire predictions of increased fire risk if logging did not occur were false .
In fact , we were safer .
The frenzy to salvage log after this year ’s fires is uncalled for and will create more dangerous fires in the future , as well as require manual replanting of the forests .
Just observing the fire behavior all over Northern California confirms this : the fires burned hotter and were more destructive in areas that had been previously salvage logged and / or were plantations .
We only need to look at the massive 2002 Biscuit Fire in Oregon to learn that salvage logging is not the solution .
According to the Environment News Service :
As of December 2006 , the Forest Service had completed 12 salvage sales , the GAO said , resulting in harvests of 67 million board feet .
The sales generated $ 8.8 million in receipts for the federal government , but cost $ 10.7 million , the report found .
Science Daily reports :
… fire severity was 16 to 61 percent higher in logged and planted areas , compared to those that had burned severely and were left alone in a fire 15 years earlier .
The study was done in areas that had burned twice — once in the 1987 Silver Fire , and again in the massive 2002 Biscuit Fire , one of the largest forest fires in modern U.S. history …
However , in the aftermath of a wildfire , removal of large dead trees followed by planting conifer seedlings does not appear to lessen the risk of severe fires in the first 10 - 20 years , Thompson said .
This may be because the logging process leaves more available fuel on the forest floor ; the dense , homogenous replantation of young trees provides a good setting for fire ; or some combination of these factors over time …
By contrast , natural regeneration of forests , he said , appears to result in at least slightly , and sometimes significantly less risk of severe future fires .
Salvage logging is not the solution to forest fire rehabilitation , and it only removes merchantable timber leaving small diameter fuels behind .
It makes forests more susceptible to future burns , and it negatively impacts natural regeneration .
It does n’t make economic or ecological sense .
As Dan Donato , a graduate student in the Department of Forest Science at OSU , explained , “ Surprisingly , it appears that after even the most severe fires , the forest is naturally very resilient , more than it ’s often given credit for . ”
Let Mother Nature heal the forests on her own .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Anthrax suspect Bruce Ivins took several hours of administrative leave on the day it is believed two anthrax - laced letters were mailed , a government source said .
The source said records show Ivins reported to work at his Fort Detrick lab on the morning of September 17 , 2001 , but stayed only a short time before taking leave hours .
Though they have no direct proof , investigators believe Ivins used the time to drive to Princeton , New Jersey , where the letters were mailed .
Princeton is about 160 miles from Frederick , Maryland , the home of Fort Detrick .
Ivins returned to the lab for a late afternoon appointment , according to the source , who asked not to be named .
An attorney for Ivins , Tom Degonia , emphasized there is no direct evidence showing Ivins mailed the letters or drove to New Jersey that day .
The U.S. government Wednesday declared
Ivins the lone culprit in the anthrax attacks , saying he had a history of mental illness and that he created and mailed the spores used to kill five people .
Authorities say Ivins , a 62 - year - old Army biodefense researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Frederick , Maryland , committed suicide last week as they were preparing to charge him with carrying out the anthrax attacks .
In a statement Wednesday , Ivins ' attorneys said the scientist was innocent and the stack of documents the government released to support its conclusion fell short of " concrete evidence . "
All About Anthrax • Bruce Ivins
While I am an avid reader of books , magazines and periodicals , I also enjoy watching movies as a vehicle for learning .
Not every movie made for Hollywood was created for teenagers ; there are plenty of movies that have lessons for working adults .
Once you start to look at a movie as a learning tool , you might not ever see it as pure entertainment again !
“ Wall Street ” is one of my all time favorites .
It tells the tale of a young man who loses his moral compass in his quest to be more than his education , background and skills allow .
Charlie
Sheen stars as the young hot shot who demonstrates his tenacity and street smarts to ruthless tycoon Michael Douglas .
Douglas buys and sells companies without remorse focusing only on the profits because that is the only game he knows or wants to play .
“ Greed is good ” symbolizes not just the time that the movie was filmed and still applies today , unfortunately , to many disgraced so - called leaders of business .
“ Glengarry Glen Ross ” is the ultimate sales training movie .
Once you see this movie you will forever remember what the contest prizes are for the salesmen in an under performing real estate office .
When Alec Baldwin departs the office at the beginning of the movie , you will always know what “ ABC ” stands for in the sales process .
This is a movie rich with talented performances by Jack Lemmon , Al Pacino , Ed Harris and Alan Arkin .
Back in the dark ages when movies were filmed in black and white , “ Twelve O’ Clock High ” conveyed the story of a young general with a mission to turn around a struggling bomber group in the dark days of WWII .
While the movie takes place in wartime , it is n’t a war movie , it is the saga of how an organization that has gotten off track can get refocused but can lose its way if improperly led .
Gregory Peck stars as the general assigned to turn things around , only to get caught up in his own success .
He ultimately fails , and this is not a typical Hollywood ending .
I ’ve long admired George C. Scott ’s performance in “ Patton ” .
You can watch this movie from the perspective of history , or you can see the performance of someone who believes and practices the basics of leadership .
As an example , his staff wakes the general to advise that the enemy is going to attack ; he had fallen asleep doing competitive research , reading a book authored by his opponent .
While Patton comes across as human and makes mistakes like everyone else , his leadership moved more men across more miles with fewer casualties than any other general in that war .
“ Titanic ” is a case study in poor management and non existent organizational leadership .
Instead of watching the romantic side of the main characters develop , keep an eye on the ship ’s captain and his conversations ( almost filmed in passing ) with reporters , the ship ’s builder and the owner .
You can watch the movie and learn how not to run an operation in just a couple of hours .
Once the ship runs into the iceberg the lack of front line management and their failure to deal with a crisis can serve as a reminder to anyone in business to prepare for the unexpected .
Because it just might happen !
There are many other movies to review , but allow me to suggest that there are lessons that can be translated to business by watching : “ Remember the Titans ” ( leadership under adverse conditions ) , “ Cast Away ” ( overcoming obstacles to achieve a goal ) , “ Apollo 13 ” ( failure is not an option ) , “ Hoosiers ” ( teambuilding ) , “ 12 Angry Men ” ( consensus and decision making ) and “ Jerry Maguire ” ( creating a mission statement and seeing it come to fruition ) .

A reader recently e-mailed me to ask which personal finance guru I ’d recommend .
I thought about it for a little while and had to tell her that there was n’t one guru I prized above the others .
Instead , I sketched out which personal finance gurus I liked best for particular areas .
( I added some blogs as well , but I wo n’t here , perhaps later . )
I ’m going to go into a little more detail here , though there ’s still much more that could be said .
Dave Ramsey for Major Debt
If you have major debt and want help and inspiration for getting out of it , the PF guru I ’d probably recommend ( depending on your temperament ) is Dave Ramsey .
I found a number of concepts in his Total Money Makeover very helpful .
He does n’t claim to be revolutionary , so they ’re possibly things you ’ve heard online .
What Ramsey provides is inspiration , even fantacism .
His books can make you feel completely devoted to getting out of debt as fast as you can .
If you ’ve been having trouble motivating yourself and want to get into it , they ’re quite helpful .
I ’d take it with a few grains of salt , but his advice is generally sound if that ’s the direction you want your debt - repayment to take .
I would n’t recommend this book if your only debt is your mortgage or perhaps your mortgage and your cars as long as you can afford the monthly payments .
Ramsey is also an unapologetic Evangelical Christian , and even though I do n’t entirely subscribe to his take on it I still find his work useable .
Some people find it more difficult , especially knowing that he requires all counsellors to be evangelical Christians , even if they ’re not supposed to evangelize .
Despite these , if you ’re mired in credit card debt or student loans then he ’s probably the person for you .
If you ’re worried about being evangelized , stick with the books , you can take or leave the stuff there .
Jean Chatzky for Money Management
I ’d recommend Jean Chatzky to people who are n’t really in debt but want to be in control and happy about their finances and particularly to women who have decided to take control of their money .
I became a fan after reading her book You Do n’t Have to Be Rich .
The book focuses on two themes : first , finding balance in your life so that you can be happy even if you ’re not rich ; second , managing your money so that even if you do n’t have a huge income , you can build wealth .
She ’s practical , of course , and understand that you do need a certain amount of money to live comfortably and a certain salary to be able to invest .
The book is a good cross between self - improvement and money management advice .
She also has an excellent book directed specifically at women , called Make Money , Not Excuses .
It works as a good outline for anyone learning to manage their money , but it ’s specifically directed at women and the reasons that women do n’t pay more attention to their money .
I think you can skip her book Pay It Down !
From Debt to Wealth on $ 10 a Day .
There ’s nothing wrong with it , per-se , but it ’s essentially a latte factor book .
The overall premise is that if you find an extra $ 10 / day ( $ 300 / month ) whether by spending less or earning more , and use it to pay down any debt or build wealth ( depending where you are in the cycle ) .
Not bad , but her other books are much better .
Suze Orman for Personal Finance Education
I ’m not as fond of Suze Orman as I am of Jean Chatzky .
I ’m not entirely sure why , something about her does n’t appeal to me as much .
I do admire her motto : “ People first , then money , then things . ”
From what I ’ve read , she seems relationship - oriented .
She emphasizes that money is n’t everything .
And on her show she addresses a lot of relationship / money questions .
What I recommend most : The Road to Wealth ( revised edition ) .
Wow .
It ’s a comprehensive book of information , an “ everything you wanted to know ” about personal finance .
It ’s insanely thorough if not very inspiring .
For example , in the “ managing debt ” section , for instance , she answers questions such as “ How do I know if I ’m in trouble with debt ? ”
“ Why do so many people get into ‘ bad ’ debt ? ” or “ what exactly is a debit card ? ” .
Short answers of several paragraphs .
Good for people who want to learn more about personal finance or buy a reference guide .
She ’s not as strong on getting out of all debt as Dave Ramsey .
She accepts a mortgage , for example , as normal .
She ’s certainly concerned about paying off debt and spending less than you earn , she ’s just not as passionate as Ramsey .
Suze has also written a book on women and money which is quite similar to Jean’s .
Again , I prefer Jean .
But if you do n’t like the former , try this one .
She has been criticized for recommending a riskier investing strategy than she herself uses .
However , I think it ’s understandable because when you have as high a net - worth as she does , you do n’t need to take on as much risk .
Robert Kiyosaki for ….?
I have a hard time recommending Kiyosaki .
Not all of his stuff is bad , but you have a limited amount of time .
Why spend it sorting out the good points when you can find them or other good points from other writers ?
Things which bother me about Kiyosaki :
He very strongly emphasizes real estate and entrepreneurship ( and seems to criticize other options ) .
I think that both of those are great ways to make money , but I also think that they ’re better for some “ types ” than others .
I do n’t want to manage real estate .
I find the thought stressful .
And I do n’t think I ’d be happy running my own business in the long run .
Yes , I run a blog and a consulting business , but that ’s enough for me .
Besides , I absolutely love working at libraries .
Why give up my passion ?
He has bashed mutual funds and the like as “ risky ” ( I believe that was the word he used , if not , it was the implication ) .
Of course there is risk involved , but there ’s plenty of risk in real estate and entrepreneurship as well .
I do n’t think that sensible investing strategies are riskier .
And there appears to be question as to whether Kiyosaki actually made any money with these techniques or just by being a guru .
He ’s also admitted that “ Rich Dad ” is a metaphor .
So , if he did n’t make money this way and “ Rich Dad ” does n’t exist , then there ’s also no proof the system works .
At least not from his end .
You can still find inspiration and good stuff in his books .
I just do n’t recommend them because you can find that inspiration in plenty of other books without the bothersome elements .
I think that Lazy Man did a good job of extracting three good points from Kiyosaki ’s most famous book .
Other Gurus
Those are the 4 main PF gurus whose books I ’ve read .
I ’ve glanced at other books , but other than John Bogle ’s Little Book of Common Sense Investing for people learning about index funds , I ca n’t recommend any other books or gurus from personal experience ( I ’ve read some more , but did n’t find them terribly moving ) .
Perhaps it ’s rare that as a PF blogger I have n’t read more , but I read a lot of book reviews , especially on The Simple Dollar and a lot of blogs , so I get the main point of many books and just do n’t have the time .
Which gurus do you prefer ?
1 The Wangcaster : a guitar with balls
The manliest guitar of all time .

It ’s the perfect guitar to rock out on the Fourth of July .
Aside from resembling how the United States of America looks like on a map , the strange but cool aspect of this guitar is the finely carved and detailed eagle head .
High schools and colleges are steering students away from cars to save money on gas , save the environment and promote physical fitness .
This fall , Ripon College in Ripon , Wis. , is offering freshmen free mountain bikes , helmets and locks in exchange for a promise not to bring a car to campus .
The $ 300 - per- student cost is funded by private donations .
The college 's president , David Joyce , says the project was meant to avoid building a parking garage , but its side effects are beneficial : less pollution , more exercise and savings on gas .
The timing was right , Joyce says : " We were either extremely brilliant or extremely lucky . "
About 60 % of the school 's 300 incoming students have signed up .
" Today 's teenagers deserve a lot of credit .
They 're socially aware , they 're environmentally conscious , " says Mike Martin , executive director of the National Association of Pupil Transportation .
" When the price of gasoline takes effect , they 're smart . "
On other campuses :
• At Auburn University in Auburn , Ala. , a bike maintenance shop in the new student union and a bike - sharing program kicks off this fall .
High gas prices have helped the school meet its goal of increasing bike ridership to 12 % of students and staff two years ahead of schedule .
• Other bike - loan programs will start or expand this year at colleges in Georgia , Illinois , Maine and Pennsylvania .
• More bike racks , new speed limit signs and a parent carpooling system are among the changes being considered at Hanover Park High School in East Hanover , N.J. , to reduce car traffic and to improve students ' safety .
• Howards Grove High School in Howards Grove , Wis. , is using a federal grant to create a walking and biking path to the campus , currently accessible only by car or bus .
The $ 100,000 project is scheduled to be done by fall 2009 .
• Graduate students at State University of New York - Albany proposed a 5 K ( 3.1 - mile ) biking and walking path around campus as a class project .
The first phase , one - third of a mile , was completed in June .
• Faculty and students at three high schools in Marin County , Calif. , are working with their local Safe Routes to Schools program to improve intersections , designate walk - or - bike - to - school days and use bikes as transportation for field trips .
The National Center for Safe Routes to School gets state and federal funding for kindergarten through eighth grade .
A bill sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer , D - Ore. , would fund high school programs .
High schools ' wider attendance boundaries , students ' reduced physical activity and their desire to be self - reliant make funding necessary , he says .
" We have over 100 million bikes that are sitting around in garages and basements and back porches , " Blumenauer says .
" When people start to use them , it can be transformational . "

Hilary Rosen says she empathizes with Sarah Palin 's personal choices but opposes her political views .
( CNN ) -- Warning !
This pundit is n't feeling the same way as many of my colleagues about Sarah Palin .
She is being attacked for her lack of experience for the job and for whether she should be putting her family first instead of her career .
This just is n't that unusual in my book .
And the more it goes on , the more uncomfortable I feel with that message .
Let 's reflect .
In her acceptance speech , we saw a woman who was compelling , charming and aggressively partisan .
She succeeded in demonstrating that she is a regular mom who came to government to make a difference .
And she had that crowd in the convention hall eating out of her hands .
Celebrity ?
It will be hard for the Republicans to attack Sen. Barack Obama for his celebrity now that they have one of their own .
A superstar of the radical right was made Wednesday night .
And she may also have made some headway with those who buy her folksiness without knowing the extreme nature of her actual policy views .
Read the transcript of Palin 's speech
So where does this leave us as Democrats in making the case against Sarah Palin and her running mate for president ?
What is the choice now for the American people ?
There is a really strong case to be made against the McCain / Palin ticket and Democrats need to make it the right way , right away .
I am a woman who someone took a chance on several years ago when they gave me a job that had only previously been done by old white guys .
Experience ?
How do you get any if no one takes a chance on you ?
And the decision to take a chance can be instinctive , as John McCain said .
And what about the argument that she is a negligent mother who will be distracted from her important role ?
I am a mother who constantly feels the pressure from others about whether I am fit to be a parent , whether I put my kids first often enough and whether my children get enough of my attention .
Who has the right to judge my family ?
My grandmother always said , " You ca n't tell time on someone else 's clock . "
Judgments about people 's personal lives are better left unsaid and unrealized .
So why then do I think that Sarah Palin would be a terrible vice president ?
Because I also think that John McCain would be a terrible president .
I do n't care about how Sarah Palin or John McCain take care of their families .
I care about how their policy choices affect my family and millions of other Americans .
McCain and Palin get their health insurance paid for by the government ( hers in Alaska and his in Washington ) .
Yet they oppose giving the nearly 46 million uninsured Americans the same access to affordable health care .
John McCain 's kids do n't have to worry about paying for college .
Yet he has opposed every single education support program to help others .
McCain and Palin say they will stand up to oil companies .
Yet the only energy policy they support gives millions of dollars in tax breaks to oil companies to do more drilling and he has opposed every piece of federal legislation to explore alternative fuel sources .
McCain and Palin say they will revamp how Washington does business .
Yet his campaign is filled with lobbyists and she has cooperated with Sen .
Ted Stevens in funneling federal money for useless projects in Alaska for years .
And McCain and Palin have no solutions for Americans worrying about their jobs in a fragile economy .
iReport.com : Is Palin the right choice for you ?
McCain and Palin want us to leave their families alone .
Yet they want to make rules for our families by eliminating our right to make our own choices over abortion , eliminate our access to family planning education or domestic partner benefits , and our freedom from discrimination .
They want to control what our kids learn in school about sex and about science .
In short , through the policies they promote and the judges they support , they want the government to have more control over our private lives than at any time in history .
McCain and Palin now say their campaign is about change , too .
Yet the only real change they have proposed is a change from a suit to a skirt in the vice president 's office and one man fighting a misplaced war for another in the Oval Office .
That seems to me to be the right reason to oppose them in November .
It 's not the process or the people , it 's what they represent .
This unconventional choice of a vice presidential nominee by John McCain wo n't result in a win in November , because McCain and Palin are the wrong choice for the country .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

Nutrition can be so confusing .
Several decades ago , fats were bad .
Then carbs became bad .
Now gluten is the source of all evil .
Red meat has gotten a bad rep too .
Meanwhile bodybuilders tell you to eat every 3 hours while intermittent fasting has gotten popular …
What are you supposed to eat ?
It all seems so complicated and contradicting .
But this is a fairly new problem .
Through human history , people did n’t spend a lot of time thinking about what to eat .
They knew .
Because they followed eating habits formed through childhood .
Eating habits they received from their family and that was part of the food culture .
This guide is about that .
I ’m going to share simple nutrition habits that I follow to be strong in the gym , and maintain a muscular and lean physique – without spending hours in the kitchen , or stressing over what I eat .
Eat Mostly Unprocessed Foods
Unprocessed foods have been unaltered – you can buy them in their natural state .
An example of an unprocessed food is an apple that was just picked up from the tree .
The only processing is to wash the apple , then you can eat it .
Compare that Apple with Apple Jam bought from a supermarket .
It ’s rare for that apple jam to contain only apples .
Usually the list of ingredients on the back is long – in most cases all kind of things were added on top the apples , including preservatives and sugars .
The main benefit of eating unprocessed foods it that you have better control over how many calories goes into your body .
Most processed foods have hidden calories in the form of hidden sugars and fats .
This may be good for people wanting to gain weight , but not if you want to maintain or lose weight .
Unprocessed foods : fresh meat , fish , poultry , eggs , veggies , legumes , fruits , rice , oats , quinoa , …
Processed foods : fruit bars , cereals , frozen pizza , cookies , sausages , frozen meals , …
The first nutrition rule is to focus on eating unprocessed foods as much as possible .
It ’s okay to eat cookies once in a while .
I do it .
But most meals you eat should consist of unprocessed foods so you have better control over how many calories get into your system .
Eat Protein with Each Meal
Protein is crucial for getting results when lifting weights .
Without enough protein you do n’t get proper recovery , and will not get proper progress .
Protein also helps with fat loss – it keeps you full longer , and has a higher thermic effect ( more of your meal is burned for digestion if it ’s higher protein ) .
Luckily you do n’t need that much protein .
You only need 0.82g of protein per lb of body - weight ( 1.8g /kg ) for muscle recovery and to build extra muscle mass .
That means about 145g of protein if you ’re 80kg / 176lb .
The easiest way to get your daily protein intake is to eat a whole protein source with each meal
Red Meat .
Beef , pork , lamb , deer , buffalo , etc .
Poultry .
Chicken , turkey , duck , etc .
Fish .
Tuna , salmon , sardines , mackerel , etc .
Dairy .
Milk , cheese , cottage cheese , quark , yogurt , whey , etc
Eggs
Eat Veggies with Each Meal
Veggies are low calorie .
Salad actually has “ negative calories ” – it takes your body more energy to digest and absorb the food , than there are calories inside .
This makes veggies excellent for maintaining or losing weight ( not for gaining weight though ) .
Because you can eat your stomach full of veggies , so you do n’t feel hungry , but while getting zero to no calories in .
A good goal is to have at least half your plate filled with veggies .
This is the other benefits to eat veggies with each meal : it will push other things out of your plate .
Most people eat way too many carbs because they ’re easier to cook and cheaper .
But carbs are higher in calories .
By aiming to eat at least half a plate of veggies each time , you are pushing other food sources out of your plate , and thus limiting how many calories you get .
This makes it easier to maintain or lose weight .
Vegetables also have vitamins and minerals to help with recovery from lifting .
And they have fiber to help with digestion .
Some of the best vegetables for lifters are :
Broccoli
Spinach
Salad
Kale
Cabbage
etc
If you hate veggies , learn to use spices and condiments .
Stop steaming and boiling , it tastes disgusting that way .
Grill the vegetables and add a tbsp of olive oil , with pepper and salt .
Limit Your Carb Intake
100g of pasta or rice or bread has almost 400 kcal .
That ’s before you add any topping .
Those calories are fine if you want to gain weight , but not for maintaining or losing weight .
To keep your weight under control , you need to control how many calories you eat .
The easiest way to do that is by controlling your carb intake .
You should not stop eating carbs .
Low carb diets are popular , but few people can stick to them long - term .
Because carbs are everywhere and most people like their taste .
I like bread , I like pizza , I like oatmeal .
I do n’t want a life without pizza .
And I ’m not going to eat fake cabbage crust pizza .
Keep eating carbs but limit their intake .
One simple rule is to eat carbs only once per day , like after your workout .
You do n’t need to eat bread or rice or pasta three times a days unless you ’re looking to gain weight .
Once a day is enough for most people looking to gain or maintain weight .
If you followed the first rule , you ’re only getting carbs from unprocessed food sources .
These would be the best :
Rice
Pasta
Bread
Potatoes
Quinoa
Oatmeal
Eat Good Fats
Fat does n’t make you fat .
Excess calories do .
So you can eat real butter , whole eggs and full - fat yogurt .
Because you ’re going to lift heavy weights three times a week , and eat unprocessed foods most of the time .
So a little saturated and cholesterol is not going to cause cardiovascular disease .
You do not have to eat fat - free yogurt or split the yolk from the eggs .
Low fat food is tasteless .
Just go full - fat .
It will keep you full longer .
Eat also omega - 3 fatty food sources like fatty fish ( salmon , tuna , mackerel , sardines , etc ) .
Drink Water
You sweat when you lift weights , especially once the weights get heavy .
You need to drink water to get all the fluids back that you lost through sweating .
And you need water for proper muscle recovery .
Dehydration from lack of drinking will cause headaches .
The same kind of headaches that you get after a night drinking ( alcohol dehydrates ) .
Headaches make it harder to motivate yourself to train , to get your reps , and to progress .
You need to drink .
How much water you need depends on how much you sweat , which depends on the season and where you live .
If I train in Bangkok , Thailand during the summer , I ’m going to sweat more and easily drink 3 - 4 bottles of water .
But I ’m probably only drinking a 3 liters a day when it ’s winter in Belgium .
You do n’t need all those sugary drinks .
This is not long - endurance training .
This is lifting weights .
The workouts are short , and you ’re spending most of the time resting between sets .
Just take a bottle of water to the gym .
Sip on it during your workout .
I usually drink about 1.5l during my workout ( but I live mostly in Asia now where it ’s hot most of the time ) .
Then start your day by drinking two big glasses of water .
If you drink somewhat during the rest of your day , you should get about 3 liters a day which should be enough .
Do n’t Chase Perfection
You do n’t need to be perfect with your diet .
80 % of your results will come from following the above rules .
Trying to chase 100 % perfection will set you on failure .
Because no - one can stick to that .
You will deviate .
Someone will present you cake .
You wo n’t be able to eat right in certain situations .
The problem happens when you think that breaking the rules equals not getting results .
A lot of people end up binging or giving up because of that .
That ’s stupid and unnecessary .
I eat burgers , pizza ’s and cakes .
Because I like it .
I do n’t feel terrible when I do .
I just eat them infrequently , and go back to following the above nutrition rules right after that .
Have a treat once in a while .
Just do n’t do stupid stuff like all - you - can eat buffets .
One cake , then done .
One pizza , then done .
Frequently Asked Questions
What Should I Eat ?
80 % of your results will come from eating the right amount of calories , and getting enough protein .
The rest is details .
However you do want to focus on quality foods so you get vitamins , minerals , fiber , etc .
So you should eat mostly whole , unprocessed foods .
Examples :
Judged by the astonishing increase in journal papers written by scientists in China , there can be little doubt that China is finding its place as one of the world 's scientific power houses .
Michael Banks , Physics World 's News Editor , quantifies this surge in scientific output from China and asks whether quality matches quantity in August 's Physics World .
Nanoscience , quantum computing and high - temperature superconductivity are three of the cutting - edge areas of physics that have seen particularly large increases .
Published journal articles in nanoscience , for example , with at least one co-author based in China , have seen a 10 - fold increase since the beginning of the millennium , rising to more than 10,500 in 2007 .
China has already overtaken the UK and Germany in the number of physics papers published and is beginning to nip at the heels of the United States .
If China 's output continues to increase at its current pace , the country will be publishing more articles in physics - and indeed all of science - than the US by 2012 .
Quantity alone however is not enough .
The number of times a journal paper is cited by other academics in their own journal papers is often used as a guide to journal papers ' quality .
Unfortunately for China , they are currently a long way from the national citation top spot , ranked in 65th for physics , just ahead of Kuwait , with an average of 4.12 citations for each of the papers published .
As China has only just started to publish large volumes of work , it is not a fair reflection .
Werner Marx , an information scientist from the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart , Germany , who carried out a bibliometric study for the Physics World article , said , " The figure is still quite impressive , and I estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years . "
All indications suggest that China 's propensity for world - leading research is growing .
In March this year scientists in Japan first reported a new class of iron - based superconducting material that can conduct electricity without resistance when cooled to below 26 Kelvin ( K ) .
Researchers in China quickly picked up the baton and , within a month of the initial Japanese discovery , had boosted the transition temperature at which the material loses all its electrical resistance to 52 K .
Werner Marx said , " China has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape .
Usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in China , so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future . "

GOP spirits rise as price of gas increases RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Republicans in Congress have had little to smile about this year , but some members ' moods are improving as they watch gas prices tick toward $ 5 per gallon .
Bracing for another wave of defeats in November , GOP lawmakers have been squabbling with their leaders and each other as they struggle to stick to a legislative agenda , but some are seeing their fortunes rise along with prices at the pump , reports Roll Call .
After three special election losses earlier this year , Republicans were angry , irritable and glum .
And it certainly didnt help when the Conferences  Change You Deserve agenda slogan was found to be the same as an anti-depressants .
But Members interviewed by Roll Call say the dark mood has lifted a bit .
Although they still see a tough electoral environment this year , the gas prices debate has rescued them from their funk .
 Things were dismal last year and earlier this year , but things are looking up now ,  one Member said .
The Member said there was a flurry of chatter about changing leadership after the three special election losses , but that has subsided with the focus on energy .
 Now the team seems to feel like it has momentum . 
The GOP lawmakers are united against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who is standing firm against Republican pleas to open vast new sections of US coastlines and the arctic for oil and natural gas companies to drill .
 Skyrocketing energy prices have united Republicans in Congress with a level of enthusiasm that mirrors the anger that the American people feel about the price at the pump ,  Antonia Ferrier , a spokeswoman for Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , tells the subscription - only Capitol Hill paper .
Pelosi , meanwhile , is sticking to her guns , accusing the opposing party of perpetrating a " hoax " to keep Americans from realizing the economy has gone south after nearly eight years of a Republican president , who had a GOP Congress for nearly his entire time in office .
 The fact is , the President of the United States , its on his watch that this economy is going in this direction .
We have bad fiscal policy where the president has taken us deeply into debt in terms of our budget .
We have had a focus on giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans in the country .
But the very idea that the Republicans would say , but for offshore drilling , our economy would be great , it s really a hoax , " Pelosi said Monday on NBC's Today Show .
" It s really a hoax on the American people .
First of all , it will not bring down the price of the pump for 10 years and only two cents at that .
Second of all , the jobs numbers , the fragility of our financial institutions , the down turn in the capital markets , all these things , the energy prices , all these things contributing to that and these are the economic policies of the Bush administration which have failed and we have to take the country in a new direction . "
In a separate interview with Roll Call Pelosi could hardly contain her confidence .
 You probably dont want to ask me if I m emboldened ,  Pelosi said in an interview .
 Im probably as bold a person as you will find . 
On this page you will find live gold prices .
The live gold price is continuously updating , as gold prices are in a constant state of flux .
The live gold price is also referred to as the spot gold price .
Live gold prices represent the price of gold right now as opposed to some date in the future .
The price of gold can be affected by many different inputs , and live gold prices can keep you up to date on market movement .
How are Live Gold Prices Determined ?
Live gold prices indicate the current spot price for gold .
The spot price is always on the move , and live gold quoted depict this movement and keep investors up to date on changes in price .
The spot price of gold is determined using a gold futures contract .
Exchange - traded futures contracts , such as those that trade on the COMEX Exchange , are used to provide spot gold prices .
The spot , or live gold price , may be represented using a front month , or near - term contract month .
Conversely , they may also be derived from a deferred month contract .
The month used for depicting the live gold price is typically the nearest month with the most substantial trading volume .
The exchange data is sent out to gold markets all over the globe to provide a live gold price .
What Causes Price Fluctuations in Live Gold Prices ?
Gold is recognized all over the world for its investment value as well as for its use in jewelry making .
As a global market , gold prices can be affected by a host of factors .
Some of the major potential drivers of live gold prices include :
Interest rates
Monetary policy
Geopolitics
Risk aversion / appetite
Currency markets
Inflation or deflation
Investment demand
Jewelry demand
Equity markets
Gold is typically denominated in U.S. Dollars , and the value of the dollar can have a significant impact on the live gold price .
As the dollar strengthens , it can potentially make gold relatively more expensive for foreign investors , driving the price down in the process .
On the other hand , if the dollar is weakening , it can potentially make gold relatively less expensive for foreign investors , driving gold prices higher in the process .
Changes in the U.S. Dollar Index are a major catalyst for changes in live gold prices on a daily basis .
Gold can also be affected by rising or falling gold jewelry demand .
India , for example , is home to a major gold jewelry market .
When demand for such jewelry is strong , gold prices may possibly rise .
If jewelry demand is soft , however , it may potentially be reflected in weaker gold prices .
Interest rates are another primary driver of gold prices .
Higher interest rates can make holding gold relatively more expensive , as there is an opportunity cost to hold gold given the fact that it does not pay dividends or interest .
Lower interest rates , however , may potentially have a positive effect on gold .
This is due to the fact that lower rates lessen the potential opportunity cost of holding gold , and therefore may possibly make it more attractive to investors .
Are Live Gold Prices the Same all Over the World ?
Theoretically , yes .
An ounce of gold is the same ounce of gold regardless of whether it is traded in the U.S. , Canada , Japan or Europe .
Most major gold markets use live gold prices denominated in U.S. Dollars per ounce , gram or kilo .
That being said , however , fluctuations in currency values can make gold relatively more or less expensive for investors using currencies other than dollars .
Some of the major trading hubs for gold include Chicago , New York , London and Zurich .
China , India and the United States are some of the biggest marketplaces for gold .
Gold trading is essentially an around the clock activity at this point , as there is basically always an open market .
This makes access to live gold prices even more important .
Live gold prices may enable investors to closely monitor price activity , and may provide information necessary to make buying or selling decisions .
Live gold prices are always updating , and can provide nearly instantaneous price information for the spot gold market .
Live gold prices can also be depicted on charts .
This provides investors a tool for identifying price trends in the gold market or for looking for specific areas of support and resistance to buy or sell at .

5000 - Statements of Policy
GOLD
Statement of Policy
On December 31 , 1974 , Public Law 93-373 , which removes the restrictions on a person " purchasing , holding , selling , or otherwise dealing with gold , " becomes effective .
The word " person " in the Act has been construed to include banks .
Thus , to the extent authorized by State law , State nonmember banks will be permitted to deal in gold .
Trading in any commodity , including gold , is a highly speculative activity .
The past experience of individuals and companies in the commodities markets indicates that , at minimum , commodities trading is a very risky activity for the novice .
In the case of gold , moreover , the more than forty year old prohibition against U.S. citizens holding and trading in gold has meant that few persons have even a nominal degree of expertise in such activity .
The Corporation therefore believes that insured State nonmember banks should consider confining their trading in gold to purchases and sales on a consignment or agency basis .
Irrespective of the manner in which an insured nonmember bank intends to deal in gold , the Corporation should be notified of such intention .
Insured nonmember banks which are considering dealing in gold for their own accounts should carefully evaluate the experience and ability of their present staffs in this regard before proceeding .
Further , such banks should bear in mind that gold ownership exposes them to possible loss due to adverse fluctuations in market value .
In order to minimize such exposure , banks may find it necessary to conduct limited trading in gold futures for hedging purposes .
Banks considering holding inventories of their own gold are reminded that gold bears no yield or interest and that any such inventory should be reflected as " other assets " and should be periodically adjusted to current market value .
Even the sale of gold by a bank to its customers on a consignment basis , while not subjecting the bank to possible losses due to fluctuations in the price of gold , entails certain other risks of which insured State nonmember banks should be aware .
These problems can also arise with respect to sales of a bank 's own gold .
First , banks may bear the risk of any loss with respect to gold which they hold , even when it is held on consignment .
Banks considering holding gold should therefore evaluate the adequacy of their present security arrangements .
Second , gold purchase or consignment agreements entered into by a bank may not provide it with the right to resell to the dealer any gold which the bank 's customers ask the bank to repurchase .
Thus a bank might be forced to refrain from repurchasing gold which it had previously sold to its customers .
Third , banks should attempt to minimize the possibility of receiving , and ultimately selling , bogus gold by entering into agreements only with responsible , reputable dealers .
In this connection , insured nonmember banks should be especially wary of proposals which purport to offer gold to them at or below the current market price .
They should pay particular attention to the degree of fineness ( purity ) of the gold so offered .
The inadvertent sale of gold which does not conform to a bank 's representations may well expose the bank to unfavorable publicity or legal action .
Fourth , banks engaging to repurchase gold from their customers should consider retaining possession of the gold pursuant to a sale / safekeeping agreement .
Unless the gold has constantly remained in the possession or control of the bank , it may be necessary for the bank to acquire or utilize facilities for weighing and assaying gold it plans to repurchase .
Many insured nonmember banks , including banks which do not choose to offer gold for sale to their customers , may find themselves engaged in safekeeping arrangements for gold owned by their customers .
Here too , banks contemplating providing such services should evaluate the adequacy of their security arrangements .
Where the size or amount of the gold received cannot feasibly be held in normal safe deposit facilities , banks should take care to segregate such gold in their vaults and to issue receipts to their customers therefor .
Such receipts , whether issued in connection with a sale / safekeeping transaction or otherwise , should be issued in non-negotiable form and should refer to a specifically identifiable amount of gold .
Each receipt and any advertisement of gold safekeeping services should also state clearly and conspicuously that the gold held pursuant to the safekeeping arrangement is not a deposit insured by FDIC .
It is the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury that Public Law 93-373 did not repeal or alter the so - called Gold Clause Resolution of 1933 ( 31 U.S.C. 463 ) .
The Resolution prohibits any contractual provision which purports to give the obligee the option of requiring payment of the obligation in money or a specified amount of gold .
Deposit contracts which purport to give the bank 's customer such an option are therefore rendered legally unenforceable by the terms of the Gold Clause Resolution .
Contracts specifically payable only in gold may be similarly unenforceable where the parties to the contract view the gold as a medium of discharging a debt , such as a deposit liability , rather than as a commodity to be traded .
Needless to say , sound banking practice dictates that insured nonmember banks not enter into legally unenforceable deposit contracts .
Conversely , while contracts entered into by a bank treating gold as a commodity , rather than a currency , such as futures contracts , may be valid obligations of the bank , they do not give rise to " deposits " insured by FDIC .
Insured nonmember banks should exercise care so that the aggregate amount of gold held as collateral for loans does not become unduly large .
Adequate margin requirements on such loans ( such as valuing the gold at 50 percent of the current market price ) should be maintained and banks should revalue gold held as collateral at least monthly .
Banks considering making loans for the purpose of enabling the borrower to purchase gold should bear in mind that such loans , unless made for industrial or commercial purposes , are speculative and nonproductive .
As in the cases of the sale and safekeeping of gold , banks should consider the adequacy of their facilities for authenticating and protecting gold held as collateral for loans .
In sum , the Corporation believes that insured nonmember banks should move cautiously in regard to dealing in gold .
Those banks offering gold for sale should consider possible adverse customer reaction if the price of gold drops and endeavor to warn their customers of the highly speculative nature of such an investment .
Banks should also check their security systems for compliance with the Corporation 's Part 326 and any subsequent revisions thereof .
Similar policy statements are being issued by the other Federal bank regulatory agencies with respect to banks under their jurisdictions .
Effective date .
The policy enunciated in the preceding statement shall be effective on the date of its publication [ December 18 , 1974 ] .

New Haven , Conn . —
Yale researchers have shown that the origin and evolution of the placenta and uterus in mammals is associated with evolutionary changes in a single regulatory protein , according to a report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Many past studies have shown that genes are regulated and altered by changes within their own structures .
This is the first work suggesting that the evolution of transcription factors — separate regulatory proteins — may play an active role in the origin and evolution of structural innovations like the placenta and uterus , " said senior author Gunter Wagner , the Alison Richard Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Yale .
Pregnancy is a biologically unusual situation where one organism lives and develops inside another that is genetically different .
Ordinarily , the immune system identifies and destroys the dissimilar tissue as if it were a parasite .
But in some early mammals , changes ' turned down ' the immune system , allowing the developing embryo to grow and thrive unchallenged by the maternal immune response .
Gunter Wagner : " Transcription factors can play an active role in the origin and evolution of structural innovations . "

With the evolution of the uterus and placenta , it became possible for mammals to protect their growing young and to ensure they were not exposed to an unpredictable environment , like their egg - laying relatives .
This study identified one of the genetic switches that tempered the immune system and allowed formation of the placenta and internal development of young .
By analyzing DNA from many species of mammals , including resurrecting genes from the extinct ancestors of mammals , the researchers found that a crucial regulatory link in the evolution of pregnancy involved the altered function of a transcription factor protein , HoxA - 11 .
The specific change they found in HoxA - 11 is present in all known placental mammals — from elephants , the most primitive lineage with a placenta , to humans — but does not exist in marsupials , like opossums or wallabies , where there is a brief and rudimentary pregnancy followed by development of the offspring outside the mother , or in egg - laying mammals like the platypus .
The textbook story is that regulatory proteins , like HoxA - 11 , are ancient , universal and unchanging tools , and that new functions arise by using an existing tool from the gene regulatory ' toolbox ' in a new or different place .
According to Yale graduate student Vincent Lynch , lead author of the study , " We are writing a different chapter .
In this case the function of a major regulatory tool was altered — it is like we found a redesigned hammer . "

I 've clearly felt that Bush let down his guard after the '06 elections , and that this stretch has been defined by increasingly immature behavior and disinhibition .
What I have n't been able to decide , however , is whether Bush has been hitting the bottle and / or the medicine cabinet .
Overall , I think Gawker did a decent job of editing a series of Bush Olympic images focusing not just on Junior 's strange behavior , but also the suspicious gash on his forearm and the facial flushing associated with potential alcohol abuse .
A particularly interesting thing to study in the shots from last Sunday 's swimming event ( seen above ) , by the way , are the expressions -- both of a concerned and a possibly humoring / co - dependent quality -- from daughter Barbara .
Where the Gawker series does n't help , however , is showing photos from multiple days with the intimation that Bush might be drunk or hung over throughout .
( In this video interview with Bob Costas within hours of the swimming event , Bush does n't seem out - of - it at all . )
Focusing specifically on this image , and the series of Sunday night photos at the swim stadium , however , the drinking argument fits to the extent Bush lost his balance on the way into the arena , perhaps after having an extra share of dinner cocktails .
What lends weight to the argument , also , is just how much help he required .
If he stumbled with his full wits about him ( okay , go ahead and joke ) , would he have really required the whole crew of secret service guys ?
( It 's probably also helpful to study this longer view . )
But then , maybe the fact the whole crew was ready was because they had been counting the drinks in the first place .
( If Bush was drunk , however , it 's strange to consider that Laura , who does seems more zombie - like lately , or at least Barbara , behind him , would n't have been more clued in . )
In terms of Bush 's escalating disinhibition , two of the most vivid examples I 've captured in the past four or five months involved the WH Correspondents Dinner in April and the NATO summit last March .
As to suggestions of drinking , specifically , there was that weird analogy about three weeks ago in which Bush characterized the economy as drunk and hung over .
And of course , there were those suspicious photos shot during the G - 8 Summit in Germany a year ago .
All in all though , the significance of the image -- just like the significance of the suspicions -- has more to do with what this photo does speak to , which is the widespread recognition of George Bush , even perfectly straight , who can barely maintain and the George Bush who can barely deal .

With web music fan favorite Muxtape currently out of commission due to “ a problem with the RIAA , ” an open source — if no more legal — alternative has appeared : Opentape .
Opentape describes itself as “ a free , open - source package that lets you make and host your own mixtapes on the web . ”
Or , in other words , a Muxtape clone that ’s free and open source .
The demo mixtape is basically a straight up clone of the Muxtape site .
The software uses PHP 5 , Apache , and requires curl .
The version 0.1 release hit the web a couple of days ago .
Why would anyone want to create an open source version of an application that was shuttered due to legal trouble with the highly litigous American recording industry ?
Over at Hacker News , where I first heard about Opentape , the concensus seems to be that the idea is to become another thorn in the RIAA ’s side .
The more people running their own version of what is essentially Muxtape , the harder it will theoretically be for the RIAA to shut them down .
Opentape does n’t solve any copyright issues , it just makes it harder for the RIAA to litigate .
However , as others on Hacker News have pointed out , the RIAA has not been shy about going after individuals when it comes to P2P traffic .
A few weeks ago we posted about a new service called 8 tracks that operates similarly to Muxtape — allowing users to create 8 song mixtapes and share them with friends — but is planning to do so legally by paying royalties to SoundExchange , ASCAP , BMI and SESAC .
Will Opentape succeed ?
That ’s hard to say , but there are two potential issues holding it back .
The obvious one is legal : how many people will be willing to risk the RIAA ’s wrath to publish a mixtape on their server ?
The second is content .
What made Muxtape great was the ability to browse other mixtapes and find great new music .
Without a way to aggregate and discover the mixtapes people are making and publishing with Opentape , it will be less attractive as a distributed service .
In January this year , Mr Chertoff said there was only a " small window " to check on the background of most visitors from Europe and expressed the desire for better vetting .

Author of the Declaration of Independence , third President of the United States , major architect of the U.S. 's westward expansion and founder of the University of Virginia , Thomas Jefferson is a figure of world historical significance .
His writings are important documents for the history of America 's founding and for the Founders ' attempts to put into practice theories associated with the eighteenth century Enlightenment .
Jefferson 's concepts of democracy remain inspirational for many people today , even as his views on religion and race remain a source of controversy .

Mr. Putin said that dozens of people had been killed in South Ossetia and hundreds wounded , and tens of thousands were reported to be fleeing .
Georgia ’s health minister said that more than 80 people had been killed , including 40 civilians who died in airstrikes in Gori , a city north of Tbilisi .
Another Georgian official said at least 800 people , almost all of them civilians , had been injured .
Each side ’s figures were impossible to confirm independently , as was an earlier claim released by South Ossetians and repeated by some Russian officials that 1,500 people had been killed in the territory .
The fighting , and the Kremlin ’s confidence in the face of Western outcry , had wide international implications , as both Russian and Georgian officials placed it squarely in the context of renewed cold war - style tensions and an East - West struggle for regional influence ..
Western influence over Russia appeared minimal .
The East and West were stuck in diplomatic impasse , even as reports of heavy civilian casualties indicated that the humanitarian toll was climbing .
The United Nations Security Council was meeting Saturday to discuss the crisis , but with no resolution .
Georgian officials said their only way out of the conflict was for the United States to step in , but with American military intervention unlikely , they were hoping for the West to exert diplomatic pressure to stop the Russian attacks .

“ Georgia is a sovereign nation , and its territorial integrity must be respected , ” President Bush said at the Olympics in Beijing .
“ We have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand - down by all troops .
We call for the end of the Russian bombings . ”

The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency enlisted 100 goats to clear a 2.5 - acre downtown lot yesterday , saying that the goats are cheaper and better for the environment than humans with weed - wackers , the LA Times reports .
The steep , weed - coated property temporarily turned to somewhat of a zoo , with downtown workers halting from their commute to gawk at the munching mountain goats .
Subway riders snapped photos on their cell phones , capturing the stark contrast between the skyscrapers and the specialty - breed South African Boers .
Being so close to Hollywood , many onlookers assumed the goats were part of a film set or public art installation .
George Gonzalez , goat - keeper and only paid member of the workforce , said the goats could be working on the field for up to 10 days .
The Redevelopment Agency paid $ 3,000 to use the goats and said the cost for human workers would have been more than double .
And obviously the goats do n’t need lunch breaks .
The space will eventually be home to a third California Plaza skyscraper .
There are no plans to use goats or any other animals later in the project , but hopefully the building process will find other ways to keep the environment in mind .

Army Combat Team to Train for “ Homeland Scenarios ” Under NorthCom
Gina Cavallaro
Army Times
September 18 , 2008
The 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle , helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys .
Now they ’re training for the same mission — with a twist — at home .
Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the 1st BCT will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
It is not the first time an active - duty unit has been tapped to help at home .
In August 2005 , for example , when Hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in Mississippi and Louisiana , several active - duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas .
But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities .
After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
“ Right now , the response force requirement will be an enduring mission .
How the [ Defense Department ] chooses to source that and whether or not they continue to assign them to NorthCom , that could change in the future , ” said Army Col.
Louis Vogler , chief of NorthCom future operations .
“ Now , the plan is to assign a force every year . ”
The command is at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs , Colo. , but the soldiers with 1st BCT , who returned in April after 15 months in Iraq , will operate out of their home post at Fort Stewart , Ga. , where they ’ll be able to go to school , spend time with their families and train for their new homeland mission as well as the counterinsurgency mission in the war zones .
Stop - loss will not be in effect , so soldiers will be able to leave the Army or move to new assignments during the mission , and the operational tempo will be variable .
Do n’t look for any extra time off , though .
The at - home mission does not take the place of scheduled combat - zone deployments and will take place during the so - called dwell time a unit gets to reset and regenerate after a deployment .
The 1st of the 3rd is still scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010 , which means the soldiers will have been home a minimum of 20 months by the time they ship out .
In the meantime , they ’ll learn new skills , use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it .
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
Training for homeland scenarios has already begun at Fort Stewart and includes specialty tasks such as knowing how to use the “ jaws of life ” to extract a person from a mangled vehicle ; extra medical training for a CBRNE incident ; and working with U.S. Forestry Service experts on how to go in with chainsaws and cut and clear trees to clear a road or area .
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
“ It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . ”
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
“ I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , ” said Cloutier , describing the experience as “ your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body .
“ I ’m not a small guy , I weigh 230 pounds … it put me on my knees in seconds . ”
The brigade will not change its name , but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF ( pronounced “ sea- smurf ” ) .
“ I ca n’t think of a more noble mission than this , ” said Cloutier , who took command in July .
“ We ’ve been all over the world during this time of conflict , but now our mission is to take care of citizens at home … and depending on where an event occurred , you ’re going home to take care of your home town , your loved ones . ”
While soldiers ’ combat training is applicable , he said , some nuances do n’t apply .
“ If we go in , we ’re going in to help American citizens on American soil , to save lives , provide critical life support , help clear debris , restore normalcy and support whatever local agencies need us to do , so it ’s kind of a different role , ” said Cloutier , who , as the division operations officer on the last rotation , learned of the homeland mission a few months ago while they were still in Iraq .
Some brigade elements will be on call around the clock , during which time they ’ll do their regular marksmanship , gunnery and other deployment training .
That ’s because the unit will continue to train and reset for the next deployment , even as it serves in its CCMRF mission .
Should personnel be needed at an earthquake in California , for example , all or part of the brigade could be scrambled there , depending on the extent of the need and the specialties involved .
Other branches included
The active Army ’s new dwell - time mission is part of a NorthCom and DOD response package .
Active - duty soldiers will be part of a force that includes elements from other military branches and dedicated National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction - Civil Support Teams .
A final mission rehearsal exercise is scheduled for mid-September at Fort Stewart and will be run by Joint Task Force Civil Support , a unit based out of Fort Monroe , Va. , that will coordinate and evaluate the interservice event .
In addition to 1st BCT , other Army units will take part in the two - week training exercise , including elements of the 1st Medical Brigade out of Fort Hood , Texas , and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade from Fort Bragg , N.C .
There also will be Air Force engineer and medical units , the Marine Corps Chemical , Biological Initial Reaction Force , a Navy weather team and members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency .
One of the things Vogler said they ’ll be looking at is communications capabilities between the services .
“ It is a concern , and we ’re trying to check that and one of the ways we do that is by having these sorts of exercises .
Leading up to this , we are going to rehearse and set up some of the communications systems to make sure we have interoperability , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know what America ’s overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day , seven days a week , there are soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they ’re called , ” Cloutier said .
“ It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home . ”

An investigation by the Associated Press ( AP ) has revealed that the drinking water of at least 41 million people in the United States is contaminated with pharmaceutical drugs .
It has long been known that drugs are not wholly absorbed or broken down by the human body .
Significant amounts of any medication taken eventually pass out of the body , primarily through the urine .
" People think that if they take a medication , their body absorbs it and it disappears , but of course that 's not the case , " EPA scientist Christian Daughton said .
While sewage is treated before being released back into the environment , and water from reservoirs or rivers is also treated before being funneled back into the drinking water supply , these treatments are not able to remove all traces of medications .
And so far , the EPA has not regulated the presence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water , meaning that there are no laws in existence today that protect consumers from this increasingly dangerous chemical contaminant of the water supply .
Medications for animals also contaminating the water supply Drugs given to animals are also entering the water supply .
One study found that 10 percent of the steroids given to cattle pass directly through their bodies , while another study found that steroid concentrations in the water downstream of a Nebraska feedlot were four times as high as the water upstream .
Male fish downstream of the feedlot were found to have depressed levels of testosterone and smaller than normal heads , most likely due to the pharmaceutical contamination in their water " It brings a question to people 's minds that if the fish were affected ... might there be a potential problem for humans ? " said EPA research biologist Vickie Wilson .
While the concentration of drugs in drinking water tends to be low , some medications , such as hormones , are able to operate potently even at concentrations of one part per billion .
To make matters worse , there is evidence that the chlorine commonly used to treat drinking water may make some pharmaceutical chemicals more toxic .
Thus , the typical claim that " pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations , and therefore could not be dangerous " holds no water ( pardon the pun ) .
Not only are some chemicals potentiated ( made more toxic ) by other chemicals in the water , but to date , there have been absolutely no studies looking at the increased danger posed by combinations of pharmaceuticals now being found .
In other words , nobody knows the level of risk that may be associated with the chemical cocktail of pharmaceuticals now being found in the water supply .
No one can say with any degree of honesty that the drug contamination is safe , meaning that the real risks to human remain entirely unknown .56 different drug chemicals in the drinking water
To determine the extent of drinking water contamination , an Associated Press investigative team surveyed the water providers of the 50 largest cities in the United States and 52 smaller communities , analyzed federal databases and scientific reports , and interviewed government and corporate officials .
The investigation found widespread evidence of drinking water contaminated with both over - the - counter and prescription drugs , including painkillers , hormones , antibiotics , anti-convulsants , anti-depressants , and drugs for cancer or heart disease .
Of the 28 major cities that tested their water supplies for pharmaceuticals , only two said those tests showed no pharmaceutical contamination .
In Philadelphia , 56 different drugs and drug byproducts were found in treated drinking water , and 63 were found in the city 's watershed .
Of the 35 watersheds that had been tested , 28 were found to be contaminated .
Deep - water aquifers near landfills , feedlots and other contaminant sources in 24 states were also found to contain pharmaceuticals .
This means that even in rural areas where people get their water from wells , drinking water might still contain drugs .
According to researcher Anthony Aufdenkampe of the Stroud Water Research Center , watersheds in rural areas can be contaminated when people 's septic tanks malfunction .
" Septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail , " he said .
Cities do not test the water for pharmaceutical pollutionEven these numbers do not give the full scale of the problem , the AP suggests , because many water providers simply do not test for this kind of contamination , which is not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Of the 52 small water providers surveyed by AP , only one screened its water for pharmaceuticals .
Other providers do screen , but they conceal the results from the public .
According to a group that represents California water providers , the public " does n't know how to interpret the information " from such tests and therefore does not need to hear it !
Even companies that test and report their data often screen for only a few chemicals , creating a skewed impression of how contaminated the water actually is .
Water bottling companies also do not screen for pharmaceutical contamination in their water products .
It is highly likely , at the same time , that soft drink bottling companies using local tap water supplies to make their beverages are potentially using pharmaceutical - contaminated water .
The EPA sticks its head in the ground over pharmaceutical pollutionAccording to Shane Snyder , research and development project manager at the Southern Nevada Water Authority , researchers looking into the extent of water contamination are avoiding the important questions .
" I think it 's a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there , and so little is being spent on human health , " Snyder said .
" They need to just accept that these things are everywhere ; every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there .
It 's time for the EPA to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects , both human and environmental .
" A total of over 100 pharmaceutical products have been detected in water supplies in North America , Europe and Asia , including remote regions such as Swiss lakes and the North Sea .
And bottled or filtered water , the AP report notes , is not necessarily safer , as the filters used in homes or bottling plants are rarely designed to remove pharmaceutical residue .
Drug companies , for their part , have done nothing to accept responsibility for the environmental health impact of their polluting chemicals .
In fact , Big Pharma has n't even yet acknowledged the fact that their products are " pollutants " in any way .
Like most pharmaceutical consumers , the drug companies hope to just flush this issue down the toilet and pretend it never existed .
The health impact of pharmaceutical contaminants in waterVery little research has been conducted on the specific effects of trace drugs in drinking water , but what evidence is there gives cause for alarm .
Contamination of environmental water sources has caused male fish to exhibit female traits and led to damaging effects on other wildlife species .
Laboratory research indicates that small levels of drugs can cause cancer cells to proliferate faster , slow kidney cell growth and cause inflammation in blood cells .
At a time when the American population is suffering from skyrocketing infertility and hormone imbalances , it seems outrageous that health authorities would not be looking more closely at this issue and working on ways to protect the public from pharmaceutical pollution .
Because water is consumed regularly in large quantities over a lifetime , and because humans are exposed to many combinations of dozens of different drugs , the effects on the human body may be significantly greater than those seen in the lab .
And unlike most pollutants , drugs are specifically designed to cause changes in the human body , thus they are far less likely to be " inert " than other chemicals that might be found in the water supply .
" These are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations , " said zoologist John Sumpter of London 's Brunel University .
" That 's what pharmaceuticals do .
So when they get out to the environment , it should not be a shock to people that they have effects . "

IT 'S FREE About $ 2 billion in economic stimulus rebate checks are being confiscated to pay overdue bills for child support , student loans and back taxes , the government says .
So far , 1.8 million rebate checks have been intercepted by Treasury Department computers showing that individuals owe money to federal or state governments .
The biggest beneficiaries : parents who are owed child support .
USING YOUR REBATE :
What 's good for you vs. U.S. economy ?
The Internal Revenue Service has mailed 77 million checks worth $ 64 billion — a little more than half the expected total .
" It 's a nice bonus for the children and families in need , " says Mike Adams , head of child support at the Tennessee Department of Human Services .
His state has received $ 8.5 million of $ 20 million expected for unpaid child support .
The large take for unpaid debts is the result of an increasingly sophisticated debt - collection program started in 2001 .
Today , most states and federal agencies send weekly lists of delinquent Americans to the Treasury Department .
Before a rebate is mailed , it 's run through a list that contains the names and Social Security numbers of people who owe money .
" We 've had a few complaints but not many , " says Dean Balamaci , director of debt collections at the Treasury Department .
" We 're proud that we 're sending money back to families who need it . "
So far , nearly $ 1 billion has been collected .
Where it has gone : • 55 % for child support .
• 39 % for federal debts such as student loans or farm loans .
• 6 % for unpaid state taxes .
Taxpayers denied their rebate get letters explaining why they got a reduced payment or none at all .
The diverted money is sent directly to the family or government agency to which it was owed .
A few states , however , are losing out on millions of dollars available through the program .
Michigan does n't get its delinquent state taxes collected , Balamaci says .
The reason :
It hires private contractors to collect back taxes .
Also , Mississippi has n't joined yet , and California does n't submit the names of income tax debtors .
So while Maryland has collected $ 6 million from rebate checks for unpaid state income taxes , California has received nothing .

Rocky Twyman says God , not market forces , brought prices down A prayer group in Washington DC is claiming the credit for the recent sharp drop in the US price of petrol .
Rocky Twyman , 59 , a veteran community campaigner , started Pray At The Pump meetings at petrol stations in April .
Since then , the average price of US gasoline has fallen from more than $ 4 a gallon ( 3.8 litres ) to $ 3.80 .
" We do n't have anybody else to turn to but God , " Mr Twyman told the BBC .
" We have to turn these problems over to God and not to man . "
His first pilgrimage to the pump was prompted by fellow volunteers at the First Seventh Day Adventist Church in Petworth , a working - class neighbourhood of the US capital , who were struggling with higher gasoline prices .
He led them down the block to the local Shell gas station to pray .
And over the months since then , he has held similar prayer meetings at pumps all over the US .
Prayer warriors
" We were down in Huntsville , Alabama .
We finished praying , " Mr Twyman said .
" Immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices .
They brought it down .
We had marvellous success down in St Louis , Missouri . "
This week the group returned to the site of their first prayer meeting to celebrate .
Singing " We shall overcome , " they changed the words of the well - known hymn to " We 'll have lower gas prices " .
Mr Twyman is sceptical that market forces might be responsible for the lower prices .
But he and his prayer warriors have changed their motoring habits .
" We believe not just in prayer - because we believe that faith without works is dead .
So we 've encouraged people to car - pool more and organise their days more , because it's a combination of faith with these other factors . "
Pray At The Pump plans to build on its success and drive gasoline prices even lower .
In the words of Rocky Twyman : " We just thank God for blessing us with small victories and we expect greater things to come . "

If it ’s Sarah Palin , why is she distinctly not pregnant in a photograph which was apparently taken on Super Tuesday , which is in February , when , as Jazz Shaw points out , Palin would have been about six months along in her pregnancy ?
Keep in mind , before we wind up the Friday night activities in Blogistan , that this is still only ten hours after the announcement of Sarah Palin as John McCain ’s VP announcement caught so many of us flat - footed .
In ten hours , though , the hits keep on coming .
Let ’s take a quick look at a few more .
The first one , and possibly the most tawdry of the bunch , came via several e-mails which arrived after the announcement here at Jazz Headquarters .
Check out this picture of Sarah Palin from Super Tuesday this year .
It ’s a nice shot , but according to at least once source it was taken on Super Tuesday .
That ’s in February .
At that point , Palin should have been six months pregnant with her last child .
It does make me wonder if the following will turn into a story .
[ digg-reddit-me ]
Yesterday , Obama used the storm that accompanied an Obama - Biden rally as a metaphor for these times ( continued with sourced remarks he has said before and might have said in that storm as I ca n’t find the full transcript ) :
Sometimes the skies look cloudy and it ’s dark .
And you think the rains will never pass .
The young people understand that the clouds – these too will pass , that a brighter day will come .
In these tough times , it is that American spirit , that American promise , that pushes us forward .
Even when the path is uncertain .
It binds us together in spite of our differences .
It makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
If the last few months have taught us anything , it ’s that we can all suffer from the excesses of a few .
It has taught us that we all have a stake in each other ’s success .
We all have a stake in ensuring that the market is efficient and transparent ; that it inspires trust and confidence ; that it rewards those who are truly successful instead of those who are just successful at gaming the system .
I realize that there are some who will say that achieving all of this is far too difficult .
That it is too hard to build consensus .
That we are too divided and self - interested to think about the responsibilities we have to each other and to our country .
That the times are simply too tough .
But then I am reminded that we have been in tougher times and we have faced far more difficult challenges .
And each time we have emerged stronger , more united , and more prosperous than the last .
It is faith in the American ideal that carries us through , as well as the belief that was voiced by Franklin Roosevelt all those years ago this week : “ Failure is not an American habit ; and in the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load . ”
That is the strength and the hope we seek both today – and in all the days and months to come .
In our country , I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything , but because behind all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us ; beyond all the petty bickering and point - scoring in Washington , Americans are a decent , generous , compassionate people , united by common challenges and common hopes .
And every so often , there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again .
So it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union ; and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union .
So it was for the Greatest Generation that conquered fear itself , and liberated a continent from tyranny , and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity .
So it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines ; the women who shattered glass ceilings ; the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedom ’s cause .
So it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that ’s better , and kinder , and more just .
And so it must be for us .
America , this is our moment .
This is our time .
Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past .
Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face .
Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love .
Yahoo !
has reinstated its free webmail services in Iran , less than a year after the firm blocked new registrations from the country citing tighter US sanctions .
Iran has also reappeared in the registration country list of Microsoft 's Hotmail service .
Last November we reported how both had blocked new webmail and instant messenger registrations from Iran .
At the time Yahoo ! said it was responding to US government restrictions .
Microsoft refused to explain its move .
Last week both were seen reversing the freeze .
Yahoo ! told El Reg :
The United States restricts U.S. companies from conducting business in specified countries , such as Iran , Cuba , Sudan and others .
We continually review and adjust our business operations to identify any opportunities we may have in providing our innovative communication and content services in accordance with applicable laws , and have done so with respect to Iran .
Yahoo !'s core values center on helping people around the world communicate and engage in free expression .
We strive to balance the benefits of providing our users innovative communication services such as Yahoo !
Mail and Yahoo !
Messenger with the need to comply with applicable laws .
Microsoft again refused to comment on the issue .
US sanctions against Iran have not changed since last October , immediately before Yahoo ! and Microsoft imposed their embargo .
The tightening of trade restrictions did not prompt Google to remove Iran from its country lists .
Iranian nationalist bloggers have claimed Yahoo ! and Microsoft 's policy changes as a victory for their " Hello Yahoo Mail " online campaign .
The action included an attempt to Googlebomb the search term " Yahoo mail " with pro-Iranian websites .
Kourosh Zabari claimed on OhMyNews that five million Iranians had deleted their Yahoo !
accounts in protest at the perceived slight against their country . ®
Robert A. Heinlein Quotes
If you have quotation to add , please send it to me .
Flint , Michigan 's police chief is n't backing down from his crackdown on saggy pants .
The American Civil Liberties Union said last week that today would be the deadline for chief David Dicks to halt the stopping and searching of individuals with low - riding pants exposing underwear or bare bottoms .
Legal action may be forthcoming because Dicks said he is n't changing anything .
" I 'm going to keep on doing what I 'm doing , " Dicks told the Detroit Free Press yesterday .
" I guess I 'm expecting a lawsuit , " he said , but there has to be a plaintiff .
Dicks pointed out that he has only issued warnings since implementing the policy June 27 .
" I do n't see how a warning is a civil rights violation , " he said .
Dicks said wearing pants below the waist is a crime - a violation of the city 's disorderly conduct ordinance - and can give police probable cause to search saggers for other crimes , such as weapon or drug possession .
He said exposing the buttocks is indecent exposure .
Both crimes are misdemeanours punishable by 93 days to a year in jail and fines up to $ 500 , Dicks said .
The ACLU is particularly troubled by the searches of saggers .
" Your new practice of stopping and threatening young men with disorderly conduct for wearing ' saggy pants ' is a blatant violation of the United States Constitution , " the ACLU wrote to Dicks in a letter last week .
" Although you were recently appointed chief of the Flint police department , you cannot appoint yourself chief of the ' fashion police ' .
You have no power to criminalise a style of dress because you find it distasteful .
We ask that you halt this practice immediately . "
The ACLU could not be reached yesterday .
What caused this ?
It is a simple question , and yet answers are all over the map , as you might expect .
Here ’s mine in two words : fiat money .
The word fiat means : out of nothing .
Money out of nothing is money that is eventually worth nothing .
The possibility of precisely that happening emerged on August 15 , 1971 .
Since Nixon severed the last tie of the dollar to gold , the world ’s monetary system has not been restrained by anything physical .
We ’ve depended on the discretion of central bankers .
We ca n’t trust that , and this crisis shows precisely why .
Of course there are subsidiary factors .
The lifting of restrictions on Freddie and Fannie .
Subsidized lending .
The Fed ’s artificially low interest rates .
The Community Reinvestment Act. Financial “ deregulation . ”
The war .
Bush profligacy .
Debt .
There is much more besides .
But fighting each of these forces individually is like battling down flies at the garbage dump .
The core issue is that there is nothing to restrain money creation .
The first time that people hear this , they find their minds rather boggled , and they want to know more .
My whole experience in this area is that once people start digging around the area of monetary theory , they find that 1 ) it is not as difficult a subject as it seems , 2 ) it is endlessly fascinating , and 3 ) it explains far more than they realized before .
Prices and Production ... F.A. Hayek Best Price : $ 15.65 Buy New $ 89.28 ( as of 09:50 EST - Details )
It was F.A. Hayek who bore this burden most directly for those in the English - speaking world .
His books on the source of the business cycle and what to do about it appeared in the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s .
These works were cited by the Nobel Prize Committee in 1974 as his most important contribution to economic thought .
His ideas are directly applicable to our current plight .
It has been a real tragedy that these works have been out of print .
But this year , the Mises Institute made a hard push to get this book out in time for the current financial calamity .
We set other projects aside and worked all hours to bring out the definitive collection .
Here it is : Prices and Production and Other Works on Money , the Business Cycle and the Gold Standard , by F.A. Hayek .
The Causes of the Econ ... Ludwig von Mises Best Price : $ 0.49 Buy New $ 23.99 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
The book is priceless in its content and presentation .
Specifically , Hayek explains the mechanism by which loose credit generates false signals to investors , leading them to chase fads all over the market , and ending in sector - wide failures .
He was writing at a time when the gold standard provided partial restraint on the government and the central bank .
No more .
So Hayek ’s analysis of all of this is more penetrating than ever .
The book also contains the complete text of his many battles with Keynes .
At this link , you can buy what we are calling the Crisis Book Kit at a deep discount .
Just click the books you want and the discount happens .
At the same time he was writing , his mentor Ludwig von Mises was battling it out in Austria and the German - speaking world .
He became the great opponent of not only inflationary finance but also the Continent ’s version of the New Deal .
The remarkable thing is that these essays were not translated until the 1980s and even then remained obscure .
This book is really their first major debut , and it appeared only last year : The Causes of the Economic Crisis .
You will see his expository virtuosity at work and also his amazing courage and passion .
The Theory of Money an ...
Mises , Ludwig von Best Price : $ 3.50 Buy New $ 20.99 ( as of 11:30 EST - Details )
It has been a major task of the Austrian school since 1912 to explain to people what money is , how it works , and how its corruption and distortion by the state is the source of both inflation and business cycles .
The core book here is Mises ’s own 1912 classic called The Theory of Money and Credit , written at the dawn of the central banking age .
The prose is still crystal clear , and it continues to be the best textbook on money ever written .
In the American context of the Great Depression , one book captures the whole onset and response .
It is Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression .
He shows that it was n’t the 1929 crash that was the problem ; it was the response to the crash that created the Depression .
Bailouts .
Price controls .
Wage controls .
Government programs .
Trade restrictions .
Crackdowns on the capital markets .
And who did all this ?
It originated not with FDR but with Herbert Hoover — clear echoes of today .
There is no understanding the present crisis without this book .
America ’s Great ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 3.02 Buy New $ 14.16 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Finally we need to realize the problem of loose money and its effects are not new and not necessarily 20th century .
The whole history of the American economy is littered with banking panics , bailouts , business cycles , and chaos , each with the same root .
When the money goes bad , everything goes bad .
Rothbard chronicles the long history in his marvelous book : History of Money and Banking in the United States .
The Mises Institute has sponsored research on this topic since it was created in 1982 .
Our first conference was on the gold standard .
We ’ve suffered for this choice .
The best way to fall out of favor with the regime — or its pseudo - libertarian and neocon supporters — is to question its central bankers .
We ’ve done that .
But now , the work is done .
It is available .
The truth is out there .
You only need to grab it , comprehend it , and spread it .
Please help .
History hangs in the balance .
Lew Rockwell Archives
The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
This article is part of a series describing a port of the samples from Practical Common Lisp ( PCL ) to Clojure .
You will probably want to read the intro first .
This article covers Chapter 7 , Macros : Standard Control Constructs .
Rolling your own
Common Lisp control constructs are generally part of the standard library , not the core language .
Ditto for Clojure .
If you do n't find a control construct you want , you can always roll it yourself .
For example , Clojure does n't have an unless , so here goes :
( defmacro unless [ condition & body ] ` ( when ( not ~ condition ) ~@ body ) )
defmacro differs from Common Lisp in two important ways .
The argument list is a vector [...] , not a list (... ) .
( This is true for functions as well , I just had n't mentioned it yet ) .
Clojure gives vectors , sets , and maps equal billing with lists by giving them their own literal syntax .
, not a list .
( This is true for functions as well , I just had n't mentioned it yet ) .
Clojure gives vectors , sets , and maps equal billing with lists by giving them their own literal syntax .
Clojure uses different reader macros for unquote and unquote - splicing .
Where CL uses , and , @ , Clojure uses ~ , and ~@ .
The avoidance of commas in read macros is a well - considered decision .
Commas are whitespace in Clojure .
This often results in an interface that is simultaneously human - friendly and list -y .
The following two expressions are equivalent :
{ :fn " John " : ln " Doe " } { : fn " John " , :ln " Doe " }
The latter form makes the map more readable , and more similar to other languages .
doseq
Common Lisp provides dolist for iterating a list .
Clojure works in terms of sequences , which are collections that can be traversed in a list - like way .
The Clojure analog to dolist is doseq .
It can work with lists :
user= > ( doseq [ x ' ( 1 2 3 ) ] ( println x ) ) 1 2 3
doseq also works with maps .
Note the destructuring bind since I care only about the values :
user= > ( doseq [ [ _ v ] { : fn " John " :ln " Doe " } ] ( println v ) ) John Doe
In fact , doseq works with any kind of sequence ( hence the name ) .
( iterate inc 1 ) produces an infinite collection incrementing up from 1 . ( take 5 ... ) pulls a finite set of 5 elements from a collection .
user= > ( doseq [ x ( take 5 ( iterate inc 1 ) ) ] ( println x ) ) ) 1 2 3 4 5
Do n't try to doseq an infinite collection , and do n't say I did n't warn you .
dotimes
Common Lisp provides dotimes for iteration with counting .
Here is the Clojure version of PCL 's multiplication table example :
user= > ( dotimes [ x 10 ] ( dotimes [ y 10 ] ( print ( format " %3d " ( * ( inc x ) ( inc y ) ) ) ) ) ( println ) ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
CL do and loop
Common Lisp provides some more general control constructs : do and loop .
Clojure 's functions of the same name serve very different purposes .
Clojure 's do is equivalent to CL's progn , and Clojure 's loop works with recur .
You could write Clojure macros to emulate CL's do and loop , but you probably wo n't want too .
Instead , you can use list comprehensions or lazy sequences , which I will introduce later in this series .
Wrapping up
Like CL , Clojure defines control structures using macros .
Also like CL , Clojure has control structures that are functional , plus some that are evaluated for their side effects .
Clojure 's control structures tend to use fewer parentheses .
Clojure does not duplicate CL's general purpose imperative control structures .
Instead , you can often use list comprehensions and lazy sequences .

Revision history
ROCKVILLE , Md. 
A hormone - like chemical should be taken out of food packaging , especially baby bottles , infant formula cans and other products used by children and pregnant women , university researchers and consumer advocates told a Food and Drug Administration subcommittee Tuesday .
The FDA has said that the chemical , bisphenol A , or BPA , does n't pose a risk at the levels to which people are commonly exposed .
BPA has been detected in the bodies of virtually all Americans tested .
But critics questioned why the FDA based that ruling on three studies funded by the chemical industry , all of which found BPA to be safe at current exposure levels .
Hundreds of independent studies in animals and cells suggest the estrogen - like chemical poses serious risks .
The newest research — the first large study in humans — links BPA to both heart disease and diabetes in adults .
Adults with the highest BPA levels in their urine were more than twice as likely to have heart disease or diabetes than those with the lowest levels , according to the study of 1,455 people , published online Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association .
The total number of people with these conditions was small : 79 had heart disease and 136 had diabetes .
In a letter sent to the FDA Tuesday , Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , Tuesday became the latest lawmaker to ask the agency FDA why it gave preference to industry - funded studies .
Grassley — who noted that much of the research rejected by the FDA was paid for by the National Institutes of Health — asked the FDA to provide copies of all communication with the American Chemistry Council , which funded one of the pivotal studies cited by the FDA .
FDA scientist Laura Tarantino said the agency relied on industry studies because they were very large and included raw data , which allows the FDA to independently verify the findings .
But Frederick vom Saal , a University of Missouri professor , says the industry studies ' flaws make them useless in deciding on a safe exposure level for BPA .
" The FDA is ignoring all of this research , " vom Saal says .
" While it has been doing that , Americans have been at risk . "
The FDA 's report puts it at odds with the National Toxicology Program , which this month expressed " some concern " that BPA alters the brain , behavior and prostate in fetuses and children .
That study included many studies that were not weighed in the FDA safety standard .
Babies are mainly exposed to BPA through liquid infant formula , which is usually sold in metal cans lined with the chemical , as well as bottles made of polycarbonate plastic , according to the FDA report .
Powdered formula probably is much less contaminated with BPA .
John Bucher , the toxicology program 's associate director , says this put formula - fed infants most at risk .
HOUSE DIVIDED : How federal agencies can disagree on BPA
D. Gail McCarver , a pediatrician at the Medical College of Wisconsin , says the FDA report underestimates how much BPA children are exposed to .
She notes that the report 's safety ruling is based on " average " exposures for formula - fed infants — even though some babies may consume much more than average .
" I do not believe we should be protecting our children at an average level , " McCarver says .
Consumer activists have warned about the dangers of BPA for a decade .
Now that research also finds disease in humans , activists say the FDA needs to revise its ruling that the chemical is safe in everyday use .
At the very least , the FDA should require a prominent warning on products made with BPA , says Diana Zuckerman , president of the National Research Center for Women & Families .
Products made with BPA today are rarely labeled , making it difficult for consumers to avoid them .
The FDA received about 200 public comments on its draft report .
About 20 people — most opposed to the use of BPA — spoke at the hearing .
Sonya Lunder of the Environmental Working Group says it 's especially important to protect fetuses and infants from BPA , because they are the most vulnerable to hormonal influences .
Yet she says babies are exposed to more than 12 times as much BPA per pound of body weight as adults .
McCarver says there 's a critical need to measure BPA exposure in babies , especially premature infants , who are exposed to many plastic medical devices and tubes while in the hospital .
But McCarver says she does n't support completely banning BPA , which is used to make life - saving bicycle helmets .
If manufacturers replace it with another chemical , she says , there should be thorough tests to make sure the replacement is safe .
GET ANSWERS : Have questions about how to avoid BPA ?
Health reporter Liz Szabo joins the conversation to answer your questions below .
Whoever devised the slipknot contract clause “ into perpetuity ” had n’t conceived a Gail Zappa .
She ’s made it her job to parse the music industry ’s dense legalese , close contractual loopholes and , most significantly , end what she sees as its iron grip on an artist ’s past , present and future .
“ Let me say it in the simplest way , ” she lays it out , her full hand on the table , “ My job is to make sure that Frank Zappa has the last word in terms of anybody ’s idea of who he is .
And his actual last word is his music . ”
To that end , Gail Zappa has become a vocal advocate for artists ’ rights .
The wife of the late musician - composer Frank Zappa , she has been keeping watch over not just her husband ’s image and brand but his legacy .
Despite what people might think , her dogged efforts are not about erecting razor - wire around all things Zappa but protecting his memory .
Yes , she knows all about the finger - pointing and the grousing , the battles with the record labels about who owns what ; the fury and frustration of fans who are unable to download the most famous and seminal works of the Zappa canon .
The Zappa Family Trust is in the middle of a dust - up with Rykodisc ; Gail Zappa is suing Rykodisc over “ copyright infringements including digital rights . ”

It ’s not the first time the Zappas have been in a legal dance :
In 1977 , Frank Zappa filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros .
Records and his former manager citing artistic grievances and questioning certain “ creative accounting practices , ” Gail says .
After an out - of - court settlement was reached in 1982 , the rights to his master recordings reverted to him , a lucrative boon .
December marks the 15th anniversary of Frank Zappa ’s passing , but interest in him and the work continues only to grow .
“ No two of Frank ’s shows were ever the same , which is one of the reasons he was one of the most heavily bootlegged artists , ” Gail explains .
Tapping into that interest , in the last few years , the Zappa Family Trust has begun to release rarities from the Zappa vault .
Frank was an obsessive chronicler , recording both audio and video ( in every conceivable format ) of his process .
Gail has established two labels -- reconstituting Zappa and launching Vaulternative -- to showcase that material , which includes band rehearsals from the ‘ 60s and live footage selected by Gail with the assist of Vaultmeister Joe Travers .
This summer , they ’ve issued on DVD the concert film “ The Torture Never Stops ” in Frank Zappa ’s original edit and “ One Shot Deal , ” a previously unreleased compilation of guitar - focused music .
Reissues of Zappa ’s first solo album , 1967 ’s “ Lumpy Gravy , ” and the following year ’s “ We ’re Only In It for the Money ” are in the offing .
Coinciding with all of this is the very first staging of his 1979 rock opera , “ Joe ’s Garage , ” at Hollywood ’s that , loosely speaking , chronicles the travails of an imaginary guitarist named Joe.
Gail gave the first - time greenlight .
“ I ’m the front - of - house mixer , ” Gail Zappa says , settling into a soft chair near Travers , just to the right of an old console setup in what was most recently Frank ’s editing room in their Laurel Canyon home .
Gail usually makes herself available only for the nuts - and - bolts sound bite related to a release , “ but it ’s not often that I can get into the grommets and widgets and explain what ’s behind all of this . ”
Advertisement
Her position has n’t always made her popular -- she ’s butted heads at times with everyone from record execs and label lawyers to fan boards and tribute bands .
“ I ca n’t go out and be the rebuttal witness every minute because I just end up looking like the screaming shrew that I ’m getting the reputation for being . ”
But she has her reasons , and they ’re rooted in a promise : “ My job is to make sure that everything is as clean as you can get it .
. . .
I do n’t want anybody standing between the audience and what Frank ’s intention as a composer was and still is .
[ W ] hat I ’ve discovered in the process . . . comes down to one simple thing .
Because everybody wants to remake his image .
And they can . . .
Well , they can all pound salt ! ”
Fifteen years gone , and Frank Zappa still casts a long shadow .
Gail , like Travers , often speaks of him in present tense .
And though , on this late - summer afternoon , no one occupies Frank ’s old console chair , there are all sorts of winking reminders salted about everywhere .
Gold records and old album covers .
A “ Nixon for Governor ” poster hangs on a far door .
Scores of “ Zappa ” license plates , gifts from fans from across the country , frame the old console , and photographs , tucked into unexpected places , have a fun - house effect : the eyes seem to follow you .
It ’s not a spirit that hovers but an ethos ; standards to be upheld .
Gail Zappa is not custodian of a ghost but of a force that still has power to prod and provoke .
Keeping watch keeps her busy .
There are the cover bands to police , and there is even the historical narrative of Frank ’s band The Mothers to keep close tabs on .
It can be all over the map -- tribute bands asserting that they are “ embodying the spirit of Frank Zappa , ” an old band member claiming collaborator status .
“ Do you remember ‘ Police Woman ’ ?
Pepper ? ” Gail Zappa asks .
“ That ’s me .
The ultimate Sgt. Pepper . ”

One of the front - burner issues has been the digital music rights for the work that makes up Frank Zappa ’s primary catalog .
Many recording artists have expressed their distaste for digital sound , arguing that when their work is compressed into MP3 files , it can seem flat and thin .
What the public might not know , Gail says , “ is that it was Frank ’s concept to limit [ the sale ] to a format so that it was accurately represented , that being 16 - bit technology -- CDs .
He did n’t want it compressed .
So we ’re currently in a lawsuit over this issue . ”
What ’s at stake here is intent : “ iTunes has been from the get - go massively compressed .
That ’s fine perhaps if you ’re Britney Spears . . . but it ’s not fine for Frank Zappa ’s music , and he was interested in protecting that . ”
A spokesperson for Rykodisc parent Warner Music had no comment .
Peering into genius
TO LABEL Frank Zappa an iconoclast would only be rounding the corner of the neighborhood where he and his imagination reside .
There ’s so much stirring at every turn and busy intersection : glances of doo - wop , blues , faux - psychedelia .
His music could n’t be fenced - in in terms of genre .
In fact , much of it is an amalgam of styles -- embracing , say , heavy artillery guitar - rock with nods to composers Igor Stravinsky or Edgard Varese -- that reflected his citizen - of - the world sensibilities .

Angular and antic , prescient and political and vamped - up in tricky time signatures , Zappa was of his time -- as a commentator and a critic -- and light years ahead of it .
“ Frank often said , ” Gail says , “ that his job was to go ‘ out there ’ and come back . . . and tell you what I found out . ’”
Part of the idea behind opening the vaults was to chart those travels and to give audiences an unprecedented , behind - the - scenes look at the composer ’s process .
As Vaultmeister , Travers is n’t just cataloging the contents , but , he says “ also investigating the possibilities . ”
Since 1995 , Travers , the drummer for a band led by Frank ’s son Dweezil , Zappa Plays Zappa , has been sifting through the assets ; a wall - to - wall , floor - to - ceiling audio / video and all - manner of miscellany magic library .
Though every silver film canister , tape box or VHS shell is marked in Frank Zappa ’s own hand , “ it does n’t mean that you ’ll find what you think in there , ” says Travers , so there is a fair amount of mind - reading and extrapolating .
There is basically every kind of format that music was archived on from the ‘ 50s to the ‘ 70s , and Travers has about 40 % of it cataloged both on hard drive and CD .
Travers works closely with Gail , submitting ideas for releases .
Ultimately , she has the final word .
“ I kind of look at the progression of the releases , like if we ’ve released a record from a band in 1976 , I do n’t want to stay in that realm .
I want to jump around and try to cover different areas .
. . .
I try to prioritize a lot of things that Frank didn’t , ” Travers says .
“ There is an album . . . called ‘ Wazzoo , ’ which is a 20 - piece band that Frank only did eight shows with but never released anything from .
But we just did . ”

The Zappa label is dedicated to work wholly produced by Frank Zappa , while Vaulternative highlights old sessions , rehearsals , sonic threads long stored away .
The Zappa Family Trust has about 40 projects in the works , Gail says .
“ We could easily put out five to eight projects a year and can do that for the next few years . ”
That would make Zappa almost as prolific as he was when he was living .
“ Years ago my husband said , ‘ Sell everything and get out of this horrible business . ’
Did I listen ?
No . I tried .
I really tried .
But I realized early on that I have to defend his right to have been here in the first place , ” Gail says .
So all of this , every choice , weighs heavy .
“ The best thing that I can hope is to . . . keep windows open to be able to discover the music .
If [ people ] get to the original recordings , and even Zappa Plays Zappa and other groups that respect the intent of the composer then that music is going to be with them for the rest of their lives .

“ It is not a causal relationship , ” she says .
“ So that ’s the reason , the whole motivation for what I do what I do .
Because I owe it to Frank and what I feel about his music .
When it ’s said and done , I still work for that guy . ”

Displaying his Frankophilia
Back IN the ‘ 70s , Pat Towne was one of those boys who was out there listening -- listening for something out of the ordinary , something with substance .
“ I was the kind of kid who did n’t dance in lock step to the disco beat , because it looked like everybody was marching in step and becoming mindless , ” Towne says .
As a prog-rock guy into Emerson , Lake & Palmer and Yes , Towne was fascinated by Frank Zappa ’s abstract expressionist musical canvas .
But there was something else , an anti-conformist message , that he found intriguing : “ His music attacked those kinds of people and that kind of thinking .
It instantly appealed to me .
As well as it being great music . ”
He ’d first connected with Zappa ’s 1973 album “ Over - Nite Sensation ” in high school , but when a friend visited his dorm room with a copy of “ Joe ’s Garage ” a few years later , Towne was hooked .
It was a concept album that took on sweeping themes -- religion , overzealous government , sex , consumer culture and was “ full of all these funny snippets and side remarks .
When I saw that the album said ‘ Act I , ’ that stayed with me .
I had images in my head of what scenes would look like .
It existed in my head as a pipe dream . ”

Towne finally is getting a chance to bring that dream to life on stage .
This week , the Open Fist Theatre will present the world premiere of “ Joe ’s Garage , ” Zappa ’s three - act rock opera , adapted by Towne ( who is directing ) and the show ’s producer , Michael Franco .
It ’s been an obstacle course of sorts to say the least -- from gaining Gail Zappa ’s consent ( “ I did a PowerPoint presentation and acted out scenes in front of her ! ” ) -- to evoking just the right mood .
“ I told the design team , ‘ This is the palette , the album cover .
Let this stimulate your conversation . ’ ”
Chance put Towne in contact with the Zappas ’ daughter , Moon ( the voice of “ Valley Girl ” ) , in 2005 .
She played a part in a play that Towne had directed , and he worked up the nerve to ask her about approaching her mother to stage the piece .
“ Gail said he ’d actually meant to have it performed , ” Towne says , but money and time were issues .
“ He could make a . . . lot more money doing rock ‘ n ’ roll . ”
For a piece conceived nearly 30 years ago , it retains a topical immediacy and shock value , producer Franco says .
And what did Zappa see ?
“ Through satire [ he ] showed people what they really were :
You know people right now who are making love to machines , Internet porn ?
We know people like this .
That ’s something that Frank Zappa wrote about in 1979 .

“ The idea of government eavesdropping and mandating the behavior of its citizenry ?
Really , really in play , ” he says .
“ I think he feared that America would turn into a fascistic theocracy , and , lo and behold , we ’re awfully close . ”
While a couple of actors begged off early , saying that some of the content went “ against their religious beliefs , ” casting was n’t the biggest hurdle .
Getting the music down has been the top priority .
“ There was no score , ” Towne says .
“ We had to hire someone to listen to the album and transcribe the whole thing , first for voice and piano so the actors could rehearse . ”
Now they are fine - tuning the seven - piece band and are considering adding a horn section .
There are other splashes of verisimilitude : Franco has secured Carvin amps , the brand Zappa used , and , at press time , he was still trying to find a Stratocaster with a whammy bar .
And still , there is Gail , and her ultimate approval .

“ We ’re trying to be as authentically Frank as possible , ” Towne says .
“ But it ’s complicated music with weird rhythms and odd harmonies .
But it has to be absolutely right because it ’s about the music .
Even though I keep telling everyone that it ’s the show of ‘ Joe ’s Garage , ’ we ’ll get a lot of feedback : I know we ’ll have the Frankophiles . ”

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - More than 500 hot spots have been spotted across Indonesia ’s Sumatra island , signaling the annual dry - season forest fires and the haze it sometimes carries , a Forestry Ministry official said on Monday .
Forestry ministry official fear the number of hot spots could exceed last year ’s record as the current dry season will be marked by less rain than usual , Sonny Partono , the director of forest fire control , told Reuters .
“ According to the Meteorology agency , this year ’s dry season is very dry , not wet like last year .
That ’s the problem , ” Partono said .
“ Looking at the fluctuation of hot spots , this year could be worse than last . ”
Partono said he had recorded 8,000 hot spots since January .
Last year ’s dry season was wetter than usual , resulting in 35,000 hot spots , down from 144,000 in 2006 .
In the past , Indonesia ’s neighbors have grown increasingly frustrated by the annual fires , most of which are deliberately lit by farmers or timber and palm oil plantation companies to clear land for cultivation .
Malaysia ’s Meteorological Department said worsening haze has cut visibility in the busy Malacca strait to below 5 km ( three miles ) and said that it could be dangerous to ships that do not have navigational aids .
A report last year by the World Bank and Britain ’s Department for International Development said Indonesia was among the world ’s top three greenhouse gas emitters because of deforestation and forest fires .
Forest and land fires account for 57 percent of Indonesia ’s non-industrial greenhouse gas emissions , the report said .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Falling stock markets around the globe and the credit crunch are putting the pension funds of some of the largest U.S. companies into deeper financial holes , according to a report released Monday .
Since the credit crunch hit last fall , pension plans funded by S&P 1500 companies have lost about $ 280 billion in assets , according to an actuary at Mercer , a human resources consulting firm .
On paper , the losses from last October tally $ 160 billion .
However , according to Mercer actuary Adrian Hartshorn , the asset losses are closer to $ 280 billion when pension plan assets and liabilities are considered together .
The assets , which totaled roughly $ 1.7 trillion at the end of October 2007 , fell by 17 % , leaving about $ 1.4 trillion in assets at the end of June .
Companies should be concerned , he said , because - assuming no change in the market - a typical U.S. company can expect their pension expenses to increase between 20 % and 30 % in 2009 .
That 's due to the higher cost of servicing the pension plan 's debt and the smaller return from the plan 's assets .
" I think it 's important for corporations to be aware of what 's going on in their pension plans , as corporations would be concerned when any part of its business is performing badly , " Hartshorn said .
According to the report , the total losses on pension assets and liabilities from the last day of 2007 through the end of June has grown to more than $ 80 billion .
Part of the loss has been reflected in companies ' current financial statements , but many losses incurred since the end of 2007 have yet to hit company balance sheets .
The affected pension plans are qualified and non-qualified plans .

Storm will put energy industry 's changes to the test Energy industry 's changes put to test
After building platforms up and reinforcing rigs , companies await Gustav 's verdict
As Hurricane Gustav spun through the heart of the nation 's offshore energy industry Sunday , oil and gas operators braced for the biggest test yet of improvements made in the wake of Katrina and Rita three years ago .
Energy companies at every step in the long supply chain that delivers fuel and power to millions of Americans said they learned the harsh lessons and addressed vulnerabilities exposed by past storms .
Gustav sliced through a region dense with production platforms on its way to Louisiana , although the 115 - mph winds it packed Sunday afternoon were a far cry from the 150 - mph winds it hit Cuba with Saturday .
Once onshore today , the threat becomes heavy winds and rain that could knock out power to critical energy infrastructure , including refineries and pipelines that carry gasoline far and wide .
Port Fourchon , home to the vital Louisiana Offshore Oil Port and many vessels that could be called upon to make repairs at sea , also was in the path .
But energy companies said they are better prepared now to withstand a major storm than they were in 2005 .
" The kind of damage we saw in those storms were a first for many in the industry , " said Steve Baker , spokesman for Colonial Pipeline , which runs from Houston to New York .
" It 's put us in a much better position today . "
Overnight commodities trading in Asia showed some traders were not convinced , but trading later today in Europe showed more faith .
At midday in Europe , light , sweet crude for October delivery was down 77 cents to $ 114.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier in the session , it reached a high of $ 118.25 before retreating ..
The contract slipped 13 cents on Friday to settle at $ 115.46 a barrel .
U.S. trading was closed today for Labor Day .
After hurricanes Ivan in 2004 and Katrina and Rita in 2005 destroyed or severely damaged more than 190 production platforms in the Gulf , oil companies made sweeping changes in traditional platform and drilling rig design , as well as in hurricane forecasting .
Katrina ripped the drilling rig from its clamps on Shell 's Mars platform about 130 miles south of New Orleans and slammed the 1,000 - ton structure back on the deck .
Last year the repaired rig was returned to the platform with stronger , better clamps .
" The clamps that secure the rig to the platform could not stand up to Katrina .
They 've not just been made stronger , it 's a completely different design , " said Frank Glaviano , vice president of Shell Production Americas .
Other improvements included additional mooring lines for floating drilling rigs , many of which came loose in 2005 , damaging seabed pipelines with dragging anchors .
Decks of most fixed platforms near the coastline also have been raised to withstand higher waves , and standards are tighter for securing equipment .
Workers cleared
Several new installations will get their first encounter with a major storm , including the Anadarko - operated Independence Hub , which cranked up more than a year ago and produces 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day , or 2 percent of U.S. gas production .
Other new facilities include a pair from Chevron that just shipped out in recent months .
They were built " in consideration of the kind of storm Katrina was , " Chevron spokesman Mickey Driver said Sunday .
By Sunday , oil and gas companies with offshore facilities in the Gulf including Shell , Chevron , BP , Exxon Mobil and Anadarko Petroleum , had cleared workers from their installations and finished shutting in production by closing valves beneath the seafloor to stop the flow and ensure no leaks .
" It 's a business where you have to start early even when you do n't know what a storm 's going to do , " Glaviano said .
Houston - based Transocean and other offshore drilling contractors also evacuated workers and halted operations at moored rigs while moving other rigs and drillships out of Gustav 's path after disconnecting them from seafloor operations .
Nearly all of the Gulf 's crude oil production and more than 82 percent of its natural gas production had been halted , a government report said Sunday .
Once Gustav comes ashore , companies will fly over their structures to assess damage and ascertain whether they can land helicopters on the helipads .
Glaviano said once officials ensure power and communications aboard installations are working , they can start returning employees to platforms .
Refiners get ready
Onshore energy companies were enacting emergency response plans they said had also been improved since 2005 .
The Gulf Coast is home to 42 percent of the nation 's refining capacity , and several companies had shut down or were shutting down plants in anticipation of Gustav 's arrival .
Energy information provider Platts reported shutdowns that equated to about 2.4 million barrels of U.S. crude refining capacity , or approximately 15 percent .
Valero has multiple cellular phone services at its plants as a safeguard in the event a provider goes down .
The San Antonio - based firm , with refineries in Texas and Louisiana , also has identified workers at other facilities to help bring storm - damaged plants back online and has replaced poles with stronger and deeper - set ones , spokesman Bill Day said .
ConocoPhillips , the nation 's second - largest refiner , strengthened buildings at its Alliance refinery in Belle Chasse , La. , which was damaged in 2005 .
On Sunday , the company was shutting down its Alliance and Lake Charles , La. , facilities .
Exxon Mobil was shutting down its Chalmette , La. , refinery , as was Marathon Oil for its Garyville , La. , plant .
Shell has two base camps to accommodate displaced plant workers , and the company also is keeping giant terminals supplied so it can direct more fuel to regions where residents are evacuating , company spokesman Stan Mays said .
The biggest difference from the company 's pre-2005 storm planning and now ?
" It was n't as proactive , let 's put it that way , " Mays said .

e Bay is having trouble attracting new users
Online auction site eBay has warned that sales will be lower than expected in the current quarter as it struggles against a weakening global economy .
The caution came as eBay posted a rise in net income of $ 460 m ( £ 230.2 m ) over the past three months to June , from $ 376 m a year earlier .
But investors were disappointed by the firm 's prudent outlook , with full - year projections kept unchanged .
The US firm is also battling against trust problems among its users .
Earlier this year , it overhauled its feedback system , banning sellers from leaving negative comments about buyers .
It is currently appealing against a ruling from a French court ordering it to pay 40 m euros to luxury goods giant LVMH , which owns the Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior brands , for allowing online auctions of fake copies of its goods .
Attracting users to its shopping sites is also proving to be difficult .
e Bay said the number of new active users rose by 1 % during the quarter from a year earlier , even as listings increased by 19 % .
" It 's ancient history now , but in past years , investors knew eBay would start out each year conservatively and raise their outlook more and more as each quarter went by , " Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen said .
" What eBay is saying now is , ' We do n't want to go out on a limb , ' " Mr Pyykkonen said .
" The economy is working against them . "
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Water containing a small amount of radiation leaked from a U.S. nuclear - powered submarine that stopped by Japan earlier this year , the U.S. Navy and Japanese government said on Saturday , prompting calls by civic groups for full disclosure .
The leak , which was too small to have any impact on the environment , was found during an inspection of the nuclear - powered Houston in Hawaii , the Japanese Foreign Ministry said , citing information provided by the U.S. government .
“ The amounts were very , very , very small and were not of the sort that would affect the human body or the environment , ” Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference .
The incident comes at a time when the United States has been trying to allay fears over the planned stationing of nuclear - powered aircraft carrier George Washington in Japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear attacks .
A civic group opposed to the deployment of the George Washington said the leak raises doubts about the safety of the U.S. Navy ’s nuclear - powered vessels .
“ The claim ... that the U.S. Navy ’s nuclear - powered vessels are safe and are not susceptible to radiation leaks has completely broken down , ” Masahiko Goto , a lawyer representing the group said in a statement .
Goto called on the U.S. Navy to disclose the causes of the radiation leak and urged the Japanese government to seek complete disclosure .
Many Japanese are sensitive about the use of nuclear power by military forces .
The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki came under nuclear attack from the United States at the end of World War Two in August 1945 .
DRY DOCK
The radiation leak from the Houston came to light after an incident in July , when the submarine was in dry dock , Lieutenant Commander David Benham , spokesman for Commander Submarine Forces , Pacific in Pearl Harbor , said by telephone .
Around a gallon of water that contained a small amount of radioactivity spilled out from a pipe onto a crew member of the Houston , Benham said .
But no contamination was found on the sailor , he said .
It was unclear when the radiation leak had started , and whether there had been any leak while the Houston was in Sasebo in southern Japan from late March to early April , he said .
“ But seeing as we could n’t rule it out , we notified the government of Japan , ” Benham said .
“ It was a very minute amount , and there was never any danger to the reactor of the ship or to the crew of the ship , or for that matter to the public , ” he added .
“ We ’re talking about an extremely minute amount of radiation ... it ’s about half as much radiation as you would find in a 50 pound bag of fertilizer , ” Benham said .
Twenty - four hour radiation monitoring conducted by the Japanese government during the Houston ’s stay in March and April had revealed no irregularities , the Japanese Foreign Ministry said .
The aircraft carrier George Washington is scheduled to arrive in Yokosuka , 45 km ( 28 miles ) southwest of Tokyo , in late September .
A fire broke out on board the nuclear - powered carrier in May , adding to concerns about the ship ’s safety .
The U.S. Navy replaced the George Washington ’s captain after the incident .
Political activist Jay Stone recently sent out a press release seeking recruits for his latest crusade against Mayor Daley .
In it he blasted city officials for awarding a $ 40 million , five - year " pinstripe patronage " contract to Aon Corporation to help the city make sure hiring is free from patronage and political favoritism .
It seems fair to wonder about that deal , as Aon 's founder and retired chairman , Patrick Ryan , is heading up the mayor 's efforts to bring the Olympics to Chicago .
But Stone lost me at the end of the release , when he took a shot at Barack Obama for not having " the courage and conviction to stand up to Mayor Daley " — and then essentially endorsed Senator John McCain for president .
Yet Stone was only putting into writing what I 've been hearing from quite a few Daley haters who claim a vote for Obama is a vote for mayoral tyranny .
It 's time to set them straight .
This year 's presidential election is about a lot of things , but it 's most certainly not a referendum on Daley .
He 'd consolidated his power long before Obama came on the scene , and he 'll hold on to it no matter who wins .
Lord knows
Daley has no long - standing allegiance to Obama — he has n't significantly helped Obama at any stage of his career .
He did n't endorse him during his successful bid for the state senate or his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Congressman Bobby Rush .
He did n't even back him in the 2004 Senate primary .
Daley only endorsed Obama in the presidential campaign because he did n't really have a choice — he had to look enthusiastic about the hometown guy , especially since he did n't want to alienate black voters in last year 's mayoral election .
What 's more , Daley has no problem getting cozy with Republicans .
In fact , Patrick Ryan is a major Republican donor : he 's given more than $ 200,000 to the Illinois GOP over the last few years and hosted a fund - raiser for President Bush at his house in Winnetka .
In the last year Ryan and his wife have donated thousands of dollars to the campaigns of McCain , Rudolph Giuliani , and Mitt Romney — and nothing to Obama .
In 2006 , though , he gave Daley $ 100,000 .
Daley himself all but endorsed Bush in 2004 : he stayed out of the campaign until it was over , at which point he promptly blamed John Kerry and the national Democrats for losing .
On the day after the election , Daley told reporters that the Republicans had become " the party of the people " while the Democrats had been taken over by " Washington elitists " who " do n't like faith - based organizations " or people " who maybe read the Bible or read the Koran . "
His comments would have fit in comfortably with the speeches by Giuliani , Romney , and Sarah Palin at this year 's Republican convention .
Mayor Daley does n't need a Chicago Democrat in the White House to retain his grip on power .
His machine is truly a bipartisan affair .
If you do n't believe me , ask the folks in northwest suburban Bensenville .
One of their Republican state reps , Skip Saviano , and their Republican chairman of the DuPage County Board , Robert Schillerstrom , teamed up with legislators from both parties in the General Assembly to pass a law giving Daley the authority to snatch 15 percent of their town for the O'Hare expansion .
That 's what I call reaching across the aisle .
And none other than the Bush administration financed this land grab with hundreds of millions of federal dollars .
No wonder Mayor Daley took the president out for such a nice dinner in 2006 , when he came to town to celebrate his 60th birthday .
When it comes to approving Daley 's boondoggles , the Bush administration has been nearly as accommodating as the Chicago Plan Commission , the Community Development Commission , or any of the other local oversight boards Daley controls .
And Republicans in Washington have handed over hundreds of millions of dollars for the Brown Line reconstruction and the never - finished underground station at Block 37 .
Am I disappointed that Obama is not as passionately antimachine as , say , I am ?
Absolutely .
But then I 'm just as disappointed in the 70 - plus percent of my fellow Chicago voters who keep on electing our mayor no matter what he does .
And I 'm even more disappointed in our local Republicans , who have deserted their core free - market principals on issue after issue as they fall into line with the mayor .
Our Republicans are tough as nails when it comes to entitlements for the poor — got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and all that — but when it 's time to feed big businesses and developers from Daley 's TIF trough , man , they can't get enough .
Like every other liberal Democrat in this state , Obama had to make a monumental decision when he started his career .
He could fight the machine , join it , or pretend it did n't exist .
He chose the third option , which put him in the company of most of the other liberals around here .
But I 've cut Obama some slack , just as I did Dick Durbin , Paul Simon , Sidney Yates , Paul Douglas , and all the other liberals we 've sent to Washington .
Agreeing to look the other way while the machine does its dirty deeds is part of the deal they make to win a seat in Congress and start working on important national issues .
Lots of Democratic superstars — like Harry Truman and John Kennedy — got their start with the backing of local political machines and went on to bigger and better things .
Put it this way :
There are plenty of other reasons you might want to vote for McCain .
You may want to cut federal funding for public schools and cities , eliminate the distribution of birth control devices to teenagers , or , if Palin gets her way , force women to carry their pregnancies to birth , even if they 're raped .
You may regard homosexuality as a degenerate sin that can be cured by prayer , or you may want to promote creationism alongside evolution in public schools .
Maybe you oppose laws that guarantee women equal pay or compel businesses to follow environmental regulations .
Or you might just be terrified at the thought of a black man getting elected president .
You want to vote Republican , go ahead .
But do n't justify your vote for McCain as a vote against Daley .
You 'll be fooling yourself .

Every few days , ( or hours ) you probably get a friend request of some sort , the good news is , someday , this will not be relevant .
I just got finished watching this video of Renato of “ E ” , a device and software platform that allows you to phsyically gesture in the real world with people you meet that you are friends .
Remember palm pilot back in 2001 that let you ‘ beam ’ contact info to each other ?
Similiar to that , but now with more ‘ social ’ context .
Thinking forward a few years , “ friending people ” whether in Facebook , Plaxo , or will no longer be an activity that we ’ll have to do .
Intelligent websites ( and their data ) will be able to determine who our friends are from our behaviors , context , and preferences , without us verbally ( or physically ) having to indicate so .
Those ‘ bacn ’ messages make it painfully obvious that the ‘ system ’ ( the web , data , and beyond ) is n’t quite intelligent , as it ca n’t determine who our own social contacts are yet .
Like a baby , we ’re teaching the ‘ system ’ our language , how to walk , how to coexist in our real flesh and blood world , the ‘ system ’ is just starting to show intelligence .
One primary example of this is the use of hashtags in Twitter .
We use the # sign to tag content so it ’s easily to organize and find .
That one # character is n’t native to our tongue ( unless when you recite your grocery list and say “ hashtag ” ) it ’s another example of us speaking machine language in order to teach the system .
For example , I started a social experiment on Sunday , where I encouraged folks to tweet related music artists using the tag “ #relatedmusic ” you can see the database form when you search for that term – If we had enough people do this in my –and your– network we ’d be able to build a reference engine that other music reccomendations services could pull from .
Saturday , I posted my thoughts about what ’s next after the social web , and some interesting comments are coming in , take the time to read about it .
For now , I ’m tagging these posts the ‘ Intelligent Web ” as I do n’t really think we ’re there yet , we ’re having to input too much to teach the machine right now .
If you ca n’t see where this is headed , I ’ll tell you : all of what we ’re doing from our clicks , queries , wall posts and tweets is teaching the ‘ system ’ .
In the long run we ’re creating a massive global computer , an artificial intelligence , and someday , a thinking being .
Therefore , when the ‘ system ’ is more mature , we wo n’t have to explicitly state who we ’re friends with anyone –it ’ll have learned and already know .
Phrases to know :
I ’ll refine these over time , but for now , here ’s some early stakes in the ground .
The System :
The system is the combination of all websites combined , it ’s a massive data base of content , clicks , search terms , time on site , shared posts , wall posts , links , and tweets .
Teaching the System : Humans are constantly speaking in machine language , from use of hashtags in twitter , or boolean searches in Google , or even from the act of friending folks in your social network .
All of these behaviors are humans teaching the system how to understand us , so it can better serve us .
The Intelligent Web : Software that is able to collect and make sense of all the data in the system and is able to deliver meaningful content back to people in context –often without us saying or gesturing that we need it .
Update :
This has spun off to more discussions in Friendfeed , I think a lot of folks missed the big idea I was trying to convey here –or perhaps more likely , I did n’t communicate it well .

And he has staked a lot on Sarah Palin .
Voters are unlikely to learn much that is new or surprising about Obama , McCain or Joe Biden over the next two months .
Palin ’s performance as the vice - presidential nominee , on the other hand , is the open and unresolved question of this campaign .
She is , in a way , now the central figure in this fall ’s electoral drama .
If Palin turns out not be up to the challenge for which McCain has selected her , McCain will pay a heavy price .
His judgment about the most important choice he ’s had to make this year will have been proved wanting .
He wo n’t be able to plead that being right about the surge in Iraq should be judged as more important than being right about his vice - presidential pick .
McCain has gambled boldly on Palin .
If she flops , McCain could lose by a landslide .
On the other hand , if Palin exceeds expectations , and her selection ends up looking both bold and wise , McCain could win .
The Palin pick already , as Noemie Emery wrote , “ Wipes out the image of McCain as the crotchety elder and brings back that of the fly - boy and gambler , which is much more appealing , and the genuine person . ”
But of course McCain needs Palin to do well to prove he ’s a shrewd and prescient gambler .
I spent an afternoon with Palin a little over a year ago in Juneau , and have followed her career pretty closely ever since .
I think she can pull it off .
I ’m not the only one .
The day after the V.P. announcement , I spoke with an old friend , James Muller , chairman of the political science department at the University of Alaska , Anchorage .
He said that Palin “ has been underestimated over and over again .
She took on the party and state establishments here in Alaska , and left them reeling .
She ’s a very good campaigner , a quick study and a fighter . ”
Muller called particular attention to her successes in passing an increase to the oil production tax and facilitating the future construction of a huge natural gas pipeline .
“ At first the oil companies thought she was naïve , and they ’d have their way .
Instead she faced them down and forced them to compromise on her terms . ”
Can she face down the Democrats , Joe Biden and the national media over the next couple of months ?
John McCain is betting she can .
Perhaps , as he pondered his vice - presidential selection , he recalled the advice of Margaret Thatcher : “ In politics if you want anything said , ask a man .
If you want anything done , ask a woman . ”

Obama supporter : McCain's Chicago ad full of ' distortions and distractions '
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama 's presidential campaign is accusing Republican John McCain of relying on a campaign of guilt - by - association smears and distracting personal attacks to hide the fact that his " fuzzy " financial proposals would worsen an already devastating economic crisis .
In a new ad , Obama accuses McCain of wanting to apply the same principles that led to the recent Wall Street meltdown to the healthcare industry .
The ad cites a recent article appearing under McCain 's by - line that argues for deregulating the health insurance industry .
" There 's no question that what has happened in the Bush administration -- supported wholeheartedly by Sen. McCain -- has led us to this crisis " in US financial markets , said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , during a conference call sponsored by the Obama campaign Monday .
Sebelius said applying the same principles to healthcare would leave people 's lives at risk and argued that the country could n't afford to risk McCain , who has been putting forward " very fuzzy " proposals on the economy .
For its part , the McCain campaign 's offering to the airwaves Monday dealt with none of the problems facing the country right now .
Instead it painted Obama as a figure " born of the corrupt Chicago machine " and highlighted some corrupt figures his hometown who at one time had tangential connections to the Illinois senator .
Sebelius accused McCain of " continuing the distortions and distractions of trying to defame Sen. Obama with information he knows is untrue . "
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said McCain 's campaign was trying to distract from a new report that his campaign manager earned nearly $ 2 million for overseeing a lobbying campaign on behalf of embattled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
 It 's no coincidence ... the McCain campaign would launch this false , gratuitous attack , " Burton said .
" Barack Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate as an independent Democrat .
He took on the Chicago Democratic organization in a primary to win a seat in the US Senate .
And in both Illinois and Washington , he has challenged the Old Guard for landmark ethics reforms . "
The story of Rick Davis 's inolvement on Fannie and Freddie 's behalf appeared in the New York Times three days after McCain tried to tie Obama to the same companies .
It drew a sharp rebuke from campaign strategist Steve Schmidt , who likely learned his bash - the - press tactics from mentor Karl Rove .
" We are first amendment absolutists on this campaign , " he said during a conference call .
" Of course , it is constitutionally protected with regard to writing whatever they want to write .
Let 's be clear and be honest with each other .
Whatever the New York Times once was , it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization . "

Looks like they were testing the top speed of the car .
Yes , from the front it looks cute and good , but from the rear , not good looking ?
But looks are subjective .
My overall observations are :
1 ) Engine has sufficient grunt .
2 ) Although physical stance is not the correct parameter to decide / comment on ground clearence by any stretch of imagination , this car seems to have good ground clearence .
3 ) Looks good from front ( as good as Swift for me ) .
Only Matiz looked better .
( This is limited to me as looks are quite subjective ) .
4 ) Although I appreciate the effort , taking shots while driving in not safe and not advisable .
EDIT : @ Byzanram :
Which car you were in ?
We can get a better idea about speed after considering the speedo error .
Thanks aaggoswami !
Well , none of these pictures are taken by me .
They have been clicked by my dear wife , who was sitting beside me in my Honda City !
BTW
I am extremely careful about safety and road sense .
Would never in life drive and take photos or for that matter even use my mobile phone while driving !!

Sen .
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska became the nation 's most prominent Republican officeholder to publicly question whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has the experience to serve as president .
" She does n't have any foreign policy credentials , " Hagel said in an interview published Thursday by the Omaha World - Herald .
" You get a passport for the first time in your life last year ?
I mean , I do n't know what you can say . "
Could Palin lead the country if GOP presidential nominee John McCain could not ?
" I think it 's a stretch to , in any way , to say that she 's got the experience to be president , " he said .
McCain and other Republicans have defended Palin 's qualifications , citing Alaska 's proximity to Russia .
Palin told ABC
News , " They 're our next - door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska . "
Hagel took issue with that .
" I think they ought to be just honest about it and stop the nonsense about , ' I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something about Russia , ' " he said .
" That kind of thing is insulting to the American people . "
Hagel , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
PALIN'S HUSBAND REFUSES TO TESTIFY
Palin's husband has refused to testify in the ethics investigation of his wife , and a key lawmaker said Thursday that uncooperative witnesses are effectively sidetracking the inquiry until after Election Day .
Todd Palin , who participates in state business in person or by e-mail , was among 13 people subpoenaed by the Alaska Legislature .
McCain - Palin presidential campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said Thursday that Todd Palin would not appear , because he no longer believes the investigation is legitimate .
In the past year both Google and Facebook have released the remote procedure call ( RPC ) technologies that are used for communication between servers within their data centers as Open Source projects .
Facebook
Thrift allows you to define data types and service interfaces in a simple definition file .
Taking that file as input , the compiler generates code to be used to easily build RPC clients and servers that communicate seamlessly across programming languages .
It supports the following programming languages ; C++ , Java , Python , PHP and Ruby .
Google Protocol Buffers allows you to define data types and service interfaces in a simple definition file .
Taking that file as input , the compiler generates code to be used to easily build RPC clients and servers that communicate seamlessly across programming languages .
It supports the following programming languages ; C++ , Java and Python .
That ’s interesting .
Did n’t Steve Vinoski recently claim that RPC and it 's descendants are " fundamentally flawed " ?
If so , why are Google and Facebook not only using RPC but proud enough of their usage of yet another distributed object RPC technology based on binary protocols that they are Open Sourcing them ?
Did n’t they get the memo that everyone is now on the REST + JSON / XML bandwagon ( preferrably AtomPub ) ?
In truth , Google is on the REST + XML band wagon .
Google has the Google Data APIs ( GData ) which is a consistent set of RESTful APIs for accessing data from Google 's services based on the Atom Publishing Protocol aka RFC 5023 .
And even Facebook has a set of plain old XML over HTTP APIs ( POX / HTTP ) which they incorrectly refer to as the Facebook REST API .
So what is the story here ?
It is all about coupling and how much control you have over the distributed end points .
On the Web where you have little to no control over who talks to your servers or what technology they use , you want to utilize flexible technologies that make no assumptions about either end of the communication .
This is where RESTful XML - based Web services shine .
However when you have tight control over the service end points ( e.g. if they are all your servers running in your data center ) then you can use more optimized communications technologies that add a layer of tight coupling to your system .
An example of the kind of tight coupling you have to live with is that Facebook Thrift requires specific versions of g++ and Java if you plan to talk to it using code written in either language and you ca n’t talk to it from a service written in C# .
In general , the Web is about openness and loose coupling .
Binary protocols that require specific programming languages and runtimes are the exact opposite of this .
However inside your Web service where you control both ends of the pipe , you can optimize the interaction between your services and simplify development by going with a binary RPC based technology .
More than likely different parts of your system are already doing this anyway ( e.g. memcached uses a binary protocol to talk between cache instances , SQL Server uses TDS as the communications protocol between the database and it's clients , etc ) .
Always remember to use the right tool for the job .
One size does n’t fit all when it comes to technology decisions .

Exposing a WCF Service With Multiple Bindings and Endpoints – Keith Elder describes how Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF ) supports multiple bindings that enable developers to expose their services in a variety of ways .
A developer can create a service once and then expose it to support net.tcp :// or http :// and various versions of http:// ( Soap1.1 , Soap1.2 , WS* , JSON , etc ) .
This can be useful if a service crosses boundaries between the intranet and the Internet .

According to the study performed by the University of Sussex , music can calm much better if it is played by real musicians rather than computers .
Neuroscientists analyzed the reaction of the brain to the piano sonatas , which were played by a musician and a computer .
They discovered that , though computerized music did get some response from the brain – mainly to unpredicted changes of the chords – the effect was not as strong as the response to the same melody played by a professional pianist .
Dr. Stefan Koelsch , a senior research fellow in psychology , was the one to lead the research , being supported by his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences , located in Leipzig .
The scientists played a number of extracts from classical piano sonatas to 20 people , who were not professional musicians , and made records of the brain responses , as well as reactions of the skin conductance , which fluctuate with sweat production as a result of emotional reaction .
Despite the fact that the participants did not have any experience in playing musical instruments and considered themselves to be unmusical , their brains had a clear reaction to musical changes ( including unexpected chords and modifications in tonal key ) .
Such reactions show that the brain was able to understand musical grammar .
The reaction of the brain was much sharper when the classical piano sonatas were played by professional musicians .
" It was interesting for us that the emotional reactions to the unexpected chords were stronger when played with musical expression .
This shows us how musicians can enhance the emotional response to particular chords due to their performance , and it shows us how our brains react to the performance of other individuals , " mentioned Dr. Koelsch .
During the study the researchers were also able to discover that when a classic composition was played by a real musician , human brain was more likely to search for musical meaning .
" This is similar to the response we see when the brain is responding to language and working out what the words mean .
Our results suggest that musicians actually tell us something when they play .
The brain responses show that when a pianist plays a piece with emotional expression , the piece is actually perceived as meaningful by listeners , even if they have not received any formal musical training , " said Dr. Koelsch .

Oh those silly Republicans , trying to show how seriously they take their job to represent their oil lobbyist buddies constituents by repeating the shenanigans of Friday .
We 've got Roy Blunt castigating the 110th Congress for not passing an appropriations bill , and yet here Congress is , trying to get a veterans ' appropriations bill passed and there goes the Republicans , playing games .
The Republicans ' unsuccessful attempt to derail the veterans bill comes after President Bush threatened to veto the legislation over excessive spending on veterans and our troops and after Senate Republicans blocked the National Defense Authorization Act in the Senate over the same issue .
The House did pass the FY 2009 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill , H.R. 6599 despite the Republican obstruction .
This bill provides another much - needed funding increase for veterans ' care ( 11 percent more than last year and $ 2.9 billion more than the President 's request ) - building on last year 's largest ever increase in the 77 - year history of the Veterans ' Administration .
All of the major veterans groups endorse the measure .
As Chairman Edwards explained , Veterans ' organizations also called for its swift passage : " we urge that no impediments are put in its way and that its passage can come quickly and smoothly .
The issues in this bill ... are not controversial , and they have broad bipartisan support .
Attaching non-germane issues to the veterans funding bill that serve to delay or block passage would truly be wrong . "
[ VFW , 7/25/08 ]
Nonetheless , Republicans attempted to derail the bill by attaching drilling provisions that would destroy some of the nations most pristine areas forever in exchange for savings of only pennies per gallon more than 15 years from now , according to President Bush 's own Energy Department .
The provisions , however , would provide billions of dollars in profits for the oil industry .
Josh Nelson breaks down exactly how far $ 2,228,995 goes with some members of Congress .
I do n't know how long it will last , but there 's a YouTube up of their shenanigans on Friday .

As a computer journalist for the last 25 years , I 've received a lot of review copies of software .
As something of an obsessive magpie , I 've tended to keep most of it , “ for reference ” .
Until yesterday , that is , when I finally threw out all those copies of OS / 2 , Lotus SmartSuite , and my entire collection of Microsoft software .
This included Windows NT 3.5 , Windows 2000 , Microsoft Office and many , many more .
What 's makes this little spring - cleaning exercise particularly apt as well as cathartic is that all of us - and not just me - may finally be witnessing the end of the Windows era .
The most obvious manifestation of this has been the utter fiasco that is Vista .
This is not so much things like the recent security hole in Vista 's memory protection , which may or may not be a big deal – although if Bruce Schneier sees it as a real problem , then I think Microsoft 's probably in trouble .
No , it 's the fact that however Microsoft tries to spin the numbers , Vista is simply not catching on .
The company can try all the marketing tricks it likes , but customers are voting with their wallets by opting for the “ downgrade ” to XP :
An official at PC maker Hewlett - Packard said the majority of the company 's business customers are downgrading new computers from Windows Vista to Windows XP -- raising questions about Microsoft 's Vista sales figures .
Another tell - tale sign that the days of Windows as we know it are drawing to a close are the increasing number of stories about Midori :
Microsoft is incubating a componentized non-Windows operating system known as Midori , which is being architected from the ground up to tackle challenges that Redmond has determined cannot be met by simply evolving its existing technology .
SD Times has viewed internal Microsoft documents that outline Midori ’s proposed design , which is Internet - centric and predicated on the prevalence of connected systems .
Midori is an offshoot of Microsoft Research ’s Singularity operating system , the tools and libraries of which are completely managed code .
Midori is designed to run directly on native hardware ( x86 , x64 and ARM ) , be hosted on the Windows Hyper - V hypervisor , or even be hosted by a Windows process .
That is , we may be looking at a complete dicontinuity in the Windows line – a recognition that the creaking software architecture that has been around for over a decade now is simply too broken to be fixed .
There are a number of straws in the wind indicating that Windows no longer provides the benchmark for desktop computing .
The continuing rise in popularity of Apple 's machines is a clear indication that more people are looking beyond Microsoft , something that was reflected in Mark Shuttleworth 's recent exhortation to the free software community :
" The great task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the Linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty , into something that is art , " Shuttleworth said to applause from the audience .
" Can we not only emulate , but can we blow right past Apple ? "
Quite correctly , Shuttleworth sees Apple as the one to beat these days .
The traditional desktop experience is being further redefined through the move to cloud computing solutions , which are frequently browser - based , and the appearance of GNU / Linux - based ultraportables , which also draw on Net - based solutions for much of their convenience .
Both make the underlying operating system moot .
And as if that were n't enough , there 's yet another interesting approach that could have a substantial impact on people 's perception of free software – and of Windows .
The Splashtop technology uses GNU / Linux as a kind of pre-operating system that lets users boot up very quickly to gain Internet access and perform key tasks such as checking email or moving around the Web .
Strikingly , some of Splashtop 's key advantages are essentially reactions to two of Windows ' problems – speed and security :
Be online seconds after you turn on your PC .
Why wait for Windows to load when you could be surfing the web right away !
Surf the Web safely , immune from the malware that targets Windows .
What started out as a cool , but rather marginal , idea has now started gain momentum .
First , it was announced that Asus motherboards would be offering the feature , and then Asus notebooks .
In a sure sign that the approach is entering the mainstream , now Dell has joined the club :
Dell ’s Latitude
On works by bypassing the Windows operating system so that you get immediate access to things like your calendar , email , Internet , and contacts .
It ’s a fully integrated technology that will appear later this year on the Dell 4200 and 4300 Latitude series notebooks , and is powered by a Linux OS , sort of as a secondary operating system .
What this means is that users of these systems , even when rigorously Windows - based , will be experiencing the power and speed of GNU / Linux , albeit unwittingly , when they use this mode .
Even if they do n't know it 's GNU / Linux , they will certainly be aware that it is not Windows .
Moreover , if the idea proves popular , it 's not hard to imagine most PC manufacturers following suit in order to match Dell 's move , ensuring that many more people experience the fact that it is possible to use a PC without using Windows .
That is the key breakthrough .
At the moment , there is a widespread if tacit assumption that desktop computing * is* Windows .
This is manifest most clearly in schools , where teaching computing really means teaching children how to use Windows and Office .
Once people realise they have a choice , then Windows ' stranglehold on the desktop market will be fatally loosened .
For many years , people in the free software world have dreamed of a day when GNU / Linux would replace Windows on the desktop .
Although the market share of GNU / Linux there is finally lifting – figures range from 3 % to 11 % , according to the sector – it seems unlikely that GNU / Linux will ever take over the desktop from Windows .
But that does not mean that Windows will maintain its dominance there , simply that the future is more complex than the monoculture we have seen and suffered for nearly two decades .
I would like to suggest that the free software world should start looking at things from a different perspective – not how many percentage points GNU / Linux gains on the desktop , but how many Microsoft is losing to * all* of the alternatives to Windows .
Free software has nothing to fear from a heterogeneous environment – indeed , mixing technologies almost forces open standards upon manufacturers if they want to provide full interoperability .
Moreover , as many have pointed out , the low number of GNU / Linux viruses is only in part down to the latter 's superior design .
If GNU / Linux became as dominant on the desktop as Windows , there would be a greater incentive to break that security – and a bigger knock - on effect when it was broken .
Far better to promote heterogeneity , which is good for the software ecosystem , and thus good for * all* users .
Against this background , then , we should be celebrating what looks increasingly like the end of the Windows era on the desktop , but not in the naïve , and slightly selfish hope that it will usher in one purely based on GNU / Linux .
One of the best proofs that free software is superior in all senses to proprietary software is having the maturity to recognise that the world of personal computing today is far more complicated , and far richer , than Bill Gates 's original , monopolistic vision of “ a ( Microsoft - based ) computer on every desktop ” .

“ I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rule of law and defeat this bill , ” Senator Russ Feingold , Democrat of Wisconsin , said Wednesday as the outcome was all but assured .
The final plan , which overhauls the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed by Congress in 1978 in the wake of Watergate , reflected both political reality and legal practicality , supporters said .
Wiretapping orders approved by secret orders under the previous version of the surveillance law were set to begin expiring in August unless Congress acted .
Heading into their political convention in Denver next month and on to the November Congressional elections , many Democrats were wary of handing the Republicans a potent political weapon .
The issue put Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , in a particularly precarious spot .
He had long opposed giving legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in the N.S.A. ’s wiretapping program , even threatening a filibuster during his run for the nomination .
But on Wednesday , he ended up voting for what he called “ an improved but imperfect bill ” after backing a failed attempt earlier in the day to strip the immunity provision from the bill through an amendment .
Mr. Obama ’s decision last month to reverse course angered some ardent supporters , who organized an Internet drive to influence his vote .
And his position came to symbolize the continuing difficulties that Democrats have faced in striking a position on national security issues even against a weakened president .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Democrat of New York , who had battled Mr. Obama for the nomination , voted against the bill .
Senator John McCain , the likely Republican presidential nominee , was campaigning in Ohio and did not vote , though he has consistently supported the immunity plan .
Support from key Democrats ensured passage of the measure .
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV , the West Virginia Democrat who leads the intelligence committee and helped broker the deal , said modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act was essential to give intelligence officials the technology tools they need to deter another attack .
But he said the plan “ was made even more complicated by the president ’s decision , in the aftermath of Sept. 11 , 2001 , to go outside of FISA rather than work with Congress to fix it . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Georgian businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili , who feared assassination and faced accusations of plotting a coup in his homeland , has died in Britain and British police are treating his death as suspicious .
Police said checks had found no radioactive traces on Patarkatsishvili ’s body or at his home .
Former Russian spy and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko died in November 2006 after being poisoned with radioactive polonium in London .
Georgian public television said Patarkatsishvili , who was a critic of President Mikhail Saakashvili and ran against him in a presidential election last month , had died of a heart attack at his mansion near London .
But a source close to Patarkatsishvili said the 52 - year - old billionaire had feared for his life and allies in the former Soviet republic called for an international inquiry .
Police said they had referred the case to a major crime investigation team .
An ambulance was called to his secluded mansion late on Tuesday after Patarkatsishvili had entertained a large number of friends and family , police said .
“ As far as I know from his relatives , it was his heart , ” exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky , a friend and business partner , said by telephone .
Patarkatsishvili had lived in Britain since late last year , when Georgian authorities accused him of plotting a coup against the president and issued a warrant for his arrest .
He ran as a candidate in Georgia ’s presidential election on January 5 and won about 7 percent of votes , but did not campaign in his homeland for fear of detention .
“ His death is a big loss for our country .
I know he wanted to do a lot of good things for Georgia , ” Eduard Shevardnadze , a former Georgian president and Soviet foreign minister , said .
Patarkatsishvili showed no signs of illness at a meeting in London on Tuesday , someone who attended the meeting said .
“ As the result of initial work by experts there is no suggestion of anything radioactive involved , ” a police spokeswoman said on Wednesday .
Patarkatsishvili ’s body has been taken to a hospital for a post- mortem and results are not expected until Thursday .

LEGAL CHARGES
Georgian government officials declined comment on the death .
Rati Shartava , a Tbilisi - based aide to Patarkatsishvili , said his death was triggered by legal charges brought by the government , Russia ’s Interfax agency reported .

“ The state machine fought him and his heart gave in , ” Shartava said .
Western powers watch developments in Georgia closely .
It lies on the route of an oil pipeline in a strategic region bordering Turkey and Russia , and is at the heart of a tussle for influence between Moscow and new allies in the West .
Patarkatsishvili made his fortune in Russia during the 1990s in association with Berezovsky .
Following Georgia ’s election , which the opposition said was rigged and on which Western monitors gave a mixed verdict , a Georgian court seized his television station and other assets .
Georgian authorities blamed Patarkatsishvili and his Imedi television station for stirring protests against Saakashvili in Tbilisi last November , the biggest challenge to the pro-Western president since he took power in 2003 .
The protests were crushed when Saakashvili sent in riot police to fire rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators .
Opposition leaders said the protests were triggered by anger at corruption and poverty .
Patarkatsishvili accused Saakashvili , who promoted an image abroad of a modern , pro-Western leader , of pushing his country into dictatorship .
Orthogonal Viewer
7 September 2008
On the flight out east I threw two previously published projects together to form something new .
You 've probably seen the animations of my brain and the JavaScript BMP library .
So the next step is to reformat the MRI data into a compact JavaScript data structure , then render it on the fly inside a web browser .
I 'm rather shocked at how well it runs under Firefox 3 and Chrome ( Yay , I can finally start mentioning Chrome ! ) , while Opera and Safari do an acceptable job of it .
Once again , IE is the boat anchor that keeps dragging web applications back .
If you have a fast connection , load the Orthogonal MRI Viewer .
Be patient , it 's got 12 MB of data to download .
If someone can come up with a decent yaw / pitch / traverse control that translates to a plane formula ( such as : ax + by + cz = d ) , this viewer could render arbitrarily angled slices , not just orthogonal ones .
The biggest stumbling block I encountered was the data compression .
It turns out that the JavaScript literal string notation for the null character ( \0 ) must be avoided when encoding arbitrary data .
If this notation is followed by a number , the result is parsed as one octal character .
E.g. ' \012 ' means the linefeed character ( %0A ) , not the null character ( %00 ) followed by ' 1 ' and ' 2 ' .
A somewhat nasty ambiguity to identify when buried within a 12 MB data stream .
Flying back west proved interesting .
The US border agent ( stationed within the Ottawa airport ) tried cross-referencing my H1 - B visa with his database .
A sensible check , since otherwise you could just Photoshop your visas .
Sadly , my visa was n't listed in his five databases .
At this point I was detained and brought into a back office for further processing .
The stamps in my passport certainly looked genuine , and my employer looked vaguely reputable .
So as a last resort , the agent pulled up a list of all H1 - B visas granted , in chronological order , and started scanning through the list for " FRASER " .
Page after page , each screen - full containing ten names .
Next .
Next .
Next .
After an hour of this stunningly boring chore , he finally found my entry .
With a quick stamp , he approved my re-entry to the US -- ten minutes after my plane had departed .
In fairness , I can understand the problem .
I mean , their database has literally THOUSANDS of entries .
That quantity of data would overwhelm any imaginable computer system .
Clearly the only scalable approach is a visual search .
However , they really ought to look into using pigeons .

Cool Earth Solar Constructing First Solar " Balloon " Prototype Plant
September 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
We ’ve written about Livermore , CA - based startup Cool Earth Solar before .
Now the company , which develops inflatable balloon - like solar concentrators , has announced that it is constructing a prototype plant in Livermore .
Last week , I spoke to Cool Earth Solar CEO Rob Lamkin to get some more information on the upcoming project .
According to Lamkin , the prototype plant will be online in approximately two months .
The company plans to test out different solar concentrator designs at the plant to prove out the technology .
This winter , Cool Earth will launch its first commercial - grade power plant .
The plant will be relatively small — only 1.4 MW — but Cool Earth plans on launching a full - size plant ( 10 to 30 MW ) by next summer .
If the prototype plant is successful , Cool Earth wants to expand far beyond the Livermore area .
“ Initially , we ’ll be be doing projects in California and the Southwest , but we do want to expand overseas , ” Lamkin said .
“ To address the global energy problem , we ’ve got to scale bigtime worldwide . ”
Cool Earth Solar ’s design is unique in the solar energy world .
The company uses an inflatable plastic thin - film balloon ( solar concentrator ) that , upon inflation , focuses sunlight onto a photovoltaic cell held at its focal point .
The design produces 400 times the electricity that a solar cell would create without the company ’s concentrator .
Additionally , Cool Earth ’s balloons are already price - competitive with natural gas - derived electricity .
“ Plastic thin film is abundant and cheap , ” said Lamkin .
“ It only costs two dollars for the plastic material necessary for our solar concentrator . ”
Keep watching Cool Earth Solar —
I have a feeling that this company will become a household name in the near future .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government agreed to rescue insurer American International Group with an $ 85 billion loan from the New York Federal Reserve to stave off a bankruptcy that would have thrown world markets back into turmoil .
KEY POINTS :
* The U.S. Federal Reserve will extend AIG $ 85 billion in exchange for a nearly 80 percent stake to bail it out , the Fed said in a statement .
* The deal averts the largest corporate bankruptcy ever .
COMMENTS :
LIM TAE - GEUN , MARKET ANALYST , DAEWOO SECURITIES , SEOUL
“ Shares are recouping yesterday ’s massive losses and it also helped that the U.S. government is seen providing lifeline to AIG .
“ Eyes are on U.S. financial markets as investors continue to be concerned about its ripple effects to the real economy and higher risk premium on emerging markets .
Stocks are cheap , but investors are waiting for the signs of some sort of stability on Wall Street . ”
CALLUM HENDERSON , CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT STANDARD CHARTERED BANK , SINGAPORE :
“ Markets are trying to find a floor given the latest events and headlines out of the US , which may help to support sentiment if they accurate .
“ Asian equity markets are generally higher on the back of the slightly stronger close to the Dow .
In line with this , many Asian currencies have come off their lows .
“ The bigger question is whether or not this will change the economic outlook for Asia - and the answer to that is clearly no .
So any rally in Asian currencies is going to be temporary and the more important level is going to be at what level do you sell them ? ”
KOICHI HAJI , CHIEF ECONOMIST , NLI RESEARCH INSTITUTE
“ Rescuing AIG itself is a good thing , but we ’re seeing a double - standard here .
Why is the Fed helping AIG but not Lehman ?
Unless U.S. authorities come up with a clear standard on who to help and who not to , market unrest will continue .
“ Investors are becoming very risk - averse .
They do n’t want to get into trouble .
We ’ll likely see market turbulence for some time .
Japanese investors will continue repatriating money from abroad .
“ The biggest worry for Japan ’s economy is a possible surge in the yen , or a sharp dollar decline .
If confidence in the dollar erodes , we might see the dollar plunge and once that happens , it ’s hard to control it .
A joint currency intervention by the United States , Japan and euro zone to stem dollar falls then becomes a possibility . ”
TAKAO HATTORI , SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST , MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES
“ There is still doubt about how soon markets will stabilize ...
The flames surrounding securities firms leapt across to an insurer .
But if they can avoid a crisis , the move could lead to a certain level of market stability .
“ Still , I think the problem in U.S. financial markets will likely stay for a while . ”
AKITO FUKUNAGA , FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST , CREDIT SUISSE , TOKYO :
“ This removes the near - term risk of a collapse ( of AIG ) and is a negative factor for bonds .
“ But when taking a more longer term view , it is not as if a recovery in the global economic cycle is coming into sight .
While worries about the financial system may abate for now , the weakness of the real economy still lies at the root .
“ So I do not think this will lead to endless buying of equities or of selling of bonds . ”
JUNKO NISHIOKA , ECONOMIST , RBS SECURITIES , TOKYO
“ The entity in question is a large insurer and the decision reflects expectations that such an institution should not be allowed to fail .
But uncertainty towards the financial sector is likely to remain and continue to expose the markets to downside risks .
That said , the Federal Reserve has shown that it is willing to go to great lengths .
Its decision to stand pat on monetary policy yesterday reflects such a stance as the current financial crisis cannot be solved by shifting interest rates . ”
YASUNARI UENO , CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST , MIZUHO SECURITIES , TOKYO
“ If the Federal Reserve is to provide support to AIG , that would give a sense of security to investors , boosting share prices while prompting a sell - off of bonds , even if it does n’t cost taxpayers money .
“ Following the case of Lehman Brothers , I think the U.S. authorities will likely provide some safety net but the question will be how far the Fed could shoulder the risk of losses or whether it would only take stop - gap measures .
“ If Fed does n’t provide a rescue , stock prices will plunge and bond prices will ascend ...
It will be a total mess . ”
MASARU HAMASAKI , SENIOR STRATEGIST AT TOYOTA ASSET MANAGEMENT , TOKYO
“ The news is a relief , putting a stop to the worsening situation for now .
“ Insurers have their own assets unlike brokers , and if they went bankrupt and had to liquidate their assets , which are immense , the impact could have destroyed the market . ”
PETER HILTON , HEAD OF ASIA EQUITY RESEARCH , ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND , HONG KONG :
“ You will probably see some relief today because there were calls going into affiliate offices in Asia and people were a bit worried about their effective savings .
So relieving that pressure helps some .
“ I expect the markets will be a bit better today but that ’s after a very rough period . ”
CHRIS ORNDORFF , MANAGING PRINCIPAL , PAYDEN & RYGEL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT , LOS ANGELES :
“ The Federal Reserve obviously thought the systemic risk from a major insurance company was too great to let go .
Remember , AIG not only does major business with Wall Street and the financial markets but also Main Street , ” said Orndorff , whose funds hold both AIG shares and bonds .
“ That is why the Fed stepped in .
It would have been disruptive , in no uncertain terms , if AIG went bankrupt . ”
DAN FUSS , VICE CHAIRMAN , LOOMIS SAYLES , BOSTON :
“ Thank God !
AIG is interwoven with so many people and touches many companies around the world .
If AIG had gone belly up , you would have an unknown , humongous number of default swaps cut off .
What would that lead to ?
We were already approaching some market disruption .
The credit markets in the U.S. were frozen this morning .
The liquidity in the corporate bond market , not junk bonds but investment grade , was zero .
This is a huge relief to many parts of the financial markets . ”
MARKET REACTION :
STOCKS : U.S. equity index futures rose , pointing to gains for Wall Street come Wednesday morning .
Stocks in Asia rose as well .
BONDS : U.S. Treasuries dropped in Asian trading as a flight - to - safety bid that had powered their recent rally faded .
CURRENCIES :
The dollar pushed higher against the yen .
There is a portion of Police and Elvis Costello devotees who have single - mindedly followed both artists ' careers through three decades , tenaciously collecting each cherished release and carefully housing them in clear vinyl slipcases .
There 's also a large contingent of mutual casual fans — the ones who will probably attend the artists ' concerts and yell for " Roxanne " and " Pump It Up " all night and get worked up that " they keep playing all this other shit instead . "
And there are the Gen - Xers who pine for the punk rock that actually scared people and want to see alumni from the Class of ' 77 before they pass into the ether and do an American Express commercial .
No matter our divergent paths from the vaunted " early punk " days of the Police and Elvis Costello , we must all know the truth :
Sting and Elvis Costello were never really punks .
Info Sting Cricket Wireless Pavilion The Police , and Elvis Costello and the Imposters are scheduled to perform on Saturday , May 24 .
Rather than blurt out the rest of the bad news — that Sting and Costello were about as punk as Henry Winkler was the Fonz — let 's make a little game of it .
We 'll start each man off with five safety pins , because they did their share of punk gigs , where the phlegm flowed freely .
For every display of punkish pride , we 'll award a safety pin , but we 'll take one away if we sense anything your card - carrying , leather lapel - pinned punk might deem a " sellout . "
1977 : English school teacher Gordon Sumner ( minus one safety pin ) , nicknamed " Sting " ( +1 ) by jazz musicians ( - 1 ) , forms a band with Stewart Copeland , son of a CIA chief ( - 1 ) and drummer for prog rock outfit Curved Air ( - 1 ) , and Andy Summers , who played in Eric Burdon & the New Animals , during those final years when they sang eight - minute songs about girls named after tabs of acid ( - 1 ) .
Desperate for money , Sting and his charges dye their hair blond and impersonate punks for a Wrigley gum commercial .
While this proves they are bogus punks , the Sex Pistols proved that nothing 's more punk rock than taking the money and running ( +1 ) .
British pub rocker Declan MacManus Costello is fortuitosly rechristened Elvis by his manager shortly before the King of Rock ' n '
Roll falls off his throne in Graceland during one last pharmaceutical poop .
Stiff Records immediately prints up more " Elvis is King " stickers ( +1 ) .
Ready - to - gig Costello forms the Attractions with ex-pub rocker Pete Thomas and classically trained pianist Steve Nieve ( - 1 ) .
Bassist Bruce Thomas says at the audition that his dream gig would be Steely Dan .
He becomes the bassist anyway ( - 1 ) .
1978 : The first Sting composition to chart in the U.K. , " I Can't Stand Losing You , " is banned by the BBC for being about suicide , a point made all too clear by the single 's cover , a picture of Stewart Copeland with a noose around his head while standing on a block of melting ice ( +1 ) .
When The Police give their first two albums French names , they subconsciously endear themselves to fans of Plastic Bertrand ( +1 ) .
Costello and the Attractions are booked as a last - minute replacement for the visa - troubled Sex Pistols on Saturday Night Live ( - 1 ) .
Costello decides to perform " Radio Radio , " a song that had n't been cleared with the network censors .
The stunt gets them banned from SNL for 10 years — which was a blessing because , unlike Costello , the show would suck for most of those 10 years ( +1 ) .
1979 : The Police 's " Message in a Bottle " incorporates the calypso phrasing of Harry Belafonte 's " Day - O " and " Star - O " by creating new nouns such as " sea-o , " " me-o , " and " despair -o . "
Politically correct even then , Sting is careful to withhold the 15th letter of the alphabet in the final verse , ensuring that a hundred billion castaways are not looking for a home - o ( - 1 ) .
Costello says , " Somebody should clip Sting around the head and tell him to stop using that ridiculous Jamaican accent . "
Jah , mon ! ( +1 ) .
On his antagonistic Armed Forces tour , Costello manages to enrage hippies like Bonnie Bramlett and Stephen Stills ( +2 ) and fans who complain about being shortchanged by Costello 's 45 - minute sets with no encores and blasts of ear - splitting feedback to clear the hall out .
This tribute to German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen 's 1966 piece " Solo for a melody instrument with feedback " goes unrecognized and is instead viewed as the snarky actions of a bratty pop star ( +2 ) .
1982 : Sting has a surprise solo hit , reaching back to the boring ' 20s for " Spread a Little Happiness , " from an old English musical , Mr. Cinders . ( - 1 )
With Imperial Bedroom , Costello makes further inroads into orchestral pop ( - 1 ) .
During this time , Costello is frequently photographed smiling and more than ever inclined to mention George and Ira Gershwin in interviews ( - 1 for each Gershwin ) .

1985 : Oh , yeah ?
Miles Davis , a jazz musician as punk as you can find , enlists Sting to make a vocal appearance on his album You 're Under Arrest ( - 1 ) .
Sting proves his credential as a jazz musician by raiding Wynton Marsalis ' band for players and driving a wedge between Wynton and his brother Branford ( - 1 ) .
The same year , he appears on records by Arcadia , Dire Straits , Hal Wilner , and Band Aid .
To Sting 's credit , on " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? , " he sings the line about " the bitter Sting of tears " with a completely straight face ( - 1 ) .
1987 : Costello begins a songwriting collaboration with Paul McCartney , the man whom Glen Matlock got kicked out of the Sex Pistols for liking ( - 1 ) .
1991 : Sting beats Costello to the classical music label Deutsche Grammophon by 10 years with his recital of Peter and the Wolf ( - 1 ) .
Punks , resist the urge to call this a Deutsche bag !
1996 : Costello teams with Burt Bacharach on " God Give Me Strength , " and the pair write a whole album together in 1998 , infuriating the network of Dionne Warwick psychic friends who felt she should 've gotten a crack at these songs first ( - 1 ) .
1999 : Sting 's chart fortunes are back on the rise with " Desert Rose " a song he collaborates on with Algerian - born raï singer Cheb Mami ( - 1 ) , a man who is currently under an international arrest warrant after being indicted in October 2006 for " voluntary violence , sequestration and threats " against an ex-girlfriend , and failing to answer a court summons ( +1 ) .

The obesity epidemic may be linked to high worldwide rates of gum disease , according to a new study conducted by researchers at Boston University and published in the journalResearchers wrapped a material that had been infused with P. gingivalis , a bacteria that causes gum disease , around the gums of both obese mice and mice of normal weight .
They found that the obese mice had more bone loss than the leaner mice , indicating a more severe form of gum disease .
They also had higher levels of P. gingivalis in their mouths , and lower levels of certain immune system chemicals that the body produces to help fight off infections .
" These data indicate that obesity interferes with the ability of the immune system to appropriately respond to P. gingivalis infection , " the researchers wrote .
They noted that the generalized immune system suppression seen in the obese mice might indicate that obese people are more vulnerable to bacterial infections in general than people of healthier weight .
Periodontal disease is incredibly common , affecting approximately 40 percent of adults around the world .
" The importance of the current findings is underscored by the facts that millions of people worldwide are affected by this infection every year , " the researchers said , " and the universal prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions .
" Another recent study may also link gum disease to obesity .
Researchers at the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom have discovered a connection between Type 2 diabetes , which is often correlated with obesity , and severe forms of gum disease " We found that periodontal disease was often of the more aggressive form in patients with diabetes , " researcher John Taylor said .
" It is possible that obesity may be compromising the immune response , leading to increased susceptibility to periodontal disease . "

Breaking News : Guerrillas in western Afghanistan deployed a roadside bomb to kill 4 US Marines on Saturday .
Pushtun guerrillas mounting an insurgency against the Karzai government and against NATO troops in the Pushtun areas of Afghanistan staged a daring prison break on Friday .
They set off bombs at a prison in Qandahar , killing 15 prison guards and allowing 1100 inmates to escape , including 400 captured guerrillas .
Although the US refers to the guerrillas as ‘ Taliban ’ it is not clear that they are seminary students are actually linked to the Taliban movement of the 1990s .
Many appear to be disgruntled Pushtun villagers .
The jailbreak spoke eloquently of the weakness and incompetence of the Karzai government , which many observers believe is in the process of collapsing under the weight of its own corruption .
The collapse seems to be accelerating even though the number of foreign troops in the country has grown enormously , to some 30,000 US and 30,000 NATO soldiers .
Foreign donors recently pledged $ 20 bn in aid , though $ 10 bn of that came from the US and European donors seemed distinctly wary of having their money go into the pockets of the Afghan bureaucrats and those of their extended families .
In May , more US and allied troops were killed by guerrillas in Afghanistan than in Iraq .
Aljazeera International interviews Hamid Karzai and reports on Afghanistan :
Scroll down at our Global Affairs blog for Barnett Rubin ’s excellent postings on Afghanistan in recent weeks .
You all know the drill and how annoying it is .
You 're on a cell phone call with someone .
the connection drops .
You are n't sure whose signal was worse .
So you both call each other back at the same time and get each others voice mail .
So you realize the other person is calling you back ( you both realize this at the same time ) .
So then you , and the other person , both decide to not dial again and wait for the other person to call you back .
But they are doing the same so a few minutes go by and each of you are thinking that the other person is waiting for you to call them so you both again dial each other and get a busy signal
LET'S STOP THE MADNESS .
Let 's just follow this simple rule .
If you are on a cell phone call and the call gets dropped , the new rule is that that person that initiated the call in the first place calls the other one back .
No dual dials .
No dual voice mails .
No 3 minute delays to get the call going again .
Its really this simple .
if you initiated the call and it drops you call the other person back .
if you received the call and it drops you just wait for the call back .
Please pass this along or forward the link to this post to everyone you know .
It will save us all time and frustration .
Report : Clinton says do n't nominate me RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Former first lady Hillary Clinton is expected to ask that she not be nominated at the Democratic convention later this month , much to the chagrin of some of her most die - hard supporters , who have not given up the quest to oust Barack Obama from his spot as the party 's presumptive nominee , according to a report Friday in the New York Daily News .
A source close to the New York senator confirmed she wo n't file a formal request to the convention asking to be nominated along with Barack Obama , who eked out the victory in their fierce primary slugfest .
" She is not going to submit the signed request , " the insider told the Daily News .
" People are still circulating petitions on her behalf , but this is a done deal . "
Party rules stipulate that Clinton must ask in writing to be nominated herself and also submit a petition signed by 300 to 600 delegates .
Without her signed request , petitions of support are meaningless .
TalkingPointsMemo's Greg Sargent , though , says Clinton is n't making the decision completely on her own .
Rather , it 's being influenced by Obama 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee .
But according to Hillary spokesperson Kathleen Strand , in truth Hillary is actually not making this decision on her own -- she 's making it in concert with both the DNC and the Obama campaign .
" While no decisions have been made at this time , they will be made collaboratively with Senator Clinton and her staff , the DNC and Senator Obama 's campaign and released at the appropriate time , " Strand emails me .
Curiously , according to Strand , this quote was also provided to the Daily News but did n't make it into its story .
In truth , the decision is n't quite as straightforward as it looks .
It 's unclear whether her pulling her name out of contention could provoke some of her more passionate delegates to create other problems .
The Obama campaign , too , will have a major say over what 's finally decided and will have its own considerations .
When delegates formally cast their votes at the convention , which will be held in Denver from Aug. 25 - 28 , they are free to vote for whomever they choose .
The Daily News , though , says Clinton has been urging her 1,886 delegates to vote for Obama .
" Depending on the dynamics , hundreds of delegates might decide to demonstrate their support and affection , " a Clinton source speculated .
If so , that could be read as a dis to Obama from female Democrats still bruised by Clinton 's defeat and resisting her pleas for party unity .
Other Clinton backers , however , worry that she could be embarrassed by a roll call because many of her delegates already have switched to Obama .
Clinton is expected to speak at the convention Aug. 26 , but details have not yet been finalized .
While the second - place Democratic candidate was once seen as a strong contender to become Obama 's running mate , few observers believe she is still being considered for the role .
The gap between rich and poor is wider than ever .
But that does n't seem to bother Britain 's wealthiest earners .
In an extract from their new book , Polly Toynbee and David Walker describe the jaw - dropping arrogance they encountered when they asked some of the fat cats to justify their lives of luxury
From the marbled 20th floor of a glass tower in Canary Wharf the view of the river is breathtaking .
It snakes down to the Thames barrier , glinting in the sunset .
Close to the new city lie the serried ranks of East End estate blocks .
The view is typical of London : glossy new wealth nestling close to old and persisting penury .
Precious little money has trickled down from this gilded new town in the sky to its neighbours below .
The view is a reminder of the widening gap .
History , many like to believe , is a Whiggish tale of wealth , social progress and fairer distribution , an onward march : we all wear the same clothes , meet on equal terms on Facebook .
Yet background predicts who will run the banks and who will clean their floors .
It 's not happenstance ; it is largely pre-programmed .
General mobility is a myth .
The top 10 % of income earners get 27.3 % of the cake , while the bottom 10 % get just 2.6 % .
Twenty years ago the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company earned 17 times the average employee 's pay ; now it is more than 75 times .
Since Labour came to power in 1997 the proportion of personal wealth held by the top 10 % has swelled from 47 % to 54 % .
Labour did try to tug in the opposite direction , but after Gordon Brown 's last budget as chancellor axed the 10 p tax rate , many of the lowest paid were left bearing a heavier burden .
Those who make the most money , meanwhile , seem less willing than ever to see it redistributed .
Tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that in 2006 at least 32 of the UK's 54 billionaires paid no income tax at all .
High - earners tend to be elusive , preserving their privacy at home and at work , journeying between them in expensive cars .
But in sessions conducted by Ipsos Mori over two evenings we did meet partners in a law firm of international renown and senior staff from equally world - famous merchant banks .
Their business is money , and they make it : the law partners earned between £ 500,000 and £ 1.5 m per year , putting them in the top 0.1 % of earners in the UK , while the merchant bankers ranged from £ 150,000 up to £ 10 m .
We hoped to gain an insight into their notions of fairness - what might persuade them to share more of their wealth with others .
What we encountered was a startling demonstration of ignorance .
Here were professionals who deal daily with money , yet know next to nothing about other people 's incomes .
When asked to relate themselves to the rest of the population , these high - earners utterly misjudged the magnitude of their privilege .
How much , we asked our group , would it take to put someone in the top 10 % of earners ?
They put the figure at £ 162,000 .
In fact , in 2007 it was around £ 39,825 , the point at which the top tax band began .
Our group found it hard to believe that nine - tenths of the UK's 32 m taxpayers earned less than that .
As for the poverty threshold , our lawyers and bankers fixed it at £ 22,000 .
But that sum was just under median earnings , which meant they regarded ordinary wages as poverty pay .
Mistakes such as these should disqualify the wealthy from pontificating about taxation or redistribution .
And yet City views carry great weight with ministers and politicians of all parties .
Fortunately , Professor John Hills , director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics , was on hand at the focus groups to provide correct figures .
Once he had done so , one youngish banker said sheepishly : " My appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless .
Given my age and my level of experience in the City I would n't have thought that I would be so out of touch with reality . "
Another realised how much he had lost touch : " It sounds an awful thing to say , but I know people I went to school with , and I 've no idea how they survive on the incomes they have . "
But they got over their initial embarrassment quickly enough .
An encounter with the facts did n't seem to impinge in the ensuing discussion : in no time they reverted to an underinformed view of the world .
Justifying their own high incomes , they said : it 's not us , it 's globalisation , and anyway we are the nation 's economic benefactors .
" The goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to London to make wealth , " one said , echoed by all .
The growing gap between rich and poor is " a reflection of the success of policies here . . . making the City one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world " .
Another said defiantly ( this was on the eve of the banking sector 's implosion ) , " I do n't think we should sit here and say London should be guilty for being successful . "
They put themselves inside a golden enclave , but one on which the entire UK depended for its wellbeing .
Do n't mess with its denizens : they deserve thanks for providing invisible exports and powering GDP growth .
We high - earners belong to a global elite , able to work anywhere , always mobile .
But the City 's importance is exaggerated .
Finance , including the City , insurance and high street banks , forms 7.9 % of the UK's GDP , compared with manufacturing at 14.7 % and property services at 16.5 % .
Added together , hotels , catering and telecoms account for nearly the same share of GDP as finance .
As for their threats of flight , both our bankers and lawyers turned out to be remarkably immobile , most having worked for their firms for a long number of years .
The warmth with which they described their London lives with partners and children suggested they would be loth to leave .
" We work harder and aspire the most , " one said .
The longer we talked , the more they turned to moral reasons for success and failure , moving away from the structural globalisation reasons given above .
One banker said : " It 's a fact of modern life that there is disparity and ' Is it fair or unfair ? ' is not a valid question .
It 's just the way it is , and you have to get on with it .
People say it 's unfair when they do n't do anything to change their circumstances . "
In other words , they see themselves as makers of their own fortune .
Or , as another banker said , " Quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve , and quite a lot of people have n't done well because they do n't want to achieve . "
One woman banker described escaping from a provincial town where the main employer was the public sector : " If you aspire to anything beyond that you 're not going to live [ there ] any more , and that 's the choice you make . "
They had chosen a life that would make them rich while others , making different and morally equivalent choices , had abdicated their right to complain .
" Some of these are vocational , things like nurses . . .
It 's accepted - they go into it knowing that that 's part of the deal . "
Another said : " Many people , like teachers , do n't do things for the pay .
But you wo n't find a teacher that works as hard as we do . "
This was categorical , evidence unnecessary .
They spoke of heroic all - nighters drawing up contracts for clients in time zones on the other side of the globe , a Herculean effort that justified fat pay .
But did they work 10 times as hard as a teacher on £ 30,000 a year or , in the case of some lawyers and bankers , 100 times as hard ?
Such disproportionality did not enter their scheme of things .
None of us like to feel guilty about our comfortable lives , and it would have been absurd to expect mea culpas from these people just because they earned so much .
What we had hoped for was more awareness , some recognition that their position needed explaining and even justification .
Instead , with the exception of a couple of progressive lawyers , they simply denied they were rich .
They could scarcely deny they had money ; indeed they spoke of the pleasures that high incomes bought .
" I do enjoy the fact I can have nice holidays and do n't think twice about buying particular items , " said one lawyer .
But most blocked out the suggestion they were extremely well off .
Living in London cost a lot , they said : the city that made them rich was a reason you had to be rich .
You had to afford London property .
" I 'm sick of this , because with £ 100,000 in Manchester you are well off ; £ 100,000 is a not a wealthy person down here . "
A lawyer admitted that he could n't imagine surviving on an income as low as £ 100,000 , and in discussions about higher tax bands his colleagues objected to any such low sum being used as a benchmark .
One of the more imaginative lawyers described their social isolation : " We now live in a separate economy , we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country .
We do n't send our kids to the same schools , we have more choice over schools , we have more choice over health , we have more choice over where we live , we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs .
And we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to . "
" Providing for children " was flourished as a trump card , as if spending on offspring were automatically moral and good , regardless of how other people 's children fare .
" I work hard , I 've got two boys and I want to provide for them . "
Providing for children meant buying them access to high - earning jobs , taking trusted routes through school and university .
One result of such social selection is already being seen on the City 's doorstep .
Applicants at this law firm are " becoming posher " , a senior partner noted .
Older partners were often grammar school , but now recruits almost exclusively have been to private schools .
They are also greedier : the same older partner said he was shocked that the first question high - flying graduates ask now is about the salary .
Once our conversation turned to tax , the high - earners ' arguments against rebalancing the system ranged from threat to bluster to attack .
Response one : we will leave , and you will be poorer .
Or : we do n't deserve to be forced to pay more .
Or : even if we were taxed more , the money would all be wasted .
John Hills 's charts showed how the modern UK tax system can barely be called progressive , with the top 10th of income earners paying a smaller proportion of their total income in tax than the bottom 10th .
The poor are hit hard by VAT and other indirect taxes : they spend relatively more on taxable goods and services .
Even when confronted with that evidence , the bankers especially gave the crudest response , saying flatly that they contributed more in cash - denying the point of a progressive tax system , which is that higher earners pay a larger proportionate share .
" Politics of envy ! " one lawyer exploded furiously .
" I really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something that 's totally irrelevant and wo n't help a poor person at all . "
The idea of redistributing more was , he said , " all kinds of bullshit crap which does n't help the people " .
They felt a passionate hatred of capital gains tax and inheritance tax .
One banker , bearing a distinct resemblance to Mr Scrooge , said : " People do n't starve in this country - it 's OK .
Compared with other countries , here you do n't go hungry because you can just go and get money for free . "
Some thought benefits already too high .
One banker said he thought a family of four receives " say , £ 3,000 a month in their hands , and they 're somewhere miles up north .
They 're not going to earn that sort of money , so where 's the incentive for them to go out to work ? "
In fact , a family of four would in 2008 receive a net total of £ 1,328 a month .
Whatever , the poor did n't deserve it .
Masters of the universe our groups might be , but their outlook was pure Daily Mail : " Single people . . . get pregnant and get a flat and more money .
You just see everybody pushing prams , then they 'll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life . "
There was much talk of the perverse incentives for single parenthood , with one banker complaining that the 18 - year - old mother on benefits " does n't get that much less money than another 18 - year - old working in a shop " .
It did n't seem to occur to this speaker that the shop worker 's pay might also be too low .
They were contemptuous of anything that gave extra money directly to poorer people : " This thing of giving pregnant women £ 200 for dietary supplements .
Like , as if they 'll really spend it on fruit . "
Most were adamant , along with this banker : " We do n't think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer . "
A last defence against paying more tax was their absolute conviction that government is inefficient and could not to be trusted with a penny more .
When it comes to government , " lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job " , said one lawyer .
" Nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that they 're required to do . "
Another argued : " Labour did a bit of that , with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions .
The big debate is about how effectively all that money - raising has been applied .
Most people would say not all of it was well applied . "
We heard this get - out time and again .
Public money is always misspent .
Our bankers airily said the administrative cost of paying tax credits was astronomical ; Hills said it was actually 3 % .
And what was the ratio of office costs to turnover in a big City bank ?
A good deal more - nearer 8 % , it turned out .
But their error was delivered with all the aplomb of power .
The entire public realm was dismissed in one sweep .
As if he hailed from the planet Zog , one of the bankers said : " I have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore I do not trust the system at all . "
But he knew his taxes would be misspent .
" The classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus what 's invested in the roads and the transport system .
It goes into a black hole . "
Another banker asserted that there is " little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used " .
Several lawyers , meanwhile , swivelled in their chairs to point downriver from Canary Wharf , to where the Millennium Dome floats like a jellyfish on its spit of land .
" Does n't that , " they cried in triumph , " say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending ? "
Here were people who might be technically adept , or good at deal - making , but as a group - with one or two exceptions - they were less intelligent , less intellectually inquisitive , less knowledgeable and , despite their good schools , less broadly educated than high - flyers in other professions .
Their high salaries were not a sign of any obvious superiority .
Most dismaying was their lack of empathy and their unwillingness to contemplate other , less luxurious lives .
They could not see that the pleasure they derived from possessions , prospects and doing well by their children is universal and that others deserve a share of that , too .
' What can charity do for us ? '
How the rich - or at least those who bother to give - are using philanthropy to boost their status
Charity used to be something you did quietly , unostentatiously .
We attended a breakfast for high - net - worth individuals organised by the Charities Aid Foundation and hosted by the Lord Mayor of London .
The main speaker was Stanley Fink , chief executive of Man Group plc , the hedge - fund managers .
Charity , he made plain , is now a way to fame .
" I want to talk about what charity can do for us , " he told his audience , describing giving as the ultimate door - opening lifestyle accessory .
" What do you do now you 've got all the toys ? " he asked .
" You 've already got all the houses , yachts , cars and jets you can use , so what comes next is charity . "
It 's not just the joy of giving , but opportunities to meet celebrities : " I get invited to places I 'd never have seen otherwise . "
Charity is the passport to the in - crowd : he listed the eye - popping names and places his philanthropy had taken him , from No 10 upwards .
Give and ye shall meet celebs .
At the behest of Labour ministers , the mega - wealthy have taken to secondary education .
In academy schools , for a very reasonable £ 2 m a pop , they get their name above the door plus the option to chair the trustees and , subject to governance rules , select like - minded members of the board .
Sponsors thus play a major role in selecting and firing headteachers and designating specialisms , free of local - authority control .
" If we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity , we have a shot at having a really strong impact , to be able to transform the lives of children , " says Arpad Busson , a Swiss - born financier and the founder of Absolute Return for Kids ( ARK ) , which runs seven academy schools .
This is a charity mentioned as often in the gossip columns as in Society Guardian because Busson helped turn giving into high fashion .
ARK 's 2007 fundraising dinner is said to have raised more than £ 26 m , exceeding the £ 18 m claimed in 2006 , mainly on the back of pledges from Bloomberg , Merrill Lynch and UBS .
Guests were entertained by Prince , and items auctioned by the deputy chair of Sotheby 's included a day on the set of the latest Bond movie and dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev .
The previous year , guests heard Elton John , and up for sale were a Damien Hirst and a guitar lesson from Chris Martin of Coldplay .
Press releases namecheck the producers , the food suppliers and the floral decoration : this is business as charity and vice versa .
Are the rich merely bidding to reclaim the position once occupied by aristocratic patrons , suzerains of the public sphere ?
They control the business sector , so why not social policy as well ?
City entrepreneurs are used to running the show and think they know best , whether running schools , hospitals , universities , galleries or Jobcentres .
The voluntary sector should be efficient and effective , of course , and corporate and finance - sector managers have a contribution to make .
Financial skills are often in short supply , and balance sheets and audit committees should truck no nonsense .
But voluntary organisations are complex and attract diverse people .
The business approach can be reductionist .
Nor are the rich quite as generous as they would like to appear .
Many do n't feel any responsibility outside their family , or need every last penny of that £ 5 m - a - year income .
An Institute for Public Policy Research survey found wealthy people refusing to give because they do n't trust charitable organisations : apparently , charities have become too professional in their fundraising and yet not businesslike enough in how they spend the money .
It concluded that tax incentives and high - profile giving campaigns might encourage those already giving large amounts to up the ante , but the majority of wealthy individuals who give little or nothing are pretty impervious .
When the Scottish sports - goods magnate Sir Tom Hunter announced that he was giving away £ 1bn over his lifetime , the story led the BBC Ten O'Clock News , perhaps underscoring how rare big giving is .
Andrew Carnegie said that a man who dies rich dies shamed , but it seems embarrassment is easily weathered .
We explored attitudes in our focus groups with lawyers and bankers .
They felt charities were not so different from government and would " waste " money .
One lawyer asserted : " The general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not , if you do give the cash , it 's going to get where you want it to go . "
Another admitted : " People like us do n't put our hands in our pockets so much . "
It is true that the larger a household 's annual income , the more likely the household will give money to charity .
Half the households in the top 10 % of the income distribution make charitable donations , but only one in six of the bottom 10 % .
But there is a twist in the figures .
The worse off give proportionately more of their income .
The top fifth of households give less than 1 % of their total income , while the poorest 10th give three times as much , or 3 % of their income .
The Charities Aid Foundation notes that the same few names get recycled in the media , giving an erroneous impression that philanthropy is on the rise .
Its own annual report for 2007 , however , records " a fall in the proportion of high - level donors " - and this in a year of soaring boardroom bonuses .
To put it bluntly , the rich are a greedy bunch .
