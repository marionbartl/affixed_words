Dear Mr. Buffet , Mr. Gates , Mr. Turner , Mr. Soros , Ms. Winfrey , and any other hyper - rich types with progressive political leanings :
If this essay has , against all odds , somehow made its way to your desk , please , bear with me .
It ’s longish , but it winds eventually toward an exceedingly important conclusion .
If you ’ll give me a few minutes , I ’ll do my best to reward your patience .
_______________
In the 2008 election , Barack Obama won a landmark political victory on a couple of prominent themes : “ hope ” and “ change . ”
He has since been afforded ample opportunity to talk about these ideas , having inherited the nastiest economic quagmire in living memory and a Republican minority in Congress that has interpreted November ’s results as a mandate to obstruct the public interest even more rabidly than it was doing before .
Reactions among those of us who supported Obama have been predictably mixed , but even those who have been critical of his efforts to date are generally united in their hope that his win signaled the end of “ movement conservatism ” in the US .
There are perhaps reasons for optimism .
Politics in America can be cyclical , and by that thinking our current reactionary hegemony may have run its natural course .
The Millennial Generation , which is between 75 - 100 million strong and extremely active socially and politically , skews heavily away from the policies that have defined the nation since Reagan .
And some believe that Obama is the sort of once - in - a - lifetime charismatic who , like John F. Kennedy , can redirect the course of the culture through sheer force of vision and will .
If any or all of these things are true , then there is room for … hope .
But while hope is an occasionally helpful frame of mind , it ’s no substitute for intelligence , insight , planning , hard work and cash .
As I consider the state of the Republic some 49 days into the Obama era , I find in that formulation a variety of reasons to worry .
For starters , it strikes me that very few people – very few , even , of the most visible lights in the progressive firmament – truly understand the magnitude of the conservative climb to power or the nature of the strategy employed .
It ’s not well understood how long it took , for instance , or how complex the effort was , or how deeply the foundation was poured , or how much it cost .
The shallowness of our popular history is a dangerous condition in an age of instant gratification , when winning a skirmish is all - too - easily mistaken for winning the war , and it ’s nothing short of terrifying to think that some saw January 20 as the end of the struggle instead of the beginning .
Yes , it was a triumph , and we were right to pause and celebrate , to mark the achievement of a critical milestone , but afterward the collective sigh was nearly audible .
I do n’t want to overstate the effect , though .
I ’m not suggesting that a majority of American progressives think the hard part is over , that we can put our society on cruise control and that the wicked Republican Nosferatu is dead once and for all , because that ’s simply not the case .
Instead , I ’m suggesting that we may not sufficiently understand the nature of our opponent and that the failure to stake it through the heart now , while it ’s down , assures that it will rise from its all - too - shallow grave to terrorize us once more .
The landscape has changed , for sure , but the fundamental engines that propelled the modern reactionary right to power in the first place are alive , well , and already hard at work plotting their resurrection .
The Long War Against America
Let ’s take a second to understand a few of the relevant facts regarding the war that still rages around us .
1 : The conservative revolution was a generation in the making .
Those who laid the groundwork for the eventual ascent of the Republican kwisatz haderach took a long view – an astoundingly long view by American standards – and accepted the occasional tactical setback so long as the eternal march of the faithful continued .
One of the godfathers of the movement , Daniel Bell , published his foundational The End of Ideology in 1960 , and his intellectual contributions to the landscape we now inhabit can hardly be overstated .
In The Coming of Post - Industrial Society ( 1973 ) , for instance , he gushed about the coming “ information age ” and painted a rather rosy picture of the life of the “ information worker . ”
This new post - industrial age would be marked by certain significant shifts in axial principles , and among his more powerful claims was the assertion that growth in the information sector resulted necessarily in prestigious knowledge - based employment .
Information sector jobs were depicted as automatically better - paying and more fulfilling .
Krishan Kumar ’s 1978 retort ( Prophecy and Progress : the Sociology of Industrial and Post - industrial Society ) aptly demonstrated the fallacies in Bell ’s reasoning .
Information - based enterprises , like the industrial sector enterprises which preceded them , have a set of basic operational needs which are neither information nor expertise - based .
A software operation , for example , requires the same custodial services as a manufacturing operation .
Bell ’s rhetoric , however , counts such menial employment by the same standards it uses for programmers and managers .
In many practical respects , though , the daily operations of service sector businesses differ little from the industrial sector , and claims that a shift in the type of “ product ” offered from goods to services equals a change in the fundamental structure of employment ought to be greeted cautiously .
So , there you have a pointed exchange from Daniel Bell and Krishan Kumar , two men that you ’ve probably never heard of .
But ask yourself , which of the perspectives strikes you as rhetorically familiar ?
Which argument have you heard , and in service to what kinds of policies ?
Right .
And here ’s how complete the rout was .
The most enthusiastic parroting of Bell ’s construction I ’ve ever run across came from Al Gore when he was Vice President .
The Democratic Vice President .
Take this snippet from a 1994 speech to the International Telecommunications Union :
Approximately 60 % of all US workers are “ knowledge workers ” — people whose jobs depend on the information they generate and receive over our information infrastructure .
As we create new jobs , 8 out of 10 are in information - intensive sectors of our economy .
And these new jobs are well - paying jobs for financial analysts , computer programmers , and other educated workers ( Gore 1994 ) .
One assumes “ knowledge ” companies do n’t need janitors .
Regardless , when we reach the point where our “ liberal ” leaders are reading directly from the script authored by conservative intellectuals , it ’s safe to say that the progressive possibility is in deep , deep trouble .
2 : The conservative revolution was built on a strong intellectual and academic foundation .
( I do not , by the way , use the term “ intellectual ” to signify correctness or moral righteousness – one can be intellectual while being wrong and evil . )
Given how effectively conservatives have kneecapped education in America , it ’s remarkably ironic how important academics were to empowering the movement .
Daniel Bell is noted above ; he and other intellectuals like Irving Kristol , Milton Friedman , William F. Buckley , Russell Kirk and those associated with a host of conservative “ think tanks ” like the Heritage Foundation , the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution worked diligently to re-engineer the very DNA of America ’s popular ideology .
They sought to understand the collective psyche in ways that could be shifted , altered and exploited , and their efforts to deconstruct and re-encode our shared vocabulary is among the grandest achievements in the history of human propaganda .
Turning “ liberal ” into a dirty word was barely the beginning .
These efforts mattered more than it is possible to quantify .
As the neo -Marxist scholar Stuart Hall explains , the “ battle of signification ” is everything .
Whoever wins the struggle to dictate to vocabulary used will win the debate . *
Think about the abortion “ debate ” and the clever , almost - always unchallenged construction of “ unborn human life . ”
If that phrase is allowed to stand , the pro-choicer has nearly zero chance of winning the argument .
3 : The conservative movement was incredibly well - funded .
And still is .
One source estimates that between the late 1970s and late 1990s alone 12 major conservative foundations funneled hundreds of millions of dollars – at least – to think tanks , policy organizations , individual scholars , media apparatuses , legal organizations , advocacy groups and more .
The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation , the Koch Family foundations , the John M. Olin Foundation , the Scaife Family foundations and the Adolph Coors Foundation are five of the biggest donors .
In 1988 , the Olin Foundation alone distributed $ 55 million in grants .
The Scaife family has donated more than $ 200 million over the years .
Million dollar annual grants to individual think tanks are routine .
These Foundations have also been instrumental in creating the most famous think tanks .
The Heritage Foundation , considered the leading think tank in America , was created in 1973 with $ 250,000 in seed money from brewery mogul Joseph Coors .
The Cato Institute , the nation ’s leading libertarian think tank , was founded in 1977 by the Koch family foundations . )
….
According to the Center for Policy Alternatives , the major conservative think tanks in Washington had a combined budget of $ 45.9 million , while the major progressive think tanks had a combined budget of $ 10.2 million .
What this means is that far - right think tanks are better able to publicize their findings , stage more conferences , lobby harder for their policies , and present more and better - packaged information before Congress .
Not too put too fine a point on it , but conservative interests have a lot of cash and they ’ve proven conclusively that they ’re willing to invest it in programs that assure their continued political , social , cultural and economic domination .
And while I hate to oversimplify complex dynamics , it must be said that the points I have just made go a long way toward explaining the last 30 + years of American political history .
Yes , there are other factors , but subtract the cash and the intellectual groundwork it bought and our current landscape would look dramatically different .
Whether that ’s a good thing I ’ll let you decide for yourself .
My opinion is probably obvious , but I ’m not a billionaire .
What Must Be Done
In The Conscience of a Liberal , Paul Krugman does a meticulous job of explaining how we got here from there – “ there ” being the New Deal society that stands today as the Golden Age of American prosperity .
Toward the end he sounds an optimistic note , suggesting that some of the factors that played key roles in the rise of movement conservatism are waning – racism , for instance – and that without their broad mobilizing power the conservatives are in deep kim-chee .
There is ample evidence supporting his claims , so perhaps he ’s right .
I certainly hope so .
But if I might return to my vampire metaphor from earlier , when you have the soul - sucking undead bastard down , you do n’t stand around hoping .
You drive a stake through its evil , demonic heart .
Right now , almost 50 days into the Obama administration , we have Dracula on the canvas .
And this is where you , my friends , come in .
The way we assure an enlightened future for our nation is to act , and act resolutely , to make sure that movement conservatism stays down .
In order to accomplish this , we need to proceed along the following fronts :
We must empower progressive intellectuals the way the Right has empowered theirs .
As researchers like George Lakoff have demonstrated , much of the conservative success emerged from how they framed issues and re-encoded the very language we all speak .
Political lingustics is an important field – as noted earlier – and if we can successfully keep the English language from being transformed into Newspeak we will hamstring the conservative noise machine in a meaningful way .
However , Lakoff ’s Rockridge Institute recently closed its doors and various of its brightest lights are currently seeking to find funds to build on its work .
Put simply , the bright lights on the Right are living well while our brightest and best are , as is so often the case , struggling to survive .
We must restore credibility and integrity to the media .
As I ’ve noted elsewhere , things began to unravel in earnest when Reagan ’s newly appointed FCC apparatchiks were allowed to decree , with a straight face , that “ the public ’s interest , then , defines the public interest . ”
Which is to say that “ the public interest is what the public is interested in . ”
Newspeak , indeed .
Now reporting has been replaced by “ fair and balanced ” and there is a frighteningly real risk that journalism – real journalism – is dying .
Its future , if it has one , perhaps lies in endowment .
I ’ve heard a variety of ideas tossed around , including Mother Jones ’ new tilt at non-profit journalism .
I ca n’t say what the successful model will look like at this point , but if it emerges , it will center on the insulation of reporting and analysis from the influence of cash and spin .
We must revitalize our educational infrastructure around the imperatives of intellectual inquiry and critical thought .
We have seemingly convinced ourselves that the only proper function of education is job training , and that ’s an ideology that serves an identifiable master .
Specifically , let ’s ask ourselves who benefits when an ed system cranks out people with “ marketable ” skills but no capability for asking uneasy questions about their condition .
There is no surer innoculation against tyranny than a critically minded citizenry .
To this end we must invest in education – and I say “ invest ” instead of “ spend ” because every dollar you spend is returned to you several times over – and invest mightily .
Invest in educational innovation , in new ways of teaching everything from basic math and science to advanced reasoning skills .
Invest heavily in early childhood reading programs , because nothing better energizes subsequent , lifelong learning .
And most of all , invest in public education .
The next time you hear somebody ranting about the marvels of vouchers and “ competition ” in education , remember a few things .
First , America has historically out - learned , out - taught , out - researched and out - innovated every nation on the face of the Earth .
The people who did that were , in most cases , the products of public education .
Second , we ’ve always had alternatives to public ed – “ competition , ” if you will .
Private schools , parochial schools , and so on .
If competition cured all ills , then how do we explain the state of contemporary public ed ?
Third , we have more alternatives than ever today .
We have the options noted in the previous item , plus Montessoris and Charters and again , all this competition seems not to have solved our problems .
Finally , the next time you hear rosy conservative rhetoric that seems at little at odds with the empirical world you live in , remember – we live in an age where the language has been re-tooled to serve the ends of a narrow minority .
It ’s possible , just possible , that you ’re hearing propaganda instead of fact .
And always feel free to backtrack the data .
It may just come from one of those marvelously well - funded conservative “ think tanks . ”
In summary : Dear Progressive Billionaires , America needs your money .
And I do n’t mean a million here and million there .
I mean hundreds of millions , even billions .
If we are to realize any meaningful dreams of hope and change , we must have a world where our brightest and best can apply their minds to our shared problems as professionals .
When their intellects are doing it for a living and ours are trying to carve out a couple hours after work , we lose .
When their brightest minds are primarily concerned with crafting winning policy and ours are constantly distracted by desperate concerns about their ability to feed their families , they win .
Money is n’t everything , but since you ’re a billionaire I ’ll assume that you understand a thing or two about what it can accomplish .
Thanks for your time .
If you find some value in what I ’ve said but are n’t sure where to start , click the Contact button and drop me a line .
I know people who are worthy of your generosity and people who will reward your support a thousand times over .
Sincerely ,
Sam Smith

Lusitania Truthers Vindicated !
By Jonathan Cole P.E .
The Jan / Feb 09 Archaeology Magazine " Lusitania 's Secret Cargo " appears to have vindicated the Lusitania “ Truthers ” .
The article states :
" The nearly century - old debate about whether the passenger liner Lusitania was transporting British war munitions when torpedoed by a German U - boat is over .
Physical evidence of just such a cargo has been recovered from the wreck , which rests 12 miles off the Irish coast in 300 ft. of murky turbulent water . "
" Lusitania was sunk off County Cork on May 7 , 1915 .
The attack killed 1,198 people , including 128 Americans and helped push the United States into WWI .
Ever since the ship went down , there have been suspicions [ by conspiracy theorists known as ' the Lusitania truthers ' ( JC. ) ] that the Lusitania was carrying live munitions .
Under the rules of war , that would have made the liner a legitimate target , as the Germans maintained at the time . "
" The British government has always been evasive about the presence of munitions on Lusitania .
Two cargo manifests were submitted ; the second , filed after the ship sailed indicated there were light munitions on board .
Some believe the ship was carrying much more , however , and that the British Navy attempted to destroy the wreck in the 1950s to conceal its military cargo . "
" Now a team led by County Waterford - based diver Eoin McGarry , on behalf of Lusitania 's American owner , Gregg Bemis , has recovered live ammunition from the wreck ...
This past September , Bemis 's team used a remotely operated vehicle to penetrate the wreck .
They were able to clearly identify a vast amount of ammunition in an area of the Lusitania not believed to have carried cargo .
The Remington .303 caliber bullets the team discovered on the ship had been used by the British Military during WW1 .
Ten of the bullets were brought to the surface . "
" The charge that the Lusitania was carrying war materiel is valid , " says Bemis .
" She was a legitimate target for the German submarine . "
However , the official explanation of events contradicts the conspiracy theorists , and supported by a study conducted by GIST ( “ Government Incompetence of Scientific Technology ” ) , after a 90 plus year , 125 billion dollar investigation .
While GIST acknowledges that “ vast quantities ” of .303 ammunition may have been found , it flatly denies that the ammo was in the Lusitania ’s hold prior to its sinking , or that it came from America ; a neutral country at the time .
Using sophisticated computer models , the details of which are classified , GIST scientists have clearly demonstrated that the Remington bullets found were merely random live rounds accidentally dropped by WW1 soldiers in the battle fields of Europe .
Those dropped bullets then washed into streams and rivers that eventually were carried into the ocean where they coalesced into a tidy pile inside the ships hold by a drifting phenomenon called “ Tidal Expansion ” , without causing any harm to the adjacent cargo .
Moreover , in order for the “ twoofers ” allegations to be true , it has been suggested that to carry out a sophisticated American - British ammo transport operation , with all the buy / sell ordering paperwork , the manufacturing , the hauling to the ship yard , unloading , storage then re-loading into the ships hold all that ammunition , would have involved thousands of people .
Of course some would have talked , and it would have been impossible for the US or British government to keep such a secret for so many years .
In addition it ’s well known that the US and British governments would never even consider such a thing .
As GIST lead investigator Dr. Siam Blunder has stated “ Why would they take a chance placing their own citizens in harms way ? ”
Dr. Blunder added that they also investigated the possibility of a terrorist German group planting the ammo in the cargo hold prior to the New York departure .
However it was dismissed it as “ an absurd insinuation ” since American security forces were at the shipyards , making it impossible for anyone , let alone the terrorists , the necessary access to load the ammo undetected .
GIST senior engineer , Mr. Gross Johnson continued “ If the ammunition was truly in the hold before the sinking , it would have fallen to the ocean bottom at almost free flotsam speed , crushing the ammunition in the process .
The fact that the divers found the ammunition intact and not crushed is definitive proof that the ammo simply eroded into the neat piles due to the naturally occurring “ Tidal Expansion ” process .
GIST held a public hearing on its preliminary findings , generously allowing the public almost three weeks to review and comment on its 347,911 page Executive Summary of the full report .
The hearing was sparsely attended by only a few surviving truthers , and of course some “ fair and balanced ” media .
GIST was asked by one old truther about the probability of the ammunition packing itself into the wreckage of the Lusitania , in view of the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
Dr. Blunder responded that due to limited funding and only 92 years to conduct the investigation , GIST did n't have time to go into the actual transfer mechanism of the ammunition , as their prime focus was on the tidal vortices around the 79th link of the ships anchor chain that triggered the “ chain ” reaction of tidal expansion .
As a result of the GIST findings , significant code changes and stiffer regulations for the storage , transport and ownership of ammunition by Americans are in the final stages .

And Consumerist readers !
Wow , there are a lot of you .
Stick around ! )
( If one must break one ’s own no - images rule , one ought to break it big . )
Yesterday , a friend dragged me to a place called Sufi Coffee Shop in Mountain View ( El Camino just north of Castro ) .
The coffee was actually quite good — it had better be quite good , the cheapest cup of drip — of drip was $ 3.50 .
( The most expensive was $ 6.75 .
Admittedly , it was Blue Mountain . )
But the attitude .
Wow , the attitude .
The place is covered from wall - to - wall with angry signs admonishing the customers for various sorts of misbehavior .
I took a photo of the first one , and the owner turned around , sternly instructed me “ no photos ! , ” and then demanded , as an implicit condition of selling me any coffee , that I delete the one I had taken .
Fortunately , the owner is n’t terribly iphone - literate , and so , well , suffice it to say that not only did I not delete the first photo , but I took numerous more besides .
Investigative Journalism , thy name is Paul Gowder .
And now , I share my ill - gotten photographic gains with you , so you can learn what not to do when you run a small business .
The first sign was fairly benign — it was merely an admonition to not leaf through the books ( on Sufism , naturally ) without buying .
Ok , fine .
I ’ve seen this at other coffeeshops that sell books .
Except this sign added a nice dose of snottiness that ’s usually not present :
The bottom says “ Sufism needs not to be promoted . ”
And this apparently is the case , since the desire to learn about the owner ’s religion is met with , according to this sign , a stern instruction to take it to google and shut the fuck up .
But that is by far the least obnoxious sign .
So , another virtue of this coffeeshop is that it is very pretty .
There ’s a lovely little covered balcony out back , with couches , and it ’s was pretty empty when I was there ( for obvious reasons , I ’d suspect that to be its usual condition , considering the prices , the owner ’s attitude , the terrible location , and the signs ) .
It ’s… almost … kinda… romantic .
I could see bringing a date here .
This , it would appear , is not approved :
There are at least five of these signs around the place , including one — not the only sign — defacing a piece of ( admittedly terrible ) artwork on the walls :
“ But , ” perhaps the owner would say in its defense , “ we ’re a small business !
We ’re allowed to be quirky ! ”
Well , it ’s pretty quirky to demand that your customers justify their presence :
That ’s a little blurry .
Here ’s a transcription :
We are not a corporate entity .
Please try to walk in our Moccasins and justify your being here and be fair .
Somehow , I doubt they have too much of a problem with people sitting around and not buying anything .
The place reeks of so much hostility to the customers that one might be afraid that being around for longer than 20 minutes will send the owner after you with a hatchet .
But , just to drive the message home :
Do they really think anyone enjoys the ambiance of the place ?
Really ?
Who enjoys the ambiance of being constantly ordered to justify their presence ?
The ambiance here is the same as the ambiance in The Castle ; the customer is K .
Surely , you might think , if they do n’t want customers sitting around forever ( or , it would seem , at all ) , they would n’t offer wifi .
But they do :
Note how the deranged ever - increasing price scale for the wifi is on the back of a statue of the Buddha .
I guess it does n’t count as sacrilege to put an insane greedfest on the Buddha , since the place is run by a Sufi — but then one has to wonder what a statue of the Buddha is actually doing there .
But the real fun starts when you go into the bathroom .
For surely , one might think , the owner ’s insanity does not extend into the bathroom .
Hehehe .
It starts off fairly mildly :
Ok , fine , perhaps someone was just really gripped by Peter Singer .
That ’s cool .
That ’s cool .*
But then things go downhill swiftly :
You really need to be able to make out the fine print in this one .
Sadly , I did n’t get a very good photo , possibly because I was too horrified to get up close .
But here ’s what said fine print says :
Please refrain from going to big toilet .
Thank you .
Now , here , the more innocent or optimistic of my readers may be thinking it ca n’t possibly mean THAT … can it ?
Yes .
Yes it can :
Sufi Coffee Shop : drink good coffee , then die of catastrophic systemic excretory failure .
Never go here .
Edit : I just wrote a nasty review on Yelp .
It ’s not quite as nasty as my review of another of Mountain View ’s institutions , the “ Zen Lounge , ” ( easily the worst club in the world ) , but it ’s up there .
My most popular yelp review , however , involved logarithms .

Hi all , Quaid here with a link to a really interesting looking trailer for a new Sam Rockwell film entitled Moon .
I ’ll be honest … I know nothing about this one , but the premise looks interesting and Rockwell is always superb .
The slight variation on HAL9000 and other Space Odyssey elements look fun , too .
I love some good , intelligent , thought - provoking sci-fi , and what I ’ve read about this one seems to imply that it ’s right up my alley .
Here is the trailer .
New Saudi King Abdullah has effectively banned citizens from kissing his hand or that of any member of the royal family , saying only fathers and mothers deserved such reverence .
" Brothers , there is something on my mind I want to tell you , " King Abdullah told delegations of princes , officials and ordinary citizens at his palace in the Red Sea city of Jeddah .
" Kissing hands is something alien to our values and ethics , and is refused by free and honest souls , " he said , quoted by the official SPA news agency .
" Moreover , it leads to bowing , which violates God 's law as the faithful bows only to the one and only God .
" Hence I declare ... my categoric rejection of this , and I ask everyone ... not to kiss the hand of anyone except their parents as ( a mark of ) devotion , " King Abdullah said .
King Abdullah , 82 , acceded to the Saudi throne after the death of his half - brother king Fahd on August 1 .
As crown prince he had effectively ruled the oil - rich Muslim kingdom since Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke in 1995 .
Many Saudis kiss the hands of royals when they visit them , while junior members of the ruling Al - Saud family also kiss the hand of more senior members .

Deeply devout people exhibit lower activity in a brain region linked to anxiety when they give the wrong answer on a simple test ( Image : Frederic Sierakowski / Rex Features )
If the deeply devout seem less self - doubting than others , perhaps it ’s because religion helps them shrug off mistakes .
So say researchers who found religious people exhibit lower activity than non-believers in a brain region linked to anxiety when erring on a simple test .
“ Religion offers an interpretative framework to understand the world .
It lets you know when to act , how to act , and what to do in specific situation , ” says
Michael Inzlicht , a neuroscientist at the University of Toronto , Scarborough , who led the new study .
“ It provides a kind of blueprint on how to interact with the world . ”

Religion – and perhaps other strongly held belief systems – buffer against second - guessing decisions , he says .
Anxiety zone
Inzlicht ’s team tested 50 university students from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds .
Christians made up most participants , but his team also tested Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists and atheists .
With a technique that gauges brain activity via dozens of electrodes on the scalp called electroencephalography ( EEG ) , Inzlicht ’s team focused on action in a small brain area called the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) .
“ When it ’s fired , the response engendered is ‘uh oh , pay attention , something is amiss here ’ , ” he says ( see also Magic reveals the brain ’s response to the impossible ) .
People with anxiety disorders tend to show high activity in this region , and drugs that treat their symptoms calm brain activity in the ACC .
Blue , no , yellow !
Volunteers took a simple test that other neuroscientists have used to measure ACC activity .
On a monitor , subjects see a colour spelled out in letters that either correspond to or contradict the meaning of the word – for example , red spelled out in red letters or blue spelled out in yellow letters , for instance .
Volunteers must press a button to indicate the colour of the letters .
The students with strong religious beliefs , as measured by their agreement with statements such as “ My religion is better than others ” or “ I would support a war if my religion supported it ” , exhibited less ACC activation than students with less fervent beliefs .
Tests with another group of students , who were asked how strongly they believed or disbelieved in God , came to a similar conclusion .
Even after accounting for self - esteem , intelligence and other personality traits , Inzlicht ’s team found that religious devotion predicted volunteers ’ ACC activity .
Blissful beliefs ?
One explanation is that people with a genetic predisposition to reduced ACC activity gravitate toward religion .
“ It ’s possible that if you ’re born with a certain kind of brain , you ’re predisposed to religion , ” Inzlicht says .
However , he suspects that religious belief is driving the association .
In unpublished experiments , Inzlicht ’s team asked religious volunteers to describe in writing either their faith or their favourite season .
Those who wrote about their connection to God exhibited reduced ACC activation , compared with people who described the weather .
Inzlicht says it would be interesting to test people as their religious devotion strengthens or weakens over time to see if ACC activation changes accordingly .
This could help confirm the correct explanation for the lower ACC activity .
“ It ’s a very provocative finding and it is consistent with a lot of other things we know about religion ” says Ara Norenzayan , a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
This might explain why religious belief seems to blunt feelings of anxiety .
Although Inzlicht has focused on religion , he thinks other forms of belief may offer the same kind of reassurance .
A previous study that used similar methods found that politically conservative Americans exhibit less ACC activation than liberals .
Keen sports fans devoted to their home team may also see the world through a framework that assuages day - to - day concerns and confusion , Inzlicht says .
Yet religious belief offers one thing that sports and politics do n’t .
“ I think religion offers the ultimate explanation , ” Inzlicht says , “ for what happens after we leave . ”

Marshal Larry Talvy ’s phone rang .
There was trouble in town .
A bunch of men in black dusters with guns were walking down Allen Street .
Again .
Talvy bolted uphill to the town ’s main drag , strode toward the armed men and laid down the law , New West style .
Show me your permit , he said , or you ’ll be ticketed for an illegal street performance .
It ’s been 127 years since Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp fought the Clantons and McLouries at the O.K.
Corral here , and Tombstone is still trying to get a handle on its gunslinger problem .
Only the desperadoes are no longer brawling over cards or horses .
They ’re fighting for tourist dollars .
The O.K. Corral gunfight has long been celebrated by Hollywood , from classics such as John Ford ’s “ My Darling Clementine ” to the 1994 film “ Wyatt Earp . ”
And for decades , local entrepreneurs and retirees indulging their western fetishes have put on their 19th century duds and re-created it along Tombstone streets .
Between performances , gunmen from the various shows and the occasional black - garbed freelancer would mingle with tourists on the three blocks of Allen Street , which is closed to traffic and lined with raised wooden sidewalks , saloons and trinket shops .

Then , three years ago , a stranger rode in and vowed to shake up what he considered a moribund tourist trap .
A showdown ensued between Tombstone residents who wanted to keep the streets as calm as possible and thespians with higher aspirations .
Stephen Keith , a onetime regular at Renaissance fairs who can hold forth on the similarities between the 1993 movie “ Tombstone ” and Wagner ’s “ Ring ” cycle of operas , founded the Tombstone Huckleberry Players .
They were not content to simply re-create the shootout under a tented space inside the O.K. Corral .
Instead , hoping to build a crowd for a new late afternoon show , the actors would walk down Allen Street , performing skits in character and leading tourists to the performance space .
Keith acknowledged there was resistance .
Locals , he said , with no theater experience did n’t like seasoned actors taking their favorite roles .
“ Every old guy who retires and ties his white ponytail back and puts his name on his pickup truck comes here to be Wyatt Earp , ” said Keith , 49 , who plays Doc Holliday .
“ I know how to work a crowd .
I ’ve been in theater for 32 years .
This is what I do . ”

For more than a year , this town of 1,500 allowed the Huckleberry Players to do their act .
But in November , a new mayor was elected , and he appointed Talvy to enforce the letter of the law .
Mayor Dusty Escapule said complaints were coming in from merchants at one end of Allen Street whose customers were being swept up by Keith ’s troupe , and from rival gunfighter groups , who said the Huckleberry actors were pulling customers away from their shows .
So the City Council invoked a 1973 law that required a permit for street performances , and promptly turned down Keith ’s application .
In January , Talvy issued his first citation .
Four of the players faced misdemeanor charges that could lead to a maximum $ 600 fine and two years in jail .
Talvy faced off with the Huckleberry players again last month as they posed for photographs on Allen Street for Arizona Highways magazine .
He threatened to cite them before eventually backing down .

Keith says that he ’s stopped doing formal street performances and that now the law is simply out to get him .
Talvy says he ’s just doing his job .
Most Tombstone residents do n’t want to get between the two .
Ask a question about the issue at a local saloon or trinket shop and the place is likely to go silent .
“ You know , small - town politics , ” one local woman finally said apologetically before reverting to character as a 19th century showgirl .
Many cite the curse an Indian is said to have placed on the settlement more than 100 years ago -- that there will never be two white men who live together here in peace .
“ It looks , ” Escapule said , “ like the curse is still in effect . ”

It is the most famous showdown in western history .
On Oct. 26 , 1881 , the three Earp brothers -- one of whom , Virgil , was the town marshal -- and gambler Doc Holliday fought two pairs of brothers who were part of a gang of local rustlers .
Three rustlers died , and it sparked a feud that is believed to have led to Morgan Earp ’s shooting death shortly thereafter .
The O.K. Corral shootout made Tombstone a legend and the place where people came to experience a bygone era -- and sometimes to re-create it .
“ Every man in the United States born between 1942 and 1957 wanted to be a cowboy , ” said Mike Christie , 37 , a computer consultant who plays Wyatt Earp in Keith ’s show .
“ When they retired from IBM or GE or wherever , they realized , ‘ I can do this . ’
And they moved here . ”
Skirmishes between different groups of reenactors were not unheard of , Escapule said .
That ’s why the town passed the law requiring a permit .
“ We knew something had to be done to keep the peace in this town , ” he said .
Keith says he did n’t intend to cause trouble .
He was just trying to escape the snow .

He was dealing blackjack in a casino in Cripple Creek , Colo. , and did n’t know if he could survive another winter .
Tombstone was just a place with a pleasant climate and promising prospects for an actor .
Once he arrived , he sized up the reenactment scene .
In the daily show at the O.K. Corral , the dashing gunslingers were played by retirees .
“ Last I read , ” one unhappy tourist wrote to True West magazine , “ Billy Clanton was not 50 years old , did n’t weigh 270 pounds , and did n’t have a flowing white beard and wear glasses . ”
( Clanton , the youngest gunslinger in the fight , was 19 . )
Keith assembled his own troupe and persuaded the owners of the Corral to let him take over the show .
Then Keith and his company decided to expand their repertoire .

They added a 4:30 p.m. performance even though they knew that tourists cleared out of Tombstone well before sundown .
They would lure them to their show with a “ walk - down . ”
The players saw it as a service to all of Tombstone because it gave visitors a reason to linger .
At first , town leaders ruled that the Huckleberry Players were simply walking to work in character and did n’t need a performance permit .
But then Escapule took office , and the law came after Keith in the form of Talvy , the newly appointed marshal .
Talvy had been away for a couple of years -- a member of the National Guard , he was deployed to the Mexican border , then Iraq .
He was startled by what he found when he returned .
The main tourist drag , he believed , was devolving into chaos .
“ I just ca n’t afford to let anyone come around here and do things on their own , ” Talvy said .

The conflict has been covered prominently in the local paper ( which Escapule owns ) , but folks are wary about discussing it .
On a recent afternoon , the gun smoke was still clearing inside Six - Gun City , a restaurant where O.K. Corral shootings are reenacted by locals during the lunch hour .
But when the grizzled gunslingers were asked about the dispute , they nervously deferred to the owner , Nora Carrafa .
“ They should [ allow ] whatever they do for everybody , ” Carrafa said .
“ That ’s all . ”
At another nearby gun show site called Helldorado Town , which includes a miniature golf course and petting zoo , owner Jaye Kukowski said even though Keith is a competitor , what ’s happening to him is wrong .
Advertisement
“ Pulling these guys off the street when the tourists absolutely loved it is like stabbing yourself in the foot , ” Kukowski said .
Some local reenactors agree that Keith is different than your average cowboy .
But that does n’t mean he ’s better , they add .
“ The difference between him and most of the actors in town is that they are reenactment actors , ” said George Turner , a retired Hollywood stuntman who goes by the name Tombstone Skip .
“ He ’s a stage actor .
It ’s more melodrama stuff .
When you ’re doing reenacting , you have to be 100 % accurate . ”
Keith has vowed to fight in court , saying the citation is an infringement of his free speech rights .
He turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to get off with a $ 75 fine .

On a recent night , Keith and actor Impus Delectii ( his legal name ) watched “ Tombstone ” yet again in Keith ’s small home .
As the movie played on his flat - screen television , Keith became melancholy during a scene in which a Shakespearean actor is killed in a stagecoach robbery and his companion scolds the citizenry for its indifference .
“ That ’s Tombstone , ” Keith said .
“ You try to bring something fine into their ugly world , and they shoot you for it . ”

American Dynamics Flight Systems , a US - based company that focuses on the development of innovative aerospace and defense systems , has recently unveiled its “ AD - 150 ” – a novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ( UAV ) , capable of vertical take - off and landing ( VTOL ) .
According to the company , the UAV ’s unique design , combined with the vehicle ’s high - speed capabilities , makes it an ideal choice for both land and sea - based operations .
AD - 150 ’s development was initiated due to an increased interest in maritime capable VTOL UAV’s by the United States Department of Defense .
The vehicle is currently considered a potential candidate for the United States Marine Corps ’
Tier III VUAS program , in accordance with , which it should be capable of , operating alongside Bell ’a MV - 22 Osprey tilt rotor transports and Lockheed Martin ’s F - 35B Lightning II joint strike fighters in a broad range of expeditionary operations .
According to a statement released by the US Navy , the minimum speed required for the qualifying UAV is 200kt ( 230 mph ) , although 240kt ( 276 mph ) will be highly preferred – ADFS engineers say AD - 150 easily passes this requirement , reportedly reaching maximum speed of 300kt ( 345 mph ) .
Among the vehicle ’s most notable features is ADFS ’ High Torque Aerial Lift ( HTAL ) implementation , which according to the company , maximizes the vehicle ’s control during hover and transition to forward flight .
AD - 150 sports a modular mission payload design , with internal bays and external stores located in the vehicle ’s center of gravity – according to the company , such a versatile payload bay configuration allows the AD - 150 to support “ the most demanding payload systems and missions . ”
A released AD - 150 specifications document states that the vehicle ’s maximum takeoff weight currently stands on 2,250 lbs , while its payload capacity is 500 lbs .
The UAV features a composite airframe , which was constructed using carbon fiber and Kevlar materials – ADFS engineers say the design was fully validated through the use of reputable computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) .
“ American Dynamics Flight Systems ’ CFD tool suite allows the company ’s engineers to model and simulate virtually any type of aerodynamic and thermodynamic physical operating condition that the AD - 150 aircraft may encounter .
This capability not only allows the company to internally validate designs , but also to accurately predict aircraft and system performance in different operating environments , ” say the inventors .
Additional features of the AD - 150 include a high - performance Pratt and Whitney Canada PW200 Turboshaft engine , as well as advanced interoperable data links and Ground Control Station ( GSC ) interfaces .
One of the first full - scale models of the AD - 150 was on display at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International ’s ( AUVSI ) Unmanned Systems North America exhibition in Washington D.C. on August 7th , 2007 .
TFOT has previously covered a number of innovative unmanned aerial systems , including the DraganFlyer X6 helicopter , which was designed specifically for remote controlled digital photography and digital video streams .
TFOT also covered Northrop Grumman ’s X - 47B drone – a mostly autonomous UAV which was designed to take off from and land on an aircraft carrier and support mid-air refueling .
BREWTON --
A small - town pharmacist intrigued by the government 's economic stimulus plan decided to launch his own version with $ 16,000 in $ 2 bills , and area stores have already felt the impact .
Danny Cottrell gave each of his full - time employees $ 700 and part - timers $ 300 .
He asked them to donate 15 percent to charity and spend the rest locally , particularly downtown , where store owners say that business has been lean .
" I wanted to do something for my employees , let them know our business is not in jeopardy , and for the local merchants , " said Danny Cottrell , owner of The Medical Center Pharmacy with its main store in Brewton and a second in Atmore .
" This seemed like a good way to do it . "
Cottrell said he paid his employees with $ 2 bills so he and the rest of the Escambia County business community could see how the money circulates .
Before he explained the plan to his employees last week , Cottrell said , he could n't resist creating a little suspense .
" Times are hard , " he said , " and the downturn has hit us some .
Employees start to worry if they will even have a job .
So I called a meeting of the staff .
One employee broke out in hives from the nerves .
My partner , Tom Henderson , said he heard some employees talking about the meeting .
They were scared to death . "
Cottrell said he began the meeting as usual , encouraging workers to answer phones faster and serve customers better .
Then he began passing out envelopes .
When workers saw the cash , some were so excited that they wept , he said .
" I was so worried , I made myself physically sick , " said Lana Jackson .
" But spending it has been fun .
It feels like you are doing a good deed . "
Carolyn Kennedy said she was so shocked she could n't speak at first .
Workers are keeping a log of the stores that they visit , more than 65 at last count .
Some have stopped in at stores they never tried before .
From the Winn - Dixie to the Peebles department store , merchants said the $ 2 bills have been noticed .
" I 've had three customers this week come in and pay with $ 2 bills , " said Candy Smith , owner of a clothing boutique downtown .
Sammy Weaver , owner of Weaver 's in Brewton , said he appreciates Cottrell and his commitment to the town .
" The $ 2 bills make it easy to see where it 's going , see how it turns over and generates tax revenue that helps our town and schools , " said Weaver , whose store sells jewelry and clothing .
" I plan to save up the bills that come in here and pay Danny my bill with them . "
Some of the $ 2 bills have even circulated back to the pharmacy .
" It 's not a huge amount of money , " Cottrell said of his hometown stimulus package .
" It would have a more noticeable impact if someone with more resources came up with a huge amount of money , but the times are tough . "
Still , for the workers with the windfall , this is just more of their boss ' big heart shining through , they said .
" I tell you , I love him like cooked food , " said Bobbie Edwards .
There I was in Target , picking up some mundane supplies , when a display on an aisle end cap caught my eye : four - bottle packs of Pepsi Natural .
Having ventured out from under my rock every once in a while , I was familiar with regular Pepsi , Diet Pepsi , Pepsi Max , and even Crystal Pepsi , but Pepsi Natural was new to my eyes .
Curiosity was running through me like so much caffeine .
What was this Pepsi Natural ?
How would it compare to the standard , plebeian product ?
In one swift move , I snapped up a four - pack , swung around , and snagged a bottle of regular off of the nearby shelf .
It was time for a new Pepsi Challenge , Pepsi on Pepsi .
The first thing I noticed , other than the fact that the “ natural ” variant was housed in glass bottles while the regular was in plastic , was the price difference .
Including the CRV , the traditional Pepsi 2 - liter rang up at $ 1.89 , while the four 12 fl oz bottles of Pepsi Natural set me back $ 4.69 .
Scale that , and you ’ll find that regular runs $ 3.69 per gallon , while super - ultra - premium - natural goes for an astonishing $ 12.50 per gallon .
$ 12.50 per gallon !
For sugar water !
Yes , yes , I realize that bottles might affect the price , but should the glass privilege be worth that much ?
I mean , that price is in the bottled - beer neighborhood .
Perhaps the contents would justify the difference .
Pepsi Natural is billed as being “ all natural ” and made with “ sparkling water , sugar , and kola nut extract . ”
Indeed , the ingredient list has all that and more .
Compared to the normal Pepsi , we find a different sweetener , a different type of fizzy water , an additional color source , different acids , and the addition of the kola nut extract .
Pepsi Natural ingredient list
The most noticable difference is the exclusion of high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) in favor of sugar alone .
Some people have made a ruckus in recent years about the virtues of soft drinks sweetened with sugar instead of HFCS .
Most major cola manufacturers made the switch to HFCS in the early 1980s , but some still have small production runs with the old - fashioned sweetener .
Supposedly , Mexican Coca - Cola is sweetened that way , as is some Coke imported for Jewish customers .
Supposedly , the taste is different ( better ) , and possible health effects from HFCS are avoided ( never mind the phosphoric acid ) .
Would the difference be noticable here ?
Perhaps not , as regular Pepsi includes both regular sugar and HFCS .
One must also be aware that “ natural ” does n’t mean “ direct from a plant ” or even “ organic ” ; rather , for natural flavors , the chemicals were derived from something that was alive at some point rather than a source like petroleum or coal tar , which are “ artificial . ”
Either way , you can bet that they went through a lot of processing and refinement before they met the bottle .
Most of the minor ingredients in Pepsi Natural seem to have fairly straightforward routes from plants to bottles , but “ natural flavors ” remains unappealingly ambiguous .
Enough of that .
Time for the taste test .
I let both the regular and natural Pepsi colas chill in the refrigerator overnight .
The next day , I brought them out and poured a glass of each .
Temperature at consumption : 57° F .
The first difference I noticed was the color .
Both were brown , caramel - colored , and clear .
However , the natural Pepsi was much lighter than the regular .
Presumably , the difference was intentional , as they both contain coloring agents .
Pepsi colors : regular on the left , natural on the right
The next difference was the smell .
While the regular cola had a sweet , somewhat acidic scent , the natural version had barely any smell at all .
Perhaps that was related to the relative effervescence of the drinks : the regular appeared far fizzier , which might have released more aromatic compounds into the air .
Time for a sip .
While the regular version had a biting , acidic feel , the natural felt smoother and more mellow .
The regular mouthfeel was inferior , being somewhat astringent .
There was a grittiness on my tounge and teeth with the regular version that seemed absent with the other .
Overall , the taste profile was very similar .
I think that the natural version had hints of cognac , but even in the non -blind test the two drinks were difficult to distinguish .
Later , a couple of my friends also used the adjective “ smoother ” when describing Pepsi Natural versus regular Pepsi .
To take carbonation and the differing acids out of the picture , I added 1.2 g of sodium bicarbonate to 180 ml of each soda .
The liquids fizzed madly , then went silent .
I tried each of the now - flat drinks , and they tasted virtually identical : two cloyingly sweet , syrupy brown liquids .
The underlying chemistry and provenance of the sweeteners are very different , but the tastes are pretty much the same .
Regardless of the form , the drinks contained what seemed to be an unhealthy amount of sugar .
Pepsi Natural has slightly less sugar in a 12 fl oz serving , with 38 g versus 42 g for regular , but that ’s still nearly a quarter of a cup by volume of crystallized sugar :
Amount of sugar in 12 fl oz of Pepsi ( 42 g )
Will Pepsi Natural find a permanent home in the market ?
Hard to say .
History is littered with failed soft drink sub -brands .
The price differential could be an issue , too : when money is tight , who is going to blow the budget by buying “ natural ” soda ?
Frankly , I find all soft drinks to be far too sweet , and the fizziness is unappealing .
I probably consume no more than a quart of soft drinks of any type in a given year .
In fact , I could finish neither of the sample glasses , so most of the carmel - colored gold went down the drain .
In this Pepsi challenge , I ’ll choose option ( c ) : still water .
Tastes better , much healthier , and a lot cheaper .
And all natural , too .
Are anti-blasphemy laws really on the rise ?
Consider this :
Since the founding of the UN in 1948 till the year 1992 , there was no mention of blasphemy in any form under the Declaration of Human Rights .
The articles 7 , 21 , 18 and 19 could have been interpreted to reject the idea that blasphemy is a crime .
Jump to half a century later ; every year from 1999 to 2006 has seen new resolutions to restrict “ Defamation of Religion ” introduced through the Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) by member nations , mostly Islamic .
Since 2005 , the UN General Assembly has passed a similar resolution every year .
I ’ll come back to the UN resolutions in a bit , but first I ’d like to consider some recent developments in India .
Recent Cases in India :
[ smartads ]
Two recent cases of human rights abuse by the Indian government have garnered much media attention .
The first was the arrest of the editor and publisher of The Statesman on reprinting an article that first appeared in the UK .
The second was the case of Ajith D , a 19 year old from Kerala .
The accused were charged under Sections 153A , 506 and 295A of the IPC .
Section 506 is concerned with making intimidating comments and was used in Ajith ’s case , but does n’t concern us here .
Section 153A was used against the Newspaper editor and publisher .
Here ’s is what it says :
Section 153A : Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion , race , place of birth , residence , language , etc. , and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony .
Go here for the full statement of the law .
Section 295A is the most relevant of the three .
Here is the entire section :
Section 295A : Deliberate and malicious acts , intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs .
Whoever , with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of [ citizens of India ] , [ by words , either spoken or written , or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise ] , insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class , shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to [ three years ] , or with fine , or with both .
It was these two recent cases that got me into a dialogue with friends of our blog , Hindu Atheist and Nitwit Nastik , prompting me to do some research into the phenomenon of blasphemy laws .
I had assumed that such outdated restrictions on speech and expression were slowly disappearing as the knowledge of our natural world grew .
I was wrong .
How Blasphemy Laws were Born / Reborn :
Pre-democratic societies had strict blasphemy laws .
Offending religious sensitivities meant death in most cases .
As times changed and modern democratic republics were beginning to take shape , the values of freedom of speech and expression began to matter more .
Many European countries still had blasphemy laws on the books , but rarely implemented them .
These were laws that were originally left in place to defend Christianity , and Christianity had become more benign a religion than it had been in the past .
Go here , here and here for examples of blasphemy in the West ( Warning : Images not suitable for sensitive people ) .
The few cases that were brought to court in European countries were dismissed , with a couple of exceptions .
Western countries today have an immense amount of freedom of expression .
Just as it seemed as though the concept of blasphemy was disappearing in the Western world , a few events through the 1990s changed things at the level of international law .
In 1990 the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) adopted the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam ( CDHRI ) .
In effect the OIC member nations had signed onto an agreement declaring Shariah law as the only guide to human rights .
According to wikipedia , “ Articles 24 and 25 of the CDHRI make all the rights and freedoms stipulated in it subject to Shariah and only to Shariah ” .
Protecting Islam against blasphemy is an integral part of Shariah .
The CDHRI was presented at the UN in 1992 and was accepted into the Human Rights Commission ’s A Compilation of International Instruments ( vol. II ( 1997 ) , pp. 478-84 ) in 1997 .
The “ Defamation of Religions ” resolution of 1999 was first brought to the UNHRC by Pakistan , initially as the “ Defamation of Islam ” resolution .
Suddenly Pakistan became the leader of the movement for anti-blasphemy UN legislation .
But what history does Pakistan have for such ideas ?
Has Pakistan always restricted free - speech in these cases ?
According to Muhammad Abdul Haye , in 1860 the British repealed existing blasphemy laws in order to allow missionary proselytizing .
From the time after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 , till 1982 when Mushtaq Raj published Heavenly Communism , there were no cases of blasphemy in Pakistan .
During that period no anti-blasphemy laws were in place ( my source does not mention if Pakistan had adopted Section 295A which was in place before partition ) .
In the aftermath of the Mushtaq Raj case , Section 295C was added to the penal code in 1986 .
It reads :
Whoever by words , either spoken or written , or by visible representation , or by any imputation , innuendo or insinuation , directly or indirectly defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Mohammed -
Peace be upon him - shall be punished with death and shall also be liable to a fine .
Not only do you get to die , you also get to pay for your own execution !
Today Pakistan ’s courts follow
the strictest interpretations of the blasphemy laws , usually sentencing guilty parties to death or life in prison .
Many of those convicted and killed are minorities of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community .
The government has ruled that this group is not even allowed to proclaim themselves as Muslims .
Many young kids have been killed by these laws .
In India :
Section 295A was enacted in 1927 .
Section 153A was not sufficient to prosecute the writer of Rangeela Rasoon , a book published by Rajpal ( he was later murdered by an Islamic fanatic ) that mentioned the prophet Mohammed in a negative light .
The case was dismissed because 153A requires intent to cause communal harm .
Muslim groups demanded that the supreme court justice who delivered the verdict , justice Dilip Singh , be sacked .
Unsuccessful at that , they demanded that a law be enacted that would outlaw all religious insensitivity to Islam .
In writing 295A , the framers were careful to insert a “ deliberate and malicious intent ” clause , in an attempt to ensure that those in pursuit of academic expression of ideas and those who hurt religious sentiment unintentionally or by accident were not to be prosecuted .
Pakistan ’s revered founder , M.A. Jinnah , who predicted that Mahatma Gandhi ’s strategy of achieving independence by appealing to Hindu nationalism would split the subcontinent into communal groups , stated at the inception of Section 295A that “ those who are engaged in historical works , those who are engaged in the ascertainment of truth and those who are engaged in bona fide and honest criticisms of a religion shall be protected . “
In 1957 the supreme court ruled that cases where malicious intent to outrage a religious group cannot be proven , Section 295A does not apply .
The court stated
Section 295 ( A ) does not penalize any and every act of insult to or attempt to insult the religion …
Insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of that class do not come within the section …
It only punishes the aggravated form of insult to religion perpetrated with deliberate and malicious intention
Despite this “ malicious intent ” clause , the law has been increasingly misused by Hindu and Muslim groups to defend their interpretation of religion .
One famous case is that of M.F. Hussein , an artist awarded the second and third highest civilian awards in the country , who has had cases filed against him under sections 295A and 153A , for the treasonable act of painting nude Goddesses - a subject that is universally identified with ancient Indian art .
India has not passed any new blasphemy laws since independence , unlike Pakistan .
The Duplicitousness of Religion :
As stated above , the “ Defamation of Religion ” laws were initiated at the UN with the introduction of Shariah as a Human Rights issue at the UNHRC .
Islamic countries managed to introduce a concept that would eventually lead to preventing legal criticism of ideas , under the banner of Human Rights !
In effect , a fascistic ideology was labeled as a human rights cause .
To get an understanding of the sneaky strategies used by religious fundamentalists in pushing these laws , more analysis of the language used at the UN is helpful .
For 4 years in a row now the General Assembly of the UN has passed a non-binding resolution against “ Defamation of Religion ” , starting with Yemen ’s introduction of ‘ Combating Defamation of Religions ’ in 2005 .
The resolutions that passed in December 2007 and November 2008 required the Secretary - General to submit a report on the implementation of the resolutions , including on the “ possible correlation between defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement , intolerance and hatred in many parts of the world . ”
What !!!
In an unbelievably heinous statement the resolution seeks to blame the violent acts of religious fundamentalists on those who criticize religion .
It ’s like saying that there ’s a possible correlation between women walking around at night and the upsurge in brutal rapes and sexual assaults - and the law protects the rapists , not the women !
The women are to blame for inciting rape and the rapists are the ones filing the charges .
Think about this .
The religious organizations pushing for this MUST have actually sat down and worked out the wording of a UN resolution that would unequivocally transfer the blame of the crime from those committing it to those who knowingly or unknowingly trigger those who commit it .
The Objectives of Religion :
The modern resurgence of blasphemy laws is most likely a reaction to increased public awareness of the unlikelihood of a supernatural God , an awareness augmented by education .
Of course , that means that the resurgence in laws was preceded by a resurgence in blasphemy itself .
Let ’s look at religion as a natural phenomenon , as Daniel Dennett would .
The tenets of any successful religion must be self - serving , in the sense that they must maximize the odds of their own survival first .
In this sense , religions that demand anti-blasphemy laws are a particularly infectious case of parasite that get their hosts ( us ) to defend them ( the religious beliefs ) against other cultural memes .
Analyzing the scholarly interpretations of religions can only take you so far .
The sociological effects of religion are best observed by studying how proponents of a particular religion behave over time .
If the resurgence of blasphemy law worldwide is any indication , religions are twisting the ears of their rides and digging the spurs in deeper , in what they see as a last ditch effort to defeat that evil villain , secularism .
Update : Some facts that are presented here are now on freethoughtpedia .
You can follow up on them here for information on the latest push from the religious establishments regarding blasphemy laws around the world .
Spanish police seize 42 - piece dinner set ... made entirely of cocaine
A 42 - piece crockery set made entirely of compressed cocaine has been seized by Spanish police .
Forty - five pounds of the drug were sculpted into a cheerful set of plates , cups , pots and saucers - painted blue and decorated with sunflowers .
Teatime : Some of the 42 - piece dinner set constructed entirely of compressed cocaine that has been seized by Spanish police
It was sent by recorded delivery from Venezuela to Barcelona via London .
Now police have arrested a 35 - year - old Spanish man , known only as JVLL , who is believed to have received the crockery in the mail , after an international investigation .
They believe JVLL was forced into the deal by Venezuelan drug lords .
The dealers had hoped to treat the drug and then sell it in Catalonia , police said .
Spain has the second - highest level of cocaine consumption in Europe after Britain .

As we all know , the Terror Warriors in the White House ( of whatever political stripe ) do n't do body counts .
They just kill people , make unsupported claims of " clean hits " on " militants , " backtrack a bit later when eyewitness reports confirm extensive civilian casualties , promise " investigations " that kick the PR can way down the road -- and carry on killing .
But strangely enough , the people who are being killed by these well - wadded , massively protected elites do count how many of their sons and daughters and mothers and fathers are being slaughtered by American ordnance .
Imagine that !
It 's almost like they are real people or something !
Pakistan is the latest target of the Terror Warriors ; the progressive , anti-war , last - best - hope - for - world - peace Barack Obama has made it his special project to lay some heavy hurt on the Pakistanis , escalating the drone bombing campaign initiated by his much - emulated predecessor , George Widowmaker Bush .
Indeed , the Obama administration is mulling expanding their expansion of the drone war into Pakistan 's troubled -- but oil - rich -- southern province of Baluchistan .
One begins to suspect that the progressive humanitarians in the White House have been drawing on the beserker fantasies of General Ralph Peters for strategic guidance on the " Af - Pak " front .
In any case , every week brings new reports of deadly attacks in Pakistan 's frontier regions , almost all of them involving the deaths of civilians .
Americans generally hear little or nothing about these attacks beyond official snippets about " successful " attacks against the apparently endless , ever - replenishing supply of " top Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders . "
[ Or to put it in reality 's terms , the United States government and its progressive , humanitarian leaders regularly order , admit and applaud the " extrajudicial killing " -- i.e. , murder -- of uncharged , untried individuals living within the borders of an allied country .
As it saith in the Scriptures :
These be your gods , O progressives ! ]
But while Americans turn a deaf ear , in Pakistan the blood cries out , and is measured , as far as possible , by a government that is further shaken by each American attack and the violent extremism it engenders .
This week , Pakistani officials released stunning figures of the civilian death count in the American drone war : almost 700 innocent men , women and children killed so far -- as opposed to 14 actual , wanted extremist leaders .
As the Pakistani paper The News reports :
Of the 60 cross - border predator strikes carried out by the Afghanistan - based American drones in Pakistan between January 14 , 2006 and April 8 , 2009 , only 10 were able to hit their actual targets , killing 14 wanted al - Qaeda leaders , besides perishing 687 innocent Pakistani civilians .
The success percentage of the US predator strikes thus comes to not more than six per cent ....
According to the figures compiled by the Pakistani authorities , a total of 537 people have been killed in 50 incidents of cross - border US predator strikes since January 1 , 2008 to April 8 , 2009 , averaging 34 killings per month and 11 killings per attack .
The average per month killings in predator strikes during 12 months of 2008 stood at 32 while the average per attack killings in the 36 drone strikes for the same year stood at 11 .
Similarly , 152 people have been killed in 14 incidents of cross - border predator attacks in the tribal areas in the first 99 days of 2009 , averaging 38 killings per month and 11 killings per attack .
Now there 's change you can believe in ( to coin a phrase ) !
In just a few months in office , Obama has managed to raise the average kill rate achieved by Bush from 32 to 38 per month .
And who can doubt that this young , capable , charismatic president will not increase that civilian slaughter rate even further as he ratchets up the drone war in the months -- and years and years -- to come ?

It is an environmental scourge that saddles local government with clean - up bills running into hundreds of thousands of pounds .
But today the world 's first biodegradable chewing gum is arriving on British supermarket shelves , potentially putting to an end the sticky mess caused by the conventional product .
Chicza Rainforest
Gum is manufactured in Mexico by Consorcio Chiclero - a consortium of 56 co-operatives employing some 2,000 chicleros ( gum farmers ) and their families .
The workers extract natural gum from the sap of the chicle tree , which is then used to make the product .
Unlike conventional chewing gum , which contains petrochemicals , the organic chewing gum does not stick to clothing or pavements .
And once disposed of , it will crumble to dust in about six weeks , dissolving harmlessly in water or being absorbed into the soil .
Chicza comes in lime , mint and spearmint flavours , and is going on sale at Waitrose for £ 1.39 a packet .
It is costly and difficult to remove conventional chewing gum from public places because of its chemical content , with cleaning typically costing between 10 p and 30 p per piece .
It takes 17 weeks for chewing gum to be removed from the entire length of Oxford Street in London , for example , but only 10 days for it to be littered with gum again .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs has calculated that local authorities spend up to £ 200,000 a year each on clearing gum ; the average cost is £ 13,000 .
Westminster city council in London , which has one of the highest clean - up bills , is backing the new product .
A spokesman for Encams , which runs the Keep Britain Tidy campaign said : " While we welcome any product that could potentially alleviate the worst problems of staining , the real solution remains for people to put gum in the bin or - if there is n't one around - in a piece of paper or tissue until they find one . "
In 1978 , as a New York City schoolteacher hoping to mobilize low - income youth into a force for change , I asked informal focus groups of East Harlem teens how they would improve their community if adults provided the resources .
They all said the same thing :
They would rebuild run-down houses to create homes and take empty buildings back from the drug dealers .
At that time more than 300 abandoned buildings blighted East Harlem , and thousands of idle teenagers and hundreds of homeless people roamed the streets , so their answers were compelling .
Soon thereafter , I founded the Youth Action Program and enlisted 20 young people and five adult volunteers .
Our first project was a five - story abandoned tenement on 107th Street in East Harlem that was “ in rem ” — taken from its private owner by the city .
It was a mess , full of garbage and rotting dead animals .
We learned as we went , taking five hours to lay the first 14 bricks .
The Youth Action Program evolved into YouthBuild USA , which now consists of 226 local programs in 42 states engaging 8,000 students each year .
In these programs , low - income 16 - to 24 - year - olds earn their GEDs or high school diplomas and learn job skills by building affordable housing for homeless and low - income people .
They also participate in leadership development activities and build a supportive mini-community of peers and adults passionate about rebuilding their communities and their lives .
Since 1994 , 76,000 young people have produced 17,000 units of affordable housing in 226 of America ’s poorest communities .
Most of them have also qualitatively improved their own lives through education and employment and internalized the ethic of service .
Nonetheless , we ’re still not meeting the nation ’s need .
Many local YouthBuild programs are turning away three to six times as many young people as they can take in ; last year we turned away 14,000 applicants .
Young people are knocking on our doors and we are forced to say , “ Sorry , no room at the inn . ”
When I sat in the waiting room at YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School in the summer of 2004 , on the final day of admissions , many of the 800 young people not accepted were crying , and I vowed to try harder .
It ’s my job to open those doors wider .
To get from partial to full scale — and for us full scale means 50,000 students a year in 850 communities —
YouthBuild ’s federal funding must increase from $ 60 million annually to $ 1 billion over an eight - year period ( or an average of $ 125 million annually ) .
Local programs will also need to raise $ 250 million annually from state and local education and criminal justice funds for diploma - granting and reentry services , and from private funds .
How will we achieve this breakthrough ?
By going back to our past supporters , and by decisively stepping up our communications and advocacy to bring in powerful new allies .
PRIVATE FUNDS
YouthBuild would never have gotten to partial scale without private support .
To get to full scale , we ’ll approach all the private funders who have ever supported us and ask them to contribute to an $ 85 million growth fund .
This fund will strengthen federal and state advocacy , provide resources for quality assurance and innovation in an expanding field , support the next generation of research on program impact , strengthen the management capacity of YouthBuild USA to handle growth , and provide strategic grants to local programs .
We ’ll also approach the new generation of billionaires and persuade them that the challenge of expanding an established but still inspiring program to full scale to help solve a critical social problem is as interesting , important , and feasible as replicating promising new initiatives in a few dozen locations .
Many funders have been attracted to the initial replication process because they consider it scaling , but few have committed to the more ambitious goal of expanding programs such as YouthBuild ( which have already been successfully replicated and proven to work over time ) to full scale .
We ’ll even revisit funders who in the past decade refused to invest in YouthBuild because it was “ too big ” and “ already a government program , ” or because they believed it could lose federal funding at any time through a political decision and was therefore too insecure .
This time we ’ll tell them that yes , we did succeed in creating a government program that is dependent on political decisions , but that this is a reason to expand support , not to avoid it .
( In 1992 Sen . John Kerry and Rep. Major Owens helped us build bipartisan support in both houses of Congress to get the YouthBuild Act passed and $ 40 million appropriated to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) for this new federal program .
Every year since then , between $ 20 million and $ 65 million has been appropriated , thanks to the support of these champions , a mobilized constituency , and steadily expanding bipartisan congressional support . )
Having created a federal program at the $ 60 million level does not solve the problem , meet the demand , or exhaust the capacity , we ’ll argue .
We ’ll also point out that such expansion takes private investment in advocacy , communications , research , leadership development , and quality assurance .
To maintain the quality and impact of a federal program , a national nonprofit must constantly negotiate with the federal government at every level and keep the entire grassroots network engaged at a high level of inspiration and connection with the mission .
The nonprofit must also fill the government ’s gaps and correct its errors , and that takes private , flexible resources .
In the unique public - private partnership that we have created , the federal government acts as the ocean liner that manages the taxpayers ’ funds , and we are the flexible tugboat that can move quickly to correct mistakes , support innovation , and maintain inspiration at the grass roots .
GOVERNMENT FUNDS
A little background : After the first $ 40 million of federal YouthBuild funds reached local communities in 1994 under HUD ’s jurisdiction , YouthBuild grew from 15 sites to 106 in two years .
But after 1996 , Congress changed leadership and the YouthBuild appropriation was cut in half .
Still , the YouthBuild Coalition fought every year to increase the appropriation , and we managed to generate a steady rise to $ 65 million in 2002 .
In 2006 , the program was moved with our cooperation from its incubation in HUD to institutionalization in the U.S. Department of Labor ( DOL ) .
The Bush administration felt it was better aligned there , and DOL wanted it as a cornerstone of their approach to disadvantaged youth .
Some of the glitches in this transfer process resulted in a 23 percent cut in funding , down to $ 50 million .
Over the same period , since 1994 , six additional federal agencies have gradually invested in key aspects of the YouthBuild program , using Youth - Build USA as an intermediary for targeted grants .
Still , this success is incremental , and it comes nowhere near meeting the nation ’s demand or need .
To go to full scale , YouthBuild USA and our local affiliates must convince politicians to make a national commitment to reconnecting all unemployed , out - of - school young adults to education , employment , and service .
Such an achievement would play an essential part in building our economy and eliminating poverty in America .
YouthBuild , combined with all other comprehensive programs reconnecting low - income out - of - school youth , could end the drain on society represented by 2 million idle young adults in an economy with worker shortages in industries such as construction and health care , 250,000 young adults in prison , and thousands of unemployed young adults who ca n’t afford to care for their own children .
Seventy - two percent of YouthBuild students are young men , attracted to the manliness of building houses for homeless and low - income people , and to the opportunity , as they tell it , to become better fathers than they had growing up .
Of course , having the President of the United States as an advocate would be the optimal situation , and I felt deeply hopeful when during his presidential campaign , Barack Obama included expanding YouthBuild to serve 50,000 youths in his national service platform .
To build political will and private support , YouthBuild USA will create a private sector advisory board .
Bank of America , Home Depot , and the Wal - Mart Foundation have been our primary corporate allies so far .
We ’ll also enlist the help of forces and organizations with overlapping goals — the Alternative High School Initiative , America ’s Promise Alliance , Campaign for Youth , the Forum for Youth Investment , the National Collaborative for Youth , the National Youth Employment Coalition , ServiceNation , Voices for National Service , the Youth Policy Action Council , and many others .
The YouthBuild Coalition itself has 1,000 organizational members committed to the expansion of YouthBuild .
It does seem that for a solution to be taken to full scale , the problem needs to become high in the public ’s mind .
Sometimes this happens spontaneously through an event or crisis , sometimes through a strategic and well - funded campaign involving many advocates and various communications professionals .
At the moment , the dropout crisis is rising steadily in the public ’s awareness , and this can lead to awareness that reenrolling students is one part of the solution .
Hundreds of young people have personally thanked me for YouthBuild and asserted that without it , they would probably be dead or in jail .
Instead , they say , they are doing well and giving back to their communities .
Last year I asked 75 YouthBuild graduates at a conference how many of them had acquaintances or relatives who had applied to YouthBuild , were not accepted for lack of room , and were now dead .
Some 80 percent raised their hands .
We have no choice now but to go full scale ahead .

The Art of Slicing Data
Sharding , is a common way of distributing database load .
Simply explaining sharding – if a database contains the data of X users and getting overloaded ( due to large size ) , it is divided in to two databases ( two shards ) each containing the data of X / 2 users .
So , with all probabilities , the load will be distributed evenly between the two databases .
Note that , when the application has 2X users , each of these databases runs in to the same problem and need to be mutated in to two again .
So in a way , the scaling is linear .
My intention behind this post is – Since we are taking the pain to divide a single convenient database to two ( or multiple ) , is there a possible sharding strategy which will perform better than the linear scaling in performance ?.
Of course , if this better strategy ( if any ) would apply to all type of applications ( like caching ) , we would not have been discussing this here .
Thus , while reading the post , please mark the inherent assumptions .
As we proceed , we will encounter nothing new , but the terminologies we are familiar with – Archiving , Caching etc .
The more I think about it , the difference between these terminologies blur .
Statistically , for a typical application , 5 % of the data is used 95 % of the times and 95 % of the data is used only 5 % of times .
The reason is simple in the context of web applications – they typically display items in reverse chronological order , which is obvious .
Now given this , let ’s see if slicing the data by time can give us better benefit than linear scaling .
Please note the assumptions stated above in which we are trying to find a better solution .
If your application does not fall in to the above pattern , it might not be a good solution for you .
With the above background , let ’s consider dividing the data in to two parts .
One is the Active Shard with recent 5 % of data ( both entities and relationships ) and the other one with Archive Shard with 95 % of data .
Any query of the application is expected to get results from the Active shard and if required calls the Archived Shard for further result .
For example , data for the first page an application is in the active shard and the subsequent pages are in the Archived Shard .
It may be required to query both shards at the same time and merge the result set .
By above , what we have achieved is that we are directing 95 % of the queries to the shard that has 5 % ( 1/20th ) of data as opposed to linear sharding ( 1/2 of the data ) .
If you have agreed with me peacefully so far , may be you are not paying attention !
I have assumed that the recent 5 % of data is the exact 5 % of data where 95 % queries will be going .
Though the data is reverse chronologically sorted , the assumption might be incorrect for some cases .
Again , go back and think through if splitting the data by recent 5 % will be a good approximation for your application .
May be the recent 5 % data per user is a good start !
Anyways , moving forward , an obvious question is what about the 5 % of the queries that are getting fired over a shard that has 95 % of data !
Will the 10th page of my application will take for ever to load ?
The answer to the above is that since now there are fewer queries on the large Archived Shard ( both read and write ) , different set of database optimizations can come in to play and again it is a different but relatively simple design problem .
Possible solutions can be –
Cache – Putting a caching layer ( like memcache ) before the Archived database .
Since there are fewer selects and updates , a relatively high timeout can be set on the cache expiry .
Even strict timeout cache ( in case of updates ) will work good since there will be fewer updates
Database optimization – Both shards here need to be optimized in different ways .
Optimize the Active shard for low sort , read buffer , higher threads ( Example : for Mysql look here ) .
Optimize the Archive shard for high sort , read buffer but fewer threads .
Several other things like Query Cache in case of Mysql will offer significant value on Archived database as number of updates are less ( the query cache will remain valid for long ) .
Pre-Calculation – Since number of updates are less on the Archived Shard , a lot of functions can be pre-calculated .
For example , if a query is accessing a large result set sorted by some parameter and accesses the data not in the first few items ( limit 10000,100 ) , it results in a performance issue .
In fact its a wel - known DOS ( denial of service ) attack .
In our current design , this data is probably going to lie in the archived shard .
Since updates are less , the data can be pre-paginated easily .
I am thinking of posting a detailed design of the same later .
On the similar lines , more efficient methods can be devised to exploit the slow update characteristics on the Archived Shard .
The above illustrations of 2 shards can be extended by partioning the Archived shard in to multiple Archived shards .
The readers may extend the thought to create their own hybrid sharding strategy .
Several directions on optimizations can also evlove .
For example , if an entity is created in ith shard out of n time sliced shards , then all relationships exist only from ith shard to the nth shard , hence any query requesting for the relationships of that entity need not be fired to the shards from 0 to i- 1 .
There are of course pros and cons to the given approach and a traditional approach .
I will leave that up to the readers to analyze in the context of their problem in hand .
SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea launched a long - range rocket Sunday in what U.S. and South Korean officials deemed a provocative act .
A recent satellite image shows a rocket sitting on its launch pad in northeast North Korea .
While the United States and South Korea confirmed the rocket launch , the payload of the rocket remained unclear .
North Korea has said the rocket was to carry a satellite into space , but the United States , South Korea and other nations fear it could be a missile with a warhead attached .
" With this provocative act , North Korea has ignored its international obligations , rejected unequivocal calls for restraint , and further isolated itself from the community of nations , " U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement .
" We will immediately consult with our allies in the region , including Japan and ( South Korea ) , and members of the U.N. Security Council to bring this matter before the Council , " Obama added .
" I urge North Korea to abide fully by the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and to refrain from further provocative actions . "
A senior Obama administration official in Washington confirmed that the rocket did clear Japan .
Japan 's chief Cabinet secretary told reporters after the launch that the country 's military was not forced to intercept any missiles , which it had pledged to do if necessary .
Preliminary data show that two objects , likely boosters from the rocket , apparently fell around Japan , one in the Sea of Japan and one in the Pacific Ocean .
The rocket -- launched at about 11:30 a.m. local time on Sunday ( 2:30 a.m. GMT ) -- was a " provocative act in violation " of U.N. Security Council resolution on North Korea 's weapons program , Fred Lash , a State Department spokesman , told reporters .
An October 2006 resolution condemned North Korea for missile launches in the summer and a nuclear test that same month .
Watch the debate about what North Korea is allowed to do »
The office of the South Korean president condemned the launch , calling it a " serious threat " to world peace , the state - run Yonhap news agency reported .
" We cannot withhold our regrets and disappointment that North Korea has caused such a serious threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the world by firing a long - range rocket when the entire world is joining efforts to overcome the global economic crisis , " Lee Dong - kwan , a presidential spokesman said , according to Yonhap .
On Friday , Obama reiterated that the United States strongly opposes any such launch .
" We have made it very clear to the North Koreans that their missile launch is provocative , it puts enormous strains on the six - party talks and that they should stop the launch , " Obama said while on a stop in France .
Obama warned that the United States will join with its allies to take " appropriate steps " to let North Korea know it can't violate United Nations rules and get away with it .
Earlier Sunday , before the launch , South Korea 's national security council called an emergency meeting amid concerns that a North Korean rocket launch was imminent , a presidential spokesperson said .
Also , Japan 's representative to the United Nations , Yukio Takasu , sent a letter requesting an urgent Security Council meeting in response to the launch .
The letter to Claude Heller , Mexico 's representative and the current security council president , was sent minutes after news of the launch broke .
Western nations fear that North Korea plans a ballistic missile test rather than a satellite launch , but the Obama administration 's special envoy to the six - party talks , Stephen Bosworth , said last week that it did n't matter if the North Koreans were trying to put a satellite in space or testing a ballistic missile that could threaten Japan or the United States .
" Whether it is a satellite launch or a missile launch , in our judgment makes no difference .
It is a provocative act , " Bosworth said .
Bosworth said the U.S. stands ready -- after a launch -- to participate in United Nations deliberations on new sanctions against North Korea .
U.S. Rep. Howard Berman , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , issued a statement late Saturday .
" It is alarming that North Korea carried out this missile launch in direct defiance of the international community , " Berman said .
" The test is an unnecessary provocation that raises tensions in the region , and I urge the North Koreans to stop using their missile and WMD programs to threaten their neighbors and the rest of the world . "
CNN 's Jie -Ae Sohn in Seoul , and Charlie Keyes and Elise Labott in Washington contributed to this report .

Many of us have fraught relationships with our cash : now psychologists are starting to work out why ( Image : Image Source / Rex )
Find out what science can tell us about the credit crunch – and how to solve it – in our special feature
Dough , wonga , greenbacks , cash .
Just words , you might say , but they carry an eerie psychological force .
Chew them over for a few moments , and you will become a different person .
Simply thinking about words associated with money seems to makes us more self - reliant and less inclined to help others .
And it gets weirder : just handling cash can take the sting out of social rejection and even diminish physical pain .
This is all the stranger when you consider what money is supposed to be .
For economists , it is nothing more than a tool of exchange that makes economic life more efficient .
Just as an axe allows us to chop down trees , money allows us to have markets that , traditional economists tell us , dispassionately set the price of anything from a loaf of bread to a painting by Picasso .
Yet money stirs up more passion , stress and envy than any axe or hammer ever could .
We just ca n’t seem to deal with it rationally … but why ?
Our relationship with money has many facets .
Some people seem addicted to accumulating it , while others can’t help maxing out their credit cards and find it impossible to save for a rainy day .
As we come to understand more about money ’s effect on us , it is emerging that some people ’s brains can react to it as they would to a drug , while to others it is …
Growth & Sustainability Surprise !
The rise and fall of the Western exurb

Surprise , Ariz. , does n't look very surprising .
It might be anywhere in the suburban West .
Home Depot and Wal - Mart rise like islands from an ocean of pavement , and late - model SUVs gleam in the midday sun .
Homes with red - tiled roofs line up like stucco boxes on a giant supermarket shelf .
There 's little to distinguish this from the hundreds of square miles of housing developments that have sprouted around Las Vegas and San Diego .
If it were n't for the palm trees , you could be in suburban Salt Lake City .
But only Surprise has the Radiant Church .
Inside this 55,000 - square - foot behemoth , 50 - inch plasma - screen televisions display huge images of American flags .
Starbucks - trained baristas serve up frothy espresso drinks , and the casually dressed congregation nibbles Krispy Kreme doughnuts .
The pastor , Lee McFarland , wears jeans and rides a Harley .
His uncanny ability to tap into the exurban zeitgeist made this the fastest - growing megachurch in one of the nation 's fastest - growing metro areas .
Radiant symbolizes the breakneck growth and prosperity that have come to define Surprise and its Western siblings .
Since it was incorporated in 1960 , Surprise -- an exurb of Phoenix -- has burgeoned from 500 people to over 100,000 people spread over 100 square miles .
Most of that growth happened in the last decade , and it happened largely independent of any economic base , such as manufacturing , mining , farming or even high - tech industry .
Instead , growth created its own economic base .
To the members of Radiant Church , it must have seemed like a miracle .
Now it seems more like a mirage .
On a warm day a few months back , about 200 people -- mostly female and Spanish - speaking -- stood in line in front of the church .
Many held small children , or scolded older ones for throwing the ubiquitous red landscaping rocks .
They were n't here for a sermon , or even for the doughnuts .
They came to take advantage of the church 's economic relief program , which distributes food , gas cards , and small cash payments to help with utility bills .
The church began the program last October , after it became clear that a profound shift had occurred in Surprise and the neighboring communities .
After a decade of riding high , the exurbs are in crisis .
In California , Nevada and Arizona , thousands of foreclosed homes sit empty , weeds reclaim vacant lots in new subdivisions and big - box stores are shutting down .
The local newspaper warns of roof rats infesting abandoned neighborhoods and mosquitoes colonizing unused swimming pools .
Many observers believe that this is only a slump , albeit a deep one , and that the old patterns of growth will someday return .
Others are n't so sure .
It 's possible , they say , that even after the national economic crisis subsides , the Western urban urge to expand rapidly and without limitation may have ended .
" I 'm not sure that the era of sprawl is over , " says Ed McMahon , senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute .
" But the paradigm of unlimited suburban and exurban growth has definitely shifted . "
The boom in Phoenix was founded on a basic truth : it was a place where many people wanted to live .
But the market turned irrational .
Investors bought homes they did not even bother to rent out .
They merely waited a few months until prices rose again so they could flip them .
Ordinary homeowners got caught up , too .
“ People saw themselves as cashing in on a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , ” Mr. Guntermann said .
Except for the few who managed to get out at the peak , it was a mistake .
By now , anyone who bought in Phoenix a decade ago would have lost money after inflation .
Many did not get off so easily .
Foreclosure notices were filed against one in 40 houses in the metropolitan area in the first quarter , according to RealtyTrac Inc .
That was the ninth - highest rate in the country .
The Case - Shiller data show that housing markets across the United States are still suffering .
Half of the 20 metropolitan areas in the index posted record year - over - year declines .
In all , the 20 - city index was down 2.2 percent from January .
From Atlanta to San Francisco to Chicago , not one of the 20 cities posted a gain in home prices from January to February , and values in all but five cities dropped by double digits from a year earlier .
The nearly 51 percent drop in Phoenix is not an isolated plunge .
Prices in Las Vegas are down some 48 percent from their peaks .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A White House official apologized Monday after he OK'd a large aircraft to fly low over Manhattan -- a sight that sent people reminded of 9/11 running in fear .
Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty .
" I was here on 9/11 , " said iReporter Tom Kruk , who saw the plane as he was getting coffee Monday morning and snapped a photo .
Kruk called the sight of the aircraft low in the sky " unsettling . "
The huge aircraft , which functions as Air Force
One when the president is aboard , was taking part in a classified , government - sanctioned photo shoot , the Federal Aviation Administration said .
" Last week , I approved a mission over New York .
I take responsibility for that decision , " said Louis Caldera , director of the White House Military Office .
" While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey , it 's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption . "
Watch people run in fear as plane flies overhead »
Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River .
It was accompanied by two F - 16s .
Two officials told CNN the White House Military Office was trying to update its file photos of Air Force One .
The officials said the president was angry when he learned Monday afternoon about the flight , which sparked fear in the New York - New Jersey area .
" The president was furious about it , " one of the officials said .
The incident outraged many New Yorkers , including Mayor Michael Bloomberg .

" First thing is , I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , " he said , calling the aviation administration 's decision to withhold details about the flight " ridiculous " and " poor judgment . "
" Why the Defense Department wanted to do a photo op right around the site of the World Trade Center defies the imagination , " he said .
" Had we known , I would have asked them not to . "
Watch the White House respond to questions about the scare »
Linda Garcia - Rose , a social worker who counsels post - traumatic stress disorder patients in an office just three blocks from where the World Trade Center towers once stood , called the flight an " absolute travesty . "
" There was no warning .
It looked like the plane was about to come into us , " she said .
" I 'm a therapist , and I actually had a panic attack . "
Garcia - Rose , who works with nearly two dozen post - traumatic stress disorder patients ages 15 to 47 , said she was inundated with phone calls from patients Monday morning .
" They 're traumatized .
They 're asking ' How could this happen ? '
They 're nervous .
Their anxiety levels are high , " she said .
Garcia - Rose is considering filing a class - action suit against the government for sanctioning the plane 's unannounced flight .
" I believe the government has done something really wrong , " she said .
Capt .
Anna Carpenter of Andrews Air Force Base said local law enforcement agencies and the Federal Aviation Administration had been given notice of the exercise .
New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne said the department had been alerted to the flight by the federal agency " with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it . "
Sen .
Chuck Schumer echoed the mayor 's sentiments in a separate news conference Monday afternoon , saying the Federal Aviation Administration should have notified the public to avoid panic .
" It is absolutely outrageous and appalling to think that the FAA would plan such a photo shoot and not warn the public , knowing full well New Yorkers still have the vivid memory of 9/11 sketched in their minds , " the New York Democrat said .
Schumer said the FAA 's decision to not announce the fly - by " really borders on being either cruel or very very stupid . "
Building evacuations took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City , New Jersey .

This year may be a disastrous one for the global economy , but it ’s shaping up to be one of the best that Heather Eisenlord has enjoyed in a good long while .
Granted , that might not be saying much :
For the past five years , Ms. Eisenlord has been an associate at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom , a notably grueling place for a lawyer to work .
But even by more stringent standards of fun , the coming year looks pretty good .
Ms. Eisenlord , 36 , who works in Skadden ’s banking group , will be buying a plane ticket that will take her around the world for a year , and she ’s been stocking her apartment in Brooklyn with Lonely Planet travel guides .
Although she ’s not yet sure exactly what she ’ll be doing on her trip , she has some ideas .
She would like to teach English to monks in Sri Lanka and possibly help bring solar power to remote parts of the Himalayas .
She ’ll probably hit 10 to 15 destinations around the world , most likely practicing not - for - profit law wherever she can be helpful .
The best part of all : Skadden is paying her about $ 80,000 to do it .
For a sixth - year associate at a New York law firm , $ 80,000 is n’t exactly competitive pay .
But for someone cruising around the world , doing good wherever she sees fit and , let ’s face it , probably hitting a beach or two , the pay is excellent .
Imagine those Amtrak conversations between Joe Biden and Arlen Specter .
The vice president ’s devotion to taking the train home to Wilmington , Del. , is legend .
It turns out that besides reinforcing his commitment to mass transit , Biden ’s commute also gave him hours and hours of uninterrupted quality time with the senator from Pennsylvania .
Which he used to urge Specter to ditch the Republicans .
“ We have talked over every problem under the sun and under the moon , ” said Specter , at a welcome - to - the - Democratic - Party press conference with Biden and President Obama .
Biden , Washington ’s most compulsive talker , and Specter , one of the Senate ’s most self - absorbed egos , rode the rails , sharing their every thought .
Probably not in the quiet car .
You ’d think that by the time one of them paused to take a breath they ’d be in Montreal .
On Wednesday , Biden was bounding around with excitement at his coup , and who could blame him ?
Heaven knows Obama deserved some good fortune .
Other than Specter ’s defection , the best news the president got on his 100th day in office was probably word that the Department of Homeland Security had eliminated the threat of swine flu by changing its name to the H1N1 flu .
Debra Saunders is a conservative columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle who has a history of writing misleading contrarian pieces on climate change .
She contacted NASA Public Affairs recently for a comment on the initial glitch on the October GHCN numbers ( see this earlier post for discussions of that ) .
They forwarded the query to me and since her questions were straightforward , I answered them as best I could .
Indeed in her subsequent column , she quotes me accurately and in context .
However , the rest of her column shows none of the same appreciation for basic journalistic standards .
She starts by asking why newspapers are no longer trusted – a good question , and one that may indeed be answerable .
However the column quickly goes off the rails .
First off , her headline “ When the warmest year in history is n’t ” does n’t appear to be related to any actual content .
Possibly it refers to the 1934/1998 hoohah from last year ( again see posts passim for discussion on its irrelevance to global warming ) .
Journalists do n’t generally write their own headlines , but a vague connection to current events is the more usual practice .
Next , she gets the Oreskes ’ Science and society paper story completely wrong ( it was a sampling of literature and survived numerous challenges to its validity – see here and here ) .
Then she uncritically quotes David Bellamy ( a late - developing contrarian who used to present natural history programs on the BBC ) who appears to think that an anti-GW article he wrote in 2004 is responsible for him not presenting BBC documentaries since 1994 ( an event he had previously blamed on his running against John Major ( then UK prime minister ) in an election ) .
She then throws in a few completely untrue ‘ facts ’ ( i.e. “ in every year since 1998 , world temperatures have been getting colder ” ( not ) and “ in 2002 , Arctic ice actually increased ” ( no it did n’t ) or that there ‘ has been no statistically significant warming since 1995 ″ ( wrong again : 0.21 +/- 0.13 deg C/dec GISTEMP , OLS , 95 % CI ) ) .
However , note that she is quoting Bellamy and Lindzen here , so that it can be plausibly claimed that she is just reporting the statements rather than endorsing their nonexistent truth value .
Sneaky .
She even quotes Marc Morano and the Erika Lovley Politico.com column in support of a contention that the consensus is collapsing .
Oh dear .
In fact , the only bit of original reportage in the piece comes from the email from me ; the rest of the article is simply a cut-and - paste of untrue and unverified claims strung together in a facsimile of logical argument .
Why is it so hard for newspapers to insist that their columnists at least make an effort to check their facts ?
If she can email NASA about the GHCN issue , she could have emailed any number of people about the other points she made if she ’d wanted to get it right .
The sad thing is that this kind of empty rhetoric is being employed at a time when maximum intellectual effort needs to be put into dealing with the energy and climate situation .
As I ’ve said elsewhere , the reflexive refusal of some commentators ( on the right and , occasionally , the left ) to come to terms with the reality of climate change is profoundly disappointing and an abdication of their potentially constructive role in public life .
If Ms. Saunders wants an answer for why “ people do n’t trust newspapers ” , she need only fact - check her own column .
Last night , Larry Lessig tweeted that Warner Music had sent a takedown notice to YouTube over one of his presentations , claiming that it infringed their copyright .
Lessig , of course , is one of the nation 's leading legal scholars , particularly when it comes to fair use and electronic media .
His presentations are filled with examples of companies like Warner sending bogus takedowns over fair - use inclusion of their copyrights in YouTube videos .
And there 's a burgeoning body of law that affords stiff penalties to companies that send these bogus takedowns .
Oh , this should be good .

The number of people being made bankrupt hit an all - time high during the last three months of 2008 , as the country 's worst recession in three decades left thousands of individuals unable to pay their debts .
The number of companies being forced into administration also more than tripled during the quarter , as businesses struggled to refinance loans and raise necessary new capital .
The statistics reaffirmed the bleak state of Britain 's economy , with economists and politicians predicting that the numbers were likely to rise even further over the coming year .

The increase in the number of people declaring themselves insolvent was particularly high in Scotland and Northern Ireland – jumping 75 and 39 per cent respectively in the final quarter of 2008 , compared to the same period a year ago .
In England and Wales , there was an 18.5 per cent jump in personal insolvencies .
In total , 35,694 people declared themselves insolvent across the UK during the quarter .
" While the substantial cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England will obviously help some people , they are likely to be insufficient to save many from insolvency , " said Howard Archer , the chief UK economist for Global Insight , the financial consultants .
" The many people who had to stretch themselves to the absolute limit to get into the housing market in recent years are particularly vulnerable .
Obviously the more that house prices fall , the more people will be trapped with negative equity .
And it is those people with the weakest credit ratings that are being hardest hit by tighter lending conditions and more punitive terms . "
Of the personal insolvencies in England and Wales , around two - thirds were accounted for by full bankruptcy declarations , while the remainder were Individual Voluntary Arrangements ( IVAs ) – agreements which allow consumers to write down a proportion of their debts without having to suffer the full consequences of bankruptcy .
Debt management agencies expressed concern about the faster growth in bankruptcies , claiming that too many people considered them " a quick fix " .
Bev Budsworth , an insolvency practitioner for the Debt Advisor , said the profile of those claiming for bankruptcy was also changing .
" We are increasingly being approached by high net worth individuals from the City , that have accrued large mortgages and outstanding debt and , due to losing their job , are struggling to meet all their repayments – even if their partner is still earning , " she says .
" These people are not receiving the help and support they need as household income is just above the threshold for various state benefits , even though they have paid substantial amounts of contributions for most of their lives .
Increasingly , these people are not meeting repayments and perceive bankruptcy as the only way out . "
Nick O'Reilly , the president of insolvency professionals ' trade body R3 , added : " What today 's figures mean is that in 2008 we saw a staggering 350 people becoming insolvent in the UK every day .
For 2009 our members believe this number will reach in excess of 430 people a day for the whole of the UK .
The outlook is bleak for the next two years , when insolvency practitioners expect to see in excess of 158,000 personal insolvencies annually .
We 'll start to see the knock - on effects of increasing business failures and redundancies on personal financial situations . "

The effect of the slowdown on businesses was particularly severe in the fourth quarter , with some 4,600 companies being liquidated in England and Wales during the period – an increase of more than 51 per cent on the final quarter of 2007 , and the largest number for 15 years .
Meanwhile , more than 2,000 companies were forced into administration during the period , up 251 per cent on the same quarter a year ago .
" This shows that the banking crisis has spilled over into the real economy , forcing thousands of people and businesses to the wall , " said Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman .
" We are now paying the price for a credit bubble which Gordon Brown allowed to soar hopelessly out of control .
With Britain facing a worsening recession , the number of bankruptcies may well get considerably worse before it gets better .
It is critical that the Government concentrates on creating new jobs and sorting out the banks so they restart lending to solvent businesses and individuals . "
Bankruptcy :
What it means
* Is bankruptcy an easy option ?
It is not difficult to declare yourself bankrupt – anyone can make a petition to the local court – but you would be wrong to think it 's an easy way out of your debts .
If your petition is accepted and you 're declared bankrupt you 'll find it very difficult to get credit .
You 'll also find it harder to secure somewhere to live , as private landlords may be unwilling to accept tenants who have been bankrupt .
* But will I be free of all my debts ?
Not necessarily .
If your application for bankruptcy is accepted , most of your remaining assets will be sold off , with the proceeds distributed to your creditors .
Any shortfall will then be written off .
However , some debts – such as student loans and child support payments – are excluded from bankruptcy orders , so these debts wo n't be cancelled .
* How long does bankruptcy last ?
Usually for one year , during which you will have to abide by certain rules .
The bankruptcy will remain on your credit file for another six years .
* What are the alternatives to bankruptcy ?
A popular alternative is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement ( IVA ) , which allows you to write down some of your debts , and to consolidate the remainder into one monthly payment .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
Year - to - year membership statistics for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints place the Utah - based faith among the fastest - growing religious traditions in the U.S. and Canada .
Comparative statistics from the 2009 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches , which was released in February and uses church data from 2007 , show that among the 25 largest faith traditions in the U.S. , the LDS Church was one of four to chart membership increases over 2006 numbers .
According to the data , membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints grew by 1.6 percent from 2006 to 2007 .
At the same time , membership in both the Jehovah 's Witnesses and the Church of God of Cleveland , Tenn. , grew 2 percent .
The Assemblies of God grew by 1 percent .
The yearbook is published by the National Council of Churches and uses figures provided by different faiths .
Comparing growth rates among faith traditions can be like comparing " apples to hubcaps , " because churches vary in their methods for counting members , said Eileen Lindner , editor of the annual yearbook , which has compiled data on church membership , giving and personnel for more than 75 years .
Some churches record membership upon a person 's baptism as an infant and never alter the record , even if the person discontinues religious practice .
Other faiths count only adult members who meet detailed , vigorous attendance and financial contribution standards .
The value of the data is really in showing the year - to - year growth patterns within individual churches , Lindner said .
LDS Church data is considered highly reliable because the church employs professional demographers to track the numbers , she said .
Data released Saturday by the church placed its worldwide membership at 13.5 million as of Dec. 31 , 2008 .
That 's up from 13.1 million in 2007 , and 12.8 million in 2006 .
The data show more than half of the growth -- 265,593 -- were converts drawn to the faith by its missionary force of about 52,000 .
The balance came from other baptisms and children born into the church .
" The more the better , " said Elder Bruce D. Porter .
" But growth is not our main focus . "
Still , Latter - day Saints believe they are called to share the word of God and the message of what they consider a " restored Gospel " on Earth .
The church is known for its proselytizing missionaries around the world .
About 75 percent of church missionaries are men under age 26 .
Roughly 18 percent are women and about 7 percent are older couples .
The LDS church began in 1830 with just six members , primarily its founder Joseph Smith Jr. and his family .
The church has never had a negative growth year , Porter said .
" However , when we think of growth we do think only of numbers and statistics , " he said .
" We think also of the spiritual growth of our members . "
Latter - day Saint membership is primarily based on the number of individuals recorded after baptism , Porter said .
Annual membership counts also reflect the number of children born to members , but drops the youngsters from the roll if no baptism occurs by age 9 .
Names are also removed from the rolls if a member is excommunicated , voluntarily elects to resign from the church or when the church receives confirmation of a death , Porter said .
The church does n't make projections about membership growth , nor does it compare its numbers to those of other faiths , he said .
Numbers provided to The Associated Press by the church last week show that in 2007 , 54 percent of Latter - day Saints lived outside of North America .
The data show that over a 10 - year period beginning in 1997 , the church grew by 19 percent in the U.S. and Canada , adding roughly 77,500 members .
At the same time , some 2.1 million people joined the church outside North America , an increase of 43 percent .
Membership rose by 142 percent in Africa and by 50 percent in Asia .
The growth rate in Europe was the slowest at 17 percent .

AMD RV790 / Radeon HD 4890 Details
The new Radeon HD 4890 is technically based on a new GPU design , which was formerly codenamed RV790 , but fundamentally it is very similar to the RV770 - based Radeon HD 4870 .
The two GPUs share the same feature set , same compliment of shader processors ( 800 ) , texture units , and ROP configurations .
Because we 've covered the architectural details of the RV770 in a previous article , we wo n't do the same again here .
If you 'd like a little refresher , however , we 'd recommended checking out our Radeon HD 4800 series launch article from last year .
All of the details necessary to understand what 's going on under the Radeon HD 4890 's hood are in that article .
Although the features are technically very similar , the RV790 does differ from the RV770 in a number of ways .
Some may be tempted to say the RV790 is simply an overclocked RV770 , but that is not the case .
The RV790 at the heart of the Radeon HD 4890 is a new chip that is comprised of more transistors than the RV770 ( 959 M vs. 956M ) .
The additional transistors are dedicated to updates made to the core to support higher clock speeds .
According to AMD , the entire chip was re-timed and power distribution on the chip was altered .
In addition , a decap ring -- or ring of decoupling capacitors - - was implemented around the chip to reduce signal noise .
The changes to the core and the addition of the decap ring result in an increase in die and packaging size , but the end result is a GPU that can run at much higher clock speeds than the RV770 .
Mr Geithner has come under criticism for his handling of AIG Ailing insurer AIG will be required to pay back hugely controversial bonuses it awarded after taking public bail - out money , the US treasury secretary says .
In a letter to congressmen , Timothy Geithner also said $ 165 m ( £ 116 m ) would be taken from $ 30 bn the firm is due to get as part of its government bail - out .
The plan comes after Mr Geithner faced heavy criticism for his handling of the increasingly controversial issue .
Republicans said he should have done more to stop the bonuses being paid .
Channelling public anger Frustration has been growing over the bonuses , and reports say that AIG offices have received hate mail and even death threats .
On Monday President Barack Obama called the AIG bonuses " an outrage " .
The BBC's James Coomarasamy , in Washington , says these are uncomfortable times for Mr Obama .
AIG : QUICK FACTS 30 million US policy holders Operates in 130 countries Provides insurance to 100,000 companies and other entities
Obama ' outraged ' at AIG bonuses US media homes in on AIG
The president is trying to channel public anger over the bonuses without becoming the object of that anger himself , our correspondent says .
Republicans have raised questions about when Mr Obama was told about the bonuses - and also criticised Mr Geithner for not preventing the payments before they were paid .
In a letter to Congress leaders , Mr Geithner outlined the measures he had taken to try to stop the bonuses being paid .
He then confirmed that the bonus payments would be deducted from the next instalment of AIG's $ 180 bn bail - out package .
" We will impose on AIG a contractual commitment to pay the Treasury from the operations of the company the amount of the retention awards just paid , " Mr Geithner 's letter said .
" In addition , we will deduct from the $ 30bn in assistance an amount equal to the amount of those payments . "
Democrat threat Politicians have been anxious to criticise the bonuses - with one congressman even suggesting that AIG executives receiving bonuses should kill themselves before swiftly retracting his statement .
On Tuesday , the politicians ' anger was stoked by a letter from the attorney general of New York state , Andrew Cuomo , revealing more details of the bonuses .
If these contracts are not renegotiated immediately , we will take action
Democrat letter to AIG
Chorus of anger over AIG
He said that 73 AIG executives - including 11 who no longer work for the company - were each last week given bonuses worth more than $ 1 m .
Before Mr Geithner 's announcement , Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , had said several committees were looking at passing legislation this week to reclaim the money from AIG .
And Senate Democrats wrote to AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy on Tuesday calling on him to hand over the bonuses .
" If these contracts are not renegotiated immediately , we will take action to make American taxpayers whole by recouping all of the bonuses that AIG has paid out to its financial products unit , " the letter stated .
The financial products unit , the letter stated , is seen as being primarily responsible for the " near - failure of the company " .
Mr Liddy has said the bonuses were paid to honour contracts AIG agreed to before the firm 's value plummeted when the financial crisis set in last year .
He is due to testify before a House sub -committee on Wednesday .
Analysts predict he will face a tough set of questions .

Hemant Mehta , the Friendly Atheist , just wrote about a Texas state Representative who -- you might want to sit down , or maybe even lie on the floor as you read this -- wants the Institute for Creation Research to be able to grant Master of Science degrees .
OK , I 'll let you comically rub your eyes with your fists for a second , then check that yes , you did indeed read that correctly .
The ICR -- a wretched hive of scum and villainy -- thinks that it 's doing science research ( and boy is it not ) , and it 's not fair that they can't grant science degrees !
Now , this is not really surprising , seeing that the ICR can't grasp reality with both hands , a vise , and a lifetime supply of crazy glue , but still .
It 's funny .
So this poor sap in the State legislature is trying to get a bill passed to exempt the ICR from the ruling that they can't grant advanced degrees .
I 'll add that the bill is more general than that ; the original news item claims it 's driven by the ICR , but the bill itself would actually allow any private institution to grant advanced degrees in science , which would bring down even more chaos on the Lone Star State .
Unless you think a Masters of Astrology or a PhD in Flat Earth Studies is a good idea .
Given the level of insanity infecting Texas politics right now , I have no idea if this bill will pass or not .
The ICR tried to get permission to grant degrees in science in 2008 , and was roundly thumped by the state commissioner who told them bluntly that religion is n't science .
You should have little doubt -- just look at their name , for Pete 's sake -- that the ICR is not doing science .
It 's doing dogma .
Nothing will ever convince them the Earth is n't 6000 years old , and that the Bible is n't the literal truth .
Go ahead and check for yourself by searching their site , if you do n't mind having your irony gland exploding into a thin oily vapor .
I suspect a bill like this does n't have much a chance , but then the guy running the State Board of Education is an avowed creationist and thinks abstinence - only education is a grand idea , so there is literally no way of knowing this bill 's fate .
Let 's all cross our fingers , throw salt over our shoulders , and rub our lucky rabbit 's feet that it fails .
And these methods should work -- I have a PhD in Superstionism .
And , just to make sure I get on the ICR 's enemies list :
Last week , I wrote about the initial stumble by Miss California during the Miss USA Pageant , when she answered a question posed by Perez Hilton .
This is a new clip of Miss Cali claiming that she represents " not only my state , but the nation that I live in " with her views on gay marriage .
I believe that there are MANY people in the state of California that would strongly disagree that she represents THEM !
What do you think ?
After World War II , laissez - faire economists had a big intellectual problem : the Great Depression .
How could you argue for dismantling the post - WW II social insurance states and returning to the small - government laissez - faire of the past when that past contained the Great Depression ?
Some argued that the real problem was that the laissez of the past had not been faire enough : that everyone since Lord Salisbury and William McKinley had been too pinko and too interventionist , and thus the Great Depression was in no way the fault of believers in the free - market economy .
This was not terribly convincing .
So advocates of a smaller government sector needed another , more convincing argument .
It was provided by Milton Friedman .
Friedman proposed that with one minor , technocratic adjustment a largely unregulated free - market would work just fine .
That adjustment ?
The government had to control the " money supply " and keep it growing at a steady , constant rate -- no matter what .
Since money was what people used to pay for their spending , a smoothly - growing money supply meant a smoothly - growing flow of spending and , hence , no depressions , Great or otherwise .
In Friedman 's view , if the task of monetary stabilization could be accomplished via technocratic manipulations by a non-political central bank , there would be no need for much of the apparatus of the post - World War II social insurance state .
In the 1950s Friedman 's doctrines were considered way out there .
But his Keynesian adversaries overreached , and claimed that clever governments could maintain price stability and a high - pressure economy with " full " ( rather than merely " normal " ) employment .
By the 1970s , it was clear they were wrong .
Since then , advocates of expanded social democracy have been on the retreat more often than on the advance .
By the 1990s , even left - of - center politicians had come to respect central bankers ' mastery of the money supply , giving them a wide berth .
The power of Friedman ’s theory was , in part , rhetorical .
" Keep the money supply growing smoothly " sounds like it means to keep the presses in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing rolling at a constant pace , printing out a steady flow of pictures of George Washington .
But that is not how " money supply " actually works .
In economic reality , " money supply " means not just cash money but also credit entries the Federal Reserve has made in commercial banks ' accounts at the Fed ; plus all the credit entries commercial banks have made in households ' and businesses ' checking accounts ; plus savings account balances ; plus ( usually ) money market mutual - fund balances ; plus ( sometimes ) trade credit and the ceilings between credit card limits and consumers ' current balances .
No central banker controls all these vast and varied sluices of the money supply – at least not in economic reality .
When banks and businesses and households get scared and cautious and feel poor , they take steps to shrink the economic reality that is the " money supply . "
Businesses extend less trade credit .
Credit card companies cut off cards and reduce ceilings .
Banks call in loans and then take no steps to replace the deposits extinguished by the loan pay - downs .
Without a single bureaucrat making a single decision to slow down a single printing press , the money supply shrinks — disastrously in episodes like the Great Depression .
Thus in emergencies , to say that all the central bank has to do is to keep the money supply growing smoothly is very like saying that all the captain of the Titanic has to do is to keep the deck of the ship level .
For the past eighteen months the collective central banks of the world have been trying as hard as they can to keep the deck of the ship level .
Traditionally , central banks boost the money supply by buying government bonds from the Treasury for cash .
Buying government bonds for cash cuts the supply of bonds the private sector can acquire , boosting their price while lowering interest rates , making businesses more eager to spend to expand and making asset holders feel richer and thus more eager to spend to consume .
The central banks and finance ministries of the world have purchased so many government bonds for cash that they have pushed the prices of short - term government bonds up as high as they can possibly go .
With interest rates practically zero , there is no extra interest return to be gained in the short run from bonds .
Yet it has not been enough .
So increasingly over the past year , the central ministries of the globe have taken extra measures : they have guaranteed debts , they have partially or completely nationalized banks , they have forced weak institutions to merge with stronger ones , they have expanded their balance sheets to an extraordinary extent .
And yet this , too , has not been enough .
So now the central bankers have thrown up their hands , and asked for help to stimulate spending through tax cuts and government expenditures .
Because they have run out of means to " keep the money supply growing smoothly . "
Today , we have reached the end of the line for the Chicago view of financial deregulation .
Friedman thought ( a ) that the central bank could exercise enough influence over the money supply to effectively control it , and ( b ) that banks and other financial intermediaries would be regulated tightly enough that what is now happening would be impossible .
But he never resolved the tension between his view that banks need controls and the Chicago view that business must be unfettered .
Monetarism may well make a comeback -- as a doctrine that is good enough for normal times .
For in normal times " keep the money supply growing smoothly " does appear to be a relatively easy task , a minor adjustment to laissez - faire that can be performed by a small number of qualified technocrats .
Unfortunately , not all times are normal .

A nonprofit organization founded by California ’s largest union local reported spending nothing on its charitable purpose -- to develop housing for low - income workers -- during at least two of the four years it has been operating , federal records show .
The charity , launched by a scandal - ridden Los Angeles chapter of the Service Employees International Union , had total expenses of about $ 165,000 for 2005 and 2006 , and all of the money went to consulting fees , insurance costs and other overhead , according to its Internal Revenue Service filings .
Charity watchdogs say that nonprofits should never have zero program expenses in two successive years and that well - performing charities direct at least 70 % of their annual spending to their charitable purpose .
“ Of the 5,000 - plus charities we ’ve looked at , I do n’t think we ’ve ever seen one that did n’t spend anything on its charitable programs , ” said Sandra Miniutti , vice president of Charity Navigator , an online rating service .
Last year , the nonprofit reported spending $ 513,000 in connection with a Compton housing development , and $ 59,200 in consulting fees for its charitable programs , which together accounted for about 88 % of its total outlays .
The primary mission of the charity -- the Long Term Care Housing Corp. -- is to provide affordable homes for the local ’s members , most of whom earn about $ 9 an hour caring for the elderly and infirm .
But SEIU officials declined to discuss the charity , saying it is a separate legal entity from the union , even though its board is dominated by officials from the local .
The charity is located at the local ’s headquarters .
Tyrone Freeman , then president of the 160,000 - member United Long - Term Care Workers , helped start the charity in 2004 .
Freeman and the local are the subjects of a federal criminal probe and a congressional inquiry because of his spending practices .
After an internal investigation , the SEIU accused Freeman and another former union officer of receiving improper payments from the nonprofit .
Freeman , who stepped aside in August , less than two weeks after The Times first reported on his financial dealings , has been banned for life from SEIU membership or employment .
The SEIU has ordered him to pay the union more than $ 1 million in restitution .
Attorneys for Freeman and others involved in the charity declined to comment .
The nonprofit is also caught up in the federal and internal investigations .
The Times reported that the charity had listed the home of a union official as its administrative address , had failed to obtain a federal tax exemption and had lost the right to do business in California .
The charity had also claimed to have a relationship with the prominent California Community Foundation , which said it had never heard of the organization .
Exemption granted
Despite the legal troubles , the IRS has since granted the group an exemption retroactive to 2004 , and its right to do business has been restored , according to the California secretary of state ’s office .
IRS officials declined to discuss the matter .
The charity did not file an IRS return -- a Form 990 -- in 2004 , apparently because it had revenues of less than the reporting threshold of $ 25,000 .
In 2005 , it sold $ 495,000 in unspecified “ inventory ” and made nearly $ 87,000 in gross returns from the sale , its sole reported source of revenue that year , according to the IRS documents .
Los Angeles County assessor records show that the nonprofit sold two Compton homes in 2005 for amounts that totaled $ 495,000 .
It could not be determined why the nonprofit did not report where it obtained the $ 495,000 in inventory , or why it did not list any part of the transaction as a charitable program expense .
The charity reported paying consulting fees of $ 31,000 in 2005 and nearly $ 68,000 the following year but did not specify who received the money .
In 2006 , the union donated $ 50,120 to the nonprofit , which appeared to be the charity ’s only income .
The nonprofit ended the year with a $ 56,000 deficit and a negative net worth .
In 2007 , the charity reported revenue of $ 633,000 , although it did not specify the source .
It listed its biggest expenses as the $ 513,000 for a contractor for the Alameda Court project in Compton , described on the city ’s website as a 28 - town - house development ; and $ 60,385 for consultant services from Kenya Nelson , who is identified on the nonprofit ’s website as the organization ’s executive director .
The charity again had a negative net worth , and a $ 17,850 deficit .
Attempts to reach Nelson were unsuccessful .
John Ronches , an SEIU trustee who has been running the local since Freeman stepped down , declined to comment .
Transparency urged
Laurie Styron , vice president of the American Institute of Philanthropy , said the nonprofit should be more forthcoming .
“ Charities have an ethical obligation to be transparent , ” she said .
The SEIU has accused Freeman of taking about $ 2,400 a month in improperpayments from the housing nonprofit from January through June of this year , in addition to a lump sum of $ 14,500 .
The payments were part of a self - dealing “ consulting agreement , ” the SEIU said in a report .
The union said Freeman “ controlled and directed ” the charity .
Freeman ’s former chief of staff , Rickman Jackson , whose Bell Gardens home was listed as the charity ’s address , has been ousted as president of the SEIU ’s largest Michigan local because , the union alleges , he received improper lease payments of $ 33,500 from the nonprofit .
Jackson , who was president of the nonprofit ’s board , could not be reached .
Former California Atty . Gen. John Van de Kamp , who has been advising the SEIU on its internal investigation , said the union could determine that only one nonprofit meeting was held at the Bell Gardens home .
Jackson is repaying the $ 33,500 in installments plus interest , an SEIU spokeswoman said .
In the meantime , Compton is investigating whether Freeman and the nonprofit defrauded the city by accepting a gift of municipal land when it had no tax exemption .
An attorney for the charity , former Assemblyman Dario Frommer , said the charity is cooperating in the investigation .
He declined to comment further .
Attorneys for the nonprofit have said the initial failure to obtain the tax exemption was the result of a “ routine ” IRS request for more information .

I visited the opening night showcase , and was able to get a peek at most of the entries .
I saw some beautiful bikes , some silly bikes , and some extremely interesting bikes .
Though I did not spend enough time at this year ’s Manifest events to provide a thorough or detailed report , I will write here about some of the bikes I saw that will be of interest to my readers .
( If you care to read a very thorough , well - written , and well - informed report , get your hands on the Winter 2011 issue of Bicycle Quarterly . )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. schools with vending machines that sell candy and soda to students could soon find the government requiring healthier options to combat childhood obesity under a bill introduced on Thursday by two senators .

While school meals must comply with U.S. dietary guidelines , there are no such rules on snacks sold outside of school lunchrooms .
Many are high in fat , sugar and calories .
Senators Tom Harkin and Lisa Murkowski said their bill would allow the U.S. Agriculture Department to establish “ common - sense nutrition standards ” for food and beverages sold in school vending machines , stores and similar outlets .
Harkin , an Iowa Democrat , chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee , which oversees school lunch and breakfast programs that cost an estimated $ 11 billion a year in federal money .
U.S. child nutrition programs such as school lunches and the Women , Infants and Children feeding program are due for renewal this year .
An Agriculture Committee spokesman said one option would be to include the legislation introduced today as part of the broader reauthorization later in 2009 .
“ Poor diet and physical inactivity are contributing to growing rates of chronic disease in the United States , ” said Harkin , a Democrat .
“ We must take preventative action now . ”
An estimated 32 percent of U.S. children fit the government ’s definition of being overweight and 16 percent are considered obese , at risk for serious health problems .
Murkowski , a Republican from Alaska , said the bill was a response to “ the youth obesity epidemic . ”
Harkin and Murkowski have offered similar legislation in prior years .
The measure could have a better chance of passing this year with U.S. President Barack Obama ’s administration recognizing obesity as a top U.S. health threat .
Consumer and health advocacy groups including the American Dietetic Association , American Heart Association and the Center for Science in the Public Interest support the legislation .
Reginald Felton of the National School Boards Association said states and local communities should determine what is sold beyond federal programs because a “ one - size fits all policy ” would not sufficiently address the needs on a smaller level .
He also noted that some schools rely on snack sales to help cover costs .
“ It ’s intrusive for the federal government to establish requirements beyond the programs that they fund , particularly when states are addressing the issue , ” said Felton .
“ If local boards want to restrict they should . ”
Math has never exactly been my forté .
If it involves food , however , I 'll give it a whack .
On first glance these fractal snowflake cupcakes are seemingly simple , with a series of triangles and what have you thrown together to make a darling little shape that reminds me of arts and crafts time .
How wrong I was .
These cakes require some serious math .
Lets break it down , shall we ?
It all starts with a " simple " algorithm .
The Koch snowflake algorithm consists of three identical Koch curves , which essentially make one large triangle .
This triangle is cut into four smaller triangles made of blue fondant and then centered on another larger triangular base which is made of white fondant .
This process of making four triangles from stretched blue fondant and adding a triangle of white fondant , then putting them together , stretching , and then making four more triangles is repeated until " the limit of your patience " or until the fondant becomes no longer manageable .
Now , I can't exactly say that I will be whipping out the fondant for this one , but I have nothing but admiration for the brilliant minds who are able to successfully complete the Koch fractal snowflake cupcake and would gladly eat one ( or five ) to show my approval .

Hi all .
Quaid here .
Richard Kelly ’s
The Box is a movie that I ’ve had on my radar for a number of months now ( a year , maybe ?
More ? ) , but that I have n’t heard much about in a while .
Well , now Mr. Kelly himself is updating us all with the status of the project via his MySpace page .
In case you do n’t know , the movie is about a couple that finds a mysterious box .
With the push of a button , the box promises to deliver you $ 1 million .
But there ’s a catch ( of course there is ) .
One person ( who you do n’t know ) somewhere in the world … will DIE !!!
This premise sounds very very contrived , but who cares .
I am about the biggest Donnie Darko fan you can find , and I am one of the seven people in the world who loved the insane , off - the - wall and over - stuffed coolness of Kelly ’s Southland Tales .
Anything he does has me there opening day .
Here are the details :
Hello everyone ,
It ’s been a while since I ’ve blogged ( been busy completing the script for FILM # 4 ) , so I thought I ’d give some facts on THE BOX , just to clarify things for people .
- WB is releasing the film on October 30 , 2009 .
The release date has been shuffling around a bit , but this is common with studios , and everyone feels like this is the best date for the film .
- The film is completely finished .
Principal photography was completed in March 2008 , and it was officially delivered to WB right before Christmas 2008 .
A March 2009 release was briefly considered , but a Fall 2009 release was always a better fit .
- We shot in Massachusetts and Virginia .
The film takes place predominantly in Virginia , 1976 .
- The running time is 1 hour 55 minutes long including end credits .
- The film was digitally photographed using the Panavision Genesis camera .
In my audio commentary on Tony Scott ’s Domino , I mentioned that I would never shoot a 1970s period piece using a digital camera .
My position on this changed when I saw David Fincher ’s extraordinary Zodiac .
It can be done .
- There is more than 300 visual effects shots , which required eight months of post - production .
The digital work - flow of the Genesis was essential to completing these visual effects properly .
- Win Butler , Regine Chassagne ( of Arcade Fire ) and Owen Pallett ( Final Fantasy , frequent collaborator with Arcade Fire ) recorded more than 80 minutes of score for the film .
- Here is a list of artists whose songs appear in the film : GRATEFUL DEAD , DEREK & THE DOMINOS , WILSON PICKETT , THE MARSHALL TUCKER BAND , SCOTT WALKER
- The official website for the film is www.thebox-movie.com – it will unveil sometime this summer .
This is my most personal film to date , and I ’m very proud of how it turned out .
So that ’s an update from me .
I will continue to update you as things progress and expect more updates from our company Darko Entertainment ( www.darko-entertainment.com) and our upcoming releases WORLD ’S GREATEST DAD , I HOPE THEY SERVE BEER IN HELL , and ROGUES GALLERY .

UPDATE – It was pointed out to me by TheGuyInThePJs below that the teaser poster for The Box can be found HERE .

MILLSBORO , Del . -
It seems simple enough .
Save money on groceries by growing some at home .
Forty - three million households reportedly plan to grow vegetables at home this year .
That is a 19 percent increase from last year .
But novice gardeners need to make sure they are investing in the right kind of plants to save money .
Experts say easy plants ( with good returns for your investment ) are : tomatoes , squash , zucchini , onions , and herbs .
Bob Shipe of East Coast Garden Center estimates that produce you grow yourself costs one - fifth of what it does at the supermarket .
" It 's a tremendous amount of crops there you could plant that would give you your money back , " Shipe said .
He says for a 16 square - foot garden , the startup costs and plants would be about $ 100 - - but over the next year , it would save you about $ 500 at the grocery store .
The startup costs for the garden 's second year would be even less .
Shipe says the only cost is the for the plants , about $ 20 .
Novice gardeners beware , some plants are not user - friendly for a first - time gardener .
Shipe recommends new gardeners avoid planting broccoli , cauliflower , and brussel sprouts .
Snipe says you can you save even more money by buying seeds instead of starter plants , but you just have to plan ahead a little bit more .
Most seed plants need to go in the ground right about now .
Starter plants can go in the ground May 5 , Snipe sad .
That is to avoid any late frost that could wipe out your whole investment .
Much of history is the tale of luxuries becoming necessities .
I remember my surprise when I read that the discovery of America was partly caused by a desire to reach the Spice Islands , to get those luxuries for wealthy Europeans without having to use the existing trading systems .
But can things go the other way ?
The Pew Research Center is out with a poll today that seems to say they can .
Whether this is a brief , recession - induced pause , or a real change , is not easy to say .
The response that most impressed me was to the question of whether home air conditioning was a necessity .
In 2006 , 70 percent deemed it a necessity .
This year the figure was down to 54 percent .
Dishwashers , clothes dryers , microwave ovens and television sets are also seen as necessities by fewer people now than in 2006 .
Overall , 52 percent think a television is a necessity .
That is the lowest figure since that question was first asked in 1973 .
The television breakdown is interesting .
The older you are , the more likely you are to view it as a necessity .
Among those over 65 , 68 percent think a set is a necessity , compared to 38 percent of those age 18 to 29 .
But both those figures are down from three years ago .
Similarly , the young are more likely to view a cellphone as a necessity , and less likely to see a need for a landline .
There ’s been no significant change in the number deeming a computer for home use to be a necessity ( 50 percent this year , 51 percent in 2006 ) .
But I am surprised it did not grow .
The proportion who deem high - speed Internet service to be a necessity also showed no significant change ( 31 percent this year , 29 percent in 2006 ) .
And appearances to the contrary , only 4 percent of Americans think an iPod is a necessity .
What is Human Achievement Hour ?
Human Achievement Hour is the Competitive Enterprises Institute ’s annual celebration of innovation and progress .
During this hour , people around the world pay tribute to human ingenuity and advancements in every field from healthcare and energy to communications and transportation .
These achievements by entrepreneurs and innovators allow us to live richer and fuller lives .
They also help us solve problems and protect ourselves and our families in unpredictable situations , like emergencies and disasters .
Take Action : Celebrate Innovation
Saturday , March 24 , 2018
8:30 – 9:30 PM
( all time zones )
Celebrate Human Achievement
Hour by sharing your favorite human achievement on Facebook and Twitter !
What innovations make your life safer , healthier , and happier ?
Use the hashtag # HAH2018 to tweet examples and photos to @ceidotorg .
During Human Achievement
Hour , will you be :
Checking social media from your smartphone ?
Watching your favorite TV show or movie thanks to satellite technology ?
Participating in the craft brewing revolution with a cold drink ?
Facetiming or Skyping with far - off friends and family ?
Traveling home from a night out with a rideshare driver ?
Relaxing at home with plenty of food , heat , and hot water for your family ?
However you spend the hour , please remember that human ingenuity , affordable energy , and the freedom to create and innovate are making life better for billions of people around the world every day — from life expectancy and disease treatment to literacy rates and increased employment .
Throwing up barriers and restrictions that slow down these improvements have real costs , especially for the poor and most vulnerable among us .
History of Human Achievement Hour :
Originally launched as an alternative to “ Earth Hour , ” an activist campaign that calls on people to show their concern about climate change by turning off their lights for an hour , Human Achievement Hour challenges people to celebrate human ingenuity and our ability to solve problems creatively .
Today , some environmental activists view mankind as a plague upon an otherwise pristine and virtuous planet , calling for a smaller human population , limits on energy use , and government restrictions on valuable new technology .
Rather than putting a vibrant economy and human know - how to use , we hear fearmongering about living in a resource - constrained world – poorer than our ancestors – with government restrictions on what we can grow , use , mine , harvest , and create .
This is an overly - pessimistic vision of our shared future that ignores how affordable energy sources — like oil , natural gas , and coal — are vital to human survival .
It also fails to explain why , even as population has boomed over the last 50 years , people around the globe are healthier and wealthier than ever before .
Technology , affordable energy , and the competitive economies that brought electricity to the developed world are precisely what will allow us to continue to prosper as we address the global challenges ahead .
Instead of sitting in the dark , Human Achievement Hour asks us all to celebrate the human spirit — and support a free society in which ever greater success is possible .
a MAGICAL liopleurodon [ Apr. 1st , 2009 | 06:15 pm ] herrdoctor
I realized today that ' Charlie the Unicorn ' is an indictment of organized religion .
The Atheist ( Charlie ) is hassled by two priests who try to show him Heaven ( Candy Mountain ) via their holy book ( a map ) .
After much badgering he finally agrees to go look , mostly to shut them up but also to perhaps help them realize that there is no such place .
After a time they come to a guide ( a Magical liopleurodon ) who talks nonsense which the two priests claim is directions but which is really just random noise .
Finally they come to what they claim is Heaven - much to the astonishment of the atheist .
A song is sung and our hero is essentially forced into heaven ( converted if you will ) where he is knocked out and his kidney is removed .
The clincher is that the priests KNOW that it is fake .
They deliberately fool this poor person into a way of life that is detrimental to his well being to better their own lifestyle .
Fuckers .
Gary North , Y2 K , and Hidden Agendas
by Mike Lorenz
Caveats
Before I dive in , I feel I should preface my remarks with a few caveats .
First of all , I 'm a software programmer , so I 'm not a bona fide expert on any fields that are relevant to these topics .
I do n't have a PhD in economics or political science like some of the conspiracy theorists ( and cab drivers ) do , so perhaps I 'm speaking from a viewpoint of some ignorance .
I 'll admit that .
I 'll also admit that I 'm a bit sarcastic at times .
But that 's just me trying to turn something very bitter into something funny .
It 's how I cope .
Remember , I 'm just expressing my opinions here , and that 's all .
Introduction
This essay got started because of Art Bell and Gary North .
Bell had North on his show sometime in May 1998 talking about the Year 2000 ( Y2 K ) crisis about to hit the world .
This was the first time I had ever heard of Art Bell , and although I had been to North 's site once before , I was pretty new to him too .
When I first heard the show , it hit me hard .
I mean , here was a pretty rational - sounding moderator asking pretty rational - sounding questions , and he was becoming convinced .
In the course of a couple of hours , he was turned from a skeptic to a believer , and so was I .
But I did n't take this all at face value .
I started doing some digging .
I was n't looking for anything bad -- just some facts that would show whether North is on the level , and whether the downside potential of the Y2 K situation was really as bad as he said .
Unfortunately , it became like digging up an old outhouse : the deeper I dug , the more things started to stink .
Gary North : Not Who He Seems
Whenever I hear a doom - and - gloomer prophesying the End of the World As We Know It , I ask myself a few simple questions :
Is he a nut ?
Does he really believe what he 's saying ?
Does he have a hidden agenda ?
Is he selling something ?
At first , my answers to these questions were No , Yes , I do n't see one , and No .
But as time went on , these answers eroded into some very unsavory ones .
Let 's go over them point by point :
Is he a nut ?
Dr. Gary North has a PhD in economics , and is very articulate on the air .
He runs a web site with nearly 2000 links to articles and other sites dealing with various Y2 K issues , and running something that size takes a clear head -- I know that firsthand .
He 's obviously intelligent , and he does n't rant and rave and froth at the mouth .
At least not in public , when lots of people are watching .
But that does n't mean anything one way or the other .
In the end , it really depends on your own point of view , and what you consider a " nut " to be .
I have an essentially scientific view of life , so anyone who starts talking about astrology , Nostradamus , aliens living among us , etc. , automatically goes into my " nut " category , because they 're ready to believe things without sufficient proof .
Likewise , anyone with a strong religious agenda makes me nervous .
I do n't dismiss them as " nuts " because by default I respect anyone 's religious beliefs , but I do tend to steer clear of them : they 're often very dangerous people .
So is Gary North a nut ?
I do n't know , but I believe he is very scary and very dangerous .
I 'll expound on that a little later .
Does he really believe what he 's saying ?
Yes and no .
This answer ties in with the next one about his hidden agenda , so I 'll just answer it here and provide more details there .
Gary North believes -- and hopes -- with all his heart that there will be a major upheaval of our society and of the entire world 's civilized societies .
He discovered Y2 K and found that it fit his vision perfectly .
He did n't examine Y2 K first with an open mind and then conclude that it would cause major havoc .
He already believed that havoc was coming , and backed into Y2 K as a way to explain it .
Bottom line , if Y2 K were n't around , he would have found something else to predict an apocalypse .
In the 80's , he said it would be AIDS .
In the 90's , it 's Y2K .
And when civilization does not fall in 2000 , he 'll take a couple of years to regroup and find something else .
Does he have a hidden agenda ?
Yes , absolutely .
At first I was n't aware of it , because he stays fairly low - key about it during his radio appearances and at his web site , but he is attaching a huge Christian agenda to Y2 K .
And this explains a lot .
It explains why he's so obsessed by it , and why he often seems to take a tone that relishes the idea of the coming ( did I hear someone say second coming ? ) apocalypse .
This is so typical of the Christian right ( and just about any other religious group , for that matter ) , taking a complex issue and attaching a religious significance to it .
They did this with AIDS , for instance , saying it 's God 's way of punishing homosexuals .
But wait , what about hemophiliacs ?
Um , uh , go away kid , ya bother me .
What about the innocent children who have died of AIDS ?
Then they invoke the old standby , " the Lord moves in mysterious ways . "
Right .
Well , heck , people have been predicting the second coming since two weeks after Jesus died .
It has n't happened yet , and the odds that Y2 K is going to bring it on are pretty damn slim .
If God wanted a real apocalypse , I do n't think he'd need to go through all the trouble of influencing the minds of thousands of programmers over a forty - year period , telling them that two - digit years are a good idea .
Or of making sure the economics of mass storage were such that we would deem it too expensive to store four - digit years .
I mean , if he created the sun and the stars , he clearly has nuclear capability , so why pussyfoot around ?
Or even simpler , just fling a big ol ' asteroid at us .
After all , he did n't need Y2 K to deal with the dinosaurs .
Does Gary North have a hidden agenda ?
This is a quote directly from an email he sent in 1997 :
Of course I want to see y2 k bring down the system , all over the world .
I have hoped for this all of my adult life .
North is what is known as a Christian Reconstructionist , an extreme form of post - millennial , Calvinistic Protestantism .
Here 's his definition of Christian Reconstructionism from something he wrote almost 15 years ago ( " Backward Christian Soldiers ?
An Action Manual For Christian Reconstruction " -- Tyler , TX : Institute for Christian Economics , 1984 ) : Christian Reconstructionism is a recently articulated philosophy which argues that it is the moral obligation of Christians to recapture every institution for Jesus Christ .
It proclaims " the crown rights of King Jesus . "
The means by which this task might be accomplished -- a few CR's are not convinced that it can be -- is biblical law .
This is the " tool of dominion . "
We have been assigned a dominion covenant -- a God -given assignment to men to conquer in His name ( Gen 1:23 ; 9:1 - 7 ) .
The founders of the movement have combined four basic Christian beliefs into one overarching system : 1 ) biblical law , 2 ) optimistic eschatology , 3 ) predestination ( providence ) , and 4 ) presuppositional apologetics ( philosophical defense of the faith ) .
Y2 K is just the latest thing that North has attached himself to .
It 's a great , logical way to explain what he 's already believed and hoped for , for a long time .
For instance , he 's been a survivalist since the sixties .
Here 's an excerpt from his January ' 98 newsletter : Many newcomers ( post - 1980 ) to Christian Reconstruction do not know the early history of the movement .
For the record , I was an investor in the rural retreat set up by R. J. Rushdoony in 1965 - 66 .
So were my parents .
So were dozens of other families .
The property was located near San Luis Obispo , California .
The investors were people who had bought gold and silver based on Mr. Rushdoony 's recommendation ( and mine ) .
The project collapsed , as communes tend to do , in a nasty split .
No one ever actually moved there .
It was at the time of this survival center that he wrote his booklet , Preparation for the Future , in which he out - lined his hard - money , survivalist views .
Mr. Rushdoony now lives on the top of a hill in the gold mining country of California .
Would - be urban survivalists would salivate over his set - up .
He went there in 1976 to get away from Los Angeles .
He asked me to go there , too .
I did n't .
I went to Lynden , Washington -- still a safe place .
In short , the two founders of Christian Reconstruction preached survivalism and eventual social collapse even before there was a Christian Reconstruction paradigm -- before The Institutes of Biblical Law .
Mr. Lindsey 's sweeping statement about what Christian Reconstruction teaches on personal re- location is uninformed historically .
He was not present at the creation of this movement , and he obviously knows little of its early history .
R. J. Rushdoony got me into survivalism .
He has been far more consistent geographically in pursuing his vision than I have been .
I have now escalated my efforts to catch up with him on this point .
I suggest you do the same .
Soon .
Wait a minute .
This is from his newsletter ?
He has a newsletter ?
You bet .
And that leads us to the last question ...
Is he selling something ?
Do n't be fooled by his free web site , and his attempts to say that he 's doing all this to save lives .
He 's doing this to make money .
And he 's been in it for the money from the very beginning .
Some friends of mine recently received a 32 - page direct mail piece , and they were kind enough to give it to me .
I was truly astonished at what I had found , and it was one of the primary motivators to get me to write this page .
The mailer was advertising " The Remnant Review " , Gary North 's newsletter .
At first I thought it was a Y2 K newsletter he started recently when he discovered Y2 K , but no , he 's been doing this for 22 years !
And now for a mere $ 129 , I could receive 12 " valuable " issues and join the ranks of his followers .
This guy is slick , man .
He 's a real smart operator : he has a huge machine in place , busily extracting money from people with his newsletter , while at the same time , he operates his free web site and can claim that he 's doing it for the good of mankind .
Bull !
Let 's look at the numbers .
Here 's an email he sent a while back .
It shocked the hell out of me when I read it .
To : Charles Reuben From : Gary North Subject : Re : BS At 01:19 PM
7/17/97 -0500 , you wrote : >> .

Meanwhile , you 're showing guys property to buy .
I think my version will win out .
And i did n't capitalize oine pejorative phrase .
Yourdon has bought my 90 % of my analysis and is now publishing a survival book on it .
http://www.yourdon.com/books/fallback/fallbackhome.html
He is America 's one of the world 's senior programmers : two dozen books on the topic .
I do n't need your approval .
I 've got his .
He is clearly using one of my direct - mail ad pieces on his Web page summary of why the Great Depression is coming .
How do I know ?
I made an error that he reprints -- a kind of water mark .
It was a minor error , but it was mine , all mine .
Think of it , though : 250,000 pieces a month .
Month after month .
My version , not yours .
Enjoy !
Never mind the bitterness , pride , hatred , and contempt he betrays in that short message .
The point is , North is sending out 250,000 pieces a month .
Multiply that by $ 129 a year , and you get THIRTY - TWO MILLION DOLLARS !
Okay , maybe as an author and not a publisher , he 's just getting 15 % of that .
But that 's still $ 4.8 million .
Per year , folks .
Okay , let 's assume he 's only making one - tenth that amount .
That 's still $ 480,000 a year .
I do n't know about you , but that 's a hell of a lot more than I make .
So please do n't tell me he does n't have a vested interest in Y2 K .
( And this is just the newsletter I know about .
I 've heard he has others , plus books , pamphlets , etc. )
This guy is cashing in big - time , and he 's doing it on the backs of the people he claims he 's trying to help .
And guess what ?
When Y2 K blows over , and everything 's still intact , that newsletter will still be around .
Sure , he 'll lose some subscribers , but he 'll find another cause to scare people with .
Maybe it'll be " The Coming Crisis in Human Cloning : How It 's Going To Destroy Our Economy " .
Or maybe he 'll hop on board the " Russia is going to nuke the US " conspiracy theory .
A Dangerous Man
My contention is that Gary North is not only a religious super - zealot who is using Y2 K to stuff his own pockets , but that he is , like most religious zealots , a dangerous man .
And I have to admit this whole thing really shocks me , because only a few weeks ago I pictured him as a studious economics professor who runs an honest web site without any advertising , trying to warn people about something he recently discovered .
That 's the image he wants us to believe .
He 's said over and over again , that he 's just trying to save lives .
But here are his own words explaining why his web site exists :
" When I began writing about Y2 K , hardly anyone had heard of it .
Today , the media cover it sporadically .
In a year , there will be a tidal wave of articles .
And , month by month , fear will spread .
Doom and gloom will sell , as it has never sold before .
I have positioned my name , my site , and Christian Reconstruction in the center of this fear .
All I have to do now is to report bad news .
That 's just about all the Y2 K news there is .
One by one , the media sources will move in my direction , for two reasons : ( 1 ) it 's as bad as I say it is ; ( 2 ) the public will begin to panic , and then there will be a feverish demand for more and more information .
The " moderates " -- whose position cannot square with the facts of Y2K -- will be drowned out in a wave of panic .
My site will be in the middle of it .
The larger the site gets , the more formidable it becomes .
The site scares away those critics with a large audience , which Rev. Abshire does not enjoy .
When a network TV crew came to Fayetteville to interview me last month , it was my Web site that had hooked them .
The site is now irresistible to any reporter who has been assigned the task of writing on Y2 K .
I have done their homework for them .
I have assembled the documentation .
They all have deadlines , and my site helps them to meet it .
I have built it ; they will come . "
" Before every link , I add my comments , my " spin . "
They do n't have to believe it , but as fear spreads to the reporters about their careers and their pensions , my spin will spread . "
So now we know why the site exists .
He wants to spread the word about Christian Reconstructionism .
Not a bad thing in itself , until you dig a little deeper and get closer to the roots of North 's beliefs .
In this quote he talks about religious freedom , which is the entire basis for the existence of this country .
His words are shocking and horrifying to me , and , I think , to any US citizen .
So let us be blunt : we must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality , no neutral law , no neutral education , and no neutral civil government .
Then they will get busy in constructing a Bible - based social , political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberties of the enemies of God.
-- Gary North , quoted in Albert J. Menendez , Visions of Reality : What Fundamentalist Schools Teach ( Prometheus Books , 1993 )
North wants to gain power for the Christian Reconstructionists , then wipe out the liberties of anyone else who disagrees with their beliefs .
This is one scary dude , and I shudder to think where , or in whom , he 's investing his substantial monies .
He 's a man with a plan , and if the reconstruction goes his way , it 's going to be worse for 95 % of us than all the fan - hitting manure he 's predicting for Y2K .
But thankfully , he 's not the point man for the Christian Reconstructionists .
There are plenty of CR's who do n't like him .
For instance , Rev. Abshire :
... we do NOT have to become false prophets .
And that is the real danger .
No man KNOWS the future , for " the secret things belong to God . "
If we say THIS will happen , and it does not , then we have become a false prophet .
If people like Gary North who are scaring people into quitting their jobs , leaving their livelihoods and moving to the hills prove to be wrong on this one , let 's hope they have a little integrity , repent of their sins and get out of the economic forecasting business for good .
Here 's another commentary , this one from a free Christian newsletter ...
A lot of folks have been asking us what we think about Gary North 's current crusade to make everyone aware of the looming Y2 K problem .
For a brief summary of what that problem is , see the Eschaton column , this issue .
But North is not interested in just making people aware -- he wants us all to get hunkered down and ready .
His vision for the next few years , starting in the latter half of 1999 is downright apocalyptic .
At the same time , he sees himself as the lone voice in the wilderness .
As he put it in a recent newsletter , " Christian leaders are now answering me in the traditional , time - tested way : by murmuring .
They do not publish line - by - line criticisms of what I have written . "
As with so many issues , it is not that simple .
This is not the first time North has projected a very specific apocalyptic vision of the future .
If someone had undertaken to refute his predictions about how AIDS would bring down the system , that effort would have been rendered obsolete and unnecessary when simple time refuted him .
That dire prediction did not come to pass .
And his " ten feet to survival " left a number of people , when all was said and done , with a hole in the ground .
In a strange sort of way , many hard money conservatives have an emotional need for a kind of secular dispensationalism .
" The end of fractional reserve banking is nigh , " quoth he .
Hard money conservatives have been catching the last train out for as long as I can remember , and I suspect they were doing it before that when I was still in short pants .
That such predictions appeal to an emotional need , and not an intellectual one , can be seen by the response when the prediction does not come true .
Hal Lindsey 's terminal generation came and went , but he is still here making money .
And hard money analysts continue to predict the terminal stock market crash .
But when it does n't happen , the folks who subscribe to their newsletters . . . forgive and forget .
However , just because you are paranoid does not mean they are not out to get you .
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Y2 K problem does represent a significant problem .
And it is also clear that huge problems could be created if enough people come to think Y2 K is a problem even if it is n't a catastrophic programming problem .
This is one place where hard money end - of - the - agers differ from dispensational end - of - the - worlders .
If someone believes dispensational predictions about the latest antichrist and rapture schedules , that belief leaves him unprepared for the world in which he must live when the Second Coming fails to make an appearance .
Again .
But if someone really believes all that North is saying , then he is going to pay down his debts , buy a nice place in the country , and so forth .
And if it all does n't happen ?
He has a nice view and no debts .
Still , North ought to do more to prove he really believes what he is saying .
He does believe his own predictions enough to relocate and restructure everything he is doing now .
But here is a question .
Does he believe his analysis enough to promise to go out of the economic forecasting business if the calendar over the next few years proves him wrong ?
-- Douglas Wilson , Credenda Agenda , Vol 10 , No. 1 .
I can't finish this section without an amazing excerpt from an article I found on the web about Christian Reconstructionism .
Read section ( b ) and shudder :
Who are the " Players " in Christian Reconstructionism ? : ( a ) Dr. Rousas J. Rushdoony is considered the patriarch of CRM .
( Cornelius Van Til , a Princeton University theologian , is credited as being the " father of Reconstructionism , " even though Van Til himself never became a Reconstructionist . )
Rushdoony is a prolific writer of books and the founder ( in 1965 ) of the Chalcedon Foundation in Vallecito , California ( a think tank organization named after the Council of Chalcedon , held in A.D. 451 ) .
This organization publishes Chalcedon and The Journal of Christian Reconstruction .
Rushdoony 's two - volume Institutes of Biblical Law is an extensive study ( 800 pages ) of how the Ten Commandments could be applied to modern society ; it is the " Bible " of Reconstructionist philosophy .
Rushdoony , in a 3/88 letter said : " [ Our objective is ] nothing less than the re-Christianizing of America . "
Rushdoony also believes as many as twenty million charismatics worldwide are now part of the Reconstruction movement ( even though he is not as fond of charismatics as is Gary North ) .
Reconstructionists would deny that they believe or teach salvation by works .
Yet their spiritual father , Rushdoony , believes a Christian has denied God if he does not actively work to transform society : " A godly law order will work to disinherit , execute , and supplant the ungodly and to confirm the godly in their inheritance .
For Christians to work for anything less is to deny God . "
[ If the latter statement were true , all the Apostles , and Jesus Himself , would have to be counted as denying God !! ]
( b ) Gary North is the son - in - law of Rushdoony , and the founder of the Institute for Christian Economics ( in Tyler , Texas ) and Dominion Press , and is one of the most militant Reconstructionists .
( Rushdoony and North have not spoken to each other for years -- Rushdoony looks at North as a heretic , because North teaches that the menstrual blood of a virgin bride is a type of Jesus ' blood shed on the cross .
North also broke with Rushdoony over the issue of " Christian America " -- North holding that Article VI of the Constitution is proof of the establishment of a non-religious republic . )
He publishes a number of " gloom & doom " investment newsletters , all of which are long on verbosity and short on useful investment advice .
With an earned doctorate in economics , North would seem to be an unlikely candidate as the single most influential spokesman for a modern socio- theological movement .
Nevertheless , through his enormous and diverse literary output ( via Spurgeon Press , Geneva Ministries , Dominion Press , Institute for Christian Economics , and Reconstruction Press ) he has become the primary shaker - and - mover of the Christian Reconstruction position today .
Like his father - in - law and mentor , Rousas Rushdoony , North 's forte is rhetoric , not exegesis .
Consequently , his approach is characterized more by logical / theological arguments occasionally punctuated with Scripture than by hard reasoning derived from careful exegetical analysis of Scripture .
( According to North , women who have abortions should be publicly executed , " along with those who advised them to abort their children . "
As the means of execution , North prefers stoning because , among other things , stones are cheap , plentiful , and convenient . )
North claims that " the ideas of the Reconstructionists have penetrated into Protestant circles that for the most part are unaware of the original source of the theological ideas that are beginning to transform them . "
North describes the " three major legs of the Reconstructionist movement " as " the Presbyterian oriented educators , the Baptist school headmasters and pastors , and the charismatic telecommunications system . "
-- Biblical Discernment Ministries
So What About Y2K ?
As the saying goes , just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not out to get you .
In my opinion , yes , Virginia , there is a Y2 K problem .
But is it as bad as North claims ?
His opinions and prophecies are grossly exaggerated because he has absolutely no objective perspective on this issue .
He 's not looking at Y2 K and extrapolating an honest account of what might happen : he 's calling for the worst , the absolute worst , to happen .
And that 's based on his pre-existing prejudices and opinions , not on any scientific fact .
Now the first thing he'd say here is that it can't be predicted in a scientific manner , so you must prepare for the absolute worst .
I agree that the state of computers and embedded chips around the world on 1/1/2000 probably can't be predicted a year and a half in advance any more than the weather on 1/1/2000 can be .
But that does n't mean we need to prepare for the absolute worst .
Here is an interesting post on the year2000 - discuss list last year ...

From : Dick Mills
Subject : Awareness :
Where to draw the line on alarmism .
I believe I may have found a practical definition for where to draw the line between awareness and alarmism .
Here it is .
I 'm posting it here for everyone to shoot barbs at .
Is this a definition we can use , or not ?
Let 's use a simple analogy familiar to everyone ; airline safety .
There are two standards by which we should view technical questions of safety ; the planning view and the operational view .
The great engineer , Edward A. Murphy formulated his famous law , with airplane safety in mind .
" If anything can fail , it will . "
When designers are designing airplanes , or when software types are enumerating what Y2 K problems must be checked , this is the proper standard to apply .
Assume the worst , check everything .
Think about it ; no other standard is defensible for planning purposes .
When we 're about to board an airplane , we use the operational standard .
Sure the wings could fall off , there could be a bomb on board , the pilots might be drunk , but the proper standard to apply is to ignore all these possibilities and be optimistic .
Think about it ; no sane person should board any airplane ever if he does not expect the outcome to be favorable .
For that matter , the person would not dare use any other transportation or dare to stay on the ground .
Panophobia is the word for that ; fear of everything .
In other words , planning and design should be based on worst case possible outcomes , but daily operations should be based on expected real life outcomes .
What would be irresponsible ?
Well , to go to the airport ticket office and loudly discuss the wing falling off , bombs on board , drunken pilots , then to jump to describing the broken body parts and anguished relatives that might be the consequence would be irresponsible .
The psychological trick being played is to jump directly from a discussion of what can happen , directly to the fearfully graphics views of the consequences .
It is a trick because the planning standard is misapplied to the operational context .
Indeed , in airports this kind of talk is actually criminal .
It is so bad that it is one of the very few legal exceptions to freedom of speech .
Now , lets translate this back to the Y2 K context .
Many articles , public statements , books , and web sites discussing the Y2 K problem commit exactly this sin .
They first make the point that Y2 K vulnerability is ubiquitous .
Nearly everything and anything can fail because of Y2 K .
They then jump directly to point out how awful the consequences could be if all these critical things did fail .
To the uninitiated , the message is that what can fail will fail ; the wrong expectation .
The sin may not even be deliberate .
We software practitioners are busy avoiding and rectifying the problem .
We are immersed in the planning standard all day every work day .
It is understandable that we may forget to use a different standard when making public statements .
Understandable at least , until you read this post and have been informed .
So what 's so bad about this ?
We lose credibility and risk being ignored because we use alarmist tactics .
If we really believe that the public awareness and action is critical to achieve , then we must protect our credibility .
I believe that everyone should look at their own financial situation and try to figure out what they 're comfortable doing to prepare for Y2K .
Since no one really knows what 's going to happen , it 's impossible to get really good advice about how much preparing you should do .
And no amount of preparation is going to make any of us feel absolutely comfortable -- unless you 're rich and can set up a protected compound with five years ' of clean food and water , a couple of windmills , a half - acre of solar panels , and so on .
At a minimum , at least try to make sure you have enough food , water , and heat for a month or two .
If you can set up an alternate source of electricity , more " power " to you .
If you live in a potentially dangerous area like a city , and you feel you should get a gun , then do it , but by all means be responsible and learn how to use it .
Keep an eye out for articles and news stories about Y2 K .
I would avoid Gary North 's web site after 1/1/1999 , though , because he colors all the articles with his own spin , which is fine , but he 'll also end up omitting critical articles of success stories , because he has a lot riding on Y2 K 's perceived failure .
He tends to ridicule and belittle any success story , or any dissenting opinion , no matter how well documented it might be .
A company can set its clocks forward a dozen times and have no problems , but North will come up with a dozen reasons why they 'll still fail .
You cannot win with a zealot like him , so it 's best just to avoid him .
Wrapping It Up
There is a whole lot more to say about Gary North and Y2K .
I have n't even mentioned Ed Yourdon , another doom - and - gloomer closely linked to North .
Maybe I 'll expand on it later on , but for now this will have to be it .
Thanks for reading it , and please feel free to send me your comments .
In my research , I found the following to be very helpful :
What Is Short Selling ?
Short selling is an investment or trading strategy that speculates on the decline in a stock or other securities price .
It is an advanced strategy that should only be undertaken by experienced traders and investors .
Traders may use short selling as speculation , and investors or portfolio managers may use it as a hedge against the downside risk of a long position in the same security or a related one .
Speculation carries the possibility of substantial risk and is an advanced trading method .
Hedging is a more common transaction involving placing an offsetting position to reduce risk exposure .
In short selling , a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock or other asset that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date — the expiration date .
The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price .
Before the borrowed shares must be returned , the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost .
The risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the price of any asset can climb to infinity .
Key Takeaways
Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market , planning to buy it back later for less money .
Short sellers bet on , and profit from , a drop in a security 's price .
Short selling has a high risk / reward ratio :
It can offer big profits , but losses can mount quickly and infinitely .
1:34 Short Selling
Understanding Short Selling
Wimpy of the famous Popeye comic strip would have been a perfect short seller .
The comic character was famous for saying he would " gladly pay next Tuesday for a hamburger today . "
In short selling , the seller opens a position by borrowing shares , usually from a broker - dealer .
The short seller will try to make money on the use of those shares before they must return them to the lender .
To open a short position , a trader must have a margin account and will usually have to pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares while the position is open .
Also , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , Inc. ( FINRA ) , which enforces the rules and regulations governing registered brokers and broker - dealer firms in the United States , the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) , and the Federal Reserve have set minimum values for the amount that the margin account must maintain — known as the maintenance margin .﻿﻿
If an investor 's account value falls below the maintenance margin , more funds are required , or the position might be sold by the broker .
To close a short position , a trader buys the shares back on the market — hopefully at a price less than what they borrowed the asset — and returns them to the lender or broker .
Traders must account for any interest charged by the broker or commissions charged on trades .
The process of locating shares that can be borrowed and returning them at the end of the trade are handled behind the scenes by the broker .
Opening and closing the trade can be made through the regular trading platforms with most brokers .
However , each broker will have qualifications the trading account must meet before they allow margin trading .
As mentioned earlier , one of the main reasons to engage in short selling is to speculate .
Conventional long strategies ( stocks are bought ) can be classified as investment or speculation , depending on two parameters — ( a ) the degree of risk undertaken in the trade , and ( b ) the time horizon of the trade .
Investing tends to be lower risk and generally has a long - term time horizon that spans years or decades .
Speculation is a substantially higher - risk activity and typically has a short - term time horizon .
Short Selling for a Profit
Imagine a trader who believes that XYZ stock — currently trading at $ 50 — will decline in price in the next three months .
They borrow 100 shares and sell them to another investor .
The trader is now “ short ” 100 shares since they sold something that they did not own but had borrowed .
The short sale was only made possible by borrowing the shares , which may not always be available if the stock is already heavily shorted by other traders .
A week later , the company whose shares were shorted reports dismal financial results for the quarter , and the stock falls to $ 40 .
The trader decides to close the short position and buys 100 shares for $ 40 on the open market to replace the borrowed shares .
The trader ’s profit on the short sale , excluding commissions and interest on the margin account , is $ 1,000 : ( $ 50 - $ 40 = $ 10 x 100 shares = $ 1,000 ) .
Short Selling for a Loss
Using the scenario above , let 's now suppose the trader did not close out the short position at $ 40 but decided to leave it open to capitalize on a further price decline .
However , a competitor swoops in to acquire the company with a takeover offer of $ 65 per share and the stock soars .
If the trader decides to close the short position at $ 65 , the loss on the short sale would be $ 1,500 : ( $ 50 - $ 65 = negative $ 15 x 100 shares = $ 1,500 loss ) .
Here , the trader had to buy back the shares at a significantly higher price to cover their position .
Short Selling as a Hedge
Apart from speculation , short selling has another useful purpose — hedging — often perceived as the lower - risk and more respectable avatar of shorting .
The primary objective of hedging is protection , as opposed to the pure profit motivation of speculation .
Hedging is undertaken to protect gains or mitigate losses in a portfolio , but since it comes at a significant cost , the vast majority of retail investors do not consider it during normal times .
The costs of hedging are twofold .
There ’s the actual cost of putting on the hedge , such as the expenses associated with short sales , or the premiums paid for protective options contracts .
Also , there ’s the opportunity cost of capping the portfolio ’s upside if markets continue to move higher .
As a simple example , if 50 % of a portfolio that has a close correlation with the S&P 500 index ( S&P 500 ) is hedged , and the index moves up 15 % over the next 12 months , the portfolio would only record approximately half of that gain or 7.5 % .
Pros and Cons of Short Selling
Selling short can be costly if the seller guesses wrong about the price movement .
A trader who has bought stock can only lose 100 % of their outlay if the stock moves to zero .
However , a trader who has shorted stock can lose much more than 100 % of their original investment .
The risk comes because there is no ceiling for a stock ’s price , it can rise to infinity and beyond — to coin a phrase from another comic character , Buzz Lightyear .
Also , while the stocks were held , the trader had to fund the margin account .
Even if all goes well , traders have to figure in the cost of the margin interest when calculating their profits .
Pros Possibility of high profits
Little initial capital required
Leveraged investments possible
Hedge against other holdings Cons Potentially unlimited losses
Margin account necessary
Margin interest incurred
Short squeezes
When it comes time to close a position , a short seller might have trouble finding enough shares to buy — if a lot of other traders are also shorting the stock or if the stock is thinly traded .
Conversely , sellers can get caught in a short squeeze loop if the market , or a particular stock , starts to skyrocket .
On the other hand , strategies which offer high risk also offer a high - yield reward .
Short selling is no exception .
If the seller predicts the price moves correctly , they can make a tidy return on investment ( ROI ) , primarily if they use margin to initiate the trade .
Using margin provides leverage , which means the trader did not need to put up much of their capital as an initial investment .
If done carefully , short selling can be an inexpensive way to hedge , providing a counterbalance to other portfolio holdings .
Beginning investors should generally avoid short selling until they get more trading experience under their belts .
That being said , short selling through ETFs is a somewhat safer strategy due to the lower risk of a short squeeze .
Additional Risks to Short Selling
Besides the previously - mentioned risk of losing money on a trade from a stock 's price rising , short selling has additional risks that investors should consider .
Shorting Uses Borrowed Money
Shorting is known as margin trading .
When short selling , you open a margin account , which allows you to borrow money from the brokerage firm using your investment as collateral .
Just as when you go long on margin , it 's easy for losses to get out of hand because you must meet the minimum maintenance requirement of 25 % .
If your account slips below this , you 'll be subject to a margin call and forced to put in more cash or liquidate your position . ﻿﻿
Wrong Timing
Even though a company is overvalued , it could conceivably take a while for its stock price to decline .
In the meantime , you are vulnerable to interest , margin calls , and being called away .
The Short Squeeze
If a stock is actively shorted with a high short float and days to cover ratio , it is also at risk of experiencing a short squeeze .
A short squeeze happens when a stock begins to rise , and short sellers cover their trades by buying their short positions back .
This buying can turn into a feedback loop .
Demand for the shares attracts more buyers , which pushes the stock higher , causing even more short - sellers to buy back or cover their positions .
Regulatory Risks
Regulators may sometimes impose bans on short sales in a specific sector or even in the broad market to avoid panic and unwarranted selling pressure .
Such actions can cause a sudden spike in stock prices , forcing the short seller to cover short positions at huge losses .
Going Against the Trend
History has shown that , in general , stocks have an upward drift .
Over the long run , most stocks appreciate in price .
For that matter , even if a company barely improves over the years , inflation or the rate of price increase in the economy should drive its stock price up somewhat .
What this means is that shorting is betting against the overall direction of the market .
Costs of Short Selling
Unlike buying and holding stocks or investments , short selling involves significant costs , in addition to the usual trading commissions that have to be paid to brokers .
Some of the costs include :
Margin Interest
Margin interest can be a significant expense when trading stocks on margin .
Since short sales can only be made via margin accounts , the interest payable on short trades can add up over time , especially if short positions are kept open over an extended period .
Stock Borrowing Costs
Shares that are difficult to borrow — because of high short interest , limited float , or any other reason — have “ hard - to - borrow ” fees that can be quite substantial .
The fee is based on an annualized rate that can range from a small fraction of a percent to more than 100 % of the value of the short trade and is pro-rated for the number of days that the short trade is open .
As the hard - to - borrow rate can fluctuate substantially from day to day and even on an intra-day basis , the exact dollar amount of the fee may not be known in advance .
The fee is usually assessed by the broker - dealer to the client ’s account either at month - end or upon closing of the short trade and if it is quite large , can make a big dent in the profitability of a short trade or exacerbate losses on it .
Dividends and other Payments
The short seller is responsible for making dividend payments on the shorted stock to the entity from whom the stock has been borrowed .
The short seller is also on the hook for making payments on account of other events associated with the shorted stock , such as share splits , spin -offs , and bonus share issues , all of which are unpredictable events .
Short Selling Metrics
Two metrics used to track short selling activity on a stock are :
Short interest ratio ( SIR ) — also known as the short float — measures the ratio of shares that are currently shorted compared to the number of shares available or “ floating ” in the market .
A very high SIR is associated with stocks that are falling or stocks that appear to be overvalued .
The short interest to volume ratio — also known as the days to cover ratio — the total shares held short divided by the average daily trading volume of the stock .
A high value for the days to cover ratio is also a bearish indication for a stock .
Both short - selling metrics help investors understand whether the overall sentiment is bullish or bearish for a stock .
For example , after oil prices declined in 2014 , General Electric Co. ’s ( GE ) energy divisions began to drag on the performance of the entire company .
The short interest ratio jumped from less than 1 % to more than 3.5 % in late 2015 as short sellers began anticipating a decline in the stock .
By the middle of 2016 , GE ’s share price had topped out at $ 33 per share and began to decline .
By February 2019 , GE had fallen to $ 10 per share , which would have resulted in a profit of $ 23 per share to any short sellers lucky enough to short the stock near the top in July 2016 .﻿﻿
Ideal Conditions for Short Selling
Timing is crucial when it comes to short selling .
Stocks typically decline much faster than they advance , and a sizeable gain in a stock may be wiped out in a matter of days or weeks on an earnings miss or other bearish development .
The short seller thus has to time the short trade to near perfection .
Entering the trade too late may result in a huge opportunity cost in terms of lost profits , since a major part of the stock ’s decline may already have occurred .
On the other hand , entering the trade too early may make it difficult to hold on to the short position in light of the costs involved and potential losses , which would skyrocket if the stock increases rapidly .
There are times when the odds of successful shorting improve , such as the following :
During a Bear Market
The dominant trend for a stock market or sector is down during a bear market .
So traders who believe that “ the trend is your friend ” have a better chance of making profitable short sale trades during an entrenched bear market than they would during a strong bull phase .
Short sellers revel in environments where the market decline is swift , broad , and deep — like the global bear market of 2008 - 09 — because they stand to make windfall profits during such times .
When Stock or Market Fundamentals are Deteriorating
A stock ’s fundamentals can deteriorate for any number of reasons — slowing revenue or profit growth , increasing challenges to the business , rising input costs that are putting pressure on margins , and so on .
For the broad market , worsening fundamentals could mean a series of weaker data that indicate a possible economic slowdown , adverse geopolitical developments like the threat of war , or bearish technical signals like reaching new highs on decreasing volume , deteriorating market breadth .
Experienced short sellers may prefer to wait until the bearish trend is confirmed before putting on short trades , rather than doing so in anticipation of a downward move .
This is because of the risk that a stock or market may trend higher for weeks or months in the face of deteriorating fundamentals , as is typically the case in the final stages of a bull market .
Technical Indicators Confirm the Bearish Trend
Short sales may also have a higher probability of success when the bearish trend is confirmed by multiple technical indicators .
These indicators could include a breakdown below a key long - term support level or a bearish moving average crossover like the “ death cross . ”
An example of a bearish moving average crossover occurs when a stock 's 50 - day moving average falls below its 200 - day moving average .
A moving average is merely the average of a stock 's price over a set period of time .
If the current price breaks the average , either down or up , it can signal a new trend in price .
Valuations Reach Elevated Levels Amid Rampant Optimism
Occasionally , valuations for certain sectors or the market as a whole may reach highly elevated levels amid rampant optimism for the long - term prospects of such sectors or the broad economy .
Market professionals call this phase of the investment cycle “ priced for perfection , ” since investors will invariably be disappointed at some point when their lofty expectations are not met .
Rather than rushing in on the short side , experienced short sellers may wait until the market or sector rolls over and commences its downward phase .
John Maynard Keynes was an influential British economist whereby his economic theories are still in use today .
However , Keynes was quoted saying : “ The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent , ” which is particularly apt for short selling .
The optimal time for short selling is when there is a confluence of the above factors .
Short Selling 's Reputation
Sometimes short selling is criticized , and short sellers are viewed as ruthless operators out to destroy companies .
However , the reality is that short selling provides liquidity , meaning enough sellers and buyers , to markets and can help prevent bad stocks from rising on hype and over - optimism .
Evidence of this benefit can be seen in asset bubbles that disrupt the market .
Assets that lead to bubbles such as the mortgage - backed security market before the 2008 financial crisis are frequently difficult or nearly impossible to short .
Short selling activity is a legitimate source of information about market sentiment and demand for a stock .
Without this information , investors may be caught off - guard by negative fundamental trends or surprising news .
Unfortunately , short selling gets a bad name due to the practices employed by unethical speculators .
These unscrupulous types have used short selling strategies and derivatives to artificially deflate prices and conduct “ bear raids ” on vulnerable stocks .
Most forms of market manipulation like this are illegal in the U.S. , but it still happens periodically .
Put options provide a great alternative to short selling by enabling you to profit from a drop in a stock 's price without the need for margin or leverage .

Real World Example of Short Selling
Unexpected news events can initiate a short squeeze which may force short sellers to buy at any price to cover their margin requirements .
For example , in October 2008 , Volkswagen briefly became the most valuable publicly traded company in the world during an epic short squeeze .﻿﻿
In 2008 , investors knew that Porsche was trying to build a position in Volkswagen and gain majority control .
Short sellers expected that once Porsche had achieved control over the company , the stock would likely fall in value , so they heavily shorted the stock .
However , in a surprise announcement , Porsche revealed that they had secretly acquired more than 70 % of the company using derivatives , which triggered a massive feedback loop of short sellers buying shares to close their position .﻿﻿
Short sellers were at a disadvantage because 20 % of Volkswagen was owned by a government entity that was n’t interested in selling , and Porsche controlled another 70 % , so there were very few shares available on the market — float — to buy back .
Essentially , both the short interest and days to cover ratio had exploded higher overnight , which caused the stock to jump from the low € 200s to over € 1,000 .
A characteristic of a short squeeze is that they tend to fade quickly , and within several months , Volkswagen ’s stock had declined back into its normal range .
Gerald Ford forced to admit the Warren Report fictionalized
Cited under " fair use " .
By MIKE FEINSILBER The Associated Press WASHINGTON ( July 2 ) - Thirty - three years ago , Gerald R. Ford took pen in hand and changed - ever so slightly - the Warren Commission 's key sentence on the place where a bullet entered John F. Kennedy 's body when he was killed in Dallas .
The effect of Ford 's change was to strengthen the commission 's conclusion that a single bullet passed through Kennedy and severely wounded Texas Gov. John Connally - a crucial element in its finding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole gunman .
A small change , said Ford on Wednesday when it came to light , one intended to clarify meaning , not alter history .
'' My changes had nothing to do with a conspiracy theory , '' he said in a telephone interview from Beaver Creek , Colo .
'' My changes were only an attempt to be more precise . ''
But still , his editing was seized upon by members of the conspiracy community , which rejects the commission 's conclusion that Oswald acted alone .
'' This is the most significant lie in the whole Warren Commission report , '' said Robert D. Morningstar , a computer systems specialist in New York City who said he has studied the assassination since it occurred and written an Internet book about it .
The effect of Ford 's editing , Morningstar said , was to suggest that a bullet struck Kennedy in the neck , '' raising the wound two or three inches .
Without that alteration , they could never have hoodwinked the public as to the true number of assassins . ''
If the bullet had hit Kennedy in the back , it could not have struck Connolly in the way the commission said it did , he said .
The Warren Commission concluded in 1964 that a single bullet - fired by a ' ' discontented ' '
Oswald - passed through Kennedy 's body and wounded his fellow motorcade passenger , Connally , and that a second , fatal bullet , fired from the same place , tore through Kennedy 's head .
The assassination of the president occurred Nov. 22 , 1963 , in Dallas ; Oswald was arrested that day but was shot and killed two days later as he was being transferred from the city jail to the county jail .
Conspiracy theorists reject the idea that a single bullet could have hit both Kennedy and Connally and done such damage .
Thus they argue that a second gunman must have been involved .
Ford 's changes tend to support the single - bullet theory by making a specific point that the bullet entered Kennedy 's body '' at the back of his neck ' ' rather than in his uppermost back , as the commission staff originally wrote .
Ford 's handwritten notes were contained in 40,000 pages of records kept by J. Lee Rankin , chief counsel of the Warren Commission .
They were made public Wednesday by the Assassination Record Review Board , an agency created by Congress to amass all relevant evidence in the case .
The documents will be available to the public in the National Archives .
The staff of the commission had written : '' A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine . ''
Ford suggested changing that to read : '' A bullet had entered the back of his neck at a point slightly to the right of the spine . ''
The final report said : '' A bullet had entered the base of the back of his neck slightly to the right of the spine . ''
Ford , then House Republican leader and later elevated to the presidency with the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon , is the sole surviving member of the seven - member commission chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren .

Note bullet hole lower down on back .
Had the bullet which entered at this point been the same bullet which the Warren Report claims then exited through the knot of JFK's tie , it would have passed well above John Connally 's head .
One thing is clear .
That hole is nowehere near where JFK 's neck was .
It was in his back .

We released Fennec 1.0 Beta 1 for Maemo !
Go read Stuart ’s announcement for a good overview of the release .
Be sure to watch Madhava ’s video walkthrough too .
Like Stuart , I am now using Fennec as the default browser on my N810 tablet .
We have reached a solid milestone for performance and stability .
What ’s New
Most of the work for this release was not visible UI features .
Getting the Flash plugin to render onto Fennec ’s canvas display surface was a big step .
We also added the ability to pan any scrollable list in the chrome UI .
So the bookmark list , add - on list , download list , preference list – and so on – now support scrolling / panning just like the main web content .
We still need to add support for iframes and web content lists , which are trickier since they kind of conflict with panning the content itself .
Another area that has seen a lot of work is the rendering mechanism – the code that takes the content of the hidden browser element and renders it to the visible canvas display surface .
Fennec Beta 1 has better pageload times and much better panning performance because of this work .
For more background on what I ’m talking about , read this post and the referenced article .
We did add some visible UI features .
A big one is the new bookmark list .
Fennec now supports bookmark folders and has capabilities for managing your bookmarks and folders .
We still have some polish work to do , but the basics are all functional .
The default font size is a bit larger too , making it easier to read text content when Fennec auto - zooms web pages .
I almost forgot – JavaScript JIT is on by default for web content .
It makes a big difference .
The ARM related fixes to the JIT code made that possible .
What ’s Notable
Our never ending struggle to make Fennec ( and the Mozilla platform in general ) as fast as possible on mobile devices has yielded a few more nuggets .
Vlad and Taras have been hammering away on the rendering mechanism .
Some parts of the process we can control better than others .
The actual drawWindow call still dominates the time to render .
We still try to improve the drawWindow performance , but there is only so much we can do .
Instead , we try to limit the calls to drawWindow and limit the size of area we need to render .
Another area we can make improvements is overhead of XPConnect – the bridge between JavaScript and C ++.
On mobile devices , the overhead from XPConnect is non-trivial so we are reducing the XPConnect - able calls .
We might also try adding more “ quickstubs ” – code that short circuits the XPConnect bridge , making the call faster .
Finally , we are noticing slowdowns related to the Places ( bookmarks and history ) system .
Likely to be SQLite file I /O related .
Two examples are : during startup the Places system is initialized , and when Fennec loads the bookmark list .
I ’ll note that neither of these examples is noticeable at all on desktop machines .
The startup issue is caused by a XPCOM component being initialized and in turn , initializes the Places core system .
It results in a 250 ms speed bump during startup .
We are currently working on a fix for this issue .
The bookmark list load time is slowed by accessing the bookmark system for information used to display in the list , for each bookmark .
In a simple test using just 10 bookmarks , it can take almost 3 seconds to load the list .
Luckily , we were able to avoid some of the calls to the bookmark system and have improved load time by almost 40 % .
We already have several performance related patches ready to land for the next release .
Also , just about all the performance improvements we make for Fennec on Maemo are directly applicable to Fennec on Windows Mobile – win / win !

Calculate LCS
I pinched the idea for this animation from Ned Batchelder ’s clever visualisation of Román Cortés ’ brilliant CSS Homer Simpson .
It depends on Javascript , CSS and a font containing upwards , leftwards and north west arrows .
If it does n’t work in your user agent , my apologies .
If you ’d like to find out why I ’m comparing humans with chimpanzees , read on !
Taking a brief step back , this article is the third of a series .
In the first episode we posed a puzzle :
Starting with a list of runners ordered by finishing time , select a sublist of runners who are getting younger .
What is the longest such sublist ?
In the second episode we coded up a brute force solution which searched all possible sublists to find an optimal solution .
Although the code was simple and succinct , its exponential complexity made it unsuitable for practical use .
In this episode we ’ll discuss an elegant algorithm which solves our particular problem as a special case .
On the way we ’ll visit dynamic programming , Python decorators , version control and genetics .
An outline of the approach is :
forget about races , runners and ages the essence of the problem is to determine the longest ordered subsequence found within a given sequence R which is a measure of how close R is to being ordered so , take a copy of R and sort it using our ordering criterion to form the sequence S the subsequences of R which are also subsequences of S are precisely the ordered subsequences of R so any longest subsequence common to both R and S is actually a longest ordered subsequence of R which is exactly what we ’re looking for !
Copying and sorting finite sequences is straightforward ( and efficient implementations can be found in any standard library ) , so the steps above reduce our problem to an application of a more general problem : how to find the longest common subsequence of two sequences .
As a simple example I ’ve highlighted “ HMAN ” , the longest subsequence common to both “ HUMAN ” and “ CHIMPANZEE ”
H U M A N
C H I M P A N Z E E
Let ’s note up front that there may not be a unique LCS of two sequences ( as a trivial example , “ A ” and “ B ” are both LCSes of “ AB ” , “ BA ” ) , which is why we ’ll talk about a longest common subsequence rather than the longest common subsequence .
We can also rule out a simple divide and conquer scheme .
We ca n’t just split both inputs in half and join together the LCSes of the beginnings and endings to form an answer .
Consider finding the LCS of “ 123ABC ” , “ DEF123 ” for example — concatenating the LCSes of “ 123 ” , “ DEF ” and “ ABC ” , “ 123 ” gives the empty string , which is clearly wrong .
( We ’ll see later that a more sophisticated divide and conquer scheme does exist , but it comes at a cost . )
An elegant recursive approach to solving this problem is based around the observation that the LCS of two sequences can be built from the LCSes of prefixes of these sequences .
In algorithm speak , the longest common subsequence problem has optimal substructure .
def lcs( xs , ys ) : ''' Return a longest common subsequence of xs and ys .
Example >>> lcs( " HUMAN " , " CHIMPANZEE " ) [ ' H ' , ' M ' , ' A ' , ' N ' ] ''' if xs and ys : * xb , xe = xs *yb , ye = ys if xe == ye : return lcs ( xb , yb ) + [ xe ] else : return max ( lcs ( xs , yb ) , lcs ( xb , ys ) , key=len ) else : return [ ]
A formal explanation of why this works would be much longer than the code .
I ’ll sketch out the reasoning , but for a more rigorous approach I recommend Cormen , Leiserson , Rivest and Stein ’s classic reference , “ Introduction to Algorithms ” ( CLRS ) .
Essentially , if either input is empty , then the answer is just the empty sequence .
Otherwise , split xs into its beginning , xb , and its final element xe ; and similarly for ys .
If the value xe equals ye , then lcs ( xs , ys ) must end with this value , and the remainder of lcs ( xs , ys ) must solve lcs ( xb , yb ) .
Otherwise , the longer of lcs ( xs , yb ) and lcs ( xb , ys ) must be a solution to lcs ( xs , ys ) .
By the way , the assignment * xb , xe = xs is a nice example of Python 3.0 ’s extended unpacking syntax .
In Python 2.6 and earlier you might write xb , xe = xs [ : - 1 ] , xs [ - 1 ] .
The recursion here is interesting .
At each step , we compare two elements from the original inputs .
Depending on the result , we must evaluate either one or two smaller LCSes .
Note also the call to max in the recursion .
At this point , the algorithm chooses between two prefix pairs of the original inputs , ( xs , yb ) and ( xb , ys ) , based on the length of their LCSes .
Here ’s the source of multiple solutions : max ( ) returns the larger of its two arguments , and if lcs ( xs , yb ) and lcs ( xb , ys ) have equal lengths , I suspect the first will always be selected ; but if we wanted all LCSes rather than any one LCS , we would have to continue down both routes .
The other important point to make here is that , in any case , both routes must be fully evaluated before a choice can be made .
Loosely speaking , every additional step can double the workload .
This is a problem !
Work is needed to turn the recursive solution into a practical one .
The key issue is that the recursive algorithm calculates the LCS of the same prefix pair multiple times .
Let ’s run a quick code experiment to show this .
Starting with the version of lcs ( ) shown above , we can adapt it to keep track of call counts [ 1 ] .
from collections import defaultdict concat = ''. join def lcs ( xs , ys ) : .... def count_lcs_calls ( lcs ) : ''' Return a pair ( lcs , calls )
Where : lcs - a wrapped version of lcs , which counts up calls calls - a dict mapping arg pairs to the number of times lcs has been called with these args .
''' calls = defaultdict ( int ) def wrapped ( xs , ys ) : calls [ ( concat ( xs ) , concat ( ys ) ) ] += 1 return lcs( xs , ys ) return wrapped , calls lcs , calls = count_lcs_calls ( lcs )
If count_lcs_calls ( ) reminds you of a Python decorator , good !
That ’s pretty much how it works .
We can now call the newly decorated version of lcs and examine the calls dict to see what ’s been going on .
With two completely different inputs , the recursive algorithm never passes the xe == ye test , and must always consider another pair of prefixes of the inputs .
>>> lcs(' MAN ' , ' PIG ' ) [ ] >>> print ( * sorted ( ( v , k ) for k , v in calls.items ( ) ) , sep= '
') ( 1 , ( ' ' , ' PIG ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' M ' , ' PIG ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' MA ' , ' PIG ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' MAN ' , '' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' MAN ' , ' P ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' MAN ' , ' PI ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' MAN ' , ' PIG ' ) ) ( 2 , ( ' MA ' , ' PI ' ) ) ( 3 , ( ' ' , ' PI ' ) ) ( 3 , ( ' M ' , ' PI ' ) ) ( 3 , ( ' MA ' , '' ) ) ( 3 , ( ' MA ' , ' P ' ) ) ( 6 , ( ' ' , ' P ' ) ) ( 6 , ( ' M ' , '' ) ) ( 6 , ( ' M ' , ' P ' ) )
Here , we show the LCS of “ MAN ” and “ PIG is the empty sequence .
The next command prints the call counts to standard output , showing that e.g. we calculate lcs ( ' MA ' , ' PI ' ) twice and lcs ( ' M ' , ' P ' ) six times .
It should be no surprise to see these call counts appearing in Pascal ’s triangle .
At the other extreme , given identical inputs the recursion zips straight through the identical prefixes , and no call is repeated .
>>> calls.clear ( ) >>> lcs(' CHIMP ' , ' CHIMP ' ) [ ' C ' , ' H ' , ' I ' , ' M ' , ' P ' ] >>> print ( * sorted ( ( v , k ) for k , v in calls.items ( ) ) , sep= '
') ( 1 , ( ' ' , ' ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' C ' , ' C ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' CH ' , ' CH ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' CHI ' , ' CHI ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' CHIM ' , ' CHIM ' ) ) ( 1 , ( ' CHIMP ' , ' CHIMP ' ) )
Generally , though , we wo n’t be so lucky .
By the time I interrupted a call to find the LCS of two short strands of DNA , there had already been a total of over 200 million recursive calls to the function , and we ’d compared ' A ' and ' G ' alone over 24 million times .
The algorithm , as presented , is of exponential complexity , hence suitable for only the briefest of inputs .
>>> lcs('ACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA ' , 'GTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA ' ) .... KeyboardInterrupt >>> sum( calls.values ( ) ) 227603392 >>> max( calls.values ( ) ) 24853152 >>> import operator >>> value = operator.itemgetter (1 ) >>> mostcalled = list ( sorted ( calls.items ( ) , key=value ) ) [ - 5 :] >>> print ( * mostcalled , sep= '
' ) ( ( '' , ' GT ' ) , 13182769 ) ( ( ' A ' , ' GT ' ) , 13182769 ) ( ( ' A ' , ' G ' ) , 24853152 ) ( ( '' , ' G ' ) , 24853152 ) ( ( ' A ' , '' ) , 24853152 )
We ’ve already seen the LCS of two sequences can be built from the LCSes of prefixes of these subsequences ; that is , an optimal solution to the problem can be built from optimal solutions to subproblems , a property known as optimal substructure .
Our code experiment above shows that the subproblems repeat , possibly many times .
This second property , of overlapping subproblems , means we have a classic example of a problem we can solve using dynamic programming .
There are a couple of standard ways to progress :
memoization
converting from top - down to bottom - up
Let ’s try these out .
Memoization is a simple idea .
Rather than repeatedly recalculate a function for the same input values , we cache the result of each call , keyed by the function call arguments .
If , as in this case , full evaluation is expensive compared to the look - up , and we ’ve got space for the cache , then the technique makes sense .
In Python , we can write an adaptor function which converts our original function into a memoized version of itself .
Here ’s just such an adaptor for functions which take an arbitrary number of positional parameters .
def memoize ( fn ) : ''' Return a memoized version of the input function .
The returned function caches the results of previous calls .
Useful if a function call is expensive , and the function is called repeatedly with the same arguments . ''' cache = dict ( ) def wrapped ( * v ) : key = tuple ( v ) # tuples are hashable , and can be used as dict keys if key not in cache : cache [ key ] = fn( * v ) return cache [ key ] return wrapped
We can use this to decorate our longest common subsequence function .
I ’ve also taken the opportunity to bypass some of the list splitting , creating an inner function which uses indices into the original xs and ys inputs .
def lcs( xs , ys ) : ''' Return the longest subsequence common to xs and ys .
Example >>> lcs( " HUMAN " , " CHIMPANZEE " ) [ ' H ' , ' M ' , ' A ' , ' N ' ] ''' @memoize def lcs_ ( i , j ) : if i and j : xe , ye = xs [ i - 1 ] , ys [j - 1 ] if xe == ye : return lcs_ ( i - 1 , j - 1 ) + [ xe ] else : return max ( lcs_ ( i , j - 1 ) , lcs_ ( i - 1 , j ) , key=len ) else : return [ ] return lcs_ ( len ( xs ) , len (ys ) )
This is a big improvement .
If xs and ys have nx and ny elements respectively , then the values of i and j passed to the inner lcs_ ( i , j ) function must fall into the inclusive ranges [ 0 , nx ] , [ 0 , ny ] , and the cache will grow to contain at most ( nx + 1 ) ×( ny + 1 ) elements .
If the input sequences are of similar size , it ’s easy to see this version of lcs operates in quadratic time and space .
>>> ss = lcs('ACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA ' , 'GTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA ' ) >>> ''.join(ss ) ' GTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA '
The memoized version of lcs ( ) remembers previous results , but it ’s still highly recursive , and that can cause problems .
Try comparing a couple of longer synthesised strands of DNA .
>>> from random import choice >>> def base ( ) : return choice ( ' ACGT ' ) >>> dna1 = [ base ( ) for _ in range ( 10000 ) ] >>> dna2 = [ base ( ) for _ in range ( 10000 ) ] >>> lcs( dna1 , dna2 ) .... RuntimeError : maximum recursion depth exceeded
We might try bumping up the recursion limit but this approach is neither clean nor portable .
As the sys.setrecursionlimit ( ) documentation says :
The highest possible limit is platform - dependent .
A user may need to set the limit higher when she has a program that requires deep recursion and a platform that supports a higher limit .
This should be done with care , because a too - high limit can lead to a crash .
We might also try using a different language or a different Python implementation , but instead let ’s stick with CPython and explore a bottom - up approach .
Rather than continue with our top - down recursive algorithm , we can employ another standard dynamic programming technique and transform the algorithm into one which works from the bottom up .
Recall that , in the general case , to calculate lcs( xs , ys ) we needed to solve three sub- problems , lcs ( xb , yb ) , lcs ( xb , ys ) , lcs ( xs , yb ) , where xb is the result of removing the end element from xs , and similarly for yb .
* xb , xe = xs *yb , ye = ys if xe == ye : return lcs ( xb , yb ) + [ xe ] else : return max ( lcs ( xs , yb ) , lcs ( xb , ys ) , key=len )
These subproblems in turn depend on the LCSes of yet shorter prefix pairs of xs and ys .
A bottom up approach reverses the direction and calculates the LCSes of all prefix pairs of xs and ys , from shortest to longest .
We iterate through these prefix pairs filling a rectangular grid with the information needed to continue and to eventually reconstruct an LCS .
Once again , the code is easier to read than an explanation .
from collections import defaultdict , namedtuple from itertools import product def lcs_grid( xs , ys ) : ''' Create a grid for longest common subsequence calculations .
Returns a grid where grid [ ( j , i ) ] is a pair ( n , move ) such that - n is the length of the LCS of prefixes xs [ : i ] , ys [ : j ] - move is \ , ^ , < , or e , depending on whether the best move to ( j , i ) was diagonal , downwards , or rightwards , or None .
Example : T A R O T A 0 < 1 \ 1 < 1 < 1< R 0 < 1 ^ 2 \ 2 < 2< T 1 \ 1< 2 ^ 2 < 3 \ ' ''
Cell = namedtuple ( ' Cell ' , ' length move ' ) grid = defaultdict ( lambda : Cell ( 0 , 'e ' ) ) sqs = product ( enumerate ( ys ) , enumerate ( xs ) ) for ( j , y ) , ( i , x ) in sqs : if x == y : cell = Cell ( grid [ ( j - 1 , i - 1 ) ] . length + 1 , '\\ ' ) else : left = grid [ ( j , i - 1 ) ] . length over = grid [ ( j - 1 , i ) ] . length if left < over : cell = Cell ( over , '^ ' ) else : cell = Cell ( left , '< ') grid [ ( j , i ) ] = cell return grid
The implementation here makes a couple of unusual choices .
It models a 2 dimensional grid of values using a dict keyed by ( i , j ) pairs , rather than a more conventional array representation .
Furthermore , it uses a defaultdict , which returns a value even for keys which have n’t been filled in .
I ’ve used this data structure primarily to avoid special case code at the edges of the grid .
For example , a grid cell can be accessed at position ( j - 1 , i - 1 ) even if i or j is zero , and that cell automatically takes the desired ( 0 , 'e ' ) value .
I ’ve come across the suggestion that defaultdict ’s should be converted into regular dict ’s before being passed back to callers , which makes a lot of sense , but in this case I ’m choosing to return a defaultdict since its default value property will be useful in subsequent calculations — to find an actual LCS for example .
Cells in the LCS grid hold moves and LCS lengths .
To extract an actual LCS , we need to retrace the moves .
Here ’s an iterative algorithm ( a recursive one would also be possible ) which does this .
def lcs( xs , ys ) : ''' Return a longest common subsequence of xs , ys . ''' #
Create the LCS grid , then walk back from the bottom right corner grid = lcs_grid( xs , ys ) i , j = len ( xs ) - 1 , len(ys ) - 1 lcs = list ( ) for move in iter ( lambda : grid [ ( j , i ) ] . move , 'e ' ) : if move == ' \\ ' : lcs.append( xs[i ] )
i -= 1 j -= 1 elif move == '^ ' : j -= 1 elif move == ' < ' : i -= 1 lcs.reverse( ) return lcs
If you have n’t come across the 2 - argument version of iter , it ’s a neat way to generate a sequence terminated by a sentinel value .
In this case we move back through the grid , finishing when we hit an 'e ' end move .
Note that we only require the move fields of the grid cells to reconstruct an LCS .
The length fields were used during calculation of the grid itself .
I ’ve reproduced here the animation shown at the start of the article .
It demonstrates the LCS grid being calculated , one cell at a time .
The numbers in the cells correspond to the lengths of the LCSes ending at various prefix pairs of the inputs and the arrows indicate the moves : as an example , the 2 in the 4th row , 4th column shows that lcs ( " CHIM " , " HUMA " ) has length 2 , and the leftwards arrow shows the best previous LCS was lcs ( " CHIM " , " HUM " ) .
Once the grid has been filled , the red and orange arrows track back through it to find an LCS .
The orange arrows indicate matches — elements of an LCS — and the red arrows indicate a route which threads through in the greatest possible number of these .
H U M A N C 0 ← 0 ↑ 0 ↑ 0 ↑ 0 ↑ H 1 ↖ 1 ← 1 ← 1 ← 1 ← I 1 ↑ 1 ← 1 ← 1 ← 1 ← M 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↖ 2 ← 2 ← P 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 2 ← 2 ← A 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 3 ↖ 3 ← N 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 3 ↑ 4 ↖ Z 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 3 ↑ 4 ↑ E 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 3 ↑ 4 ↑ E 1 ↑ 1 ← 2 ↑ 3 ↑ 4 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↖ ↖ ↑ ↑ ↖ ← ← ↑ ↑ ↖ N A M H
Calculate LCS
If the inputs are of size X , Y , then the grid will have X × Y entries each of which gets set in constant time .
Recovering an LCS from the grid is a linear operation , so overall , this algorithm operates in O ( XY ) time and requires O ( XY ) space .
If X and Y are similarly sized , we have a quadratic algorithm .
Practically speaking , we do n’t bang into CPython ’s recursion limit any more , but large inputs still put a strain on the machine .
I tried running this new LCS calculation on a couple of long strands of DNA .
>>> len( dna1 ) , len ( dna2 ) ( 10000 , 10000 ) >>> lcs( dna1 , dna2 )
To complete this calculation , we ’ll need a grid with 10000 × 10000 entries , i.e. 100 million entries .
So if each grid entry occupies 10 bytes , we ’re looking at roughly a gigabyte — a sizable chunk even for today ’s computers .
And if each step takes 100 nanoseconds , we ’d be looking at a run-time of 10 seconds , if we do n’t run out of memory first that is .
This back of an envelope calculation turned out to be way off .
Running the code snippet above caused my system to thrash .
I killed it after 10 minutes , at which point the Python process alone was using over 1GB of memory .
At this point the choice of a dict ( a hashtable ) very definitely becomes questionable .
Actually , our choice of Python becomes questionable .
When you have a quadratic algorithm with large inputs , the space and time constant factors both become critical .
We have a number of options :
find a leaner algorithm .
find a bigger computer .
treat our Python implementation as a prototype .
Code up a high performance version in a language which gives better control over the machine .
Then there ’s option 2a , to find a way of distributing the job over a number of computers .
There ’s also an option 3a , to tune up our Python implementation .
When you ’ve run out of main memory , any estimate of runtime based on big - O analysis becomes useless .
The system either crashes or thrashes , paging in virtual memory .
By contrast , if we can reduce the memory required by a program , the time analysis should still hold — we never have to page in more time .
Once you ’ve watched the dynamic programming solution a few times , you ’ll realise that the LCS lengths ( the numbers in the grid ) are computed row by row , with each row only depending on the row above .
If we just wanted to calculate the LCS length of two sequences , we could write :
import itertools def lcs_length ( xs , ys ) : ''' Return the length of the LCS of xs and ys .
Example : >>> lcs_length ( " HUMAN " , " CHIMPANZEE " ) 4 ''' ny = len ( ys ) curr = list ( itertools .repeat(0 , 1 + ny ) ) for x in xs : prev = list ( curr ) for i , y in enumerate ( ys ) : if x == y : curr [ i+1 ] = prev[ i ] + 1 else : curr [ i+1 ] = max ( curr[i ] , prev[ i+1 ] ) return curr[ny ]
This LCS length algorithm requires just a linear amount of space for the current and previous rows in the grid ( in fact we could halve this space again , since each the LCS calculation for each cell in the grid only depends on the contents of the previous ny + 2 cells , but the code is a little more subtle ) .
To calculate an actual LCS , though , we would still need a full grid of moves for the final backtracking stage of the algorithm .
Clearly we can compact this grid , since each cell contains one of four moves ( ↑ , ← , ↖ e ) and can therefore be be represented in just 2 bits .
Despite this , the grid would still occupy a quadratic amount of space .
Fortunately , an ingenious hybrid algorithm by Professor Dan Hirschberg requires just a linear amount of space .
In a 1975 paper titled “ A linear space algorithm for computing maximal common subsequences ” , D.S. Hirschberg describes a technique for computing an LCS using space proportional to the length of the inputs .
The algorithm combines the dynamic programming technique discussed in this article with a classic divide and conquer approach .
If you search for this paper , you ’ll soon find a copy of the original online .
It ’s just three pages long and very accessible .
The key idea is to split one of the input sequences in two .
>>> mid = len( xs ) //2 >>> xb , xe = xs [ : mid ] , xs[mid : ]
We then calculate LCS lengths for the pair ( xb , ys ) and the pair ( reversed ( xe ) , reversed ( ys ) ) .
If we find a y- position , k , which maximises the sums of these forward and backwards LCS lengths , then we have a suitable position to split ys .
Thus our answer reduces to finding the answer for two smaller subsequences .
>>> yb , ye = ys [ : k ] , ys[k : ] >>>
lcs_xs_ys = lcs( xb , yb ) + lcs( xe , ye )
The picture shows the first stage of this algorithm for the input pair ( PYTHON , PONY ) .
split PYTHON evenly into PYT , HON working forwards from the top left , use lcs_length ( ' PYT ' , ' PONY ) ' to fill the T row of the grid .
working backwards from the bottom right , use lcs_length ( ' NOH ' , ' YNOP ) ' to fill the H row of the grid find the column which maximises the sum of lcs lengths on the T and H rows , adding each T - item to the H-item below and one to the right .
In this case , the sums are + 2 , 1 + 2 , 1 + 1 , 1 + 0 , 2 + , the maximum value of 3 is at 1 + 2 . split PONY at this column .
thus lcs( ' PYTHON ' , ' PONY ' ) is equal to lcs ( ' PYT ' , ' P ' ) + lcs( ' HON ' , ' ONY ' )
Hirschberg proves the correctness of this algorithm and goes on to prove that it has quadratic performance but requires just a linear amount of space .
The code looks something like the following .
import itertools def lcs_lens ( xs , ys ) : curr = list ( itertools.repeat(0 , 1 + len(ys ) ) ) for x in xs : prev = list ( curr ) for i , y in enumerate ( ys ) : if x == y : curr [ i + 1 ] = prev[ i ] + 1 else : curr [ i + 1 ] = max ( curr[i ] , prev[ i + 1 ] ) return curr def lcs ( xs , ys ) : nx , ny = len ( xs ) , len ( ys ) if nx == 0 : return [ ] elif nx == 1 : return [ xs [ 0 ] ] if xs [ 0 ] in ys else [ ] else : i = nx // 2 xb , xe = xs [ : i ] , xs[ i :] ll_b = lcs_lens ( xb , ys ) ll_e = lcs_lens ( xe [ : : - 1 ] , ys [ : : - 1 ] ) _ , k = max ( ( ll_b[j ] + ll_e[ny - j ] , j ) for j in range ( ny + 1 ) ) yb , ye = ys [ : k ] , ys[k :] return lcs ( xb , yb ) + lcs( xe , ye )
I say “ something like ” because this code is unpolished and inefficient .
Although the space requirement is proportional to the input sizes , it continually creates new list slices in order to get the job done .
It may well be capable of handling large inputs in a using a limited amount of memory , but it takes far too long doing so .
On a more positive note , at least this implementation passes some simple tests .
def test ( ) : concat = ''. join assert concat ( lcs ( '' , '' ) ) == '' assert concat ( lcs ( 'a ' , '' ) ) == '' assert concat ( lcs ( '' , ' b ' ) ) == '' assert concat ( lcs ( ' abc ' , ' abc ' ) ) == ' abc ' assert concat ( lcs ( ' abcd ' , ' obce ' ) ) == ' bc ' assert concat ( lcs ( ' abc ' , ' ab ' ) ) == ' ab ' assert concat ( lcs ( ' abc ' , ' bc ' ) ) == ' bc ' assert concat ( lcs ( ' abcde ' , ' zbodf ' ) ) == ' bd ' assert concat ( lcs ( ' aa ' , 'aaaa ' ) ) == ' aa ' assert concat( lcs ( ' GTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA ' , 'ACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA ' ) ) == ' GTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA '
This is an achievment in itself : if you examine the implementation , you ’ll see plenty of space for off - by - one errors to creep in .
This is about as far as we ’ll get with Python , but a working implementation is a great resource when we switch to a more efficient language .
Remember our original problem ?
At last we ’re ready to take it on .
In 2008 , 38096 runners completed the world ’s largest running event , the New York City marathon .
A full set of results is available online , one page at a time , but it ’s not too hard to scrape them into a single file for convenient offline processing .
Runners ’ ages are supplied to the nearest year .
To find a longest sublist of the results comprising runners who are n’t getting any older , we sort the results in reverse age order , then run our LCS algorithm against the original results list .
Note that we use age alone for comparison : so , for example , GAUTI HOSKULDSSON ( a 47 year old male who finished in 295th place with a time of 2:47:00 ) equals PHILIPPE LETESSIER ( also 47 , male , 298th in 2:47:14 ) .
To find a longest sublist of runners who are getting strictly younger , we must uniquify the youth - ordered results before applying the LCS algorithm .
Here ’s a sketch of how we ’d do it in Python .
I ’ve omitted details of the AgingRunner class ; all that matters is that it has an age field , which is used for both ordering and equality comparisons .
class AgingRunner : ''' Class to represent runners keyed by age . ''' .... def __lt__( self , other ) : ''' Return True if this runner is * older * than the other . ''' return self.age > other.age def __eq__( self , other ) : ''' Return True if this runner is the same age as the other . ''' return self.age == other.age def uniq ( xs ) : import itertools , operator return map( operator.itemgetter(0 ) , itertools.groupby( xs ) ) runners = read_in_results ( ) srunners = list ( sorted ( runners ) ) not_getting_older = lcs( runners , srunners ) urunners = list ( uniq ( srunners ) ) getting_younger = lcs( runners , urunners )
Sadly this really is just a sketch .
Even though our space efficient Python LCS implementation runs comfortably in main memory on a modern computer , it just is n’t quick enough .
Hirschberg ’s paper ( published way back in 1975 ) says :
We present an algorithm which will solve this problem in quadratic time and in linear space .
For example , assuming coefficients of 2 microseconds and 10 bytes [ … ] for strings of length 10,000 we would require a little over 3 minutes and 100 K bytes .
If we suppose a modern computer runs 1000 times faster , but that our naive Python implementation is 100 times slower than native code , for input sizes of 38096 we ’d expect a run time of around 6 minutes .
Sadly this estimate turns out to be optimistic .
It took me almost an hour and a half to run this program on a computer with a 2GHZ Intel Core duo processor .
C++ excels at high performance sequence crunching .
Rather than try and tune up my Python program I used it as a reference implementation for a C++ one .
The C++ version processed the full set of results in a respectable 18 seconds , giving a coefficient of around 12 nanoseconds — much closer to the figure I ’d expect from a machine with a 2.33 GHz processor .
I found the longest sequence of runners who were n’t getting any older had length 1724 .
I also found a sequence of 60 runners who were getting younger , covering every age between 80 and 18 , with the exceptions of 79 , 77 , 76 .

Here ’s a C++ implementation based on the reference Python implementation .
It should work on any container type which supports forward and reverse iteration .
It ’s similar to the Python implementation , but note :
rather than copy slices of the original sequences , it passes around iterators and reverse iterators into these sequences rather than recursively accumulating sums of sub -LCS results , it ticks off items in a members array , xs_in_lcs

This is a divide and conquer algorithm .

You may be thinking this is all of academic interest only .
Who really cares about the longest common subsequence problem ?
Well , anyone who uses version control does .
The longest common subsequence problem is closely related to the more general edit distance problem , which is all about finding the smallest number of point mutations needed to change one sequence into another .
For example , if we allow just two such mutations :
insert an element delete an element
then the number of mutations needed to convert a xs into ys is the sum of the lengths of xs and ys minus twice the length of their LCS .
Or in Python :
>>> edit_distance ( xs , ys ) == len( xs ) + len(ys ) - 2 * lcs( xs , ys ) True
For example , we can change “ HUMAN ” into “ CHIMPANZEE ” using the LCS , “ HMAN ” as follows : delete the U from HUMAN , to give HMAN , then insert C , I , P , Z , E , E giving CHIMPANZEE .
In general :
find an LCS of xs and ys .
Let ’s say this LCS has length L . strike out all elements of xs which are not in this LCS , a total of len( xs ) - L moves now insert all the elements of ys which are missing from the LCS , another len( ys ) - L moves .
Thus the edit distance is at most len( xs ) + len(ys ) - 2 * L .
It remains to show there can be no shorter edit distance .
The same argument works well enough in reverse .
Given a minimal edit sequence , note we do not delete anything we already inserted , otherwise we could remove this insert - delete pair to form a shorter edit sequence .
Thus we can sort this edit sequence so the deletions preceed the insertions to form another minimal edit sequence . .
Now process all the deletions , leaving a subsequence of xs .
Since we can now get from this subsequence to ys using insertions alone , it must also be a subsequence of ys .
More general variants of the edit distance problem allow substitution and transposition mutations , and may assign weights to each type of mutation .
In all cases , similar algorithms can be used to the dynamic programming algorithm shown in this example , but improvements can be made if we know the inputs are similar — as in the case of genetic mutations , for example .
I ’ve already mentioned Cormen , Leiserson , Rivest and Stein ’s classic reference , “ Introduction to Algorithms ” ( CLRS for short ) .
This book introduces the longest common subsequence problem as follows :
In biological applications , we often want to compare the DNA of two ( or more ) different organisms . [… ]
For example , the DNA of one organism may be S 1 = ACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA while the DNA of another organism may be S 2 = GTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA .
One goal of comparing two strands of DNA is to determine how “ similar ” the two strands are , as some measure of how cosely related the two organisms are .
And , CLRS goes on to say , the longest common subsequence of S 1 and S 2 is one such measure of similarity .
In this case , the longest common subsequence , S 3 would be GTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA
Genetic comparision is an important application of sequence matching .
As already mentioned , it ’s also a special case , which means we can can do rather better than the general purpose algorithm presented above .
For one thing , the alphabet of bases , Adenine , Cytosine , Guanine , Thymine has just 4 elements .
More importantly , the evolution of life on this planet is based around DNA replication .
Over 400 million years , glitches in DNA replication lead to genetic mutations , leading in turn to a variety of life forms .
But , for example , human and chimpanzee DNA are at least 96 % similar .
If we ’re comparing two human genomes , a recent article entitled Human genomes as email attachments points out :
The key insight is to consider that any two human genomes are more than 99 % identical .
So the random A , C , G , T sequences I used earlier this article were highly non-representative .
When the edit distance , D , between two sequences is small compared to the lengths of these sequences , more specialised algorithms can calculate this distance in O ( ND ) complexity and linear space .
I ’m not going to discuss these algorithms here , but they ’re elegant and accessible .
See a 1986 paper “ An O ( ND ) difference algorithm and its variations ” by Eugene W. Myers for more details .
Similar considerations apply to a version controlled file .
Generally the distance between two versions of a file is small compared to the size of the file itself ; the Unix diff and patch tools exploit this , as do the difference engines embedded in version control systems .
Here ’s a comment in Subversion ’s differencing engine .
/* * Calculate the Longest Common Subsequence between two datasources . *
This function is what makes the diff code tick .
* * The LCS algorithm implemented here is described by Sun Wu , * Udi Manber and Gene Meyers in " An O ( NP ) Sequence Comparison Algorithm " * */
( I ’m fairly sure they mean “ Myers ” , and P is the the number of deletions in an edit sequence .
You can easily find a copy of the referenced paper , which walks through a beautiful greedy algorithm and beats Myers ’ earlier O ( ND ) algorithm by a factor of two , or better . )
The longest common subsequence problem and the more general edit distance problem have been — and continue to be — extensively studied .
A classic dynamic programming solution to this problem is based on an elegant recursive algorithm , though by the time we ’ve created an efficient implementation some of that elegance has been hidden .
And efficiency , here , is an important consideration , since the general purpose algorithm presented in this article is of quadratic complexity .
A Python implementation is quick to develop and flexible enough to experiment with .
With some effort we can control its space requirements .
But a C++ implementation comfortably outperforms
Python by an order of magnitude or more , and for large inputs , compiled native code is required .
Does this make Python suitable only for toy projects , short scripts and blog posts ?
No , but I ’ll save a more complete answer for another time !
In the case where the input sequences are similar , more efficient greedy algorithms exist .
These algorithms form the backbone of the venerable Unix diff tool and of modern version control systems .
Let ’s not forget that we really wanted to solve the longest ordered subsequence problem , not the longest common subsequence problem .
In the next episode we ’ll explore a beautiful — and efficient — longest ordered subsequence algorithm .
My thanks to Soeren Meyer - Eppler for reporting a tricky bug in the C++ LCS implementation .
I should have run more tests using - D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG - D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC !
Note 1 .
The results served up from the official New York Marathon site were encoded using charset=iso - 8859 - 1 , and I maintained this encoding for my local copy of these results .
In Python 3.0 , you can explicitly specify an encoding when opening a file in text mode .
>>> fp = open ( 'nyc-results.txt ' , encoding='iso-8859-1 ' )
From the documentation :
encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file .
This should only be used in text mode .
The default encoding is platform dependent , but any encoding supported by Python can be passed .
See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings .
Somewhere along the line a case conversion algorithm must have failed to get the details right .

Note 2 . I ’ve already pointed out Python 3.0 ’s extended unpacking syntax .
Here ’s another example :
>>> car , * cdr = items
Note 3 .
You may well have spotted the truncating integer division used in the divide and conquer algorithm :
>>> i = nx // 2
Without the double slash , i would become a floating point number , and using it as slice index would raise a TypeError .
The // floor division operator is available in Python 2.6 and earlier and I recommend using it for all C - style truncating integer divisions .
Here ’s the full history .
Note 4 . To order and compare runners by age for the preliminary sort ( ) and the subsequent lcs ( ) calls , I added __lt__ and __eq__ methods to the AgingRunner class .
In Python 2.6 the __cmp__ method could have been used instead of these rich comparison methods , but this is no longer supported in 3.0 .
A recipe by Raymond Hettinger demonstrates a class decorator which automatically creates all the rich comparisons methods from any subset of them ( e.g. __gt__ , __ge__ , __le__ can all be sensibly derived from __lt__ ) .

Counter Intuitive Way of Lowering Your Spending
It ’s not that I do n’t like saving money ( yes I do ) , but when weeks go by without me splurging , that wallet of mine seems to vibrate by itself .
The urge is always to press snooze by buying something , but the silence only lasts for a short while .
It ’s amazing to me how this works but it seems like the less I spend , the less I want to spend .
I used to want to go out for lunches all the time .
But now that I work at home and have n’t eaten out for a while , I do n’t feel the need to go out and grab a bite .
I used to have a bowl of ice - cream every night when I was a teenager , and boy would I want one if the sugar rush have n’t started by 9 pm .
I still love that sweet taste , but I do n’t feel like life is crashing down nowadays when I do n’t have a bowl .
I think smoking works the same way , but there ’s no nicotine in ice - cream I do n’t think ( at least that ’s what the product label tell me ) .
It even works with diets I think .
The less I eat , I less I want to eat .
If I continue eating big meals , the more hungrier I get in the days following .
It ’s as if my stomach can expand and shrunk on minutes notice , but it ’s more my desire bubble that does the inflating and deflating .
Reducing your spending this way is not for the faith of heart though .
The beginning days are just awful as you have to endure that stupid vibrating wallet .
The telepathic vibration is so strong that no matter how well hidden your wallet , it will know how to call for you .
If you can continue to ignore it , the vibration will then become less frequent .
Each time , it will have less strength until one day , you do n’t feel it vibrating anymore .
If your wallet is vibrating right now , maybe it ’s better to let it be so it runs out of batteries by itself .

Posted : Fri Feb 18 , 2005 5:16 am Post subject : HOWTO : Mount / in RAM and load apps instantly
So you want to mount / in RAM for a super - speedy system ?
Here 's what you need to make your gentoo FLY
/ usr must be on it's own partition
/ home must be on it's own partition if it 's large or you use it for storage
/ root must be on it's own partition if you 're putting anything big in it
/ var on it 's own partition ( so we do n't fill up the RAM drive with logs / portage cache )
an empty directory called / newroot
You must have a partition to store the tarballs on ( I use the same partition that ends up being / root ) and it can't be /usr .
Maybe use the partition that was / during the install
computer must have a spare 176MB of RAM or so .
( Depends how much you want to load into RAM )
You need to have ramdisk , initial ramdisk , loopback device support in the kernel , not as modules .
These choices can be found under block devices , which is under device drivers .
The amount of performance boost in order of magnitude , by which is loaded into RAM seems to be
/usr/lib
/lib
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin & /sbin
Step 1
Install as normal
Step 2
generate the tarballs that will populate our RAM drives
put this in / sbin so you can run it should you update your system ( make sure STORE is mounted first if applicable ! ) :
I figured this out based on this post :

Code :
echo / sbin/ update - balls >>
/etc/conf.d/local.stop
chmod +x /sbin/update- balls
cat / sbin / update - balls
##############
#!/bin/sh
CURRDIR=`/bin/pwd`
STORE =" root "
cd /
# Exclude anything that 's on it's own partition here
tar cfp $ {STORE} / fs.tar * -- exclude=usr /* -- exclude=root /* -- exclude=home /* \
-- exclude=proc /* -- exclude=sys /* -- exclude=tmp/* -- exclude=var /* \
-- exclude=opt /*
cd /usr /
# rm - fr /usr / bin /usr / sbin /usr / lib
# cp -a /usr /.bin /usr/bin
# cp -a /usr/.sbin /usr/sbin
# cp -a /usr/.lib /usr/lib
cd bin && tar cfp /$ {STORE}/usr_bin.tar *
cd ../sbin && tar cfp /$ {STORE}/usr_sbin.tar *
cd ../ lib && tar cfp /$ {STORE}/usr_lib.tar *
# rm - fr /usr / bin /usr / sbin /usr / lib
# mkdir /usr / bin /usr / sbin /usr / lib
cd $ CURRDIR
Step 3
Now we have to make an initrd to perform the population of our RAM drive before we load init :
Code :
mount / boot # If necessary
touch / boot / initrd
dd if=/dev/zero of=/ boot / initrd bs =1024 k count=8
losetup / dev/loop0 / boot / initrd
mke2fs /dev/loop0
Now we have loop0 mounted as the initrd .
Time to populate it :
Code :
mkdir / mnt/ initrd
mount / dev/loop0 / mnt / initrd
cd /mnt / initrd
mkdir etc dev lib bin proc new store
touch linuxrc etc/mtab etc/fstab
chmod +x linuxrc
for I in sh cat mount umount mkdir chroot tar ; do cp / bin / $ I bin / ; done
cp /sbin / pivot_root bin/
We need a / newroot directory to hold the initrd after the system 's booted .
Code : mkdir / newroot
Now we have to copy the libraries that each of these binaries needs .
You can determine this a la :
Code :
ldd /bin/sh
linux - gate.so.1 => ( 0xffffe000 )
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 ( 0xb7fe2000 )
libc.so.6 =>
/lib/tls/libc.so.6 ( 0xb7eca000 )
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0xb7feb000 )
means we need / lib/ libdl.so.2 /lib/tls/libc.so.6 , lib/ld-linux.so.2
Here 's what I needed in total :
Code :
ls -R lib
lib :
ld-linux.so.2 libblkid.so.1 libdl.so.2 libuuid.so.1 tls
lib /tls :
libc.so.6 libpthread.so.0 librt.so.1
Please check each of your binaries in case you need something I do n't .
Then we need to write the linuxrc script that does the dirty work :
Code :
cat / mnt/ initrd / linuxrc
################
#!/bin/sh
export PATH=/ bin
STOREDEV=/dev/hda10
STORE=/ store
ROOTSIZE=128m
# Get kernel CMDLINE
mount -t proc none / proc
CMDLINE=`cat / proc/ cmdline`
umount / proc
mount $ STOREDEV $ STORE
# Mount root and create read - write directories
mount -t tmpfs -o size=$ ROOTSIZE none / new / > / dev/null 2>&1
cd /new / && tar xpf $ STORE / fs.tar > / dev/null 2>&1
umount $ STOREDEV
# Pivot root and start real init
cd /new
pivot_root .
newroot
exec chroot .
/ bin/sh <<- EOF > dev/console 2>&1
exec / sbin / init $ {CMDLINE}
EOF
Once that 's done , we need to make the device nodes that this will use :
Code :
mknod /mnt/initrd/dev/console c 5 1
mknod /mnt/initrd/dev/null c 1 3
mknod /mnt/initrd/dev/hda b 3 0
mknod / mnt/ initrd/dev/hda4 b 3 4
mknod / mnt/ initrd/dev/hda10 b 3 10
You only need the nodes for the mounts that the linuxrc script uses ( see /usr / src/ linux / Documentation /devices.txt )
And that 's it for the initrd Code : umount / mnt / initrd
Step 4
Modify /etc/init.d/localmount Code : start ( ) {
USRBINSIZE=32m
USRSBINSIZE=2m
USRLIBSIZE=256m
# Mount local filesystems in /etc / fstab .
ebegin " Mounting local filesystems "
mount - at nocoda , nonfs , noproc , noncpfs , nosmbfs , noshm >/dev/null
eend $ ?
" Some local filesystem failed to mount "
ebegin " Mounting RAM filesystems "
mount -t tmpfs -o size=$ USRBINSIZE none /usr / bin > / dev/null 2>&1
mount -t tmpfs -o size=$ USRSBINSIZE none /usr / sbin > / dev/null 2>&1
mount -t tmpfs -o size=$ USRLIBSIZE none /usr / lib > / dev/null 2>&1
cd /usr / bin && tar xpf / root/usr_bin.tar > / dev/null 2>&1
cd /usr / sbin && tar xpf /root/usr_sbin.tar > / dev/null 2>&1
cd /usr / lib && tar xpf /root/usr_lib.tar > / dev/null 2>&1
eend $ ?
" Some RAM filesystems did not mount "
Step 5
Modify the bootloader
Code :
cat / boot / grub / grub.conf
################
timeout 3
default 0
# For booting GNU / Linux from an existing install ( rescue )
title Gentoo
root ( hd0,0 )
kernel / bzImage root=/ dev/ram0 rw init=linuxrc video=vesafb : ywrap , pmipal,1024x768-16@70
initrd / initrd
Step 6
If you find that /usr / lib is too big to make a reasonable RAM drive , perhaps move some things to /usr / local / lib / and link them , eg :
Code :
cd /usr / lib
for I in perl5 python2.3 portage modules gcc gcc-lib ; do
mv $ I ../ local / lib/
ln -s ../ local / lib / $ I $ I
done
Putting portage in the RAM drive sure is a nice speedup , tho .
Code : time /usr / bin/emerge -s mozilla
real 0m3.680s
user 0m2.978s
sys 0m0.131s
Step 7
Finalizing
Code : mv /usr / sbin /usr/.sbin
mv /usr / bin /usr/.bin
mv /usr / lib /usr/.lib
reboot
###########Aside##########
If you just want to load certain applications from a RAM disk , you can do something like the following
Code :
##do this in advance
tar cpf /root / preload.tar /usr/bin/firefox /lib/and /lib/all /usr/lib/of /usr/lib/ the /lib/raries / it's/ dependent /lib/on
# #replace all the original bins and libraries with links to / preload / whatever
##Then put this in /etc/conf.d/local.start
mount -t tmpfs -o size =128 m none / preload > / dev/null 2>&1
cd / preload && tar xfp /root / preload.tar

Oh , how sad that /usr / lib ist as big as my RAM ( 1 GB ) .
This all brings nothing when there is something swapped .
I would rely on the caching of the kernel .
If there is RAM free , diskspace is cached , if the applications need RAM , they use it .
There is now swapping ( swapping costs time ) .
I do n't think that this will speed up anything in real life .

I´ll test it anyway , but do you notice some performance - boost ?
I´ve tried to put some files and libs on a ramdisk before , but it wasn´t faster than it was without ...

Posted : Sat Feb 19 , 2005 11:00 am Post subject : I am going to try this on a 29 node ltsp server this weekend .
right now , if everyone opens firefox , it sits and chugs for minutes before everyone has it open .
We 'll see if this makes a difference .
For me , my HD is damn fast anyways .
It just replaced it with a 200 GB seagate .
It is definately faster with the libs running off RAM ( I only have 512MB ) , but it was pretty fast to begin with .
I like the idea of doing this with a CD booting OS so the damn disk does n't have to keep spinning up and down , tho .

Hey there ,
nice guide , but some parts are hard to understand I think .
Quote : / usr must be on it's own partition
/ home must be on it's own partition if it 's large or you use it for storage
/ root must be on it's own partition if you 're putting anything big in it
/ var on it 's own partition ( so we do n't fill up the RAM drive with logs / portage cache )

You must have a partition to store the tarballs on ( I use the same partition that ends up being / root ) and it can't be /usr .
Maybe use the partition that was / during the install
computer must have a spare 176MB of RAM or so .
( Depends how much you want to load into RAM )
Do you mean I should create more partitions and update my /etc / fstab , or is it okay to let these on my root - partition ?
Do I generally have to edit my fstab file ?
Sorry if some of those questions sound stupid to you , but I 'm really lookin forward to try it out

Apps open instantly , but they do n't run any faster .
What this does is eliminate the bottleneck of loading the applications and their dependent libraries into RAM off the HD .
Also , RAM seeks WAY faster than a HD , so if multiple instances of an app are called , the system does n't sit and chug for 10 minutes while the hard - drive tries to do 100 things at once .
I set this up on an LTSP server with 1GB of RAM and it was quite fast with 4 clients connected .
I then powered up the other 30 workstations and it ran out of RAM ( because they have KDE on the silly thing ) and ran horribly because it was swapping .
30 KDE desktops sure use a lot of RAM ( about 40 MB a piece ) .
The RAMdisk was 512MB and had / bin , / sbin , / lib , openoffice firefox , AND most of /usr / lib on it .

Imagine what this would do for Linux !
Next time you show some friend of yours Linux , just fire up firefox / whatever and * zip * it 's there .
Startuptimes alone makes a huge impression .
Bravo , great work !
How much work would it be to make a script that let 's you pick programs already installed , create the neccessary dir 's and put everything into ram upon reboot ?

Wow , my /usr / lib is nearly 1GB as well ... how would you suggest cleaning it out without breaking anything ?
This RAM stuff sounds really cool ..
I just wish I had more RAM to burn .
Only 256MB here .
Though , perhaps I may try it out with single applications later .

It 's looking like thebigslide might be the minority instead of the norm on this one .
I 'll admit I have a fair number of programs installed , but I clean out old and unused packages regularily .
I need everything that I have installed right now ... too bad .

To those of you with large /usr / libs : did you look to see what was using the space ?
I 'm just curious .
If you use rox -filer , there 's a nice count feature that tells you the total folder size for multiple selected folders .
You can get a nice idea of where your disk - space is going .
Also , you can easily make a folder in / usr called preload ( or whatever ) and mount that in a RAM drive , link things back to /usr / lib and the silly symlinks that rely on .. to point to /usr will still work
The lets you pick and choose what is loaded and what is n't loaded into RAM very eaily and could be automated with a simple bash script .
odegard :
My buddy Cory is working on one of these right now that takes the binary name as an argument and copies it and all it 's dependent libraries to a tmpfs mount and links back to the original after renaming the originals . whatever .
The script will soon have start and stop functions and take a config file .
Might make an interesting addition to some people 's init scripts .
Also , btw , I have shown this to a hard core winblowz user who swore he'd never convert to using linux on his desktop because it appears slower ( even though his HTPC I made him runs KDE on gentoo on a dual AMD 1800 + box )
He was jealous .
People like me are working towards making linux easier for the windows transition crowd .
Having apps startup fast is a big thing for those people ( especially if they 've spent a ton of $ $ on a computer already so it will have acceptable performance under windows ) .
Other projects this particular gentooer is working on include a GUI based livecd and various lightweight stage4 tarballs that can be rebuilt with -e world transparently after install , to allow people to install a working gentoo OS with under 5 minutes of interactivity ( and that in a gui ) along with post - stages that will add functionality in different areas as binaries and then be easily recompiled / optimized later .
All use ebuild and portage .
Look out for more howtos
I love Gentoo .
Hmm , you guys are missing a big plus to this .
By putting critical things on a RAM drive and umounting the partition that holds the tarballs and the update script , you are preventing changes to those files except when you run the script to do so .
If someone were to h@ > < 0r your b0 > < 0r , they'd be changing things in a RAM drive that is flushed as soon as you reboot !
This is also awesome fun for a honey pot running SSH with a typical password or a service with a well known vulnerability .
You can see how people go about exploiting these boxes by simply diffing the filesystems and learn how to better secure your _real_ servers ( which are also packing a root RAM drive for security ) .

Hey there ,
nice guide , but some parts are hard to understand I think .
Quote : / usr must be on it's own partition
/ home must be on it's own partition if it 's large or you use it for storage
/ root must be on it's own partition if you 're putting anything big in it
/ var on it 's own partition ( so we do n't fill up the RAM drive with logs / portage cache )
an empty directory called / newroot
You must have a partition to store the tarballs on ( I use the same partition that ends up being / root ) and it can't be /usr .
Maybe use the partition that was / during the install
computer must have a spare 176MB of RAM or so .
( Depends how much you want to load into RAM )
Do you mean I should create more partitions and update my /etc / fstab , or is it okay to let these on my root - partition ?
Do I generally have to edit my fstab file ?
Sorry if some of those questions sound stupid to you , but I 'm really lookin forward to try it out Do you mean I should create more partitions and update my /etc / fstab , or is it okay to let these on my root - partition ?

Sorry I missed your post earlier .
You must have any large folder on it's own physical partition on the disk .
You will have to edit fstab if you 'd like the partitions mounted by gentoo automatically .
/ var especially must be on it's own partition or someone can DoS your logger and maybe other things by making it fill up the RAM drive .

Posted : Wed Feb 23 , 2005 7:12 am Post subject : nah , i´ve tried to try it , but i´ve failed with the common " kernel panic : unable to find init .
Try passing init= at the kernel line " .
Initrd is found , kernel boots fine , then this error .
But :
-i HAVE linuxrc
-i HAVE passed the option
dunno .
I remember having this probling when i built my own stage4 - livedvd , and i fixed it , but i can´t remember how .
And i´ve read almost any post on this forum that ´s related to this .
K , some description :
- linuxrc is on / in my initrd
- line from grub : Code : kernel / bzImage root= / dev/ram0 rw init= / linuxrc ramdisk=32768
- i also changed the init= to every path i could think of and copied the file everywhere , no go .
Any ideas anyone ?

What are it 's contents ?
You can try setting init= / bin / sh in grub and then enter your initrd line by line , also .

@thebigslide :
linuxrc is executable , works if i start it by hand , and if i set init= / bin / bash i get a shell and can do my job .
Only if i call linuxrc it doesn´t work , even if i copy it to / bin and call init= / bin / linuxrc from grub .
Dunno .
Thanks for the help , maybe s/o has another answer for me
Another one :
if i call " pivot_root . newroot " it tells me " no such device ... " .
It only works for me if i set newroot to some available directory .
Now a tip from me :
I don´t use your tar - solution for / bin , / sbin etc .
Instead i use my old root - partition which i mount in / store .
Then i copy over / bin , /etc , / sbin , ... to my root - ramdrive ( ~50 mb ) , unmount / store and proceed .
So i don´t need to modify localmount and don´t need to untar ( takes too much time for me )
for backing up my files before reboot / halt , i use this lil script :

you need to mkdir / newroot on your root filesystem before tarring it up / newroot is the path that the initrd will reside at following the pivotroot so it must exist for the command to be executed .

yeah , i noticed this
Anyway , ´til now there´s no great speed gain .
Not that i would notice it , at least .
I´ll try moving some of the " most - wanted " libs to the ramdisk , maybe things´ll change then .
All of ´em won´t work since my / lib is 1.5 G ...
Any ideas what else could help speeding things up ?

The idea of using scrip to stimulate spending dates back to the 1890s , when Silvio Gesell wrote a series of books related to monetary system reform .
He claimed that since money held its nominal value over time , there was little reason to be in a hurry to spend it .
This encouraged people to hoard money during periods of financial stress .
Gesell , following a suggestion made by Swiss merchant George Nordman , argued that a “ carrying tax ” on money could prevent hoarding .
Gesell suggested that a periodic tax placed on money could do the trick .
By making it costly to hold money , he believed people would be encouraged to spend it .
In a severe depression , the idea that spending could be stimulated by making money costly to hold seemed appealing .
In fact , Gesell ’s views received the stamp of approval of the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes in his General Theory .
Keynes viewed stamp scrip as a possible solution to what has been referred to as a “ liquidity trap ” — a situation where interest rates are so low in an economy , that no one cares to hold interest - bearing assets .
By establishing a carrying tax on money , the nominal rate of return on money could be lowered , creating an incentive for people to hold interest - bearing assets , which might stimulate greater production across the economy .
Some people are concerned that in the the fight against recession , the weapons of monetary policy are nearly out of ammunition .
That is certainly the case for the standard monetary weapon -- cuts in short - term interest rates .
After all , short - term interest rates are already about zero , and the Fed can not cut interest rates below zero .
Or can it ?
In a discussion at a Harvard seminar recently , a clever grad student proposed a solution to the zero - lower - bound problem .
Let 's begin with the basics :
Why can't the Fed cut interest rates to below zero ?
Why can't the Fed announce , for example , an interest rate of negative 2 percent ?
You borrow $ 100 today and repay $ 98 a year from now .
A negative interest rate would certainly encourage people to borrow and spend , thereby expanding aggregate demand .
And if negative 2 percent was n't enough to get the economy going , we could try negative 3 percent .
And so on .
The problem , you might reply , is that no one would lend money on those terms .
Rather than lending at a negative interest rate , you could hold onto cash by , for example , stuffing it in your mattress .
In other words , the interest rate on loanable funds cannot fall below zero because holding cash guarantees a rate of return of zero .
If the Fed tried to cut interest rates below zero , money would dominate debt instruments as a portfolio investment .
With this background , I can now state the proposed solution : Reduce the return to holding money below zero .
Imagine that the Fed were to announce that , one year from today , it would pick a digit from 0 to 9 out of a hat .
All currency with a serial number ending in that digit would no longer be legal tender .
Suddenly , the expected return to holding currency would become negative 10 percent .
That move would free the Fed to cut interest rates below zero .
People would be delighted to lend money at negative 2 percent .
Losing 2 percent is better than losing 10 .
Of course , some people might decide that at those rates , they would rather spend the money by , for example , buying new car .
But since expanding aggregate demand is precisely the goal of the interest rate cut , that incentive is not a bug but a feature !
Okay , I understand that this plan is not entirely practical .
But you have to give the student credit for thinking out of the box .
And his plan does address a fundamental problem facing the economy right now :
Given the fall in wealth , increases in risk premiums , and problems in the banking system , the interest rate consistent with full employment might well be negative .--- Update : Alan Taylor of UC Davis ( and coauthor , incidentally , of an excellent international economics textbook ) reminds me of earlier versions of this kind of idea
Thanks , Alan , for the pointer .
( Newser ) – Hamas police in Gaza seized thousands of blankets and food parcels meant for needy residents , the AP reports , threatening to fracture relations between the international agency that cares for most of Gaza 's residents and the territory 's militant rulers .
A UN spokesman called the incident " absolutely unacceptable . "
Hamas policemen forcibly broke into an aid warehouse in Gaza City last night and confiscated 3,500 blankets and more than 4,000 food parcels — aid meant for 500 families — after UN officials refused to voluntarily hand it over to the Hamas - run Ministry of Social Affairs , the UN says .
The UN provides food , education , and health care to more than half of Gaza 's residents .

WILLIAM BLACK CALLS THEM AS HE SEES THEM , which is why we enjoy talking with him .
Black , 57 years old , was a deputy director at the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. during the thrift crisis of the 1980s , and now serves as an associate professor , teaching economics and law at the University of Missouri , Kansas City .
At FSLIC , a government agency that insured S&L deposits , Black prevailed in showdowns with the powerful Democratic Speaker of the House , Jim Wright , and helped identify the infamous Keating Five , a group of U.S. senators ( including Sen .
John McCain , the Arizona Republican who lost his bid for the presidency in 2008 ) who tried to quash his attempt to close Charles Keating 's Lincoln Savings & Loan .
Wright eventually resigned amid unrelated ethics charges , and the senators were reprimanded for poor judgment .
Keating went to jail for securities fraud .
" It 's like Gresham 's law : Bad money drives out the good .
Well , bad behavior drives out good behavior , without good enforcement . "
– William Black Ron Berg for Barron's
For Black 's provocative thoughts on the current financial crisis , read on .
Barron's : Just how serious is this credit crisis ?
What is at stake here for the American taxpayer ?
Black : Mopping up the savings - and - loan crisis cost $ 150 billion ; this current crisis will probably cost a multiple of that .
The scale of fraud is immense .
This whole bank scandal makes Teapot Dome [ of the 1920s ] look like some kid 's doll set .
Unless the current administration changes course pretty drastically , the scandal will destroy Barack Obama 's presidency .
The Bush administration was even worse .
But they are out of town .
This will destroy Obama 's administration , both economically and in terms of integrity .
So you are saying Democrats as well as Republicans share the blame ?
No one can claim the high ground ?
We have failed bankers giving advice to failed regulators on how to deal with failed assets .
How can it result in anything but failure ?
If they are going to get any truthful investigation , the Democrats picked the wrong financial team .
Tim Geithner , the current Secretary of the Treasury , and Larry Summers , chairman of the National Economic Council , were important architects of the problems .
Geithner especially represents a failed regulator , having presided over the bailouts of major New York banks .
So you are n't a fan of the recently announced plan for the government to back private purchases of the toxic assets ?
It is worse than a lie .
Geithner has appropriated the language of his critics and of the forthright to support dishonesty .
That is what 's so appalling -- numbering himself among those who convey tough medicine when he is really pandering to the interests of a select group of banks who are on a first - name basis with Washington politicians .
The current law mandates prompt corrective action , which means speedy resolution of insolvencies .
He is flouting the law , in naked violation , in order to pursue the kind of favoritism that the law was designed to prevent .
He has introduced the concept of capital insurance , essentially turning the U.S. taxpayer into the sucker who is going to pay for everything .
He chose this path because he knew Congress would never authorize a bailout based on crony capitalism .
Geithner is mistaken when he talks about making deeply unpopular moves .
Such stiff resolve to put the major banks in receivership would be appreciated in every state but Connecticut and New York .
His use of language like " legacy assets " -- and channeling the worst aspects of Milton Friedman -- is positively Orwellian .
Extreme conservatives wrongly assume that the government can't do anything right .
And they wrongly assume that the market will ultimately lead to correct actions .
If cheaters prosper , cheaters will dominate .
It is like Gresham 's law : Bad money drives out the good .
Well , bad behavior drives out good behavior , without good enforcement .
His plan essentially perpetuates zombie banks by mispricing toxic assets that were mispriced to the borrower and mispriced by the lender , and which only served the unfaithful lending agent .
We already know from the real costs -- through the cleanups of IndyMac , Bear Stearns , and Lehman -- that the losses will be roughly 50 to 80 cents on the dollar .
The last thing we need is a further drain on our resources and subsidies by promoting this toxic - asset market .
By promoting this notion of too - big - to - fail , we are allowing a pernicious influence to remain in Washington .
The truth has a resonance to it .
The folks know they are being lied to .
I keep asking myself , what would we do in other avenues of life ?
What if every time we had a plane crash we said : ' It might be divisive to investigate .
We want to be forward - looking . '
Nobody would fly .
It would be a disaster .
We know that with planes , every time there is an accident , we look intensively , without the interference of politics .
That is why we have such a safe industry .
Summarize the problem as best you can for Barron 's readers .
With most of America 's biggest banks insolvent , you have , in essence , a multitrillion dollar cover - up by publicly traded entities , which amounts to felony securities fraud on a massive scale .
These firms will ultimately have to be forced into receivership , the management and boards stripped of office , title , and compensation .
First there needs to be a clearing of the air -- a Pecora - style fact - finding mission conducted without fear or favor .
[ Ferdinand Pecora was an assistant district attorney from New York who investigated Wall Street practices in the 1930s . ]
Then , we need to gear up to pursue criminal cases .
Two years after the market collapsed , the Federal Bureau of Investigation has one - fourth of the resources that the agency used during the savings - and - loan crisis .
And the current crisis is 10 times as large .
There need to be major task forces set up , like there were in the thrift crisis .
Right now , things do n't look good .
We are using taxpayer money via AIG to secretly bail out European banks like Société Générale , Deutsche Bank , and UBS -- and even our own Goldman Sachs .
To me , the single most obscene act of this scandal has been providing billions in taxpayer money via AIG to secretly bail out UBS in Switzerland , while we were simultaneously prosecuting the bank for tax fraud .
The second most obscene : Goldman receiving almost $ 13 billion in AIG counterparty payments after advising Geithner , president of the New York Fed , and then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , former Goldman Sachs honcho , on the AIG government takeover -- and also receiving government bailout loans .
What , then , is staying the federal government 's hand ?
Have the banks become too difficult or complex to regulate ?
The government is reluctant to admit the depth of the problem , because to do so would force it to put some of America 's biggest financial institutions into receivership .
The people running these banks are some of the most well - connected in Washington , with easy access to legislators .
Prompt corrective action is what is needed , and mandated in the law .
And that is precisely what is n't happening .
The savings - and - loan crisis showed that , too often , the regulators became too close to the industry , and run interference for friends by hiding the problems .
Can you explain your idea of control fraud , and how it applies to the current banking and the earlier thrift crisis ?
Control fraud is when a seemingly legitimate corporation uses its power as a weapon to defraud or take something of value through deceit .
In the savings - and - loan crisis , thrifts engaged in control frauds in order to survive .
Accounting trickery proved to be the weapon of choice .
It is at work today with the banks , and it is their Achilles heel .
You report that you are highly profitable when you engage in accounting - control fraud , not only meeting but exceeding capital requirements .
These accounting frauds create huge bubbles , which in turn create large bonuses , which in turn lead to huge losses .
Why then is there so much smoke and so little action ?
First , they are inundated by the problem .
They are trying to investigate the major problems with severely depleted staffs .
Honestly .
We have lost the ability to be blunt .
Now we have a situation where Treasury Secretary Geithner can speak of a $ 2 trillion hole in the banking system , at the same time all the major banks report they are well - capitalized .
And you have seen no regulatory action against what amounts to a $ 2 trillion accounting fraud .
The reason we do n't see it -- are n't told about it -- is that if they were honest , prompt corrective action would kick in , and they would have to deal with the problem banks .
Are there any parallels between the current crisis and the savings - and - loan crisis that give you hope ?
Of course .
Objectively , our case was even more hopeless in the S&L debacle than in the current crisis .
If we were able to do it in such an impossible circumstance back then , we have reason for hope in the current crisis .
I know how easily things can get off course and how quickly things can turn back again .
The thrift crisis went through several lengthy courses and distortions before it finally was resolved under the leadership of Edwin Gray , the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , which oversaw FSLIC .
We went through almost a decade of cover-ups by a Washington establishment intent on helping thrift owners .
Back then , we had the Justice Department threatening to indict Gray , the head of a federal agency , for closing too many thrifts .
Next , there were those so - called resolutions , where the regulators worked day and night -- to create even bigger problems for the FSLIC .
Years later , these so - called resolution deals had to be unwound at great expense by closing down even larger failures .
Or how about the bill to replenish the depleted thrift - insurance fund that was blocked and delayed by then - Speaker of the House , Texas congressman Jim Wright ?
You say the evidence of a breakdown in the regulatory structure comes from the fact that America avoided an earlier subprime crisis in the 1990s .
Exactly .
Why had no one heard of the subprime crisis back in 1991 ?
Because America 's regulators also faced down the crisis early .
The same thing happened with bad credits being securitized in the secondary market .
Remember the low - doc or no-doc mortgages done by Citibank ?
Well , the problem did n't spread -- because regulators intervened .
Obama , who is doing so well in so many other arenas , appears to be slipping because he trusts Democrats high in the party structure too much .
These Democrats want to maintain America 's pre-eminence in global financial capitalism at any cost .
They remain wedded to the bad idea of bigness , the so - called financial supermarket -- one - stop shopping for all customers -- that has allowed the American financial system to paper the world with subprime debt .
Even the managers of these worldwide financial conglomerates testify that they have become so sprawling as to be unmanageable .
What needs to be done ?
Well , these international behemoths need to be broken down into smaller units that can be managed effectively .
Maybe they can be broken up the way that the Standard Oil split up back in the early 1900s , through a simple share spinoff .
The big problem for the last decade is that we have had too much capacity in the finance sector -- too many banks have represented a drain on our talent and resources .
All these mergers have n't taken capacity out of the system .
They have created even bigger banks that concentrate risk to the taxpayer , and put off dealing with problems .
And a new seriousness must be put into regulation .
We do n't necessarily need new rules .
We just need folks who can enforce the ones already on the books .
The bank - compensation system also creates an environment that leads to mismanagement and fraud .
No one has to tell someone they have to stretch the numbers .
It is all around them .
It is in the rank - or - yank performance and retention systems advocated by top business executives .
Here , the top 20 % get the bulk of the benefits and the bottom 10 % get fired .
You do n't directly tell your employees you want them to lie and cheat .
You set up an atmosphere of results at any cost .
Rank or yank .
Sooner rather than later , someone comes up with the bright idea of fudging the numbers .
That 's big bonuses for the folks who make the best numbers .
It sends the message -- making the numbers is what is most important .
There is a reason that the average tenure of a chief financial officer is three years .
Compensation systems like I have just described discourage whistleblowing -- the most common way that frauds are found in America -- because the system draws upon the cooperation of everyone .
The basis for all regulation and white - collar crime is to take the competitive advantage away from the cheats , so the good guys can prevail .
We need to get back to that .
Thanks , Bill .

Advertisement A flashmob of tiny Plasticine figures have gathered on London 's Bankside to honour the memory of the late TV artist Tony Hart .
Almost 200 models in the shape of children 's TV favourite Morph were arranged in a Terracotta Army - style formation outside Tate Modern .
Hart 's daughter Carolyn Williams said she was " completely bowled over " by the gesture in memory of her father .
The children 's favourite died in January at the age of 83 .
[ My father ] would be absolutely thrilled .
He would have thought : ' You 're all completely mad ' but he would have been very touched

Morph army honours Tony Hart Hart inspired children to paint and draw on TV shows for nearly 50 years before he retired in 2001 .
Morph appeared alongside Hart from 1977 on several of his UK TV programmes , notably Take Hart and Hartbeat .
The event has been organised on social networking website Facebook by a group of friends who wanted to remember Hart .
Laura Kerry , a 31 - year - old arts manager from Walthamstow , won a competition for the Best Morph , which was judged by Ms Williams .
She said : " I only spent four hours making him .
I heard about it and I was just really moved and felt we had to be part of it . "
There were some unusual interpretations of the well - known figure Ms Williams , who is currently finishing a biography of her father 's life , said : " I 've been completely bowled over suddenly to discover that there are hundreds of people with whom I share my father and who probably love him almost as much as I do .
" I had no idea what to expect today .
We were saying to ourselves as we came here today ' will there be four or 400 ' ?
It 's absolutely lovely to see so many people here .

This trio of beauties shows China 's forward - thinking vision of the iPhone Nano .
Named the " HiPhone Nano " , this mongrel knock - off combines the worst of all worlds .
The HiPhone Nano is a tri-band GSM clam - shell which actually packs a few features that the full - sized , authentic model does n't .
You get a sub- sized 1.3MP camera , but it does record video .
There is also support for MMS ( something Apple will have taken three iterations of iPhone to get right ) , a microSD card slot , handwriting recognition ( yes , it has a touch screen when opened , below ) , an MP3 player ( and recorder ) and a stylus .
The price ?
A fantastically optimistic $ 400 , with an instant reduction to a still rather steep $ 125 .
Available now in red , gold or silver .

So as could be expected I was deluged with mail this weekend , most of it from outraged Michelle Malkin readers , and nearly all of whom sounded the same basic theme : that I was a bad , bad person for issuing ad hominem attacks and should be discredited for " not having my facts straight " and for being too much of a coward to " debate the real issues . "
Which is interesting , except that no one actually found an incorrect fact in anything I wrote , and no one seemed very interesting in debating any issues .
Instead , about 99 % of the mail I got focused on the name - calling and the " childish " sexual innuendoes .
I would say that is my fault , that I should have known that once you start dropping sack onto another columnist 's face in public you can pretty much forgo any expectation of being taken seriously -- except that when dealing with teabagger types , you know in advance you 're not going to be taken seriously anyway .
So the incentive to be restrained in one 's response ( particularly when the people you 're arguing with are running around screaming about the fascist threat with tea bags dangling absurdly from their hat - brims ) is not particularly strong .
But the real reason nobody takes the teabaggers seriously is that they have no answers to several enormous holes in the parody of a protest argument they tried to make last week .
I got nearly two hundred letters this weekend and not one of them had an answer for any of the following :
1 . If you 're so horrified by debt and spending , where were your tea parties when George Bush was adding $ 4 trillion to the federal deficit ?
2 . If you 're so outraged by the bailouts , where were your tea parties when the bailouts were first instituted by Henry Paulson and George Bush last fall ?
3 . If you 're so troubled by pork , where were your tea parties when the number and cost of congressional earmarks rose spectacularly in each year of Republican congressional rule between 1996 and the end of the Republican majority in 2006 ?
A number of people wrote in to me and complained that the only reason I 'm not seeing eye to eye with them is that I have no children and therefore do n't care about the debt burden in the future .
Oh , please .
There 's only one reason we 're talking about " the children " in this debate at all : because 95 % of the people protesting the tax outrage will actually be getting a tax break .
Until you can plausibly answer the question of why future government debt burdens did n't bother you during the last eight years or massive deficit spending , that whole " O the children ! " bullshit has to be put back on the shelf .
Anyway , I 'd really be curious to hear some answers to these questions .
Because if the spending argument is moot , if the bailout argument is moot , if the pork argument is moot , and the tax argument is moot , then what you 're left with is arguing that it 's not waste when we spend billions handing out soccer balls in the Anbar province , but it is waste when we build bridges in Peoria and Tulsa .
The only thing even remotely resembling a logical justification for any of this was the argument , made by several letter - writers , that the fact that the teabaggers are hypocrites does n't necessarily make them wrong about the Obama budget .
If that point is conceded at the top , I think most Americans would be willing to discuss the rest of it , because that 's a discussion worth having .
The problem is that once you admit that you sat on your hands during a period of unprecedented waste for eight years , it makes it very hard to take when you start calling yourselves victims of fascism and tyranny and threatening to secede in year nine , which just happens to be the first year of a new regime you oppose politically .
In other words if you concede the hypocrisy , the hysteria automatically becomes obnoxious and wrong .
So I do n't think the " My hypocrisy is irrelevant " line holds water , not unless you can answer one more question :
4 . Would you be protesting any of this bullshit if this had been George W. Bush 's budget ?

Illingworth 's home was raided after he posted the clip on Liveleak .
He was charged with using the internet to access and publish child - abuse material .
The charge has proven controversial because the baby - reportedly part of a Russian circus family - is shown laughing and smiling at the end of the clip .
Online rights activists and academics say the case has far - reaching implications for individuals sharing content online , as it is now clear they can be held just as liable as traditional publishers .
Online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia ( EFA ) has contacted Illingworth to provide him with help in fighting his case .
EFA vice - chairman Colin Jacobs said the law was a blunt instrument and no blunter than when applied to the internet .
" Any internet user could stumble upon these sorts of ' viral videos ' , which are a far cry from the organised child abusers against whom the laws are targeted , " he said .
" I think that now Australians could justifiably feel very afraid that casual internet use might bring the police to their door . "
Australian laws concerning the publication of such material are far stricter than in many other countries .
Here , news stations have shown only the beginning and end of the clip , while this website has been advised by lawyers not to show any of the clip at all .
In a statement , Queensland Police said the term " child - abuse material " even extended to clips in which a child " appears " to be a victim of cruelty .
The clip , criticised by child - welfare advocates because of how vigorously the man swings the baby , was created without any involvement of Illingworth , who has published hundreds of other clips on the Liveleak site .
Queensland Police from the anti-pedophile squad Task Force Argos raided Illingworth 's home on November 30 .
He was subjected to a thorough forensic examination of his home and office computers and a gruelling interview over several hours , complete with fingerprinting and mug shots .
Asked to respond to claims by Illingworth that he was targeted unnecessarily and unfairly labelled a child abuser , Queensland Police said it was a crime " to participate in the exploitation and abuse of children by seeking to view , possess , make or distribute child - abuse or child exploitation material " .
It provided a definition of " child - abuse material " , which was any material that shows a person under the age of 18 who " is , or appears to be , a victim of torture , cruelty or physical abuse " .
" Task Force Argos are continuing to work with international law enforcement partners to identify the child depicted in the video clip to remove him or her from further harm , " Queensland Police said .
David Vaile , executive director of the University of NSW 's Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre , agreed with Queensland Police but said many people were not aware that they could be held liable for content they republished online .
" If something you upload and republish on the internet is a video of what appears to be abuse of a child , you can't be that surprised when it is caught by laws trying to suppress the publication and distribution of ' child - abuse material ' , " he said .
" Publishing capability has been democratised and decentralised , but so has liability and responsibility . "
Illingworth , whose reputation has been tarnished after the incident was featured in a story in his local Sunshine Coast Daily newspaper , said he was meeting his MP , Peter Slipper , this afternoon in an attempt to pressure police to drop the charges .
Illingworth said it was unfair that he was being labelled a child abuser over a video he did n't make , when the late Steve Irwin was let off for dangling his baby near the open jaws of a crocodile .
Earlier this week , Illingworth said that since being charged he could not eat , sleep or work and was worried his children and people in the local community would think he was a pedophile .
" I 've had to go down to the hospital .
My blood pressure is 160/108 and I 'm on blood pressure pills and valium - all because of this , " he said .
" Do they realise what pain they put someone through ?
I could fall over dead over this .
I can't even get the office work done .
I 'm just a zombie . "

I ’m probably reinventing the wheel here , but I have n’t come across this elsewhere .
I came across an idea whilst working on Traces , unbounded graphs ( I could say infinite , but I am something of a constructionist ) .
An unbounded graph is a graph defined by a function
adjacentNodes :: a -> [ a ]
The function adjacentNodes could for example create every possible legal game move from the current position , run every possible lsystem rule on the string or find all legal one step permutations of Trace ( some of these generate Trees but the method I am applying here is fairly universal ) .
There is also scope for creating strings out of grammars in general .
So lets say you want to find out a property of your graph .
Whether in a Trace a certain substring can occur , for example .
Or whether there is a strategy to guarantee a win in a small game .
To generate every node in the unbounded graph you just generate a list of those nodes and append a list of those nodes with iterate applied recursively .
Warning unbounded lists created !
Also code not thoroughly tested .
> import Data .
List as List > import Data .
Set as Set > import Data .
Monoid > gIterate :: ( a -> [ a ] ) -> a -> [ a ] >
gIterate nextNodes start = nextList ++ ( List.concat $ List.map ( gIterate ( nextNodes ) ) nextList ) > where nextList = nextNodes start
You can get back to iterate simply by doing
take 10 ( mIterate ( \a -> [ a ] ) '!')
iterate is just creating a unbounded graph where there is only one possible adjacent node !
Now iterating through a graph with mulitple options is a bot more interesting then the flat graphs done by iterate .
So you might choose to ignore some edges , for example those you have visited before .
> gIterateNoCycles :: ( Ord a , Eq a ) => ( a -> [ a ] ) ->
Set a -> a -> [ a ] >
gIterateNoCycles nextNodes visited start = nextList ++ ( List.concat $ List.map ( gIterateNoCycles ( nextNodes ) visited ' ) nextList ) > where nextList = List.filter ( \a -> member a visited ) $ nextNodes start > visited ' = Set.insert start visited
Or those that fail some predicate , a heuristic or the end of the game .
> gFilteredIterate :: ( Ord a , Eq a ) => ( a -> [ a ] ) -> ( a -> Bool ) -> a -> [ a ] >
g Filtered Iterate nextNodes filt start = nextList ++ ( List.concat $ List.map ( gFilteredIterate ( nextNodes ) filt ) nextList ) > where nextList = List.filter ( filt ) $ nextNodes start >
However all this ( ++ ) is not always ideal , lets generalise it somewhat .
> gfoldMap :: Monoid b => ( a -> [ a ] ) -> ( a -> b ) -> a -> b
> gfoldMap nextNodes transform start = mconcat ( List.map ( transform ) ( nextList ) ) `mappend` ( mconcat $ List.map ( gfoldMap ( nextNodes ) ( transform ) ) nextList )
> where nextList = nextNodes start
This allows you to use the Any monoid if you just want to find if one of the Nodes satisfies a predicate , or the First monoid to look for one value .
However it does mean that you can no longer specify how far to search with the ( take n ) trick , unless you specify transform to be something that returns a list .
So you would probably want to use one of the variants above , or specify a number to go with it .
Slowing spending on computers saw Intel profits fall by 90 % from $ 2.3 bn to $ 234 m ( £ 159.6 m ) in the last three months of 2008 .
Karen Nye reports from New York .
The Federation of American Scientists ' Secrecy News has obtained a declassified version of an interim report on an inquiry into warrantless NSA surveillance issued this past fall , a teaser for a comprehensive report by the intelligence community 's inspectors general due this summer .
( The declassified version , apparently , is identical to the original submitted two months prior , but for one mysterious sentence . )
While it 's mostly limited to an account of how the agencies are divvying up the reporting task , even that provides a hint of the the departments ' roles in the program itself .
That final report , mandated by Congress as part of last year 's amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , is supposed to provide a detailed account of how the National Security Agency 's program of extrajudicial communications intercepts and data mining — here dubbed simply " the Program " — changed and operated from 2001 , through its exposure in 2005 and eventual subordination to the FISA court .
By this point we have a rough portrait of various components of the program , thanks to whistleblowers like Russ Tice and Thomas Tamm , but on many crucial points observers have had to resort to informed speculation based on what they could cobble together from the dribs and drabs of information that have leaked out .
The interim report , unfortunately , does n't hint at any of those juicy details , but only lays out the division of labor between the agencies .
Most of the heavy lifting appears to be relegated to the Justice Department 's IG , which as of November had apparently already been working on a broad review of the Program for some 18 months — well before Congress handed down its mandate .
This will include an analysis of " any use of Program information in the FISA process " — something reputed to have been a sticking point when the chief judge on the FISA Court , who had been made aware of the Program , began to suspect that the Court was being used to launder illicit intercepts .
The report also suggests that the operational details of the Program — which we now know to have gone by the codename Stellar Wind — changed in response to the shifting legal opinions and presidential authorizations that supported it over the years .
It alludes , for instance , to the role of the National Counterterrorism Center in " drafting and coordinating the threat assessments and legal certifications supporting periodic reauthorization of the Program " and " identifying targets and tasking Program collection . "
The NCTC , it bears noting , did not even exist until 2003 ( when it was originally dubbed the Terrorist Threat Integration Center ) .
The Office of the Secretary of Defense is referenced in connection with the " establishment and implementation of the Program , " suggesting that the early incarnations of Stellar Wind fell under the aegis of then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , with responsibility shifting to the Director of National Intelligence after the office was created in 2005 , and occupied in turn by John Negroponte and former NSA head Michael McConnell .
The final report , due in July , will be compiled from the individual IG reports by the Central Intelligence Agency 's Inspector General .

Last year , in suburban Washington , DC , 19 - year - old Alicia Lannes overdosed on heroin .
The girl was in her bedroom and text messaging her boyfriend and heroin supplier , Skylar Schnippel , when he realized something was wrong .
But when he realized Lannes was in trouble , he did n't call 911 or her parents .
Instead , he called some friends and asked them to check up on her .
At 4:00 am , they peered through her window , saw her unconscious , and called paramedics .
Shortly after 5:00 am , her father , Greg Lannes , was awakened by paramedics pounding on his front door .
" We found my daughter lying next to her bed , " Lannes told the Washington Post .
" She had passed away .
She had gone through a lot in her little life . "
Dr. Reardon and son Danny
Six years earlier , Washington dentist Daniel Reardon went through something similar .
His son , Danny , 19 , a freshman at the University of Maryland , passed out after a night of drinking .
Fraternity members laid him on a sofa , took his pulse , and took turns watching him .
But young Reardon quit breathing at some point during the night , and by the time fraternity members called an ambulance at 3:30 am , Reardon was brain dead .
He died six days later without gaining consciousness .
In both cases , people who might have saved the lives of the victims with fast action hesitated to call for help , largely out of fear of legal repercussions .
Whether it was using heroin or underage consumption of alcohol , friends as well as the victims themselves faced the possibility of prosecution for drinking or drug use .
Yesterday , Daniel Reardon testified before a Maryland General Assembly committee to urge members to pass a bill that might have saved his son's life .
The House Judiciary Committee was holding hearings on HB 1273 , a Good Samaritan overdose bill , which would protect overdose victims and the people seeking help for them from facing criminal prosecution .
Although New Mexico is the only state to have passed such legislation , numerous college and universities have instituted similar policies .
" There are about 90 schools across the country that have these medical emergency amnesties , " said Stacia Cosner , a University of Maryland senior and member of Students for Sensible Drug Policy ( SSDP ) , which has endorsed the Maryland legislation .
" About one third are public ; the rest are private , usually small colleges . "
Unfortunately , the University of Maryland is n't one of them -- yet .
" We have been working on this here for a couple of years , and there has been some progress , but there is nothing formally adopted yet , " said Cosner .
It is working at George Washington University in Washington , said Cosner , citing ongoing research there .
" Since they instituted the program , 911 medical emergency calls have gone way up , " she said .
The movement is spreading beyond the college campus now .
This year , besides Maryland , legislatures in at least seven other states -- Connecticut , Hawaii , Illinois , Nebraska , New York , Rhode Island , and Washington -- are considering Good Samaritan overdose laws .
( The Washington state effort died earlier this month after failing to move out of committee . )
There is good reason for such laws .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , more than 22,000 people died of drug overdoses ( both licit and illicit ) nationwide in 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available , making ODs second only to traffic accidents as a cause of death for young people .
Only about 15 % of fatal overdoses result in immediate death , meaning quick action could save lives .
" It should never be a crime to call 911 " , said Naomi Long , director of the Drug Policy Alliance DC and Maryland Project , which is leading the charge for the bill in Annapolis .
" This bill is about saving lives without compromising public safety .
In these hard economic times , Maryland should focus resources on saving lives not arresting Good Samaritans . "
The Good Samaritan bill " is about giving countless Marylanders a second chance at life , " said Del. Kris Valderrama , the bill 's sponsor .
" We should pass laws that send the message that saving lives is our first priority . "
" We need these laws to protect lives and to help people in confusing situations make the right decision to call for help if necessary , " said Amber Langston , SSDP eastern regional outreach director .
" People may hesitate to call 911 or not call at all out of fear of punishment , and even a few moments of hesitation can cost someone 's life .
If the goals of our drug policies are to save lives , then enacting Good Samaritan laws is good drug policy . "
As a student organization , SSDP is particularly concerned about young people , said Langston .
" This is an issue that particularly affects young people , who are generally less experienced and more fearful of retribution , " she argued .
" We know that people are dying of overdoses , and these are preventable , unnecessary deaths , " said DPA 's Long .
" We need to be creating the kind of situation where people immediately call for help .
The bills in Maryland and elsewhere are an attempt to remove the perceived threat of prosecution from people who want to do the right thing , but are in a difficult situation . "
Whether the Maryland bill passes this year remains to be seen , but the hearings have been an opportunity to open lawmakers ' eyes to the problem , said Long .
" We have been able to educate lawmakers about how the fear of arrest and punishment makes people hesitate to call 911 , we have some really powerful stories , but the bottom line is that the bill still faces an uphill fight , " she said .
" I think it 's great that some state legislatures are trying to catch up with a good harm reduction program , " said Hilary McQuie , western director of the Harm Reduction Coalition .
" People frequently cite the fear of retribution as the main reason they did n't seek help .
If these laws can get passed and accepted so they change people 's behavior around what happens with an overdose situation , this could really make a difference in people 's lives .
It could save their lives . "
But passing a Good Samaritan bill is just the beginning , said McQuie .
" There is a lag between changes in the law and changes in 911 calls , " she said .
" It takes a little time for people to build trust in the system .
You also have to educate police and the people around drug users that the law exists , and there is no funding for that .
These efforts are wonderful , but they need more resources to be effectively implemented . "
They say a picture tells a thousand stories , but can it also tell how smart you are ?
Actually , say UCLA researchers , it can .
In a study published recently in the Journal of Neuroscience , UCLA neurology professor Paul Thompson and colleagues used a new type of brain - imaging scanner to show that intelligence is strongly influenced by the quality of the brain 's axons , or wiring that sends signals throughout the brain .
The faster the signaling , the faster the brain processes information .
And since the integrity of the brain 's wiring is influenced by genes , the genes we inherit play a far greater role in intelligence than was previously thought .
Genes appear to influence intelligence by determining how well nerve axons are encased in myelin — the fatty sheath of " insulation " that coats our axons and allows for fast signaling bursts in our brains .
The thicker the myelin , the faster the nerve impulses .
Thompson and his colleagues scanned the brains of 23 sets of identical twins and 23 sets of fraternal twins .
Since identical twins share the same genes while fraternal twins share about half their genes , the researchers were able to compare each group to show that myelin integrity was determined genetically in many parts of the brain that are key for intelligence .
These include the parietal lobes , which are responsible for spatial reasoning , visual processing and logic , and the corpus callosum , which pulls together information from both sides of the body .
The researchers used a faster version of a type of scanner called a HARDI ( high - angular resolution diffusion imaging ) — think of an MRI machine on steroids — that takes scans of the brain at a much higher resolution than a standard MRI .
While an MRI scan shows the volume of different tissues in the brain by measuring the amount of water present , HARDI tracks how water diffuses through the brain 's white matter — a way to measure the quality of its myelin .
" HARDI measures water diffusion , " said Thompson , who is also a member of the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro - Imaging .
" If the water diffuses rapidly in a specific direction , it tells us that the brain has very fast connections .
If it diffuses more broadly , that 's an indication of slower signaling , and lower intelligence . "
" So it gives us a picture of one 's mental speed , " he said .
Because the myelination of brain circuits follows an inverted U - shaped trajectory , peaking in middle age and then slowly beginning to decline , Thompson believes identifying the genes that promote high - integrity myelin is critical to forestalling brain diseases like multiple sclerosis and autism , which have been linked to the breakdown of myelin .
" The whole point of this research , " Thompson said , " is to give us insight into brain diseases . "
He said his team has already narrowed down the number of gene candidates that may influence myelin growth .
And could this someday lead to a therapy that could make us smarter , enhancing our intelligence ?
" It 's a long way off but within the realm of the possible , " Thompson said .
I admit it ; I was blown away by Battlestar Galactica 's almost - perfect series finale .
But that does n't mean that there are n't some things that I wo n't miss about the show .

Popularizing The Word " Frak "
Yes , yes .
It 's like " fuck " but in space .
We get it already .
" Frak " has become nerd cliche by this point , overused to the point of becoming annoying , especially on non-nerdy TV shows when they want to drop a little geekage for one of their characters .
Like all good TV show catchphrases - and that 's really what this one was - it's had it 's day , and it 's time to slowly let it slink into the shadows at least until Caprica .
Being Treated As Art With The Self - Conscious Capital A
The one sour note in the finale ?
That would 've been the epilogue , where AngelSix and AngelBaltar practically looked into the camera and said " It 's not just science fiction , do you see ?
It 's actually about the real world ! " before we get Jimi and the robot clip show .
Galactica has always had a tendency to get its pretension on , and that 's one of the things that made it so wonderfully ambitious ... but along the way , everyone else started getting very indulgent of that pretension .
Yes , it transcended its SF roots to become a human drama that anyone could enjoy , but the self - congratulatory SciFi Channel specials ?
A little bit too much , even for self - promotion .
And do n't get me started on the UN thing .

That Music
Yes , people may have had a problem with the use of " All Along The Watchtower , " but that 's not the music I 'm talking about here .
Bear McCreary is a fine composer whose work on the first couple of seasons of the show ( and , for that matter , on Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Eureka ) was amazing .
But as his work got more ambitious on BSG , it also started to overpower some of the scenes , or just take the viewer out of them altogether with unexpected touches ( All I 'm saying is this : Bagpipes are never a good idea .
Especially digital bagpipes ) .
Although he managed to keep things under control in the finale , I dread to think where he would 've gone if the show had continued for a fifth or sixth season .
Lee Adama In General
Where to start ?
With the way that his character never really gelled in any particular direction ( even when that direction was " directionless " ) ?
Or how about the weird lack of purpose that he served in the show all along ( Was there ever really an Apollo - centric story arc that did n't feel tacked on to some other plot ? ) , or Jamie Bamber 's performance that regularly mistook frowning for emotion ?
But , no ; I 'd rather talk about the lasting impression that I 'll have of Lee Adama from the finale :
His giant , giant hair .
You can tell the true impact of a character when the thing that he 'll really be remembered for is that he was fat for a bit during the show 's third season , and it was this spirit of style - over - substance that must have led Bamber and the show 's creators to send Apollo off with a hairstyle that can only have been a tribute to the late ' 70s era that spawned the original show in the first place .
Not for nothing was he one of the few characters who did n't really have any kind of dramatic moment in the series finale ; anything else might have made you suspect that he was there for some reason other than to look good .
Dualla could 've done so much better .
Battlestar Galactica
Okay , this is slightly unfair ; I thought BSG was a wonderful show , despite all of the above , one that engaged my heart and my mind and poked and prodded in all the right ways , questioning and exciting and entertaining ( if you can use that word for such a constantly depressing , pessimistic show ) at all times .
But if there 's one thing that the finale accomplished , it was finishing the story .
By the time it was done , I felt as if everything that needed to be said had been said , and said beautifully ... and then there was the trailer for Battlestar Galactica : The Plan ( and , for that matter , the trailer for Caprica ) .
Maybe it 's just me , but I do n't think that the show needs an epilogue or a prequel spin-off , and the fact that it 's getting both just feels more than a little like SciFi can't say goodbye to such a successful show , and have no problem with a little bit of graverobbing to try and keep the good thing going a little longer than it should .
I 'd love to miss Battlestar Galactica ; I just do n't feel as if I 'm going to get the chance , sadly .

THE very word “ perfume ” has feminine overtones to many male ears .
Men can be sold “ deodorant ” and possibly “ aftershave ” , but the idea of all those dinky little bottles with their fussy paraphernalia is too much for the sensitive male ego .
Yet no industry can afford to neglect half its potential market , and perfume - makers are ever keen to crack the shell of male reticence .
Now they may know how to do so .
Craig Roberts of the University of Liverpool and his colleagues — working with a team from Unilever 's research laboratory at nearby Port Sunlight — have been investigating the problem .
They already knew that appropriate scents can improve the mood of those who wear them .
What they discovered , though , as they will describe in a forthcoming edition of the International Journal of Cosmetic Science , is that when a man changes his natural body odour it can alter his self - confidence to such an extent that it also changes how attractive women find him .
Half of Dr Roberts 's volunteers were given an aerosol spray containing a commercial formulation of fragrance and antimicrobial agents .
The other half were given a spray identical in appearance but lacking active ingredients .
The study was arranged so that the researchers did not know who had received the scent and who the dummy .
Each participant obviously knew what he was spraying on himself , since he could smell it .
But since no one was told the true purpose of the experiment , those who got the dummy did not realise they were being matched against people with a properly smelly aerosol .
Over the course of several days , Dr Roberts 's team conducted a battery of psychological tests on both groups of volunteers .
They found that those who had been given the commercial fragrance showed an increase in self - confidence .
Not that surprising , perhaps .
What was surprising was that their self - confidence improved to such an extent that women who could watch them but not smell them noticed .
The women in question were shown short , silent videos of the volunteers .
They deemed the men wearing the deodorant more attractive .
They were , however , unable to distinguish between the groups when shown only still photographs of the men , suggesting it was the men's movement and bearing , rather than their physical appearance , that was making the difference .
For Unilever and other manufacturers of men's scent , this is an important discovery .
The firm 's marketing of its main product in this area , a deodorant called Lynx , plays up the so - called “ Lynx Effect ” — which is supposed to make men irresistibly attractive to women .
Dr Roberts 's experiment , however , suggests that the advertised “ Born chicka wah wah ” of the product may have nothing to do with a woman 's appreciation of the smell , and everything to do with its psychological effect on the man wearing it .
Nor is this the only example of science illuminating the true role of perfumes .
How they work to make people attractive is , as this example shows , not as obvious as it might seem .
Born chicka wah , ker - ching chicka ching
There are three broad theories of perfume use .
One is that people employ it to mask body odours that they perceive as bad .
The second is that some perfumes contain chemicals that mimic human pheromones — elusive , mysterious ( and possibly mythical ) substances believed by some to play a role in mating .
The third is that people use it to heighten or fortify natural scent , and thus advertise sexual attractiveness or availability .
All three theories could be true .
In particular , the role of perfume as an olfactory disguise is obvious .
Even here , however , there are some subtle twists .
Bad smells are not just a matter of poor hygiene .
Illness and old age both bring characteristic odours of their own , and neither state makes people more attractive .
Perfumes may spoof these messages .
Hence the marketing of a new scent called Ageless Fantasy , by Harvey Prince , which claims its product disguises the “ odour of ageing ” , suggested to be caused by the breakdown of a particular fatty acid in the skin .
As to pheromones , whether humans have these is questionable .
A pheromone is a chemical that elicits a specific behavioural response at a distance .
Some insects , for example , can release sex pheromones that will attract a mate from many kilometres away .
The most likely human candidate is a substance called androstadienone .
This is a derivative of testosterone that is found in men's sweat and is known , from brain - scanning studies , to promote activity in parts of women 's brains .
That this results in changes in behaviour has not , however , been clearly demonstrated .
Terri Molnar , a spokeswoman for the Sense of Smell Institute , a research organisation in New York tied to the fragrance industry , says of human pheromones , “ I think we believe they exist but they do not function as an attractant .
They will elevate one 's mood but not attract a mate . ”
The fallen sons of Eve ?
The most interesting area , though , is the interaction between perfumes and natural scents that carry messages but do not have the specific properties of pheromones .
Odours co-ordinate a wide range of human behaviour .
Mothers can recognise their children by smell .
Children can recognise each other .
Relatives can be distinguished from non-relatives , even to the extent of understanding who is genetically different enough from the smeller to be a good choice of mate .
The sexes themselves smell different , too , and women can glean information about a man 's social status from his smell alone .
As long ago as the 1950s , a perfumer called Paul Jellinek noted that several ingredients of incense resembled scents of the human body .
It was not until 2001 , however , that Manfred Milinski and Claus Wedekind of the University of Bern wondered whether there was a correlation between the perfume a woman preferred and her own natural scent .
They found that there is .
The correlation is with the genes of what is known as the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) .
This region of the genome encodes part of the immune system .
It turns out that one of the most important aspects of mate choice in mammals , humans included , is to make sure that your mate 's MHC is different from your own .
Mixing up MHCs makes the immune system more effective .
The MHC is also thought to act as a proxy for general outbreeding , with all the hybrid vigour that can bring .
Fortunately , then , evolution has equipped mammals with the ability to detect by smell chemicals whose concentrations vary with differences in the MHC of the producer .
That means people are able to sniff out suitable MHC genomes in prospective partners .
A woman , for instance , will prefer the smell of T - shirts that have been worn by men whose MHC genes are appropriately different from her own .
Dr Milinski and Dr Wedekind also found an association between a woman 's MHC genes and some of her preferences for perfume .
Perception of musk , rose and cardamom is correlated with the MHC .
Perception of castoreum and cedar is not .
Women , it seems , choose not the kind of smell they would like on a partner , or even one that might mask a nasty odour of their own , but rather something that matches their MHC .
In other words , they are advertising their own scent .
There are many useful inferences that might be drawn from this research .
One would be that a woman 's choice of perfume will resist the vagaries of fashion .
This may explain why most innovation in the industry involves changes in packaging and marketing , producing all that fussy paraphernalia , rather than changing what is in the bottle .
Another implication , says Dr Roberts , is that it is probably best that people choose perfumes for themselves rather than for someone else — unless they happen to know what the recipient likes .
If you have made a good genetic choice of partner ( ie , someone with a significantly different MHC ) , then the theory suggests that you should not be able to choose something that smells nice to them based on your own preferences .
You might , though , have better luck choosing for a close relation , because she would probably have an MHC similar to your own .
The research also raises the question of what so - called unisex perfumes are for .
In any genetically successful love match , one of the partners ought to hate a unisex perfume .
Perhaps , in a world of olfactory fakery , this is one tip for the wise .
If your partner has a strange knack of being able to pick out all the right perfumes , this may not be a good sign at all .
And that , of course , means that the best you can hope for this Christmas is that he has bought you a perfume that you absolutely hate .

If it were any other person originating this post it probably would n't have mattered but in your case this is whole new low for you .
It 's bad enough you are a well documented Telco shill ( and the mere mention of Verizon just turns you on does n't it Karl ) but now you have to inject your political viewpoint into what used to be a really great website .
You know d^mned well that Fox like most websites use banner feeds from other companies and at any time these feeds can be temporarily contaminated by a bad banner script .
It 's happened to EVERY website that uses ads that you can be sure of .
Every webmaster including the operators of the Fox site work very hard to mitigate things like this but they still do happen .
It 's not Fox 's fault and I 'm sure they are doing everything they can working with the vendor to resolve the issue .
Anyone who has google or adbright or clicksor ads has experienced the same thing including this website Karl .
Do us all a favor Karl .

John Dean : Bush almost became an ' unconstitutional dictator ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday March 3 , 2009
Print This Email This
It was during the Civil War that President Abraham Lincoln became known as a " constitutional dictator , " said former Nixon White House counsel John Dean during a Monday broadcast of MSNBC 's Countdown with Keith Olbermann .
Responding to the recent release of several legal justifications for President Bush 's most criticized policies , Dean summarized , " Reading these memos , you 've gotta almost conclude we had an unconstitutional dictator .
It 's pretty deadly and pretty serious , what 's in these materials . "
The memos , released by Obama 's Justice Department on Monday , outline possible methods for the president to ignore treaties and International laws , kidnap and torture American citizens and overrule the First Amendment to the Constitution which ensures freedom of speech and of the press .
All of these things and more could be done exclusively by the president in the name of fighting terrorism .
" Who in this formula was supposed to decide that these were terrorists ? " asked Olbermann .
" Well , according to these memos , that was rather limited to the President of the United States and there are no guidelines as to how he might describe who was or was not a terrorist , " said Dean .
Dean also said that the repeal of several of these memos just days before the Bush administration left power , was " definitely a bit of C - Y - A , " though he did not ascribe " evil intent " to anyone .
" What does this say about what we need to do now in terms of investigating this , John ? " asked Olbermann .
" Is this the scale - tipper for everybody ? "
" It could be , " said Dean , " because the public is going to be aware of a lot more than they were .
There is an investigation that is ongoing that started late in the Bush administration by the Office of Professional Responsibility .
" I think that investigation , which we 've heard very little about , is going to be very hard to suppress now .
... I think the Office of Professional Responsibility may make some very strong recommendations that could include prosecution . "
Dean has previously warned of " serious consequences " around the world if the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress are not willing to " point fingers " at Bush administration members who may be guilty of war crimes .

One in four of the major government databases is almost certainly illegal and should be scrapped , a report says .
The national DNA database , the proposed national identity database and the ContactPoint system , which will hold records of all children in England , are among the systems singled out for fundamental reform or abolition .
Researchers called for 11 systems assessed as " almost certainly illegal " under human rights or data protection law to be scrapped or substantially redesigned .
The study , by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust , also pointed to significant legal and practical problems with a further 29 databases , including the national childhood obesity one and the planned NHS summary care record system , and said they should be reviewed independently .
Privacy experts were asked to compile the report after two discs listing the entire child benefit database went missing in 2007 .
Researchers said data - sharing should be authorised only for strictly defined purposes , and said sensitive personal information should be collected and shared only with the individual 's consent .

The report 's co-author , Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University , said : " Britain 's database state has become a financial , ethical and administrative disaster which is penalising some of the most vulnerable members of our society .
Often , computerisation has been used as a substitute for public service reform rather than a means of enabling reform .
Little thought is given to safety , privacy and value for money . "
Researchers highlighted legal problems with systems that held sensitive data where there was " no effective opt - out " such as ContactPoint , the index planned to record English children 's relationship with public services .
The report said : " Many question the consequences of giving increasing numbers of civil servants daily access to our personal information .
Objections range from cost through efficiency to privacy .
The emphasis on data capture , form - filling , mechanical assessment and profiling damages professional responsibility and alienates the citizen from the state . "
A Home Office spokeswoman said : " We recognise the absolute necessity of striking the balance between the rights and privacy of the individual and the ability to disrupt , prevent and investigate crime effectively .
That is why the Home Secretary [ Jacqui Smith ] has made it clear that a ' common sense ' test must be applied to every action in this area to make sure it is proportionate , transparent and robust safeguards are in place .
" For example , the National Identity Scheme and ID cards will have independent oversight built in from the start , with every citizen given the right to see their data and who has accessed it .
Technology such as DNA and CCTV is providing clear benefits in deterring and detecting crime , securing convictions and reducing fear of crime . "

Weltwirtschaftskrise : Der überforderte Kapitalismus
Die USA stemmt sich mit einem 2 Billionen - Programm gegen die Abwärtsspirale .
Jetzt zeigt sich : Der Neoliberalismus hat die Welt ins größte Desaster seit Hitler und Stalin geritten .
1.000.000.000.000 , eine Billion Dollar , so viel will die Obama - Regierung in die Finanzwirtschaft pumpen .
Wohlgemerkt : nur ins Bankensystem .
Rund 800 Milliarden zur Stimulierung der einbrechenden Konjunktur kommen noch dazu .
Eine irre Zahl , mit viel Symbolwert .
Das ist nicht nur ein " Hilfsprogramm " , das den privaten Investoren die Verluste abnimmt , nachdem sie jahrelang die Gewinne eingesackt haben .
Wie immer der Plan von US - Finanzminister Timothy Geithner im Detail aussehen wird , der Staat wird die Bedingungen diktieren .
Im Extremfall werden Banken , die praktisch insolvent sind , verstaatlicht werden .
Die Idee dabei : Wenn die Finanzhäuser mal wieder saniert sind , werden nicht die heutigen Investoren verdienen , sondern das Gemeinwesen wird hoffentlich etwas zurückerhalten .
Das ist ein Gebot der Gerechtigkeit .
Noch gibt es ein paar Unentwegte , die uns immer noch sagen :
Das mag gerecht erscheinen , jedoch sei dieser
Weg ökonomisch ganz falsch .
Schließlich sei der Staat doch ein schlechter Unternehmer .
Nun , das mag sein .
Aber ein schlechterer Unternehmer als die , die gegenwärtig das Sagen haben , kann er gar nicht sein .
Der Staat ist zurück .
Für einen Augenblick wollen wir festhalten , wie paradox das ist .
Die " Mehr privat , weniger Staat " - Ideologie schwappte aus den USA über die westliche Welt .
Wobei der Begriff " Ideologie " nur ein Hilfsausdruck ist .
Denn es war nicht eine Idee schwindliger Ideologen , sondern Regierungspraxis .
Mit Ronald Reagan war ein Präsident ins Weiße Haus eingezogen , der von der Spitze der Regierung aus stets bekundete , dass der Staat letztendlich etwas Schlechtes ist .
Ein Regent , der gegen das Regieren regierte .
Unter George W. Bush setzte sich diese Tragödie als Farce fort .
Eines der Kuriosa dieses Sachverhalts ist , dass deshalb diese Ideologie auch nicht Schaden nahm , wenn ihre Verfechter grottenschlecht regierten .
Schließlich konnten sie einwenden : " Ja , Regierungen sind eben etwas Schlechtes , haben wir ja immer schon gesagt . "
Gut sind die Märkte , die Privatinitiative , die unsichtbare Hand .
Schlecht sind die Institutionen , die Regeln , die Ämter , die Bürokraten - bis zum vergangenen Herbst .
Damals , nach dem Infarkt der Finanzmärkte infolge der Lehman - Pleite , kollabierte der Kapitalismus nur deshalb nicht , weil der Staat ihn gerettet hat .
Es war die größte Staatsinterventionswelle seit Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin .
Mittlerweile zeigt sich , dass die Hunderte von Milliarden , die in den Finanzsektor gepumpt wurden , nicht ausgereicht haben - auch nicht die konzertierten Aktionen der wichtigsten Notenbanken .
Das globale Finanzsystem ist zu sehr beschädigt .
In den Bilanzen der Banken schlummern faule Kredite und unberichtigte " Werte " , also krass überbewertete Wertlosigkeiten , in exorbitanter Höhe .
Deswegen hat sich erst in den vergangenen Wochen wirkliche Katastrophenstimmung breitgemacht .
Bislang hat man sich , bei all dem Desaster , noch in Sicherheit gewogen , die rund siebzig global " systemrelevanten " Banken und Investmenthäuser seien " too big to fail " .
Das Vertrauen werde schon zurückkommen und auch die Kreditmärkte würden wieder in Schwung geraten .
Aber was passiert , wenn der Schuldenberg so hoch ist , dass nichts mehr geht ?
Genaue Daten kennt niemand , stattdessen raunt man sich Horrorzahlen zu : 2.000 Milliarden Euro an faulen Krediten in den Bilanzen deutscher Banken , 270 Milliarden an ausstehenden Darlehen in den Bilanzen österreichischer Banken , zum Großteil Kredite in Osteuropa .
Noch sind es " nur " die Schrottpapiere wie jene " Asset Backed Securities " , die berühmten Bündel amerikanischer Immobilienkredite , die große Löcher reißen .
Aber diese Vermögensverluste setzten eine Kettenreaktion in Gang mit fatalen Rückkopplungseffekten .
Investoren , die viel verloren haben , ziehen ihre Investitionen anderswo ab , um liquide zu bleiben .
Weil alle gleichzeitig verkaufen , verfallen die Preise .
Die Konjunktur schmiert ab .
Auch " normale " Kreditnehmer , Unternehmer in der " Realwirtschaft " gehen pleite oder können zumindest ihre Verbindlichkeiten nicht mehr bedienen .
Wenn ein Risiko schlagend wird , werden gleich viele Risiken schlagend , weil einer , der fällt , mehrere mit ins Loch reißt .
Ganze Staaten könnten pleitegehen - nicht nur weit hinten in Asien oder nahe dem Polarkreis .
Ungarn , die Ukraine und Griechenland sind Kandidaten .
Selbst wohlhabende Länder könnten dann ihre Banken womöglich nicht mehr retten .
Verluste von zwei Dritteln des Bruttoinlandsprodukts würden sogar Deutschland überfordern .
Langsam wird klar , wie groß das Ausmaß der potenziellen Katastrophe ist .
Der Neoliberalismus hat der
Welt das größte globale Desaster seit Hitler und Stalin beschert .
Tolle Bilanz .

The FBI labels the environmental and animal rights movements the number one domestic terrorism threat .
Those activists have never flown planes into buildings , taken hostages or sent anthrax through the mail .
So how did they make it to the top of the government ’s list ?
Here are 10 ways you can be labeled an eco-terrorist :
10 . ) Sabotage corporate property .
Underground groups like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front have released animals from fur farms , vandalized SUV’s and , at the most extreme , set fire to empty buildings .
Those crimes have only harmed property , not people , but the government has pushed for terrorism enhancement penalties in those cases .
It may come as a surprise that sabotage is the bottom of this list , but these cases are actually only a very small focus of the bigger Green Scare .
9. ) Fall in love with an FBI agent .
That ’s what happened to Eric McDavid .
He did n’t harm anyone or break anything , but he was convicted of conspiring to sabotage federal facilities in the name of defending the environment and sentenced to 20 years in prison .
The entire case against him hinged on the work of Anna , an FBI operative who provided the group with bomb - making recipes ; financed their transportation , food and housing ; strung along McDavid , who had the hopes of a romantic relationship ; and poked and prodded the group into action .
8. ) Attend vegan potlucks .
While Al - Qaeda continues to release video communiques threatening Americans , the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces are using anti-terrorism resources to attempt to infiltrate vegan potlucks .
7. ) Protect your privacy .
The FBI and local law enforcement have been exposed for spying on activists around the country , including peace activists in Maryland and the HoneyBaked Hams protesters in Georgia .
Understandably , many activists do n’t want their faces in FBI files , so they often wear bandanas at protests .
And guess what ?
The government says THAT is terrorism .
Joint Terrorism Task Forces have arrested an animal rights activist in Virginia for wearing a mask , and four California activists are facing terrorism charges for the same .
6. ) Beat the good ol ’ boys at their own game .
A Utah lawmaker is promising to introduce new eco-terrorism legislation .
His target ?
Not the Earth Liberation Front , Animal Liberation Front , or some shadowy underground group .
Hes openly , proudly targeting mainstream environmentalists .
Specifically , he has his sights on Tim DeChristopher , the University of Utah student who disrupted an oil and gas auction by bidding on parcels of land .
The state lawmaker says DeChristopher ’s auction bids are no different than burning down a mans cattle operation eco-terrorism .
DeChristopher took millions of dollars away from us , and hes laughing at us .
Its not right .
Its not fair .
5. ) Stop the symbolism .
With the RNC coming to town , local organizers in the Twin Cities set up a community infrastructure including housing , transportation , child care and protest logistics .
They worked with a wide range of mainstream , lawful organizations .
They were very public , vocal and outspoken from the beginning about their intentions :
We do n’t just want a photo opportunity or a symbolic civil disobedience , were going to disrupt business as usual .
The government ’s response ?
Eight organizers were arrested before the protests began for conspiring to riot in the furtherance of terrorism .
4. ) Be vocal and unapologetic .
The government has n’t made headway on the vast majority of crimes by groups like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front .
So they ’re targeting above - ground activists who vocally , unsympathetically support the underground .
In the SHAC 7 case , animal rights activists were convicted of animal enterprise terrorism for running a website that posted news of both legal and illegal actions against a notorious laboratory , and vocally supporting all of it .
The government also uses grand juries like the recent one in Utah to harass and intimidate activists , and force them to testify about their political beliefs and political associations .
3. ) Go after their money .
I ’m not just talking about the kind of property destruction mentioned in # 10 .
Sweeping new legislation called the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act wraps up a wide range activity as terrorism , including causing a loss of profits to an animal enterprise .
Causing a loss of profits is not terrorism : it is effective activism .
2. ) Get to their root of the problem .
The government is n’t going to label people as terrorists for recycling or volunteering at an animal shelter .
That ’s not because those things are n’t important , its because they are n’t radical in the true sense of the term : they do n’t get to the root of the problem .
When activists go deeper — when they move beyond questioning the types of light bulbs we use to questioning the entire , unsustainable economic system — that ’s when they truly become terrorists .
1. ) Be effective .
More than anything else , this is the sure - fire way to be labeled a terrorist .
For instance , shortly after the historic victory of Proposition 2 in California , a corporate front group bought a full - page ad in the New York Times labeling the Humane Society of the United States as terrorists .
Whether its activists burning SUV’s or passing landmark legislation , the common thread between every activist being labeled a terrorist is that they are successful .
In this War on Terrorism , the number one domestic terrorism threat includes any environmental activist who is passionate , uncompromising and , above all else , effective .

Does Gordon Brown ever ask himself : " Was it worth it ? "
As he surveys the wreckage of his reputation both for economic competence and political integrity , does he ever think : was it for this that I planned and plotted , ever since I was a student ?
Was it to taste this bitter diet of public hatred and abuse that I forced Blair – the imposter !
– from the seat of power ?
It would seem very unlikely .
Gordon Brown , in common with most men of power is , I imagine , not given to lengthy bouts of introspection or self - analysis .
Apart from anything else , it would be too painful .
Moreover , unpopular rulers , even in democracies , rarely appreciate the true level of the public 's contempt for them ; partly because their pride will not allow for it , and partly because they are generally surrounded by the sycophancy which attends power in any organisation .
Yes , Prime Minister .
So I imagine it must have come as a shock to Gordon Brown a few days ago , when a packed Anfield Football Stadium merely had to hear the Culture Secretary Andy Burnham utter the words : " Today I represent the Prime Minister ... " before erupting into prolonged boos and jeers .
Perhaps it was only the solemnity of the occasion – the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster – which prevented the crowd from chanting , " You 're going down , you 're going down ! " ; for it does seem certain that New Labour will be relegated from the Political Premier League , and that the Blues , captained by David Cameron , will be promoted .

One should not read too much into a single batch of weekend opinion polls , but last Sunday 's were as dreadful for New Labour as anyone can recall .
It was n't so much that the Conservatives had a lead of very nearly 20 points – although that was bad enough – but that support for the governing party was at a mere 26 per cent .
When you add to that the peculiar fact that our national opinion polls have consistently tended to understate the true level of Tory support – New Labour , while winning a series of general elections , on no occasion achieved the margin of victory that the polls had forecast – then you can see why most Labour MPs believe that their party is going to be annihalted at the ballot box , with a number of cabinet ministers losing their seats .
That would not be unprecedented ; but what is truly unusual is that this will not have been accompanied by a great policy split in the ruling party .
There is , it is true , a toxic level of feuding within New Labour – but it is not about any issue the public can understand .
Before the wipe - out of the Conservative Party in the general election of 1997 , the Tories had demonstrated that they were completely unable to reconcile their internal division over the issue of the nation 's proper relationship with the European Union .
A similar split on this same question had bedevilled Harold Wilson 's leadership of the Labour Party a generation earlier , but the foxy Wilson had been rather more skilful than John Major in managing it , by allowing a referendum on that great debate .
In the end , however , that issue did finally lead to a split in the Labour Party ; when the anti-EU Bennites appeared to be gaining control , Roy Jenkins , Shirley Williams , David Owen and Bill Rodgers walked out to form the Social Democratic Party .
That was traumatic for Labour : doubtless it was with such events in mind that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown managed to continue the internal European debate in private : Blair wanted Britain to join the euro , Brown did not .
After a debate conducted entirely in camera , Brown prevailed .
Yet that appears to have been the only significant point of strategic disagreement between two men whose supporters , nevertheless , seem to have been at war now for 15 years .
True , there were some topics on which Brown appeared to challenge Blair , giving temporary tacit support to rebels on the thorny issue of foundation hospitals : but when Brown took over as Prime Minister it soon dawned on Labour MPs too stupid or too naïve to have spotted it earlier , that the former Chancellor had only pretended to be in sympathy with the " Old " Labour critics of Tony Blair .
If anything , it was Brown , not Blair , who invented – or rather , borrowed from Bill Clinton 's " New " Democrats – the cynical " triangulation " approach which underpinned everything that New Labour did .
( Nothing more clearly demonstrated this than Brown 's hasty decision to remove the 10 p tax band for the lowest earners , in order to reduce the standard rate of income tax : this was done cynically to take ground from the Conservatives , with little thought for his own party 's core vote ) .
I recall talking to one minister who had been extremely close to Mr Blair personally and politically , and who as a result had been completely ignored by Brown – sent to Coventry , in fact – throughout the decade of Brown 's Chancellorship .
Yet the moment Brown took over No 10 Downing Street , this minister told me , he was astounded to be told by the new PM how valuable his work had been , and that he should carry on just as before .
In other words , Brown had only pretended to be opposed to the minister 's policy on ideological grounds – in fact his objection had been that it was connected and associated with Tony Blair .
With Blair out of the way , it suddenly ceased to be objectionable .
Brown recently told the Spectator editor Matthew d'Ancona , with whom he has collaborated on a book about " Britishness " , that he despised and rejected the " Namierite " approach to politics .
The 18th - century political historian Lewis Namier , you might recall , had argued that political actions can not be sensibly attributed to the battle of great ideas , but merely to the interplay between men of ambition and their camp followers , as they seek best to realise their private pursuit of power and influence .
It 's almost comical that Brown should have volunteered this recondite point : for the feud between the Brownites and the Blarites was – is – a veritable exhumation of the 18th - century style of politics , so deftly anatomised by Namier .
That great historian would absolutely have understood how a man like Damian McBride fitted in to the political scheme of things in the 10 Downing Street of 2009 : under the deceptively grand title of " director of strategy " , McBride was actually involved in – how shall we describe it ?
– a much more personal style of political debate .
It 's harder to know what Namier would have made of Brown 's weirdly self - contradictory " apology " for what went on : " I take full responsibility for what happens , and that 's why the person who was responsible went immediately " .
Perhaps it 's the sign that the great clan chieftain 's reign is coming to an end , when he must so brusquely disown his most loyal and ferocious follower – " the person " , indeed !
Still , you do n't need to know about 18th - century parliamentary politics to understand the forces at work here .
Everyone who has studied Shakespeare knows exactly how this plays out , with Gordon Brown well cast as the tragic , flawed figure at the heart of " The Scottish Play " , whose removal of the previous king has brought not triumph but retribution .
Indeed , if Gordon Brown is now coming to terms with his political end , perhaps he too will observe that this has been " a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing " .

Parameterized Notions of Computation , Robert Atkey , JFP 2008 .
Moggi's Computational Monads and Power et al 's equivalent notion of Freyd category have captured a large range of computational effects present in programming languages .
Examples include non-termination , non-determinism , exceptions , continuations , side - effects and input / output .
We present generalisations of both computational monads and Freyd categories , which we call parameterised monads and parameterised Freyd categories , that also capture computational effects with parameters .
Examples of such are composable continuations , side - effects where the type of the state varies and input / output where the range of inputs and outputs varies .
By also considering structured parameterisation , we extend the range of effects to cover separated side - effects and multiple independent streams of I/O .
We also present two typed Î » - calculi that soundly and completely model our categorical definitions â€ ” with and without symmetric monoidal parameterisation â€ ” and act as prototypical languages with parameterised effects .
Once you 've programmed with monads for a while , it 's pretty common to start defining parameterized families of monads -- e.g. , we might define a family of type constructors for IO , in which the program type additionally tracks which files the computation reads and writes from .
This is a very convenient programming pattern , but the theory of it is honestly a little sketchy : on what basis do we conclude that the indices we define actually track what we intend them to ?
And furthermore , why can we believe that ( say ) the monadic equational laws still apply ?
That 's the question Atkey lays out a nice solution to .
He gives a nice categorical semantics for indexed , effectful computations , and then cooks up lambda calculi whose equational theory corresponds to the equations his semantics justifies .
The application to delimited continuations is quite nice , and the type theories can also give a little insight into the basics of how stuff like Hoare Type Theory works ( which uses parameterized monads , with a very sophisticated language of parameters ) .
On a slightly tangential note , this also raises in my mind a methodological point .
Over the last n years , we 've seen many people identify certain type constructors , whose usage is pervasive , and greatly simplified with some syntactic extensions -- monads , comonads , applicative functors , arrows , and so on .
It 's incredible to suggest that we have exhausted the list of interesting types , and so together they constitute a good argument for some kind of language extension mechanism , such as macros .
However , all these examples also raise the bar for when a macro is a good idea , because what makes them compelling is precisely that the right syntax yields an interesting and pretty equational theory in the extended language .
LAREDO , Texas ( CNN ) -- Rosalio Reta sits at a table inside a Laredo Police Department interrogation room .
A detective , sitting across the table , asks him how it all started .
Gabriel Cardona , who shows his tattooed eyelids , worked as a hit man for a Mexican cartel .
Reta , in Spanish street slang , describes his initiation as an assassin , at the age of 13 , for the Mexican Gulf Cartel , one of the country 's two major drug gangs .
" I thought I was Superman .
I loved doing it , killing that first person , " Reta says on the videotape obtained by CNN .
" They tried to take the gun away , but it was like taking candy from kid . "
Rosalio Reta and his friend , Gabriel Cardona , were members of a three - person cell of American teenagers working as cartel hit men in the United States , according to prosecutors .
The third was arrested by Mexican authorities and stabbed to death in prison there three days later .
In interviews with CNN , Laredo police detectives and prosecutors told how Cardona and Reta were recruited by the cartel to be assassins after they began hitting the cantinas and clubs just across the border .
Watch how the teens turned into drug cartel hitmen »
CNN has also obtained detailed court records as well as several hours of police interrogation videos .
The detective sitting across the table from Reta and Cardona in those sessions is Robert Garcia .
He 's a veteran of the Laredo Police Department and one of the few officers who has questioned the young men .
" One thing you wonder all the time : What made them this way ? "
Garcia told CNN .
" They were just kids themselves , waiting around playing PlayStation or Xbox , waiting around for the order to be given . "
Over a nearly one - year period starting in June 2005 , the border town of Laredo , Texas , saw a string of seven murders .
At first glance , the violence looked like isolated , gangland - style killings .
But investigators started suspecting something more sinister .
Then Noe Flores was gunned down in a clear case of mistaken identity .
Investigators found a fingerprint on a cigarette box inside the suspected shooter 's get - away car .
That clue unraveled the chilling reality and led police to arrest Gabriel Cardona and Rosalio Reta .
Prosecutors say they quickly discovered these two teenagers were homegrown assassins , hired to carry out the dirty work of the notorious Gulf Cartel .
" There are sleeper cells in the U.S. , " said Detective Garcia .
" They 're here , they 're here in the United States . "
The cases against Cardona and Reta -- both are in prison serving long prison sentences for murder -- shed new light into the workings of the drug cartels .
Prosecutor and investigators say Reta and Cardona were recruited into a group called " Los Zetas , " a group made up of former members of the Mexican special military forces .
They 're considered ruthless in how they carry out attacks .
" Los Zetas " liked what they saw in Cardona and Reta .
Both teenagers received six - month military - style training on a Mexican ranch .
Investigators say Cardona and Reta were paid $ 500 a week each as a retainer , to sit and wait for the call to kill .
Then they were paid up to $ 50,000 and 2 kilos of cocaine for carrying out a hit .
The teenagers lived in several safe houses around Laredo and drove around town in a $ 70,000 Mercedes - Benz .
As the teens became more immersed in the cartel lifestyle , their appearance changed .
Cardona had eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids .
Reta 's face became covered in tattoo markings .
( Prosecutors say during his trial Reta used make - up to cover the facial markings . )
And both sported tattoos of " Santa Muerte , " the Grim Reaper - like pseudo - saint worshipped by drug traffickers .
" These organizations , these cartels , they function like a Fortune 500 company , " Webb County , Texas , prosecutor Uriel Druker said .
" We have to remember that the United States is the market they are trying to get to . "
In Cardona 's interrogation tape , there are clues that " Los Zetas " are reaching deeper and deeper into the United States .
Cardona is asked , " Where else are the Zetas ? "
And Cardona responds , " I 've heard in Dallas and Houston . "
And that 's why the cartel recruited these young Americans .
Cardona and Reta could move freely and easily back and forth across the border with Mexico .
Just hours before they were arrested , federal authorities taped a phone conversation between them in which Cardona brags about killing 14 - year - old Inez Villareal and his cousin , a Cardona rival .
Cardona laughs as he describes torturing the two boys and dumping their bodies in large metal drums filled with diesel fuel .
He says he made " guiso , " or stew , with their bodies .
As the call ends , Cardona says , " There are three left to kill , there are three left . "
All About Laredo • Gulf Cartel • Gang Violence • Mexico • Illegal Drugs
If you ’ve worked on economic policy formulation – or in any large bureaucracy – you know how to get your boss to make the decision you want .
The key is to frame the options in such a way that he or she feels that your preferred course of action is the only plausible direction .
Alternatives need to be undermined or discredited .
Smart bosses know this , of course , and they seek out sources of information or analysis that are not managed by their subordinates .
The problem is that , traditionally , most such sources are not sufficiently well informed , at a detailed level , to be really helpful in the decision - making process .
The format of most mainstream media – 800 words for the general reader , 4 minute stories , etc – does not allow engagement at the technical level ; and , to be honest , technocrats are very good at manipulating the information flow to even the best journalist ( who is usually a generalist ) .
And while there are always outside technical domain experts , research papers appear with a lag and op eds usually have a broad brush ( again , a format constraint ) .
Seen in this context , President Obama – on the face of it – has the role of blogs exactly backwards .
But perhaps he is instead telling us something more profound .
In Sunday ’s NYT , the President is quoted as saying ( at the end of the story ) ,
Part of the reason we do n’t spend a lot of time looking at blogs is because if you have n’t looked at it very carefully , then you may be under the impression that somehow there ’s a clean answer one way or another – well , you just nationalize all the banks , or you just leave them alone and they ’ll be fine .
Blogs relax previous format restrictions .
Length can vary , as can technical content .
Comments allow immediate feedback , clarification ; debate is healthy for ideas .
Experts can now express a view or an endorsement immediately to a broader audience – and get pushback , as appropriate .
And , on the President ’s point , experts can now talk directly to other experts at a very detailed operational level , and the results of that conversation are now public – and again attract public content ( let ’s be honest : sometimes experts are way off - base and they need to be told ) .
This is very threatening to official technocrats , both because their monopoly on expertise crumbles and because a broader set of people become skilled at criticizing their ideas .
These technocrats would much rather have their boss read newspapers and weekly magazines .
There is a good reason that the IMF is not free to speak candidly about the United States ; it is full of experts who know what they are talking about .
But the President knows all this , which suggests another interpretation for his remarks .
Perhaps the financial situation – e.g. , in and around derivatives – really is too complex for anyone to understand , unless they have the inside knowledge of regulators .
This would mean , of course , that going forward no one can question Treasury about anything important .
But that , in turn , makes congressional oversight impossible – even if we move to closed door hearings .
And it raises the question : if our financial system has become so economically complex that President Obama is right , then is it also too complex to be politically sustainable ?
Big financial players now know they have a colossal potential put or bailout option .
They can also construct interconnected structures that no one can understand , except possibly the Treasury .
So every 10 - 20 years ( or more often ? ) we will experience a crisis of current proportions ?
There is a growing consensus that large banks should be broken up ; no more “ too big to fail ” .
But the President ’s implied point about economic / political complexity suggests that derivatives – for all their obvious potential benefits – are too dangerous to be allowed at anything like their current scale .
Who will be willing down the road to let Treasury , without outside comment or oversight , repeatedly provide massive amounts of resources to financial system insiders ?
Derivatives have the potential to create a rent - seeking structure that is unparalleled in human history .
No society can afford to allow that kind of financial system to operate .
Either we figure out how to make it much more transparent – and amenable to outside review – or the re-regulation process currently in the hands of Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank needs to consider more radical alternatives .
“ This is what we ’re really all about at N.I.H. , ” says Gahl , a compact 58 - year - old who tends to make dry jokes in his slightly gruff baritone about almost everything — except science .
“ We ’re in this business because we want to define and understand new diseases . ”
The expectation is that this work will offer important insights into the mechanisms of more common , more familiar diseases too .
But knowledge can be double - edged : useful for the community at large , yes , and in some cases even helpful for the patient , but often incomplete , confusing or unbearably grim .
Gahl worries constantly about taking away from his patients their last refuge : hope .
When you ’re suffering from a nameless malady , it ’s easy to think that the only thing standing between you and a cure is the name itself .
The limitation of knowledge is something that troubles Gahl — or would trouble him if he allowed himself to dwell on it .
Gahl has been at the N.I.H. for his entire career .
He was born in a small town in Wisconsin , studied biochemistry as an undergraduate at M.I.T. and received his medical degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , where he also did his pediatrics residency and went on to earn a Ph.D. in oncology research .
When he first arrived at the N.I.H. in 1981 , it was as a fellow in the new field of medical genetics , back when scientists felt they were on the threshold of the era of gene therapy , when all you would need to do to cure a disease would be to find its gene , figure out what the gene did and imitate it .
The ensuing years have shown how difficult it is to bridge the gap between the gene and the cure , which has been accomplished far less often than people once predicted .
Despite the accumulating disappointments and false starts in genomic medicine , however , Gahl has never given up searching for the genetic bull ’s - eye .
As he described Summer Stiers to me for the first time in October , Gahl sounded like a mixture of teacher , scientist , enthusiast and old - fashioned healer .
“ It looks like she has leaky membranes ; what causes that ? ” he began , as though he were a senior attending physician and I were a medical student on rounds .
“ She had a diagnosis as a child of Coats disease , where fluid leaks out of her eye , and then there ’s a reaction ; her eye was removed .
Her kidneys are ruined ; her gut is problematic , she had bleeding ; her lungs are reasonably O.K. ; she ’s got calcification in her skin ; her vessels leak . ”
Gahl was certain he would accept her into the program .
“ This is an absolutely great case , ” he said .
It had everything he was looking for when he first helped design the program : documentation of her long , perplexing history and the likelihood that she was suffering from something entirely new .
He was also impressed with the patient ’s good disposition and coping mechanisms , which at the time he knew about only because of how Robert Pinnick , her primary - care physician , described her in his introductory letter .
“ We appreciate your interest in helping us make a diagnosis in this wonderful 31 - year - old woman , ” Pinnick wrote , “ whose indomitable will to survive and always positive and pleasant attitude make her case not only tragic , but intriguing and a joy to pursue . ”
There was fierce competition among patients for a spot in the Undiagnosed Diseases Program , which began as a $ 280,000 pilot initiative last May .
( It was later approved for full financing — $ 1.9 million for fiscal year 2009 . )
By the time Gahl showed me Stiers ’s case files in his cramped , chilly office that October afternoon , he had received more than 1,000 inquiries .
He was in the process of reviewing about 300 charts and had accepted 35 patients .
Another 100 or so charts were circulating through the N.I.H. for review by relevant specialists , and Gahl expected that another 20 patients would be admitted to the program before the end of the year .
Summer Stiers , as Gahl anticipated , turned out to be one of them .

When I first spoke with Stiers by telephone in mid-November , I could tell what it was about her that captivated Gahl .
She was soft - spoken , with a lilting , little - girl voice , and even when she was telling me about the devastating series of physical breakdowns that have afflicted her , there was nothing complaining or self - pitying about it .
Only once did she give a hint of her frustration , when she mentioned being told earlier that day that her phosphorus numbers were high , always a concern on dialysis .
“ They do n’t know why it is , since I ’m doing everything they tell me to do ; I ’m eating just what they tell me to , ” she said .
“ That ’s kind of what my whole life is .
I follow directions — I ’m a good little follower , I do what I ’m told — and this happens anyway . ”
Stiers was born in 1977 in Portland , Ore .
She had a troubled childhood : her father left before she was born , and she remembers her mother as a distant , difficult parent .
The first sign of Stiers ’s health problems was that her teeth were weird .
They were odd , small and sort of pointy , and she was told there were no buds for permanent teeth behind most of her baby teeth .
When she was 10 , problems started with her right eye : a black mass in her central vision resulting in several futile operations , which led to pain and inflammation and eventually total blindness in that eye .
Her condition was diagnosed as Coats disease , a rare eye disorder , though her symptoms were not at all typical .
“ They told me there was a lot of pressure , ” she said , “ and they tried to take care of it surgically , like they did back then , cutting little slits to let the pressure out . ”
The operations only bruised and battered her ; the eye hurt constantly , the vision was destroyed and finally , on her 14th birthday , Stiers had her right eye removed .
A year later she received a prosthetic eye .
She ’s now on her third prosthetic , and the color matches her own blue - gray eye color so perfectly that it ’s hard to tell which one is real .
Michael Schumacher , who won seven World Championship titles and finished runner - up a further three times , admits to being astonished by the new rule whereby the champion will be the driver with the most wins as opposed to the driver with most points .
Admitting that there are a number of question marks ahead of the new season , and that this adds to the excitement , the German , writing on his own website , continues : " I doubt the same goes for the new rules given out on such a late moment prior to the season - something which to me is really , well , astonishing , as in all the years , when the majority wanted to have a rule change for a good reason , they always said that would not be possible in a short term or so late before a season .
" I cannot imagine those changes to help F1 , " he continues , " especially regarding the new system to find the champion .
I cannot see how it makes sense to eventually have a world champion who has less points than the driver coming in second , even if I also think it is a good move to try to strengthen the winner 's position . "
Looking ahead to the new season , the German , who has attended a number of tests over the winter , writes : " The picture to me in the moment is that there are several teams able to be in the front , besides us ( Ferrari ) there are Renault and Toyota , and BMW and Williams as well - on the other hand , after Barcelona you clearly have to say that Ross ' team was outstanding .
They were one second in front , and if they can take this into the season they are strong as well - even if probably the big teams will cut that advantage away with time .
McLaren at the moment looks pretty bad . "
Of Ferrari , he adds : " As a fan of motorsports and of Ferrari .
The last impressions were showing that we look pretty good and should be in the position to fight for the world championship titles . "
The new virus is considered a swine flu because one of the two main proteins on its surface is similar to proteins on pig viruses , though its genome contains genes from pig , bird and human viruses ( Image : proman / Stock .
Xchng )
Hundreds people in Mexico and an increasing number in other countries have come down with a new kind of swine flu .
People are concerned because some of those infected in Mexico have died , and because this is the kind of virus that could become a serious worldwide epidemic ( see Deadly new flu virus in US and Mexico may go pandemic and Threat level for flu pandemic raised ) .
Should I worry about this flu ?
That depends on two things : how severe this flu is , and how far it spreads .
Its severity is still unknown .
Those who died in Mexico were young adults who do n’t often die of flu , so we know this virus can be serious .
But it is n’t always this bad : the cases picked up in the US were mild .
Outbreak investigators are now trying to find out how many people have had the virus , and how many of those were seriously ill , to get an idea of how bad it is .

Will it spread to where I live ?
That depends , again , on two different things : whether the virus is transported to your region , and how efficiently it spreads between people .
So many people travel globally now that , as long as this virus keeps infecting people , it is unlikely not to get to where you live .
Some countries are already using infrared cameras to spot people with fevers on flights from affected areas .
But that wo n’t stop it entirely , since five days can pass before an infected person shows symptoms , and the virus can spread before symptoms start .
The big question is how efficiently it spreads once it lands .
From the number of cases in Mexico and the fact that those infected in the US had not been in contact with pigs or each other , we know that it can spread from human to human , and has done so for weeks at least .
Investigators are conducting tests to see whether people who contacted known cases have also been infected to try to assess how easily it spreads .
Preliminary observations in the US suggest it has spread readily to contacts of known cases .
Similar swine flu viruses have jumped from pigs to people before and have always petered out without causing a pandemic because they were not good enough at spreading in people .
This virus may do the same thing .
Does this virus mean I should n’t eat pork ?
No .
This virus is named swine flu because one of its surface proteins is most similar to viruses that usually infect pigs , and the whole thing is of a type that has been spreading in North American pigs for years .
But this particular virus is spreading in people and we do n’t yet know if it infects pigs .
In any case , cooking kills the virus .
Wash your hands after handling meat .
Can I travel to other countries ?
Yes .
There are no official travel advisories against going to affected regions of Mexico , but the cases of this virus being discovered in other countries are all in people who had recently travelled there .
27 April UPDATE : At a European Commission briefing , the EU health commissioner Andorra Vassiliou asked Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States or Mexico .
Europeans “ should avoid travelling to Mexico or the United States of America unless it is very urgent for them , ” she said .
The US Centers for Disease Control has also warned against all non-essential travel to Mexico .
The World Health Organisation however has called on countries not to close their borders , as epidemic models have shown this will have little effect on the spread of a pandemic .
What if it causes a pandemic ?
Most countries in the world have pandemic plans , on paper at least .
They can respond with vaccines , drugs , and measures called “ social distancing ” , aimed at limiting human contacts that spread flu .
Mexico has already done this , by banning public gatherings and closing schools in affected areas .
Modelling suggests this can be effective .
The Mexican swine flu virus is susceptible to the most widely stockpiled flu antiviral drugs , Tamiflu and its relatives .
But viruses of the same family can readily develop resistance to these drugs , so no one knows how long the drugs will remain effective .
There are no stocks of vaccine to this flu .
The US has already created a “ seed strain ” from it , a virus that can be grown to make vaccines .
Because of fears that H5N1 bird flu would go pandemic , vaccine companies and regulators , especially in Europe , have developed procedures over the past few years for rapidly approving and manufacturing pandemic vaccines in factories that normally make regular human flu vaccines .
The question now is whether and when they will switch production to a pandemic vaccine .
If they do , the question will be how many doses they can produce , and how fast .
Researchers are trying to find ways to stretch vaccine stocks , but there is no commonly agreed approach yet .
They wo n’t be able to make much vaccine for several months .
But if there are several waves , each several months apart , as there have been in past pandemics , they might have time to make stocks of the vaccine before the next wave – if there is one .
Why are we worried this virus could go pandemic ?
Because it is new .
Flu constantly evolves , mostly with small changes to its surface proteins .
There are usually enough differences between this year ’s flu and whatever you had last time to allow the new virus to evade your immune defenses and cause an infection , but its similarities to your last case mean you still have partial immunity to it .
But flu surface proteins come in 16 different families , and viruses interbreed and swap genes .
Occasionally a new flu virus that has picked up completely new surface proteins from pig or bird flu viruses circulates in people .
Since no humans have been exposed to it before , no one has any immunity .
Those viruses cause pandemics .
The Mexican swine flu is like this .
It is of the H1N1 family , named for its two main surface proteins .
There are other , mild H1N1 viruses circulating in humans as ordinary flu .
But pig H1 ’s are somewhat different , and according to the CDC , immunity provided by the current H1N1 vaccine for humans does not protect against the Mexican H1 .
The bad 1918 pandemic was an H1N1 virus , and there is evidence that people exposed to earlier human H1 flu had some immunity to it .
The 1918 virus was different from this one , however , because its H surface protein was from birds .
What should I do to prepare for a pandemic ?
We do n’t know yet if this will be one – but quiet preparation ca n’t hurt .
Cover coughs and sneezes and wash your hands a lot .
Do n’t run down your ability to fight infection – eat well and be sensible .
Some scientists recommend going on statins as there is some evidence they reduce death rates from flu in people who tend to die from it in normal years .

The Sadiq family say safety at their store is their main priority
The owners of an Asian jewellery shop which was recently robbed have decided to turn away people wearing the traditional veil worn by Muslim women .
ATAA Jewellers in the west end of Glasgow was raided by two Asian men entirely covered apart from their eyes .
The pair wore full Muslim female dress , including the Niqab headwear , and were carrying handbags .
The two girls working at the time were left so shaken there are plans for a sign banning anything covers the face .
The store 's owners said they think it is an idea that will be taken up by other businesses .
They acknowledged that such a move may offend some people , but they said safety was their priority .
It will just help if the community gets together and does something solid
Rukhsana Sadiq
ATAA Jewellers Rukhsana Sadiq was in the shop when it was robbed .
She spent hours showing what she thought were the two women gold , but she never saw their faces .
" We did n't realise how tall they were until we got attacked and the pepper sprays came out , " she said .
Rukhsana said the incident has left her terrified , and suspicious of everyone she sees .
She added : " They know us by face , but we do n't know who they are .
I mean they can even walk by the shop , we do n't even know it 's them and it 's really , really frightening .
" It will just help if the community gets together and does something solid , for these women to know .
It is our safety that matters as well at the end of the day .
" God forbid anything like this happening to anyone else . "
Student Madihah Ansari does not like the idea of a shop banning the veil Rukhsana 's brother Mohammed Amin Sadiq said it was not the first time that a veil 's been used as a disguise in the area .
" There 's been an incident in another Asian shop , " he said .
" Two females came in , or males .
They picked up a bag of money , but the shop owner took note and they ran out . "
For the Sadiq family protecting business is the most important thing and they want clear boundaries for anyone who shops there .
They told the BBC Asian Network that when they get a sign there will be ways around the rule , like ringing up in advance to make sure there is a female member of staff present to identify a shopper wearing the Niqab .
But Madihah Ansari , a 19 - year - old student in Glasgow , said a sign banning the veil was not the solution .
Madihah wears a Burkha and always has her head and body covered .
Sometimes she chooses to wear a Niqab as well , meaning her face is covered .
She said : " I just really do n't like that idea .
It is like prejudice about one type of person .
Business people have to make a decision ; do they want their customers in or not with that type of dress ?
Cllr Hanzala Malik
" Just because two guys did a crime and they were dressed up in that kind of outfit you can't prejudice everyone else .
" There 'll be loads of people who just want to go in and buy gold and come out .
To prevent them kind of reminds me of when they had signs saying ' no blacks ' . "
Glasgow councillor Hanzala Malik has backed the shops decision to turn people away who cover their faces .
However , he agreed that a sign may cause offence .
He said : " Business people have to make a decision ; do they want their customers in or not with that type of dress ?
" I know in Scotland that banks will not allow their customers coming in with motorbike helmets , I do n't see why it should be different for people wearing the Niqab .
It is an issue about identifying people . "
You can hear a full report on this on the BBC Asian Network at 1230 and 1800 BST on Tuesday .

Bodybuilding is the process of maximizing muscle hypertrophy ; an individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder .
In competitive bodybuilding , bodybuilders display their physiques to a panel of judges , who assign points based on their aesthetic appearance .
The muscles are revealed through a combination of fat loss , oils , and tanning ( or tanning lotions ) which combined with lighting make the definition of the muscle group more distinct .

This Chinese panorama painting " captures the daily life of people from the Song period at the capital Bianjing , today 's Kaifeng .
The theme celebrates the festive spirit and worldly commotion on the Qingming Festival , rather than the holiday 's ceremonial aspects such as tomb sweeping and prayers .
The entire piece was painted in handscroll format , and the content reveals the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as different economic activities in rural areas and the city . " [ source ]

-----------------
Anamorphosis ( a. anamorphic ) refers to the ingenious artistic technique of distorting the perspective of a picture when viewed from the normal reference point or angle .
The apparent distortion disappears and a regular image emerges when the angle of viewing is changed or the image is observed using a curved mirror .
Holbein's ' The Ambassadors ' * is probably the most famous example of the mirror type .
See : one two .
Some of the panorama flyers exhibit the phenomenon in the way the buildings are distorted and curved to conform to the curvature of the horizon / earth .

panorama
“ [ It ] was so designed that two of the forces which militate against perfect illusion in a gallery painting — the limiting frame and standards of size and distance external to the picture itself — were eliminated …
The intrusive elements of the spectator ’s surroundings being blacked out , the world in which they were entwined consisted exclusively of the landscape or cityscape depicted on the canvas suspended thirty feet away . ”
[ Richard Altick , 1978 ]
" The panorama aspired not to artistic stance or synthesis , but to an encyclopedic gaze midway between that of some aeronautic insect and that of a real - estate sales agent .

Nowa panorama !
The story goes that the Irish painter , Robert Aston Barker , was sketching the city of Edinburgh from Carlton Hill * in 1787 when he came up with the idea of reproducing the scene as a painting on a huge canvas that could be hung all the way around the inside of a large cylindrical container .
The idea was for an observer in the centre to be encircled by a view without the perception boundaries of a regular painting 's frame .
In this way , he hoped to have the painted scene completely fill an observer 's field of vision , making the experience as close to ' real ' as possible .
It would become the first immersive virtual reality .
Barker obtained a patent for his design in 1787 , which he called ( nature at a glance ) .
A purpose - specific building ( rotunda ) , based on Barker 's plans , was opened in Leicester Square in London in 1793 to great acclaim ( two identical cross- section schematic images can be seen above ) .
By this time , either Barker or a friend of his coined the term ( ' all view ' ) which would be applied both to the circular painting and to the structure in which it was hung .
The Leicester Square rotunda was 11 metres high and 26 metres in diameter and was configured so to allow the simultaneous display of two panoramas , one upstairs , one below .
Traditional subject matter consisted of panoramic city views , land and sea battles , together with exotic location scenes ( views of Athens and the Arctic region would prove to be the most popular ) .
Visitors were admitted through a dark passage to heighten the sensation of entering another world .
The umbrella roof allowed the panorama paintings to be lit by natural light entering from directly above each painted canvas .
Shadows cast by visitors angled towards the centre of the structure so they did n't fall on the painting and break the illusion .
In the sea battle panoramas , the viewing platform was sometimes made to resemble the deck of a ship .
The upper and lower limits of the visual field were draped to make the vista appear endless .
The combination of art and technical innovation was a very popular spectacle .
Visitors were astonished and sometimes disorientated by the panorama and the inability to get a proper perspective : Exhibition spaces were opened in other cities , both in the UK and on the continent .
The panorama paintings were of course portable , so after a season in London , they might be packed up and shipped to another venue .
Other entrepreneurs set up competing ventures and introduced their own variations and the form ultimately became most popular in America , particularly during the 1840s - 1850s , with the adopted name of cyclorama .
The Barker Panorama had handbills and programs printed which , for about the first fifteen years at least , provided an illustrated legend or key - as we see above - that unintentionally resembled an anamorphic image .
Originally they simply wanted to give some sense of the 360 - degree novelty of the exhibition and this necessitated presenting the subject matter in distorted perspective .
There was an obvious emphasis on promoting the sensational aspects of a new form of visual entertainment , despite the fact that the keys were difficult to read and had no clear starting point .
Eventually , as the novelty of the spectacle wore off and / or became very widely known , the panorama legends were modified and displayed as two rectangles , without distortion , and could be more easily followed and read from left to right .
This development coincided with a change in emphasis from the visual illusion aspect to the presentation of geographical accuracy .
Barker ( and subsequent entrepreneurs ) had always highlighted the difficulties and extremes of conditions faced by the sketch artist to bring each panorama to the public .
Extravagant notices told of the insider assistance provided by foreign envoys , for example , in gaining unique and updated information and the latest changes to the skylines of target locations .
There were some ten or more versions of the Constantinople panorama made over fifty years , each subsequent painting said to be more complete , more contemporary than its predecessor .
The rotunda in Leicester Square closed in 1863 and the entertainment form suffered its greatest decline in patronage with the advent of moving pictures .
Still , panoramas - in one form or another - have never completely disappeared from the cultural repertoire available in many countries .
Joaquin Phoenix made a surprise and disguised appearance in San Francisco yesterday in support of American Apparel ’s proposed store in the Mission District ’s hip Valencia Street .
[ social_buttons ]
Phoenix apparently told the company that he ’d make a statement of support , but from this video [ below ] , you can tell he ’s less than enthusiastic .
But hey — he probably got a free trip from LA to San Francisco !
After four hours , the planning commission did not approve American Apparel ’s proposed store and the company is expected to drop its attempt to open it .

NEWS broke last week that Rahm Emanuel , now White House chief of staff , lived rent - free for years in the home of Rep. Rosa De Lauro ( D - Conn . ) – and failed to disclose the gift , as congressional ethics rules mandate .
But this is only the tip of Emanuel ’s previously undislosed ethics problems .
One issue is the work Emanuel tossed the way of De Lauro ’s husband .
But the bigger one goes back to Emanuel ’s days on the board of now - bankrupt mortgage giant Freddie Mac .
Emanuel is a multimillionaire , but lived for the last five years for free in the tony Capitol Hill townhouse owned by De Lauro and her husband , Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg .
During that time , he also served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee – which gave Greenberg huge polling contracts .
It paid Greenberg ’s firm $ 239,996 in 2006 and $ 317,775 in 2008 .
( Emanuel ’s own campaign committee has also paid Greenberg more than $ 50,000 since 2004 . )
To be fair , Greenberg had polling contracts with the DCCC before – but each new election cycle brings its own set of consultants .
And Emanuel was certainly generous with his roommate .
Emanuel never declared the substantial gift of free rent on any of his financial - disclosure forms .
He and De Lauro claim that it was just allowable “ hospitality ” between colleagues .
Hospitality – for five years ?
Some experts suggest that it was also taxable income :
Over five years , the free rent could easily add up to more than $ 100,000 .
Nor is this all that seems to have been missed in the Obama team ’s vetting process .
Consider : Emanuel served on the Freddie Mac board of directors during the time that the government - backed lender lied about its earnings , a leading contributor to the current economic meltdown .
The Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Agency later singled out the Freddie Mac board as contributing to the fraud in 2000 and 2001 for “ failing in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention . ”
In other words , board members ignored the red flags waving in their faces .
The SEC later fined Freddie $ 50 million for its deliberate fraud in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 .
Meanwhile , Emanuel was paid more than $ 260,000 for his Freddie “ service . ”
Plus , after he resigned from the board to run for Congress in 2002 , the troubled agency ’s PAC gave his campaign $ 25,000 – its largest single gift to a House candidate .
That ’s what friends are for , is n’t it ?
Now Rahm Emanuel is in the White House helping President Obama dig out of the mess that Freddie Mac helped start .
The president ’s chief of staff is n’t subject to Senate confirmation , but his ethics still matter .
Is this the change that we can depend on ?
It 's Super Bowl week .
The game is on Sunday , but by the time kickoff rolls around we 're going to be so sick of the hype that nobody is going to care about the game .
The memes have started coalescing , so here 's a little primer for every storyline that you will be sick of come Thursday evening once NBC 's pregame coverage starts following the end of 30 Rock .
1. Did you know that Kurt Warner is a Born - Again Christian ?
Be prepared to hear a lot about this one .
2 . Did you know that Kurt Warner is a free agent after this season ?
That will get a lot of attention from the sports guys as well .
3 . But maybe not as much as will the question of whether Kurt Warner will retire if the Cardinals win the game ?
After all , he nearly quit following the loss to the New York Jets when Anquan Boldin was seriously injured trying to catch one of his passes .
4 . Is Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald the greatest wide receiver ever ?
5 . Is Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald the greatest player ever ?
6 . Did you know that Cardinals head coach Ken Whisenhunt was the offensive coordinator under Bill Cowher with the Pittsburgh Steelers ?
7 . Did you know that Ken Whisenhunt was supposedly the logical successor to Cowher when Cowher retired ?
8 . Did you know that Mike Tomlin , an African - American gentlemen , got the Steelers job instead ?
9 . If the Cardinals win , will this be Whisenhunt 's revenge ?
10 .
If the Steelers win , will they be the greatest team in NFL history ?
11 . Expect to hear that Anquan Boldin , the Cardinals receiver , is a cancer to his team because of his fourth quarter fight with the team 's offensive coordinator in the NFC title game against the Eagles .
12 . Do n't expect to hear anything about Kurt Warner 's shoving match with that same coordinator during the first half of that same game .
13 .
If the Warner fight is mentioned , expect to hear it laughed off as Warner showing what a great competitor he is .
Boldin , however , will still be a cancer on par with Terrell Owens .
14 . Did you know that Bill Cowher once coached the Steelers ?
And did you know that Ken Whisenhunt once worked for Cowher ?
So , who does Bill Cowher pull for in this game ?
15 .
Hey , did you know that Ben Roethlisberger had a nearly fatal motor cycle accident several years ago ?
Well , the media will tell you all about it .
16 . The Pittsburgh Steelers are known for their famed Steel Curtain defenses .
So , which version of the Steel Curtain is the best ever ?
This one or one from the 70s ?
Expect a position by position breakdown with lots of shouting taking the place of analysis .
17 . Hey , did you know that Steelers defensive back Troy Polamalu has some really long hair ?
And did you ever wonder if it hurts when someone grabs it ?
That should be some breaking news from Media Day .
18 . Cardinals running back Edgerrin James left the Indianapolis Colts the year before they won the Super Bowl .
Does a Cardinal win serve as redemption for him ?
19 .
There will also be multiple stories on all of the stupid bets that suckers can make in Las Vegas .
Along with that , you should expect to be told that the Vegas handicappers are some of the most knowledgeable sports minds in the world .
20 .
You should also expect to be told every single story that can be told about the embarrassing history of the Chicago St. Louis Phoenix Arizona Cardinals , including how this is only the seventh time in the team 's history to make the playoffs , and that the team has n't won a title since 1947 .
21 . Being as how Jennifer Hudson is performing the anthem , expect to hear all about the recent tragedy in her life and what a brave person she is for overcoming this tragedy .
22 . For you Fox News Channel buffs , I suspect you 'll see Bill O'Reilly questioning whether that communist sympathizer Bruce Springsteen should be allowed to perform at halftime and whether he will perform that un-American anthem " Born In The U.S.A . "
23 . I would n't be surprised to hear Rush Limbaugh go on about Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin being an affirmative - action coach since he was hired under the NFL's Rooney Rule which requires teams to interview African - Americans for head coaching jobs .
24 . Expect to be reminded that Ken Whisenhunt is an offensive genius .
25 .
And here 's the ultimate trivia that I suspect ESPN will run into the ground : the Cardinals and Steelers actually merged together in 1944 to form one football team known as Card - Pitt because the teams had lost too many players to World War II to field separate teams .
In theory , the administration ’s plan is based on letting the market determine the prices of the banks ’ “ toxic assets ”  including outstanding house loans and securities based on those loans .
The reality , though , is that the market will not be pricing the toxic assets themselves , but options on those assets .
The two have little to do with each other .
The government plan in effect involves insuring almost all losses .
Since the private investors are spared most losses , then they primarily “ value ” their potential gains .
This is exactly the same as being given an option .
Consider an asset that has a 50 - 50 chance of being worth either zero or $ 200 in a year ’s time .
The average “ value ” of the asset is $ 100 .
Ignoring interest , this is what the asset would sell for in a competitive market .
It is what the asset is “ worth . ”
Under the plan by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , the government would provide about 92 percent of the money to buy the asset but would stand to receive only 50 percent of any gains , and would absorb almost all of the losses .
Some partnership !
Assume that one of the public - private partnerships the Treasury has promised to create is willing to pay $ 150 for the asset .
That ’s 50 percent more than its true value , and the bank is more than happy to sell .
So the private partner puts up $ 12 , and the government supplies the rest  $ 12 in “ equity ” plus $ 126 in the form of a guaranteed loan .

If , in a year ’s time , it turns out that the true value of the asset is zero , the private partner loses the $ 12 , and the government loses $ 138 .
If the true value is $ 200 , the government and the private partner split the $ 74 that ’s left over after paying back the $ 126 loan .
In that rosy scenario , the private partner more than triples his $ 12 investment .
But the taxpayer , having risked $ 138 , gains a mere $ 37 .
Over the past decade so many feathered dinosaurs have been discovered that it almost comes as no surprise when a new one is announced .
What paleontologists did not expect , however , was to find " feathers " on a dinosaur that should not have had them .
In a paper published this week in Nature paleontologists Zheng Xiao - Ting , You Hai - Lu , Xu Xing , and Dong Zhi-Ming described Tianyulong confuciusi , a small ornithischian dinosaur covered in feather - like structures .
It takes a little bit of background knowledge to understand why this is so shocking .
Dinosaurs can be divided into two large groups : the saurischia ( theropods and sauropods ) and the ornithischia ( armored dinosaurs , horned dinosaurs , hadrosaurs , etc. ) .
To date nearly all the dinosaurs with feathers have been coelurosaurs , a group of theropods to which birds also belong , but there is one exception .
In 2002 paleontologists announced that they had discovered a specimen of the small ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus with a plume of bristles jutting from its tail .
Since Psittacosaurus was an ornithischian dinosaur it was about as far removed from bird ancestry as a dinosaur could get , so why did have hollow bristly tubes on its tail that resembled early feathers ?
Careful examination confirmed that the structures were not some strange artifact of preservation like collagen fibers from the decomposing body , but just why this dinosaur had bristles was a puzzle .
Enter Tianyulong .
This dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous rock of China was a heterodontosaurid , a group of small dinosaurs placed near the base of the ornithischian family tree .
What is so special about the first specimen of Tianyulong , though , is that it exhibits three patches of hair - like structures very similar to the " bristles " on the tail of Psittacosaurus .
These structures did not branch like feathers and appear to have been more rigid than the feathery " dinofuzz " of coelurosaurs .
The structures possessed by Tianyulong were not feathers , but just what we should call them is now open for suggestion .
The big question is whether the bristles on Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus represent the independant evolution of a body covering among ornithischians or whether the bristles were derived from an earlier body covering shared by the common ancestor of ornithischians and saurichians .
The feathers of coelurosaurs and the bristles of the ornithischians differ significantly but it is possible that they represent different derivations from a more ancient kind of body covering .
The presence of a feathery or hairy body covering in dinosaurs , then , would have been lost in some groups and retained in other groups .
The other alternative is that some ornithischian dinosaurs independently evolved a different sort of body covering , perhaps more than once .
Which is the correct hypothesis ?
More research is required to know for sure , but what Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus show is that dinosaurs expressed a wider range of body coverings than we previously appreciated and hint at more amazing discoveries yet to be made .

Personality Characteristics of Parents Making False Accusations of Sexual abuse in Custody Disputes1
Hollida Wakefield & Ralph Underwager *
ABSTRACT : Files from contested divorce and custody cases where there were false allegations of sexual abuse were reviewed .
In many of the files , there was sufficient information to form an opinion about the individual 's personality characteristics .
We compared the personalities of 72 falsely accusing parents and 103 falsely accused parents to each other and to a control group of 67 custody only parents ( who were involved in custody disputes but without allegations of sexual abuse ) .
All cases had come into our private practice clinic .
The falsely accusing parents were much more likely than were the other two groups to have a personality disorder such as histrionic , borderline , passive - aggressive , or paranoid .
Only one - fourth were seen as normal .
In comparison , most of the individuals in the custody control group and in the falsely accused group were seen as normal .
This is discussed in terms of the dynamics involved .
A suggested typology of individuals who make false accusation of sexual abuse in divorce and custody disputes is presented .
Child sexual abuse allegations have increased dramatically in the past 10 to 15 years .
Some authorities claim this is caused by an increase in actual abuse of children and that we are in the middle of an epidemic of child abuse .
Others suggest that there may not be an increase in abuse but rather an increase in reporting abuse .
This is a more hopeful view since it indicates that we are succeeding in our efforts to respond effectively to the reality of child abuse .
There is considerable confusion about the relationship between incidence and prevalence estimates of child sexual abuse .
The most recent incidence estimate reported is in the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect Second National Incidence Study ( 1988 ) suggesting an incidence rate for sexual abuse of children of either 2.2 or 2.5 per 1000 , depending upon the definition used .
The actual prevalence rate cannot exceed a multiple ( years of childhood ) of the actual incidence rate so the most likely prevalence rate is around 4 % .
This is considerably less than many suggested prevalence rates , which range from 3 % to 62 % in different surveys and average 20 % to 30 % ( Wakefield & Underwager , 1988 ) .
Prevalence estimates are most often based on retrospective memory surveys of adults about their childhood experiences .
Retrospective memory involves reconstruction rather than recall and may be inaccurate since we often make up stories about our past in order to make sense of our present ( Dawes , 1988 ) .
Prevalence surveys do not attempt to relate the prevalence estimate to the incidence rate .
One of the more carefully conducted surveys that did not use retrospective reports , however , reported a prevalence rate of 5.3 % which is closer to what the incidence rate suggests ( Siegel , Sorenson , Golding , Burnam , & Stein , 1987 ) .
False accusations of sexual abuse are also increasing although there is disagreement as to the frequency and nature of false claims .
However , many professionals believe that false accusations have become a serious problem in vindictive and angry divorce and custody battles .
Consequently , such false accusations have received much publicity and there have been many articles about this in the literature ( Ash , 1985 ; Benedek & Schetky , 1985 a & b ; Bishop & Johnson , 1987a & b ; Blush & Ross , 1987 ; Brant & Sink , 1984 ; Bresee , Stearns , Bess , & Packer , 1986 ; Dwyer , 1986 ; Ekman , 1989 ; Ferguson , D. , 1988 ; Gardner , 1986 & 1987a ; Goldzband & Renshaw , undated ; Gordon , 1985 ; Green , 1986 ; Green & Schetky , 1988 ; Hindmarch , 1990 ; Jones & Seig , 1988 ; Levine , 1986 ; Levy , 1989 ; MacFarlane , 1986 ; Murphy , 1987 ; Ross & Blush , 1990 ; Schaefer & Guyer , 1988 ; Schuman , 1986 ; Sink , 1988 b ; Spiegel , 1986 ; Thoennes and Pearson ( 1988a & b ) ; Underwager & Wakefield , 1989 ; Wakefield & Underwager , 1988 ; Wakefield & Underwager , 1989 ; Yates & Musty , 1988 ) .
It is difficult to determine just how often sexual abuse accusations occur in custody and visitation disputes .
Theonnes and her colleagues ( Thoennes & Pearson 1988 a & b ; Thoennes & Tjaden , 1990 ) attempted to get information on the incidence and validity of sexual abuse allegations in divorce and custody cases .
They gathered information through telephone interviews and mail surveys from 290 court administrators , judges , custody mediators , and child protection workers throughout the United States .
They then conducted 70 in - depth interviews at five sites , and then finally tracked cases of sexual abuse allegations over a six month period from eleven court systems .
This latter procedure yielded a pool of 160 cases of sexual abuse allegations .
They report that the initial survey and interviews at the five sites revealed a general consensus that sexual abuse allegations in custody disputes occur in " a small but growing " number of cases ( Theonnes & Pearson , 1988a ) .
They estimate that accusations of sexual abuse are found in approximately 2 % of contested custody cases ( the range across court sites was 1 % to 8 % ) .
They state that there are approximately one million divorces annually , and of these , about 55 % or 550,000 involve minor children .
About 15 % of these ( 82,500 ) result in court involvement due to custody and / or visitation disputes .
Their estimate of 2 % sexual abuse accusations in 82,500 custody disputes translates into 1,650 cases of sexual abuse accusations annually within the environment of a divorce / custody dispute .
We suspect that this estimate is too low .
In addition to nearly 200 cases of sexual abuse allegations in divorce and / or custody disputes in which we have been formally involved , we have informally consulted on many more .
We receive two or three calls or letters every week .
When presenting this topic at a poster session at the American Psychological Society in June , 1990 , three psychologists stopped to talk to us about similar cases .
One reported having recently dealt with such a case , another reported a close friend who had this happen , and a third told us that she herself had been falsely accused by her former husband in a nasty custody battle .
Our own experiences cannot be used to estimate a nationwide frequency .
Nevertheless , the large number of cases being seen by us and by others who have communicated with us suggests that the actual frequency may be higher than Theonnes and Pearson 's estimate .
For example , many matrimonial attorneys report that they are now handling more custody cases with sexual abuse allegations ( Fisk , 1989 ) .
There is not agreement as to how many of these cases turn out to be false , although most of the estimates range from one - third to four - fifths .
Thoennes and her colleagues report that in 33 % of the cases in their survey , no abuse was believed to have occurred .
Abuse was believed likely in 50 % and in 17 % no determination could be reached ( Thoennes & Pearson 1988 a & b ; Thoennes & Tjaden , 1990 ) .
However , the decision as to whether the abuse was factual was made by custody evaluators and child protection workers rather than by the justice system .
Most professionals believe that the proportion of false allegations of child sexual abuse is highest in divorce and custody disputes .
Out of approximately 500 cases in which we have provided expert consultation in the past six years involving sexual abuse accusations , 40 % were divorce and custody cases .
Of these divorce and custody cases that have been adjudicated , for three - fourths there was no determination of abuse by the legal system .
That is , charges were dropped or never filed or the person was acquitted in criminal court , or there was no finding of abuse in family court .
Dwyer ( 1986 ) reports similar statistics .
She states that 77 % of the divorce - linked allegations of sex abuse cases coming to the Human Sexuality Program at the University of Minnesota have turned out to be " hoax " cases .
This was based upon the opinion reached by the agency staff that the allegations were not accurate .
In our experience , accusations of sexual abuse occur in a bitter and acrimonious divorce at all stages of the process .
Benedek and Schetky ( 1985a ) report that they were especially common in disputes about child custody that arise after a divorce has been granted and center around issues of visitation .
Most of the time the accusation is not a deliberate fabrication on the part of the accusing parent .
Many parents have been influenced by the publicity about sexual abuse to make false accusations based on misperceptions and false assumptions .
Wallerstein and Kelly ( 1975 , 1980 ) note that in a bitter divorce , not only is the child likely to undergo significant stress , but the parents are likely to blame the child 's anxiety and distress on the other parent .
However , in some cases a parent can deliberately foster a false accusation as a way to get custody ( Wakefield & Underwager , 1989 ) .
Thoennes and Pearson ( 1988 b ) report that in 15 % of the cases they studied , the case worker expressed doubt that the report was offered in good faith .
As the system to respond to accusations of sexual abuse has developed , it rewards the making of an accusation with all manner of reinforcements .
The person who is hated is punished .
There is social approval for making the accusation .
There may be free legal counsel , welfare payments , approbation and support from mental health professionals , therapists , friends , family , neighbors .
There is no response cost for making an accusation .
As Green and Schetky ( 1988 ) state :
A small number of parents caught up in custody battles or visitation disputes have exploited the epidemic of sexual abuse by using such allegations to promote their own interests at the expense of their child and their former spouse .
Allegations have become a surefire way of getting a judge 's attention and cutting off visitations .
They have the same emotional impact that issues of adultery once had in custody battles a decade or more ago ( p. 104 ) .
Gardner ( 1986 ) notes that an accusation of sexual abuse is a powerful weapon in a divorce and custody dispute .
The vengeful parent may exaggerate a nonexistent or inconsequential sexual contact and build up a case for sexual abuse .
The child , in order to ingratiate himself with the accusing parent , may go along with this .
On the basis of such observations , he describes a " parental alienation syndrome " in which the child identifies with the vilifying parent and communicates absolute hatred toward the other parent .
A false accusation of sexual abuse may develop in this situation ( Gardner , 1987a ) .
Gardner ( 1986 ) also observes that in some cases a mother who is obsessed with hatred toward the father may bring the child to the point of having paranoid delusions about the father .
A " folie â deux " relationship may evolve in which the child acquires the mother 's paranoid delusions ( Ferguson , 1988 ; Kaplan & Kaplan , 1981 ; Rand , 1989 , 1990 ) .
Green ( 1986 ) states that such women are usually diagnosed as histrionic or paranoid personality disorders , or paranoid schizophrenics .
Blush and Ross ( 1987 ) and Ross and Blush ( 1990 ) have reported on the personality characteristics of the parties involved arising in the context of unresolved custody and visitation .
They gathered social , psychological , and legal data from allegations arising in a family services clinic of a circuit court setting in Michigan .
They report that information from several years of such cases provides suggested patterns characterizing accusations that are more likely to be false .
Important variables are the escalation and timing of the cases , the personality characteristics of the adults involved , and the behavior of the children .
They termed the typical pattern when the allegations turn out to be false the SAID ( Sexual Allegations in Divorce ) Syndrome ( Blush & Ross , 1987 ) .
1 . The accusations surface after separation and legal action begins .
2 . There is a history of family dysfunction with unresolved divorce conflict and hidden underlying issues .
3 . The female ( accusing ) parent often is a hysterical or borderline personality or is angry , defensive and justifying .
4 . The male ( the accused ) parent is generally passive , nurturing , and lacks " macho " characteristics .
5 . The child is typically a female under age eight .
6 . The allegations surfaces via the custodial parent .
7 . The mother takes the child to an " expert " who confirms the abuse and identifies the father as the perpetrator .
8 . The court reacts to the experts information by terminating or limiting visitation .
Ross and Blush ( 1990 ) describe three personality patterns they have observed in falsely accusing parents .
The first is the histrionic personality .
This individual appears anxious , concerned , and nervous and presents herself as victimized by her estranged spouse .
She describes herself as manipulated , coerced , and physically or psychologically abused by this spouse and perceives her child as now in danger of victimization from him .
Her interpretation of her child 's behavior appears to be an extension of her own feelings , with the result that she develops unusual and inappropriate sexual concerns about her child .
She may regularly examine her child 's genitals , take the child for repeated medical exams , or interrogate the child about possible sexual activity .
The justified vindicator is a variation of the histrionic personality .
This woman initially offers an intellectually organized , assertive , and justified agenda with many facts , figures , and opinions supporting her evidence .
She presents herself as justifiably outraged and concerned by the behavior of her spouse .
However , when clarification is sought concerning the details , she becomes hostile , resistant , and passive - aggressive .
She will argue and counter even carefully framed questions , is likely to discontinue contact with the evaluator who challenges her statements , and may threaten to sue or make ethical complaints .
The borderline personality , by virtue of a basic histrionic propensity and the stress of the divorce , functions in a highly dysfunctional way and may lose contact with reality .
This person may be most readily identified by peculiar and bizarre descriptions of events in her history .
We have been engaged in an ongoing study of the personality characteristics of the parties in false accusations of sexual abuse in divorce and custody disputes .
To date , files from over 181 cases of accusations of sexual abuse arising in an acrimonious divorce and custody dispute have been reviewed .
In many of the files , there is sufficient information from professional evaluations to form an opinion about the individual 's personality characteristics .
In conducting a systematic analysis of the psychological information in the files , we predicted that compared to parents in custody disputes without sexual abuse accusations , parents who make false accusations of sexual abuse during a divorce / custody battle will be more likely to demonstrate psychopathology in the course of an evaluation .
We also predicted that the personalities of persons who had been falsely accused would not differ from those in a custody control group .
Method
Subjects
Files from 181 cases where there have been sexual abuse allegations during a divorce and custody dispute were reviewed .
In many of the files , there was sufficient information ( from medical and psychological reports , therapy and hospital records , test results , etc. ) to form an opinion about the individuals ' personality characteristics .
In some of the cases , we had performed an evaluation .
In others , the data was obtained and the evaluation done by other mental health professionals and was reviewed by us .
We limited the information we used to that given by physicians and qualified mental health professionals .
The criteria to select the cases of false allegations were ( 1 ) the accused continued to deny the charge , ( 2 ) we concluded , from our review of the entire file , that the accusation was likely false , and ( 3 ) there had been no finding of abuse by the justice system .
The falsely accusing parents were compared to two groups Ña group of parents in contested custody cases in which there were no allegations of sexual abuse , and a group of falsely accused parents .
All cases had come into our private practice clinic .
Some of the sample included both parents in a case , but in others , we only had sufficient information about one .
We found enough information in the 181 files to include 72 falsely accusing parents ( 68 females and 4 males ) and 103 falsely accused parents ( 4 females and 99 males ) .
There were 67 parents in a custody control group ( 31 females and 36 males ) .
The mean age of the accusing females was 33.5 ; the falsely accused females 33.0 ; and the custody only females 32.8 .
The mean age of the accusing males was 36.3 ; the falsely accused males 36.9 , and the custody only males 34.6 .
Procedure
The available information was carefully reviewed and a diagnosis was assigned to the person on the basis of the information .
The amount of information varied from case to case .
In some of the files , the persons had been interviewed and given multiple psychological tests by two or three evaluators .
In a few , the only information was a letter from a therapist or physician giving observations or opinions about the person but not a formal diagnostic statement .
However , most of the files included reports of clinical interviews and testing .
When the diagnosis was given by the evaluator , this was used .
In the instances where an actual diagnosis was not given by the evaluator , we selected a diagnosis on the basis of the information in the file .
We also compared MMPI profiles in the subjects who had MMPIs in the files .
Both of us reviewed the psychological data and assigned diagnoses when they were lacking .
When we disagreed , we discussed the case until we reached consensus .
However , there was initial disagreement on only a few of the cases because the information in the file was generally detailed enough to arrive at a diagnosis with a reasonable degree of confidence .
The subjects were then classified according to the diagnoses .
We combined persons who were given an adjustment reaction diagnosis and persons who were seen as psychologically healthy or " normal " for whom no psychiatric diagnosis was warranted .
We did this for two reasons : First , the adjustment reaction diagnosis was made in terms of the person 's reaction to the custody and divorce situation rather in terms of any preexisting problems .
Second , an adjustment disorder diagnosis is sometimes used to meet the third party payment requirement for persons who would otherwise not be given a diagnosis .
For each of the three groups , we first compared the diagnoses from our psychological evaluations to those made on the basis of information and conclusions from other professionals .
We did this to ensure that our results would not be affected by a tendency for us to assess persons in the three groups differently than would the other professionals .
This was important in that the proportions in each group evaluated by us compared to other professionals was different for each group .
We evaluated 75 % of the custody control group , 20 % of the accusing parents , and 70 % of the falsely accused parents .
A Chi square indicated no significant differences .
Therefore , we then compared the groups
Some information on the actual MMPI profiles was available for 62 of the custody only , 44 of the accusing , and 95 of the accused parents .
In most of these , we had the actual profile ; in a few we only had specific information about profile validity .
We used the available information to compare the groups on the validity scales and the basic clinical scales .
In addition to comparing mean MMPI profiles for our three groups , we compared them to two samples from the MMPI - 2 restandardization project : a normal sample of 773 married or cohabiting pairs and a sample of 150 couples in marriage counseling ( Hjemboe & Butcher , 1990 ) .
Although this data was collected on the MMPI - 2 , the mean raw scores were converted to the original MMPI K - corrected T - score values with Appendix K of the MMPI - 2 Manual .

Compared to the custody only , the falsely accusing females were significantly more likely to have a personality disorder diagnosis , 72 % as compared to 32 %
Only two persons in each group were given a diagnosis other than one of the personality disorders  in each case it was an alcohol use disorder ( one was also diagnosed as dysthymia ) .
The four falsely accusing males were all diagnosed as having personality disorders .
Table 2 shows the diagnoses given to the falsely accused males compared to the custody only males :

There was no significant difference between the falsely accused males and the custody only males .
In both groups most of the persons ( 69 % ) were seen as having no psychopathology while a much smaller proportion ( 27 % and 19 % ) were diagnosed with personality disorders .
Only a few persons were given other diagnoses .
In the two groups combined , there were five persons who were diagnosed as neurotic depression , two alcohol use disorder , and one bipolar disorder .
The four women in the falsely accused group were all psychologically normal .
The 31 females and 36 males in the custody only group were then compared to each other and there were no significant differences between them ( X2 [ 2 , N = 67 ] = 3.48 , p < .20 >.10 .
Therefore , we then combined males and females and compared all three groups in Table 3 :

Three - fourths of the falsely accusing parents were given diagnoses of personality disorder while only one - fourth were seen as normal .
In comparison , only one - fourth of the individuals in the falsely accused group and the custody control group had personality disorders and most ( 70 % and 66 % ) were seen as normal .
The most frequent personality disorder diagnosis for all three groups was mixed or unspecified .
This is a diagnosis given when a person does not meet the criteria for one specific personality disorder .
For the accusing parents , 24 of the 53 with personality disorders were given this diagnosis .
Within the unspecified personality disorder category , 11 of the 24 persons had histrionic personality features .
The other personality disorders for the accusing parents were histrionic ( 7 ) , dependent ( 6 ) , borderline ( 5 ) , passive - aggressive ( 5 ) , paranoid ( 5 ) , and explosive ( 1 ) .
For the custody only parents , 8 of the 17 with personality disorders were diagnosed as unspecified .
The remaining 9 were distributed fairly evenly among other personality disorders .
For the falsely accused parents , 11 of the 27 with personality disorders were diagnosed as unspecified .
The others were passive - dependent ( 7 ) , passive - aggressive ( 4 ) , anti-social ( 2 ) , schizoid ( 1 ) , compulsive ( 1 ) , and narcissistic ( 1 ) .
MMPIs
Some information on MMPI scores was available for 44 of the accusing , 95 of the accused , and 62 of the custody only parents .
We had scores on some or all of the scales for 29 of the accusing , 83 of the accused , and 59 of the custody only parents .
We compared the raw scores of the custody females to the accusing females and the custody males to the accused males .
Many of the individual MMPIs in all three groups were responded to with mild to severe defensiveness , often to the point of being technically invalid .
Using a criteria for invalidity of K ³ 70 , F ³ 70 , and / or F - K ³ - 22 , 30 % of 44 MMPIs in the accusing group , 15 % of 95 MMPIs in the accused group , and 13 % of 62 MMPIs in the custody groups were technically invalid .
( These figures also include cases in which a report did not include actual MMPI scores , but stated that the MMPI was either valid or was invalid because of severe defensiveness . )
The raw scores , standard deviations , and t values for the comparisons for the accusing versus custody females are shown in Table 4 and for the comparisons for the accused versus custody males in Table 5 .
The mean profiles for all three groups were within normal limits .
The accusing females responded more defensively than did the custody females .
Their L and K scales were higher , and their F scale was lower than for the custody only females .
This reached statistical significance on F and F-K .
There was no significant difference in defensiveness between the custody only males and the accused males as indicated by the validity scales .
On the clinical scales , the accused group was significantly higher on scale 3 .

The mean K - corrected T scales for our falsely accusing females and custody females are plotted along with the female marriage counseling sample and the normal sample of married or cohabiting females from the MMPI - 2 restandardization project ( Hjemboe & Butcher , 1990 ) in Figure 1 .
The mean K - corrected T scales for our falsely accused males and custody males are plotted along with the male marriage counseling sample and the normal sample of married or cohabiting males from the MMPI - 2 restandardization project are plotted in Figure 2 .

The shape of the K - corrected mean MMPI profiles of our female samples are similar to those of the samples of the marital counselees and the normal samples from Hjemboe and Butcher ( 1990 ) but the marital counselees had higher elevations than did the other three groups .
Our samples , however , were more defensive .
This is particularly evident in looking at the profile of the falsely accusing females , whose validity scales show the " check mark " shape characteristic of defensive profiles .
This check mark shape is not found in the other groups .
For the males , the marital counselees also had higher elevations than the other three groups .
Our custody only and falsely accused samples were more defensive than the Hjemboe and Butcher samples .
However , the " check mark " found in the falsely accusing females is not present for any of the other groups .
Discussion
Falsely accusing parents were much more likely to have a personality disorder , such as histrionic , borderline , passive - aggressive , paranoid , or unspecified .
Only one - fourth were seen as having no psychopathology .
In comparison , most of the individuals in the custody control group and the accused group were assessed as normal .
Of the personality disorders in the falsely accusing parents , roughly one - third were histrionic personality or unspecified personality disorder with histrionic features .
The mean MMPIs of the three groups did not reflect these differences in diagnoses .
The high degree of defensiveness on the MMPIs , particularly in the accusing parents ' group , meant that many of the MMPIs could not be used to reach conclusions about psychopathology .
A defensive response set is not unusual in persons taking the MMPI as part of a court evaluation or custody evaluation .
Graham ( 1988 ) reports that a typical K , depending upon education , is a T score of 60 ( corresponding to a raw score of 17 or 18 ) .
He states that , in fact , if K is low in a custody evaluation , this is a cause for concern .
The accusing parents in this study , however , responded more defensively than did the other two groups .
Another reason that the personality disorders of the accusing group were not reflected on their mean MMPIs is that , although personality disorders are relatively common , they are difficult to define and patients who have them present with a wide variety of different behaviors .
This is true even within a given personality disorder ( i.e. , borderline , histrionic , paranoid ) .
This means that there may be different codetypes found in a given personality disorder .
This is especially true of the histrionic personality .
Morey and Smith , ( 1988 ) report that the MMPI has had little success in identifying histrionic personality because the distribution of codetypes for this disorder is widely scattered .
In addition , mean codetypes do not necessarily reflect the distribution of codetypes in a particular sample .
The group means often obscure meaningful elevations patterns in that the high and low scales can be canceled out in the averaging .
For example , an individual who was high on scales 2 and 7 but low on 4 and 9 would cancel out a second individual who was high on 4 and 9 but low on 2 and 7 .
However , the more defensive response pattern found in the validity scales in our falsely accusing group is important .
These people had no more reason to try to look good on the test than did those in our other two groups .
They would have had less motivation to " fake good " than would the parents who were falsely accused of sexual abuse , some of whom undoubtedly believed that " a good score " on the MMPI might exonerate them and keep them from prison .
Therefore , the defensive MMPIs of the falsely accusing parents may well be reflecting something more than a defensive response set .
The personality patterns of many of these people may include poor insight , rigidity , and a tendency to deny shortcomings .
Social desirability is a major source of variance in the MMPI .
The extent to which a person is sensitive to and concerned about the impression made on other people reflects important personality characteristics of the individual .
Those showing excessive social desirability response sets are " self - centered and overly preoccupied with the social image they create ; these individuals tend to be hysteroid , paranoid , or socially insecure .
. . .
These test - taking attitudes can , then , be better understood as part of a subject 's general personality structure " ( Dahlstrom , Welsh & Dahlstrom , 1975 , p. 138 ) .
The finding of a significantly greater defensiveness on the mean F - K index for the group developing false accusations fits into the finding of a much higher proportion of personality disorders in the group of false accusers .
The MMPI research on validity scale configurations therefore supports the finding of a high level of pathological personality characteristics in those who are involved in fabricating false accusations of sexual abuse during a divorce / custody conflict .
Could the stress of becoming convinced that one 's child was being sexually abused in the face of disbelief by the justice system have caused the accusing parents to develop a personality disorder ?
This is unlikely for several reasons .
First , in about one - fourth of the cases the psychological information was collected before the abuse allegations were made .
There were no differences in the proportion of psychopathology in these cases compared to the ones where the information was obtained afterwards .
Second , in almost all of the cases , at the point at which the information was gathered the allegations were believed and supported .
The accused parent 's visitation was terminated or greatly restricted and he was often facing criminal charges .
Third , whatever stresses are created by believing one 's child is being sexually abused are matched by the stress of being falsely accused of child sexual abuse ( Schultz , 1989 ; Underwager , Clauss , & Wakefield , 1990 ) .
The information we have from the accused parents is that they often suffered tremendous anxiety and depression as a result of being falsely accused .
Fourth , the personality disorder diagnosis indicates a stable , long - lasting and pervasive personality pattern which is unlikely to develop as a result of a stressful situation .
Although personality disorders are exacerbated by stress , they are not created by a stressful incident .
Personality disorders are difficult and frequently misunderstood , but at the same time relatively common ( Fleming & Pretzer , 1990 ) .
Individuals with personality disorders have personality characteristics which cause distress and impairment in daily functioning .
The DSM - III -R ( American Psychiatric Association , 1987 ) defines personality disorders as " enduring patterns of perceiving , relating to , and thinking about the environment and oneself " which " are exhibited in a wide range of important social and personal contexts " ( p. 335 ) .
Such persons are likely to misperceive the behavior of others and to react to stressful situations in maladaptive ways .
Depending upon the specific personality disorder , they are characterized by instability of mood , impulsivity , inappropriate emotional overreactions , a need for approval and attention , and difficulties handling anger and conflict .
Several of the falsely accusing persons ' level of dysfunction was extremely serious , sometimes to the point of losing contact with reality .
Some believed they had rare spiritual powers and / or delusions concerning religion .
One woman planned on traveling to Rome to marry the Pope ; the records of another stated that she had gone to Switzerland to marry Christ .
One woman , a psychotherapist , believed that she had exceptional empathic powers that allowed her to sense who among her adult clients had been sexually abused as children .
Several were described as being highly unstable and unpredictable , displaying hysterical and bizarre behaviors , and sometimes failing to distinguish between fact and fantasy .
The women with histrionic personality diagnoses were described as displaying manipulative , flamboyant , coquettish , or exhibitionistic behavior and being preoccupied with appearance and attractiveness , along with having a tendency to distort events .
Several women were described as having symbiotic relationships with their children and a two were diagnosed as having developed a folie â deux relationship with an older child , who also came to share the beliefs about the abuse .
In several of the cases , the behaviors Gardner has described as the " parental alienation syndrome " ( 1987 ) were evident .
In such cases the child accepted and internalized an irrational hatred of the father in the absence of any convincing evidence for such hatred .
The falsely accusing parents were sometimes so obsessed with anger towards their estranged spouse that this became a major focus in their lives .
Such persons were often described by the evaluators as being oppositional , hostile , negative , and resistant in the evaluation and concern is expressed that the anger towards the former spouse supersedes the needs of the child .
One woman made frequent calls to her husband 's job , alleging that he was a pervert and a thief and should be fired .
She also tried to run down her husband 's attorney with her car .
Another called our office to tell us that her husband was a deadbeat and would not pay his bill with us .
She also accused him of being involved in the Scott County sex ring , an accusation that was simply impossible as the man was out of the country at the time .
Such women fit Ross and Blush 's ( 1990 ) " justified vindicator " that was described earlier .
Several of the women remained obsessed with the suspicion that their former spouse was sexually abusing the child , even after the case was dismissed or judged to be false .
Some took their young child for multiple physical and psychological examinations and made repeated accusations of abuse to child protection .
A few regularly examined the genitals of the child following visits .
Some had been questioning the children about possible sexual abuse for years .
A few , when the case was not substantiated , moved to another county and started the accusations over , continuing this pattern until a child protection worker was found who substantiated the accusation .
One woman arranged for a television station to interview her so she could publicly accuse her husband of sexually abusing their child .
This included a videotape of the child .
Two disappeared with their children after the court ruled that there was no abuse and ordered visitation with the father be resumed .
What about the four men who made false accusations ?
Although we cannot generalize from a sample of only four , these men appear to be quite similar to the falsely accusing women .
One ( unspecified personality disorder ) was described by the evaluator as extremely defensive , angry , hostile , hypervigilant , and lacking in accurate perception of others .
Another ( dependent personality disorder ) was described as a docile and passive man who had a chronic behavior pattern of developing dependent relationships .
A third ( unspecified personality disorder ) was seen to have characterlogical tendencies to be guarded and defensive and to deny and repress his considerable anger , suspicion , and hostility .
The fourth ( paranoid personality disorder ) had gone through seven attorneys  they all kept dropping him because of his manipulative , angry , suspicious , and hostile behavior .
In addition to accusing the teenaged son of his former wife 's roommate of sexual abuse , he accused his present wife of physically abusing their new baby .
In an acrimonious custody conflict , such persons may be primed to assume the worst about their estranged spouse and to jump to conclusions when presented with minimal data .
Any suspicious circumstances may lead to suggestive interviews and reinforcement of a young child , and statements about abuse may be unknowingly molded and developed .
The individual with a personality disorder , involved in a difficult and stressful divorce , may be more likely to misinterpret , overreact , and come to a false conclusion .
But the parent making the accusation does not have to be histrionic , paranoid , or vindictive .
Even normal individuals , in the midst of an angry dispute over custody , may be ready to believe that their spouse has sexually abused their children .
Some parents may be influenced by the campaigns about child abuse to make false accusations based on misperceptions and false assumptions .
They may then take their child to a mental health professional who interviews the child with anatomical dolls and assures them that the abuse is real .
They may be told that a physical examination " proves " sexual abuse .
A social worker may threaten to place their child in foster care if they do n't believe that the abuse really happened .
And once an accusation is made , it becomes extremely difficult to retract even when new evidence is presented .
In most of the cases we have reviewed , the allegations do not appear to be deliberate fabrications made for the purpose of obtaining custody .
Instead , the publicity about sexual abuse , the frequent publication of the so - called " behavioral indicators , " and the proliferation of prevention programs has resulted in many people becoming hypersensitive to the possibility of abuse and unwittingly participating in the development of a false allegation .
What about the men ( and four women ) who were falsely accused of sexually abusing their children ?
These falsely accused parents appear to be relatively ordinary persons .
Ross and Blush ( 1990 ) describe the men they have seen as unremarkable .
They may be may be nurturing and passive and unlikely to be socially aggressive or competitive .
Those with personality disorders are likely to be diagnosed as passive - dependent or passive - aggressive .
The accused men's slightly higher elevation on scale 3 also suggests passivity along with a lack of insight into their personal relationships .
Some of these men , by virtue of their sensitivity and caring , may be vulnerable to involvement with needy women .
Once involved , they may behave somewhat passively as they continue to hope that all will work out .

The behaviors , statements , and often the written material in the files we reviewed show an emotion which , though known to all of us , is not often dealt with by psychologists  hatred .
As we worked with this material it became evident that psychology as a science has little or nothing to say about hatred .
Nosologies of pathology have no classification for hatred .
We know of no psychological literature describing hatred , studying it , or doing a research project on it .
There is a large amount of material on anger but anger is not synonymous with hatred .
This lack of interest in hatred as a psychological concept is surprising insofar as hatred is the obverse of love and there is a high level of interest in love among psychologists .
Hatred has surely been known by thoughtful persons for centuries to be closely connected to love .
Love and hatred are intertwined in a complex and little understood fashion .
In secular Greek literature from approximately Homeric times , the harpist Habrotonon says " It seemed as though he loved me , but he hates me with a divine hatred " ( Kittel , 1967 , V. 4 , p. 683 ) .
In Hebrew literature ( Old Testament ) very often a man hates or is tired of the wife he has lived with for years ( Gn. 29:31 , 33 ; Dt. 21:15 ; 22:13 , 16 ; 24:3 ; Ju. 14:16 ; 15:2 ; Sir. 42:9 ; Is. 54:6 ; 60:15 ) .
" Then Ammon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her " ( 2 S. 13:15 ) .
There may well be an effect of a failed marriage , which of necessity must be a failure of dreams , visions , aspirations , and hopes , that generates the intensity of emotion and level of hostility that can only be seen as hatred .
However , hatred is not likely to show up on the MMPI , the Rorschach , a sentence completion form , or even in a clinical interview .
Psychologists who are more accustomed to anger may simply miss the pervasive , passionate , and driving force of hatred .
Nevertheless , in our data hatred appears as a construct and an emotion that may well have a determining effect on behavior to produce false accusations .
Hatred is not necessarily pathology .
It may be ethically constrained and valued negatively , but it does not imply lack of contact with reality , neuroticism , or a defect in character .
Normal people may be moved to hatred .
It may be that clinging to hatred across time produces self - defeating behavior and pathology , an insight found across all ages and cultures , but the experience of hatred is not confined to disturbed or disordered individuals .
The role played by hatred in the development of false accusations of child sexual abuse may be significant and powerful , cutting across all classifications and groupings that appear in the data .
As yet , there is no satisfactory way to measure or assess the construct of hatred .
Ross and Blush ( 1990 ) note that the trend in society to accept and to " decriminalize " divorce by enacting no fault divorce may have contributed to this .
The removal of the social stigma and the sense of moral wrong from the divorce process eliminated the forum whereby persons could prove their case against a spouse whom they believed had done them wrong .
The absence of this increased the unfinished business between divorcing persons .
The sense of unfinished business along with the desire to be vindicated is likely to fuel the hostility and hatred and contribute to the increase in false claims of sexual abuse in divorce and custody disputes .
A Suggested Typology
On the basis of our data , there appear to be four overlapping categories of parents who make or encourage false accusations of sexual abuse in divorce and custody battles :
1 ) The highly disturbed individual whose personality disorder interferes with her functioning , judgment , and sometimes her ability to differentiate between fact and fantasy .
Such individuals often have a history of psychiatric involvement and unstable relationships .
They are seen as unstable , moody , impulsive , and overreactive .
Under the stress of the divorce , they are apt to overreact and misinterpret events and jump to conclusions about abuse .
The personality disorder " comprises those stable and consistent traits that persist inflexibly , are exhibited inappropriately , and foster vicious circles that perpetuate and intensify already present difficulties " ( Millon , 1981 , p. 23 ) .
2 ) The individual ( who may or may not have a personality disorder ) who is obsessed with hatred and hostility towards her estranged or former spouse .
She tries to do whatever she can to hurt him , and their child becomes a pawn in the ongoing battle .
She may call his friends , employer , or relatives to try to win them over to her side and hurt him .
The welfare of her child is secondary to the battle with the despised former spouse .
The parental alienation syndrome is found here .
3 ) The individual who is obsessed over the possibility that her child has been or may be sexually abused .
She may have been sexually abused or raped herself or she may have just overreacted to the media attention to abuse .
In either case she is now hypervigilant about the possibility of this happening to her child .
She may question the child repeatedly , examine her genitals following visits , and take the child to doctor after doctor .
In one case , the woman 's suspicions began when the father gave his daughter , then under a year old , a bath .
The woman was convinced that his desire to bathe his baby daughter meant he had prurient and perverted interests in her .
4 ) The individual who reacts fairly appropriately to an ambiguous situation by seeking guidance from therapist or physician .
The child may report that she has bathed with her father and touched his penis or she may make a confused statement which sounds suspicious .
The woman , not wanting to handle this by herself , calls a professional .
Sometimes , when there is no abuse , the situation is clarified and eventually concluded .
But the professional may come to premature closure and tell the woman that her child has obviously been sexually abused .
She is told that she must believe that the abuse is real , visitation with the father is cut off , the child is placed into play or group therapy for the abuse and the story is supported and encouraged .
By the time the family has been involved in the system for several months it may become extremely difficult to sort out the truth .
In this fourth type , the woman herself may be a victim of the system along with the accused and the child .
Conclusions
The increasing frequency of accusations of sexual abuse in contested divorce and custody cases means that professionals must be very cautious .
It is necessary to remain open and objective , guard against a presumption of guilt , and resist aligning oneself with the reporting parent 's agenda .
Unfortunately , some professionals are ready to come to premature closure with minimal information and leap to the conviction that a child has been abused .
Klajner - Diamond , Wehrspann and Steinhauer ( 1987 ) say one of the four factors of adult influence suggesting a false accusation is a professional committed prematurely to the truth of the allegation .
Blush and Ross ( 1990 ) observe that false cases are characterized by a loss of control early on when professionals decide that abuse is real before doing a careful investigation .
If a mistake is made and a false accusation is judged to be true , two people are hurt  the child and the accused .
The nonabused child has been subjected to a process of interrogation and often to sexual abuse therapy that is confusing and potentially iatrogenic .
The falsely accused adult is likely to suffer emotional and physical trauma , family breakdown , and economic hardship ( Schultz , 1989 ) .
His relationship with his child may be irretrievably damaged .
All professionals should learn possible indicators of a false accusation of child sexual abuse .
When there are factors understood to be associated with a false accusation , the possibility should be examined and considered .
There are increasing conceptualizations of indicators of false accounts , reports in the literature , and some research projects beginning to collect empirical data ( Benedek & Schetky , 1985a ; Berliner , 1988 ; Blush & Ross , 1990 ; Bresee et al. , 1986 ; de Young , 1986 : Faller , 1988 ; Gardner , 1987a & b ; Jones & McGraw , 1987 ; Klajner - Diamond , Wehrspann , & Steinhauer , 1987 ; Kohnken & Wegener , 1982 ; Mantell , 1988 ; Paradise , Rostain , & Nathanson , 1988 ; Quinn , 1988 ; Raskin & Esplin , in press ; Raskin & Yuille , 1989 ; Rogers , 1990 ; Ross & Blush , 1990 ; Schetky & Green , 1988 ; Sink , 1988 a & b ; Steller , Raskin , & Yuille , undated ; Wakefield & Underwager , 1988 ; Wehrspann , Steinhauer , & Klajner - Diamond , 1987 ; Yates , 1988 ) .
These efforts should be supported and encouraged and the results carefully and responsibly examined .
The personality characteristics of the parties involved when accusations of sexual abuse surface in a bitter divorce and custody should be considered in evaluating the allegations .
In the absence of corroborating evidence , when the parent making the accusation is disturbed and the accused is psychologically normal , a false accusation should be considered .

I met my buddy , Kirker , about 7 years ago and pretty early on I learned he was from Kentucky .
My initial response was something charming like , " What actually happens there ?
That 's like one of those states that does n't really have anything going on , right ? "
Kirker immediately defended Kentucky touting bourbon - making , the Kentucky derby , etc .
I said , " Fine .
We 'll go to the Kentucky tourism website .
If there 's a picture of hot air balloons within ONE CLICK , you 're giving me a hand - job . "
( This , of course , based on my scientific theory that when a state has nothing going on it shows pictures of hot air balloons .
Coupled with my theory that it 's funny to bet hand - jobs with people you just met . )
Not only was I right , I did n't even have to click .
There were hot air balloons right on the homepage .
Thanks , Kentucky !
If I could , I 'd buy you all a new banjo .
( And Kirker , you still owe me that hand - job . )
What 's nice about this theory is that as states update their tourism websites , they can fall in and out of suckfullness .
So while Kentucky is n't one click away from hot air balloons right now , here are a few states that are currently shitty :
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Gang violence is spreading out from the Vancouver region into the B.C. Interior , including smaller towns such as Fort St. John , one of the province 's top cops said Thursday .
RCMP Assistant Commissioner Al Macintyre , who is in charge of B.C. criminal operations , warned the House of Commons justice committee that the number of homicides this year could reach record levels if the current trend continues .
There were 138 murders in the province last year Macintyre told the committee , which held hearings in Vancouver , at the heart of an area that 's been described as Canada 's " gang capital , " and where a gang war has seen dozens of shootings .
Of the 138 murders across the province last year , Macintyre said 55 were tied to organized crime or gangs .
There have been 34 killings so far this year up to March 27 , with 13 of the victims having confirmed organized - crime ties , he said .
There have been 21 confirmed shooting deaths in the Vancouver area since mid-January , though not all have been conclusively tied to gangs .
Macintyre was among a squad of senior officers from the Vancouver area who told the justice committee that police and prosecutors need the legal cuffs removed to help suppress the province 's burgeoning organized - crime influence .
Among other things , police want it to be easier to obtain and amend wiretap warrants and relief from onerous pre-trial evidence disclosure requirements they say take up resources better used to fight crime .
The committee is getting feedback on the Conservative government 's anti-gang and anti-drug legislation , which would toughen sentences for gang - related violence and impose mandatory minimum sentences for some drug crimes .
Macintyre and his colleagues gave the committee a picture of police facing increasingly sophisticated gangsters , backed by crooked accountants who help them hide their money and lawyers who keep them out of jail .
" Their structures are flexible , their skills diverse and sophisticated , while their knowledge about how to defeat the criminal laws is escalating , " he said .
Macintyre defended police efforts to combat organized crime after a prominent criminologist told the committee organized crime has been allowed to grow for the last 10 years , largely uninterrupted .
Rob Gordon , director of the criminology department at Simon Fraser University , said a succession of police organized - crime agencies have been set up , knocked down and revamped since the late 1990s .
The strategy over the last decade boils down to " periodic forays to target particular groups , often resulting in successful but temporary disruptions to the industry , " said Gordon .
While these operations create a media splash , he said , they also drive up the street prices of drugs , meaning higher profits to suppliers , and higher levels of property crime as addicts steal to support their habits .
Gordon said the current array of police organized crime groups work too much in isolation .
He called on the B.C. government to push ahead with setting up a regional police force for the Vancouver area , which would put organized - crime investigation under a single command .
But Macintyre rejected the idea , saying municipalities like the current setup of RCMP and municipal forces , which adds up to a regional policing model .
" We 've heard from the communities that we police , from the mayors of Burnaby and Langley and Surrey to name just a few , that the model of policing where they police locally but do the expensive , the complicated stuff on a regional basis is the model for them , " he said .
Gordon said the B.C. government should override local objections .
" We 're the last large metropolitan area in Canada not to be policed by a single police service , " he said .
Time Warner Cable Expands Metered Billing
Rochester , Austin , Greensboro and San Antonio ...
Back in January of 2008 we were the very first to report that Time Warner Cable was conducting a trial in their Beaumont , Texas market that imposed caps ranging from 5GB to 40 GB on the company 's existing tiers of service .
More controversial perhaps was the news that trial participants would be charged $ 1 per every additional gigabyte consumed , a huge markup for Time Warner Cable over cost , and a first for a major US ISP .
Back in February , Time Warner Cable told us they'd be expanding this project into four additional markets , and that they'd be raising the limits on some of the trial caps in response to user complaints .
This morning Time Warner Cable gave Business
Week an exclusive scoop , informing them that the four markets will be Rochester , NY , Austin and San Antonio , Texas , and Greensboro , North Carolina .
Business
Week even gets exclusive face time with CEO Glenn Britt , so the cable boss can frame the decision to overbill you just the way he'd like it :
quote : " We need a viable model to be able to support the infrastructure of the broadband business , " Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt says in an interview .
" We made a mistake early on by not defining our business based on the consumption dimension . "
As usual , Britt tries to suggest that Time Warner Cable 's existing flat - rate pricing model is n't " viable " enough to fund essential infrastructure upgrades .
That 's simply not the case .
The company has been very profitable under the flat - rate model , and they 've consistently found creative new ways to generate additional income , such as with DNS redirection advertising , which creates a revenue stream out of your URL typing mistakes .
In reality , Britt is pursuing metered billing because it gives him a way to monetize and / or control Internet video , which poses a very serious long term threat to his cable television revenues .
The pressure to shift to metered billing also comes from investors , who obviously love the idea of charging consumers more money for the same ( or less ) service in an age where the cost of bandwidth and network hardware continues to drop .
Keep in mind that Time Warner Cable has yet to officially announce DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades in a single market .
Where the trials go from here is n't exactly clear .
Judging from the Business Week report , Time Warner has yet to increase the highest 40 GB cap in these trial markets ; a ridiculous decision for any carrier in the age of HD video delivery -- much less one that 's facing growing competition from TelcoTV alternatives .
" Rest assured that there will be a super - tier at approximately 100GB , " a company spokesman tells me .
The question remains : will metered billing only be something Time Warner Cable imposes on less competitive markets , where limited choices mean consumers can't vote with their wallets ?
Or do company executives really think they can bring 40 GB ( or even 100 GB ) caps to bear in markets where they compete with uncapped ( so far ) and speedier Verizon FiOS ?
So far they 're avoiding " big red " markets like the plague .
All five of these trial markets have limited or no FiOS availability .
Rochester is home to financially - troubled Frontier , who ( judging from posts to our forums ) can barely offer consumers more than 3 Mbps , and has been exploring 5 GB caps .
The other Time Warner Cable trial markets are in AT&T territory .
AT&T is also testing metered billing , imposing caps from 20 to 150GB in two trial markets , charging customers $ 1 per gigabyte in overage fees .
And there 's the rub : a national migration from flat rate to metered billing will only succeed if carriers work together to institute obnoxiously low caps and painfully expensive overage fees .
Otherwise , the un-metered competitor in a metered market can highlight how Time Warner Cable , Frontier or AT&T is being a cheapskate , charging users an insanely high markup on bandwidth over cost .
Of course , if you do n't have many other viable competitors ( and change the laws to keep it that way ) , you can do , well , whatever the hell you 'd like .
In markets where competitors are n't playing along with the idea , or the carrier faces pressure from municipal fiber builds , Time Warner Cable 's decision could border on seppuku .
ROME ( Reuters ) - A vending machine that bakes fresh pizza in minutes for a few euros has got Italian chefs in a whirl before it hits the streets in the coming weeks .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The bright - red “ Let ’s Pizza ” machine uses infra-red rays and technology developed at the University of Bologna to knead flour and water into dough , spread it with tomato sauce and a choice of topping , and cook it -- all in less than three minutes .
Its developer , Claudio Torghele , says the machine has proved popular in trials in two Italian regions , but gourmets say it is an affront to traditional methods of cooking the classic dish .
“ This is not just a vending machine , it ’s a mini- pizzeria , ” said Torghele , 56 .
“ It has windows where you can watch the pizza - making process .
Kids , including my own , love it : when the machine is working , there ’s always a crowd . ”
The device was developed with help from Anglo - Dutch group Unilever , which tested it in Germany , Torghele said .
He hopes to launch the machines across Europe and in the United States , with ingredients varying according to local tastes .
At present it offers four toppings -- cheese and tomato , bacon , ham and fresh vegetables -- at an average cost of 4 euros ( 3.7 pounds ) .
Torghele thinks “ Let ’s Pizza ” will appeal to Europeans looking for cheap options as a recession hits their pockets .
“ If I want to eat a great pizza , I go to a pizzeria .
But our product is satisfactory , low cost and available 24 - hours a day , ” he said .
“ This is crisis proof ... McDonald ’s is increasing its sales .
Low cost , fast food is in demand . ”
Italy is famed for its cuisine and has seen a movement develop against fast food , called “ Slow Food . ”
But it has more vending machines than any other country in Europe , according to an industry body , mostly doling out hot coffee drinks .
Purists say the Italian pizza -- invented in the 18th century in the southern city of Naples -- cannot be rushed : the dough must be mixed and left for 12 hours , the ingredients kept fresh , and the oven pre-heated to around 300 degrees .
“ This machine is a toy , ” Pino Morelli of the Association of Italian Pizzerias said .
“ Perhaps it will find a niche overseas , but Italians are born with pizza : their mothers feed it to them as babies .
They understand it . ”
In Pizzeria Brandi , nestling near the centre of ramshackle Naples , the reaction to Torghele ’s invention was cool .
The restaurant invented the pizza Margherita in 1889 in honour of the queen of the newly unified country , its tomato , mozzarella and basil toppings mimicking Italy ’s flag .
“ Unfortunately , today people invent many things , but you ca n’t make any comparison , especially in terms of quality , ” said chef Marcello , taking a break from sliding pizzas on a wooden pole into the dome - shaped oven .
“ The only benefit is the price . ”
“ We should scrap this ‘ pizza machine ’ and bring back the old jukeboxes : at least they were charming , ” said Paolo Pagnani , who owns the historic restaurant .
The Government suffered a shock defeat in the Commons today when a Liberal Democrat bid to scrap new settlement rules for Gurkha veterans was backed by a majority of 21 .
Voting for the motion to allow all Gurkhas equal residence rights was 267 to 246 - amid shouts of " resign " from the Opposition benches .
It was the first major reverse for Gordon Brown since he became Prime Minister but has no legally binding effect on Government policy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Facing a backbench revolt , the Government came up with two concessions to try to stave off defeat .
Firstly , the Prime Minister repeatedly promised a review of the criteria - now expected to start before the July recess .
And Home Secretary Jacqui Smith followed this up with a letter to leading Labour critic Martin Salter pledging no deportation of Gurkha soldiers .
Mr Salter ( Reading W ) swiftly hailed the move as evidence that last Friday 's announcement of new settlement guidelines was not the Government 's " final word " on the issue .
But in a crucial Commons vote , and with actress and pro-Gurkha rights campaigner Joanna Lumley watching from the public gallery , the Liberal Democrat move to extend equal rights of residence to all Gurkhas was carried .
Dozens of Labour rebels had signed up to an amendment to the Lib Dem motion also demanding the " restrictive , morally wrong and offensive " guidelines were scrapped .
BrowserCouch Documentation
BrowserCouch is an attempt at an in - browser MapReduce implementation .
It 's written entirely in JavaScript and intended to work on all browsers , gracefully upgrading when support for better efficiency or feature set is detected .
Not coincidentally , this library is intended to mimic the functionality of CouchDB on the client - side , and may even support integration with CouchDB in the future .
Why ?
This prototype is intended as a response to Vladimir Vuki��evi�� 's blog post entitled HTML5 Web Storage and SQL .
A CouchDB - like API seems like a nice solution to persistent storage on the Web because so many of its semantics are delegated out to the JavaScript language , which makes it potentially easy to standardize .
Furthermore , the MapReduce paradigm also naturally takes advantage of multiple processor cores — something that is increasingly common in today 's computing devices .
Things to do
To learn how to use BrowserCouch , check out the work - in - progress tutorial .
Aside from that , you can run the test suite and the semi- large data set test , though they 're not particularly exciting .
In the future , we 'd like to make CouchDB 's Futon client work entirely using BrowserCouch as its backend instead of a CouchDB server , but that 's a ways away .
If you 'd like to see more code samples of what the BrowserCouch API currently looks like , check out the annotated source code for the test suite .
You can also read the primary source code documentation for more on BrowserCouch 's implementation .

Hi everyone !
This month I have another nice list of physics video lectures .
This is the 8th post about physics videos .
See the first seven here : 1 Have fun with these and until next time !
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British media regulator Ofcom has fined Playboy TV 22,500 pounds ( $ 32,990 ) for airing sexually explicit images in breach of broadcasting rules .
It said on Thursday the free - to - air channel Playboy One had broadcast unencrypted raunchy , and what the watchdog deemed offensive , material until September 2008 .
Ofcom had received five complaints relating to seven late night programs broadcast between September and December 2007 .
Shows investigated included : “ Sexy Girls Next Door , ” “ Sexy Urban Legends ” and “ Adult Stars Close - up . ”
“ Depending on the individual breach , the explicitness , strength and , or , sustained nature of the sexual content and language was unacceptable for broadcast on an unencrypted free - to - air channel , ” Ofcom ruled .
It said Playboy TV UK / Benelux Ltd had failed to ensure adequate protection for viewers from “ potentially harmful or offensive material . ”
HILLARY CLINTON'S most effective quip , in her long struggle with Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination last year , was that the Oval Office is no place for on - the - job training .
It went to the heart of the nagging worry about the silver - tongued young senator from Illinois : that he lacked even the slightest executive experience , and that in his brief career he had never really stood up to powerful interests , whether in his home city of Chicago or in the wider world .
Might Mrs Clinton have been right about her foe ?
Not altogether .
In foreign policy in particular Mr Obama has already done some commendable things .
He has held out a sincere hand to Iran ; he has ordered Guantánamo closed within a year ; he has set himself firmly against torture .
He has , as the world and this newspaper wanted , taken a less strident tone in dealing with friends and rivals alike .
But at home Mr Obama has had a difficult start .
His performance has been weaker than those who endorsed his candidacy , including this newspaper , had hoped .
Many of his strongest supporters — liberal columnists , prominent donors , Democratic Party stalwarts — have started to question him .
As for those not so beholden , polls show that independent voters again prefer Republicans to Democrats , a startling reversal of fortune in just a few weeks .
Mr Obama 's once - celestial approval ratings are about where George Bush 's were at this stage in his awful presidency .
Despite his resounding electoral victory , his solid majorities in both chambers of Congress and the obvious goodwill of the bulk of the electorate , Mr Obama has seemed curiously feeble .
Empty posts , weak policies
There are two main reasons for this .
The first is Mr Obama 's failure to grapple as fast and as single - mindedly with the economy as he should have done .
His stimulus package , though huge , was subcontracted to Congress , which did a mediocre job : too much of the money will arrive too late to be of help in the current crisis .
His budget , though in some ways more honest than his predecessor's , is wildly optimistic .
And he has taken too long to produce his plan for dealing with the trillions of dollars of toxic assets which fester on banks ' balance - sheets .
The failure to staff the Treasury is a shocking illustration of administrative drift .
There are 23 slots at the department that need confirmation by the Senate , and only two have been filled .
This is not the Senate 's fault .
Mr Obama has made a series of bad picks of people who have chosen or been forced to withdraw ; and it was only this week that he announced his candidates for two of the department 's four most senior posts .
Filling such jobs is always a tortuous business in America , but Mr Obama has made it harder by insisting on a level of scrutiny far beyond anything previously attempted .
Getting the Treasury team in place ought to have been his first priority .
Second , Mr Obama has mishandled his relations with both sides in Congress .
Though he campaigned as a centrist and promised an era of post - partisan government , that 's not how he has behaved .
His stimulus bill attracted only three Republican votes in the Senate and none in the House .
This bodes ill for the passage of more difficult projects , such as his big plans for carbon - emissions control and health - care reform .
Keeping those promises will soon start to bedevil the administration .
The Republicans must take their share of the blame for the breakdown .
But if Mr Obama had done a better job of selling his package , and had worked harder at making sure that Republicans were included in drafting it , they would have found it more difficult to oppose his plans .
If Mr Obama cannot work with the Republicans , he needs to be certain that he controls his own party .
Unfortunately , he seems unable to .
Put bluntly , the Democrats are messing him around .
They are pushing pro-trade - union legislation ( notably a measure to get rid of secret ballots ) even though he does n't want them to do so ; they have been roughing up the bankers even though it makes his task of fixing the economy much harder ; they have stuffed his stimulus package and his appropriations bill with pork , even though this damages him and his party in the eyes of the electorate .
Worst of all , he is letting them get away with it .
Lead , dammit
There are some signs that Mr Obama 's administration is learning .
This week the battered treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , has at last come up with a detailed plan to rescue the banks ( see article and article ) .
Its success is far from guaranteed , and the mood of Congress and the public has soured to the point where , should this plan fail , getting another one off the drawing - board will be exceedingly hard .
But the plan at least demonstrates the administration 's acceptance that it must work with the bankers , instead of riding the wave of popular opinion against them , if it is to repair America 's economy .
And it 's not just in the domestic arena that Mr Obama has demonstrated his willingness to learn : on Iraq , he has intelligently recalibrated his views , coming up with a plan for withdrawal that seeks to consolidate the gains in Iraq while limiting the costs to America .
But Mr Obama has a long way to travel if he is to serve his country — and the world — as he should .
Take the G20 meeting in London , to which he will head at the end of next week .
The most important task for this would - be institution is to set itself firmly against protectionism at a time when most of its members are engaged in a game of creeping beggar - thy - neighbour .
Yet how can Mr Obama lead the fight when he has just pandered to America 's unions by sparking a minor trade war with Mexico ?
And how can he set a new course for NATO at its 60th - anniversary summit a few days later if he is appeasing his party with talk of leaving Afghanistan ?
In an accomplished press conference this week , Mr Obama reminded the world what an impressive politician he can be .
He has a capacity to inspire that is unmatched abroad or at home .
He holds a strong hand when it comes to the Democrats , many of whom owe their seats to his popularity at last year 's election .
Now he must play it .
Fabric softeners , disinfectants , shampoos and other household products are spreading drug - resistant bacteria around Britain , scientists have warned .
Detergents used in factories and mills are also increasing the odds that some medicines will no longer be able to combat dangerous diseases .
The warning has been made by Birmingham and Warwick university scientists , who say disinfectants and other products washed into sewers and rivers are triggering the growth of drug - resistant microbes .
Soil samples from many areas have been found to contain high levels of bacteria with antibiotic - resistant genes , the scientists have discovered - raising fears that these may have already been picked up by humans .
" Every year , the nation produces 1.5 m tonnes of sewage sludge and most of that is spread on farmland , " said Dr William Gaze of Warwick University .
That sludge contains antibiotic - resistant bacteria whose growth is triggered by chemicals in detergents , he explained .
" In addition , we pump 11bn litres of water from houses and factories into our rivers and estuaries every day , and these are also spreading resistance . "
The study is important because it suggests that the problem of drug resistance is not merely the result of the over - prescription of antibiotics or poor hygiene standards in hospitals .
However , the team stressed the emergence of the most deadly superbugs - such as MRSA that has caused thousands of deaths in hospitals - is not linked to the use of disinfectants .
" Our research shows drug resistance is not confined to hospitals , but is out in the community .
It is spreading and all the time it is eroding our ability to control infections .
It is extremely worrying , " said Professor Liz Wellington , also of Warwick University .
In their study , the scientists looked at quaternary ammonium compounds ( QACs ) that are used in many household cleaning goods .
Every day , huge volumes of these chemicals are flushed from homes and factories into sewers and rivers .
In high concentrations , QACs kill bacteria .
However , in sewage , these chemicals become diluted and bacteria have evolved resistance to them .
" That is a natural evolutionary process , " said Gaze .
" If other bacteria are killed , those that are resistant to QACs will survive and , without competition , will multiply in vast numbers .
However , it turns out that the piece of DNA that confers that resistance also contains genes that confer resistance to antibiotics .
In this way , we have created an ideal environment for the emergence of antibiotic - resistant bacteria in our drains and sewers .
These microbes are now being spread round the country in river water and in sewage sludge used on farms . "
As part of its study , the team - which also includes Professor Peter Hawkey of Birmingham University - looked at soil contaminated with QACs and sewage sludge in the Midlands , the Cotswolds , Hertfordshire and other areas .
Using techniques similar to those involved in DNA fingerprinting , they then looked for the presence of antibiotic - resistant genes - and found these in high concentrations .
" The inference is clear , " added Gaze .
" We are producing sewage and river water that have more and more drug - resistant bacteria in them and that these are now poised to enter the food chain . "
Wellington added : " Once they are in the land , these bacteria will get into the bodies of agricultural workers or people who use the land recreationally and will form reservoirs of drug - resistant microbes that could pose all sorts of problems .
This is going to need a great deal of monitoring . "
In addition , the team found that antibiotics used to treat farm animals - in particular pigs - are also helping to spread drug resistance in the soil .
In their tests , the team found samples of pig slurry that possessed high levels of antibiotic - resistant genes , raising fears that strains of resistant bacteria were contaminating the land by another route and could enter the food chain .
" We might think of special measures that will help us control or localise drug - resistant bacteria in hospitals , but the problem is much more widespread than that , " added Wellington .
" It is now out there in the environment . "
Glasgow city council have this amazing campaign to stop illegal flyposting where they stick huge stickers on the posters saying “ Cancelled ” , in small print the stickers say that the poster is cancelled .
But for the innocent by stander it looks like the event / album launch etc is canceled .
I saw this on my way into town and almost died laughing .
Knowing Glasgow the 2nd coming was probably canceled due to bad weather , however it ’s likely that it might also be due to a lack of interest .
( REAL SIMPLE ) --
If you 're ready to make a clean sweep of your house , help is here .
Experts share the six main reasons why people can't seem to let go of their stuff and their smartest tricks for outwitting that primal hoarding instinct .
Prepare to clear out -- for good !
The obstacle : ' If I get rid of this wedding vase , I 'll feel guilty '
The solution : People feel a responsibility to be good stewards of things , says Randy Frost , a professor of psychology at Smith College , in Northampton , Massachusetts , and a coauthor of " Buried in Treasures " ( Oxford University Press ) .
Especially items they 've been given by or inherited from a loved one .
Getting rid of a present feels like disrespecting the giver .
But remember the true meaning of gifts .
" When you receive a present , " says Maxwell Gillingham - Ryan , an interior designer in New York City and the founder of ApartmentTherapy.com , " your duty is to receive it and thank the giver -- not to keep the gift forever . "
That goes for items you inherit .
" Ask yourself , ' How many things do I really need to honor this person 's memory ? ' " says Frost .
Select a few objects with strong associations to your late grandmother , say , and keep them in places where you 'll see them .
Let the rest go to people who want them more than you do .
Likewise , do n't be shy about admitting a mistake you made and moving on .
The $ 120 pair of heels you bought last spring that pinch ?
Cut yourself some slack and give them away .
Real Simple : How to Donate Old Clothes
A look at your love - hate relationship with the possessions that surround you , and how to overcome them
The obstacle : ' But I might need seven sleeping bags one day '
The solution : Everyone fears tossing something out only to realize -- six months , a year , or five years down the road -- that she should n't have .
Keeping things around " just in case " makes people feel safe .
If your main problem is an overflowing closet , try the " packing for a trip " trick .
It goes like this :
You 're packing for a month 's vacation -- you 'll need both dressy and casual clothes , for warm and cool weather , and you can fill two big suitcases .
Then take all the other things and place them on a rack in your basement or attic .
If you want to wear any of those exiled clothes in the coming days , grab them .
But as the months go by , you 'll be shocked at how few of those clothes you need or even think about .
From there , it 's a baby step to a Goodwill bag .
Still have separation anxiety ?
Box up the stuff you 're not quite able to part with and write on the outside , open six months later .
Then tuck it away in your basement , attic , or storage facility .
If a year from now you find that you did n't miss the items , it will be much easier to part with them .
The obstacle : ' I think this brooch / chair / ugly knickknack might be valuable again '
The solution :
When you hear the appraisers on " Antiques Roadshow " say that someone 's grandmother 's old Bakelite bracelets would now fetch $ 500 , it 's easy to wonder whether your vintage piece might be worth a bundle .
Stop guessing and find out what the item in question is truly worth .
Take a 10 - minute spin on eBay , searching for an item similar to yours .
( Click on " Advanced Search , " then " Completed Listings Only . " )
If the sale prices look promising -- or if you can't find equivalent items -- consider having the item appraised by an expert .
Many local auction houses will do this for free in the hopes that you will sell the item through them later .
( Google " auctions " and your city to find an auction house near you . )
For the greatest certainty , hire an independent appraiser through the American Society of Appraisers or the Appraisers Association of America .
Be sure to ask for an estimate first .
Real Simple : How to sell old clothes online
Remember -- for something to be considered valuable , it must be in tip - top shape .
" People think their old baseball cards or " National Geographics " are worth money , " says professional organizer Caitlin Shear .
" But that 's true only if they 're packaged in a Mylar sleeve and in pristine condition . "
The obstacle : ' If I put the bills away , I 'll never pay them on time '
The solution : Many clutterers have gotten into the habit of organizing their world visually and spatially , says professor Randy Frost .
They 're afraid that if they put stuff away , they wo n't remember it , because they wo n't see it .
" But it 's a perception of order , " he says , " not real order . "
You may initially recall that the electric bill is next to the potted plant on the kitchen counter , but it will soon be buried by other items you need to have in plain sight , too , like invitations and permission slips .
Even hard - core clutterers can train themselves to complete tasks without obvious visual cues , says Frost .
For starters , if you 're used to leaving things in piles , designate a logical home for every object .
Set up automatic e-mail reminders to help you remember to pay bills .
In addition , if you feel as if out of sight is out of mind , make transparency your friend .
Take items destined for closets , the garage , or the basement and store them in clear plastic bins so you can always see what 's there .
Real Simple :
Where to keep important documents
The obstacle : ' I want this chartreuse muumuu to go to a good home '
The solution : People often want to find just the right place for their belongings .
The problem is , trying to find just the right place can be paralyzing , says interior designer Maxwell Gillingham - Ryan .
And while you wait , say , for your niece to move into a starter apartment , your old love seat and dinette set gather dust .
To satisfy your desire for perfect placement , look for a charity with which you feel a strong connection -- perhaps a shelter for women .
To identify a worthy one near you , visit charitynavigator.org , a nonprofit research group that evaluates charities based on how effectively they use donations .
Go to the Advanced Search page , select " Human Services " charities , and type in your ZIP code .
Contact the three - or four - star charities that interest you and ask if they accept donations .
If that sounds like too much trouble , call your nearest house of worship and inquire whether it has a clothing drive coming up .
Ask if the donation is tax - deductible , and get a receipt .
The obstacle : ' I want to declutter , but I can't get motivated '
The solution :
This may be due to a phenomenon known as delayed discounting , says Daniel Hommer , M.D. , chief of brain imaging at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , in Bethesda , Maryland , and an expert on motivation .
It works like this :
If it takes a long time to reach a goal , you value that goal less than if you could reach it quickly -- making it harder to get started .
Make projects small and rewards immediate , says Hommer .
After you organize a distinct area , dress it up -- add decorative paper to the bottom of a now spartan toiletry drawer , for instance .
Keep at it and your home will become not only more orderly but also more beautiful .

People who knew Gallant described him as inconspicuous A Canadian contract killer already jailed for one murder has confessed to 27 other killings and 12 attempted murders at his trial in Quebec .
Gerald Gallant pleaded guilty to the crimes , committed in the course of three decades , as part of a plea deal .
His victims included bikers and alleged members of organised crime groups , as well as innocent bystanders .
Gallant , 58 , was caught in 2006 after fleeing to Europe when detectives linked him to a 2001 killing .
Having turned police informer , he will not get additional jail time for his other crimes and is eligible to apply for parole in 25 years .
Under his plea deal , he is barred from writing a book or making a film about his crimes , but prosecutors said he would receive protection and would be given $ 50 ( US $ 40 , £ 28 ) a month to spend at the prison canteen .
Quebec has been wracked by drug - related turf wars between motorcyclist gangs .
' I regret the hurt '
Gallant 's unintentional victims included a waitress he wounded in 2000 while killing Robert Savard , an associate of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang , who was using her as a human shield .
He looked like an ordinary Joe , hard to identify in a crowd as someone who would commit crimes
Andre Marcoux
Mayor of Donnacona , interviewed by the National Post In 1999 , he mistakenly shot dead a private detective living in an apartment formerly occupied by his intended target .
Gallant apologised before survivors and relatives of his victims in court on Tuesday .
" I regret the hurt I have caused the victims and their families , " he said .
" I understand that forgiving will be difficult , maybe even impossible .
I accept that .
I agreed to co-operate with police in order to repair the damage I caused and to seek forgiveness . "
Acting on information provided by the killer , police arrested 10 people across Quebec last week in connection with dozens of biker - related murders .
Gallant fled to Europe after police found a sample of his DNA on a glass in a restaurant in Quebec which linked him to the murder of a bar - owner in Ste - Adele , north of Montreal .
He was eventually arrested in Switzerland and pleaded guilty to first - degree murder in February 2008 .
' Clean - cut '
The mayor of Donnacona , a town near Quebec where Gallant lived for 20 years , has described the killer as an inconspicuous man with a fondness for cycling .
" He went pretty much unnoticed , " Andre Marcoux told Canada 's National Post last week .
" He was clean - cut , had clean cars and a tidy home .
He rode his bicycle a lot .
" He looked like an ordinary Joe , hard to identify in a crowd as someone who would commit crimes . "
Gallant , who often shot his victims down in bars or restaurants , reportedly received his " contracts " on pieces of paper passed to him inside a church .
Correspondents note that while Gallant is one of Canada 's most prolific known killers , he is not the worst to date .
That dubious distinction goes to Yves ( Apache ) Trudeau , one of the founding members of the Hells Angels in Quebec , who was sentenced to life in prison in 1986 over 43 counts of manslaughter .

Advertisement Soldiers have seized one of the palaces of embattled Madagascar President Marc Ravalomanana in the centre of the capital Antananarivo .
Explosions and gunfire erupted as tanks smashed the palace gates .
The central bank was also reportedly taken .
Mr Ravalomanana was in another residence on the outskirts of the city .
Earlier opposition leader Andry Rajoelina called for the arrest of the president and won public backing from the armed forces ' self - declared head .
The African Union has condemned the " attempted coup d'etat " and called on Madagascar to respect its constitution .
Dozens of soldiers broke into the presidential building Mr Rajoelina told the BBC he wanted a transitional government that would organise elections in the next 18 to 24 months " at the very latest " .
" It 's not a military coup , " he said .
" But the life of the country does n't stop .
You can't have a vacuum of power . "
The fierce power struggle on the Indian Ocean island has triggered a military mutiny , looting and violent protests that have left at least 100 people dead since January .
Gunfire lights sky Col Andre Ndriarijaona , who last week said he had replaced the military chief of staff , told AFP news agency that soldiers had seized the presidency " to hasten Ravalomanana 's departure " .
An unnamed colonel inside the captured building told Reuters : " The palace is occupied .
This was our mission for today .
For now , we have no more orders . "
CRISIS TIMELINE Dec 2006 : Marc Ravalomanana ( r ) re-elected as president 31 Jan 2009 : Opposition 's Andry Rajoelina ( l ) says he is in charge 3 Feb : Rajoelina sacked as mayor of Antananarivo ; protests intensify 8 Feb : Security forces fire on opposition rally leaving 28 dead 11 March : Dissident troops oust army chief 15 March : Ravalomanana proposes to hold referendum 16 March : Army storms presidential office
In pictures : Storming a palace Malagasy views on standoff Crisis isolates president Mr Ravalomanana was hunkered down about 15 km ( nine miles ) from the city centre at the Iavoloha palace , where hundreds of his supporters were camped out .
" We are against any bloodletting , so we wo n't go there until we obtain guarantees on the presidential guard 's intentions , " said Col Ndriarijaona .
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Antananarivo says round after round of gunfire - believed to be soldiers celebrating - lit up the night sky but the capital is now quiet , except for the howling of stray dogs .
Our correspondent says it may now be a question of when , not if , the president finds himself under siege .
Col Ndriarijaona said the army was virtually all behind the opposition .
" We are there for the Malagasy people .
If Andry Rajoelina can resolve the problem , we are behind him , " he said .
" I would say 99 % of the forces are behind him . "
Earlier on Monday , the embattled president again proposed a referendum on whether he should complete his term , as a way of resolving the seven - week political crisis .
Mr Ravalomanana , who was re-elected for a second term in office in 2006 , has previously said he wants to remain in office until his mandate expires in 2011 .
' Thirsty for change '
But the opposition leader rejected Mr Ravalomanana 's plebiscite plan and called for the security forces to arrest him .
Q&A : Madagascar in crisis Madagascar's ' young pretender '
What next for Madagascar ?
Mr Rajoelina said : " The people are thirsty for change and that 's why we wo n't have a referendum and will put our transitional government in place . "
Our correspondent says Mr Rajoelina has wrapped himself in the cloak of democracy , but he wants to replace an elected head of state without going to a ballot .
The opposition leader , a 34 - year - old former disc jockey , says the president is a tyrant who misspends public money .
But Mr Ravalomanana 's supporters say his rival is a young troublemaker who has not offered any policy alternatives .
The army has traditionally remained neutral during periods of political volatility since independence from France in 1960 .
Under President Ravalomanana , Madagascar 's economy has opened up to foreign investment , particularly in the mining sector .
But 70 % of the 20 million population still lives on less than $ 2 ( £ 1.40 ) a day and correspondents say the opposition has tapped into popular frustration at the failure of this new wealth to trickle down .

WASHINGTON - Arctic sea ice is melting so fast most of it could be gone in 30 years .
A new analysis of changing conditions in the region , using complex computer models of weather and climate , says conditions that had been forecast by the end of the century could occur much sooner .
A change in the amount of ice is important because the white surface reflects sunlight back into space .
When ice is replaced by dark ocean water that sunlight can be absorbed , warming the water and increasing the warming of the planet .
The finding adds to concern about climate change caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels , a problem that has begun receiving more attention in the Obama administration and is part of the G20 discussions under way in London .
" Due to the recent loss of sea ice , the 2005 - 2008 autumn central Arctic surface air temperatures were greater than 5 degrees Celsius ( 9 degrees Fahrenheit ) above " what would be expected , the new study reports .
That amount of temperature increase had been expected by the year 2070 .
The new report by Muyin Wang of the Joint Institute for the Study of Atmosphere and Ocean and James E. Overland of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory , appears in Friday 's edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
They expect the area covered by summer sea ice to decline from about 2.8 million square miles normally to 620,000 square miles within 30 years .

Last year 's summer minimum was 1.8 million square miles in September , second lowest only to 2007 which had a minimum of 1.65 million square miles , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
The Center said Arctic sea ice reached its winter maximum for this year at 5.8 million square miles on Feb. 28 .
That was 278,000 square miles below the 1979 - 2000 average making it the fifth lowest on record .
The six lowest maximums since 1979 have all occurred in the last six years .
Overland and Wang combined sea-ice observations with six complex computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to reach their conclusions .
Combining several computer models helps avoid uncertainties caused by natural variability .
Much of the remaining ice would be north of Canada and Greenland , with much less between Alaska and Russia in the Pacific Arctic .
" The Arctic is often called the Earth 's refrigerator because the sea ice helps cool the planet by reflecting the sun 's radiation back into space , " Wang said in a statement .
" With less ice , the sun 's warmth is instead absorbed by the open water , contributing to warmer temperatures in the water and the air . "
The study was supported by the NOAA Climate Change Program Office , the Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere and the U.S. Department of Energy .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- " Guiding Light " will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes , CBS announced Wednesday .
Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on " Guiding Light " over the years .
The daytime soap opera 's declining viewership led to the decision , according to a CBS spokeswoman .
The show , which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the longest - running television drama , first aired on NBC radio in 1937 as a 15 - minute serial , the spokeswoman said .
It moved to television on the CBS network in 1952 .
The last episode is set to air on September 18 , she said .
The show is produced in New York .
Wired Science has an interesting interview with Oxford neuroethicist Anders Sandberg about the future of drugs that can reduce the emotional impact of traumatic memories .
The interview uses the term ‘ memory editing ’ which is not a great label for these drugs , such as beta - blocker propranolol , which largely work by reducing the emotional ‘ kick ’ stored with a memory of a painful or traumatic experience when taken after the experience or during recall .
This is something that is often misreported by the mainstream media who often starting going off on one about ‘ memory erasing ’ drugs and the like .
However , it is also not true that propranolol solely effects the emotional aspects .
Careful reading of the studies show that people treated with the compound do typically show a slight reduction in their actual memory for traumatic events .
But the interview makes the interesting point that maybe we ’re a bit too focused on removing or reducing memories , the problem of inducing false memories is probably more serious :
Wired.com : I ’ve asked about memory removal ‚ Äî but should the discussion involve adding memories , too ?
Sandberg : People are more worried about deletion .
We have a preoccupation with amnesia , and are more fearful of losing something than adding falsehoods .
The problem is that it ’s the falsehoods that really mess you up .
If you do n’t know something , you can look it up , remedy your lack of information .
But if you believe something falsely , that might make you act much more erroneously .
You can imagine someone modifying their memories of war to make them look less cowardly and more brave .
Now they ’ll think they ’re a brave person .
At that point , you end up with the interesting question of whether , in a crisis situation , they would now be brave .

Back in the Reagan era , the Republican Party advertised itself as a " big tent , " a collection of conservatives , independents , recovering liberals , even Reagan Democrats .
Today , by comparison , it 's little more than a pup tent .
Much is made of the Grand Old Party 's latest evidence of shrinkage -- Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter 's defection to the Democrats .
Too little is made of the fact that in Obama 's Washington the GOP is increasingly irrelevant at a time of great crisis when a vibrant opposition voice is vital .
It 's not good for the country .
One - party dominance has too often been a recipe for recklessness .
The most alarming aspect of the GOP 's steep decline is the seeming indifference of its elected leadership and its Greek chorus in the right - wing media .
" Good riddance ! " was the response of many to Specter 's departure .
Rush Limbaugh , Grand Poobah of conservative TV cacklers , even suggested Specter take Sen. John McCain out the door with him .
A look at the map suggests this is not a party that can afford to lose anyone , even Sarah Palin .
Recent elections have left it representing a bit of the farm belt and little more than the Old Confederacy ; even there , it lost three of the Old South 's four biggest states last year , Florida , Virginia and North Carolina .
Republicans are an endangered species all along the West Coast and have suffered grievous losses in the Midwest and the Middle Atlantic states and even in parts of their Rocky Mountain stronghold .
In New England they 're beyond endangered ; they 're all but extinct .
There 's no mystery why Republicans , like Lewis Carroll 's Cheshire Cat , are slowly disappearing , grinning as they do .
It 's their quest for ultra-conservative ideological conformity .
As Specter put it : " They do n't make any bones about their willingness to lose the general election if they can purify the party . "
He cited the purging of popular GOP moderates in party primaries in Rhode Island and New Mexico that led to Senate general election defeats .
The party lacks the two things normally deemed essential to political success : nimble , attractive leaders and a message right for the times .
Its Congressional leaders , Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. John Boehner , have all the appeal of a pair of androids .
The party chairman , Michael Steele , is working toward a black belt in malapropisms .
And what damage Limbaugh does n't do to the party image , Dick Cheney does .
As toxic assets , they 're a match for any held by Wall Street 's most busted banks .
But it's on the vital subject of message that the GOP is most clearly bankrupt .
Its all - purpose cure for everything that ails the country is tax cuts and / or reduced government spending .
That wo n't do ; it might if times were good , but not now , with the economy on dead stop and needing a jolt .
Moreover , the public is wise to the GOP 's blanket opposition to the Obama program .
A CBS News - NY
Times poll reports that 70 percent of those surveyed believe the opposition is motivated primarily by politics , not principle .
In time , GOP fortunes will rebound .
But not without new leadership , new ideas , and a new welcome for viewpoints other than those of Rush Limbaugh .
South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham put it must pithily .
" We have to find places in the party , " he said , " for people who could n't win in South Carolina . "
Ted Haggard and his wife will appear on the courtroom TV show Divorce Court on April 1st ( not a joke , though ) .
They wo n’t be getting a divorce or anything like that .
Rather , they will tell the presiding judge Lynn Toler and the viewing audience that divorce is n’t the answer .
Well , if you can survive an extramarital affair with a gay male escort , I ’m sure you can survive damn near anything …
The Haggards say their marriage and Christian faith are stronger than ever , and they want people to know that divorce is not the answer .
“ This is part of Ted ’s journey , ” Gayle Haggard said .
“ It ’s made him a better man .
I see what has happened as a divine rescue . ”
She said she was helped through her darkest hours by the biblical principles of forgiveness , compassion and steadfastness , along with her husband ’s genuine repentance .
The couple will be paid an undisclosed amount for the interview …
This is totally what Jesus would have done .

There was an amusing aphorism about truth and fiction in the new movie The International ( with Clive Owen and Naomi Watts . )
I may not have the exact wording , but it is roughly :
The difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to make sense .
( Or maybe it was " There is a difference between truth and fiction -- fiction has to make sense . " )
That sounded like it was probably a noteworthy quote from somebody , so I did a Google search .
Mark Twain 's name popped up a few times with various wordings .
I did another search using his name and found these two quotes on BrainyQuote.com , so they are probably the definitive quotes :
It 's no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction .
Fiction has to make sense .
Why should n't truth be stranger than fiction ?
Fiction , after all , has to make sense .
A similar quote is attributed to Rosten , Leo :
Truth is stranger than fiction ; fiction has to make sense .
And a similar quote is attributed to Tom Clancy :
The difference between fiction and reality ?
Fiction has to make sense .
My suspicion is that the film used Clancy 's version .
If I ever meet Clancy , I 'll ask if he " borrowed " from Twain 's adage .
Finally , Alex Lane asserts that Twain 's adage is " roundly refuted " by the popularity of The X - Files .
So , can we use the fact that a proposition " makes sense " as a criteria for judging truth or lie , fact or fiction ?
If not , what good is it for us to obsess over whether anything " makes sense " ?

SEOUL -- North Korea said it has abandoned aid - for - disarmament talks and ordered international monitors out of the country , leaving the U.S. and others to figure out a new way to deal with Pyongyang 's pursuit of dangerous weapons .
Coming on the heels of North Korea 's latest weapons - related test -- the April 5 firing of a missile - like rocket -- the moves show that Pyongyang can resist international pressure despite its poverty .

In the first half of this year , borrowers defaulted on modified mortgages at rates higher than almost every estimate .
According to the Office of Comptroller of the Currency statistics released today , 36 % of borrowers who had their loans modified in the first two quarters of 2008 re-defaulted after just 3 months .
After six months , the redefault rate was roughly 56 % .
After eight months , 58 % of borrowers re-defaulted .
" The results were surprising , and not in a good way , " OCC director Dugan said .
This poses a serious challenge to government plans to stem foreclosures by modifying mortgages .
The idea behind loan modification is to lower mortgage payments and overall debt in order to make the mortgage more affordable for a borrower .
But borrowers are defaulting at high rates anyway , showing that modifications wo n't be the panacea that advocates like FDIC head Sheila Bair have claimed .
And , of course , that all the bailout programs will likely be far costlier than projected .
What 's worse , these results are for the first half of 2008 .
Since then , real estate values are plummeting and unemployment skyrocketing .
The redefault rate is likely significantly higher for the third and fourth quarters .
It 's more evidence that regulators and politicians should probably get out of the business of preventing our real estate from reaching prices where the market clears .
Dugan admirably admits that he does n't know why the redefault rate is so much higher than expected .
This is an important start .
Too often when regulators and politicians claim pricing is irrational or that mortgage products bought by the government will yield positive returns , it seems they are operating according to old models about mortgages defaults and home affordability .
Those models are broken .
It 's time to start admitting our own ignorance .

Virtual Reality has long promised a way to create an immersive illusion so convincing you can't tell the fake from the real .
Futurist Ray Kurzweil says it's that kind of virtual reality will make virtual travel possible .
Not in the way you might expect , with a super - realistic display creating faux imagery on a screen or a pair of goggles .
But instead by injecting nanobots into your brain .
Kurzweil speculates in an interview with Good magazine that nanotechnology could simulate travel because an injection of nanobots could trick your neurons into thinking that you 're really traveling someplace you are n't .
If it sounds a bit like taking psychedelic drugs , it is .
You get pretty much the same effect , but these nanobots are technically robots , not drugs .
Do I think this means that it 's time to invest in nanotechnology gaming and to sell short anything that has to do with display - based video games or virtual worlds ?
No .
It 'll take time before the nanobots are perfected .
And can you imagine what happens if they stimulate the wrong part of your brain and give you some kind of nightmare or seizure ?
I would n't want to be the guinea pig for that experiment .
I heard Kurzweil talk last year about game development and the next 20 years at the Game Developers Conference .
He speculated back then that human lifespans would start stretching longer and that we would start becoming immortal at some point as nanotechnology and biological research advances make it possible to repair our bodies as they age .
Kurzweil is also a proponent of the Singularity theory I would wager we 're quite a few years away from making this happen .
As for virtual travel , Kurzweil estimates that flawless virtual travel will be doable around 2030 .
But the Good magazine interview is nevertheless fascinating .
Jon Cohn has a very intelligent take on Obama 's auto industry announcement today .
It 's all worth reading .
Emotionally , I was struck most strongly by this paragraph :
Obama is committed to pushing the auto industry to become greener even as it becomes leaner .
And that is absolutely the right goal .
But right now the big obstacle to selling more fuel efficient cars is on the demand side .
Consumers just do n't want them badly enough , at least not with gas prices as low as they are .
Can Obama fix that problem , too , by enacting some sort of pollution tax ( whether in the form of a direct carbon levy or a cap - and - trade system ) ?
Well .
This is why Detroit is so effed up .
Let me tell a quick story .
I 've finally decided that for my next car , I ought to buy a hybrid , and I ought to buy American if I can .
I want a midsize sedan .
You know , a normal car , like normal people drive .
I 'd love to buy a Ford or Chrysler or Buick or Pontiac or maybe even a Saturn ( not a Chevrolet ; I have my limits ) hybrid midsize sedan .
You'd think they'd be rushing such models out , would n't you ?
But in fact , astonishingly , they hardly exist .
Ford is coming out right now with a Fusion hybrid ( the Mercury - badged version is called the Milan ) .
Saturn has something called the Aura , whose availability is extremely limited .
Chrysler , Buick , and Pontiac have nothing as far as I can see .
And yet , most of these manufacturers are making ... SUV hybrids !
I went to the Cadillac website , on the assumption that if Cadillac had any brains , they'd be making a hybrid sedan that someone like me ( far from right but doing okay ) could maybe afford .
The only hybrid Cadillac is pushing is - get this - the Escalade hybrid .
An Escalade hybrid ?
That 's like taking one strip of bacon off of your Wendy 's triple bacon - cheeseburger and calling it a diet .
Cohn makes a fair point that Detroit would make here .
Hybrid SUVs are selling .
There 's no great demand yet for midsize hybrid sedans .
Well , fine , make some hybrid SUVs , but : create the market for sedans , you idiots .
Markets are created all the time in capitalist society .
Once upon a time no one knew they needed a car with radio .
Now no one would buy a car without at least a single CD player and more likely a six - CD changer and all kinds of MP3 and satellite technology .
A decade ago , no one had any problem listening to songs in the running order artists intended them to be heard .
But a new invention changed all that .
And so on and so on .
They 're so unimaginative in Detroit .
You create a market with a sizzling ad campaign , one that sells an idea of the future as bound up in the new line of vehicles , and in hard incentives or disincentives .
A pollution tax is one idea in the latter category .
In the former , read this , about what Germany is doing :
The German government is paying people who junk old cars a bonus of $ 3,250 toward a new , environmentally cleaner vehicle , as part of a $ 67 billion government stimulus plan ...
... Additionally , Volkswagen AG on Monday unveiled an " Environment Premium Plus " program to provide additional incentives such as price reductions and cheaper financing to customers taking advantage of the government bonus .
With the added VW incentives , Kamand said he would be able to knock $ 6,000 off the $ 26,800 sticker price .
Owners of cars that are at least nine years old and registered in Germany for at least a year can take advantage through the end of the year .
The goal is to help Europe 's largest economy — struggling with a recession and a rising unemployment rate of 8.3 percent — by promoting big - ticket consumer purchases and newer , lower - emissions vehicles .
God forbid Detroit come up with something like this .
They 're dopes .
It infuriates me that thousands of union workers who are just doing what they 're told are going to have to suffer for their dumb bosses ' lack of imagination .
But if they can't think beyond " Gee , our customers like SUVs , so let 's just make hybrid SUVs " then they deserve what they get , sad to say .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s budget proposal relies on the evidence when it comes to healthcare reform , using research done by government and other groups on the best ways to change the system and save money .
It pulls heavily from reports by the Commonwealth Fund , Institute of Medicine and others that show extending health insurance coverage to more people will save money by preventing illness or catching diseases early , before they become expensive .
About 46 million Americans have no health insurance .
The nonprofit Commonwealth Fund has also published studies showing that moving from paper medical records and prescribing to electronic technology can save money .
Health information technology is a cornerstone of the Obama healthcare reform plan .
Studies show the reduction of errors caused by poor communication and scribbled prescription mistakes can save billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives every year , and Obama is gambling those savings will help the federal Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs .
The budget also includes a controversial $ 1.1 billion measure for the federal government to get into the business of comparing medical treatments head to head .
Government - supported studies have shown that older diabetes drugs such as sulfonylureas and cheap diuretics for heart failure work as well as , if not better , for many patients than new and pricey brand - name drugs .
“ I think that the whole process of competitive effectiveness research ... offers enormous promise for making sure that people get the most effective and cost - effective care , ” Ron Pollack of the healthcare advocacy group Families USA said in a telephone interview .
UNNECESSARY TESTS
Studies have also shown that so long as doctors are paid to treat illness and not prevent it , they will tend to order unnecessary diagnostic tests and scans and prescribe unneeded medicine and surgeries .
“ We seem to have as much as $ 700 billion a year in healthcare tests and services that are not necessary ... and just add to costs ... without making anyone healthier , ” White House budget director Peter Orszag told reporters .
On Wednesday , Dr. Elliott Fisher of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy in New Hampshire published a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine showing huge variation in medical costs across the United States .
The differences , he said , had little to do with actual health and more to do with whether doctors referred patients to pricey treatments .
Obama ’s budget stresses finding ways to encourage doctors to adopt low - cost approaches that have been shown to work .
How fighting cancer can save costs may be less obvious , but Obama would allocate $ 6 billion for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health .
The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates the average hospital cost for a lung cancer patient in 2006 was $ 14,200 or about $ 1,900 a day .
The total cost for all U.S. lung cancer patients was $ 2.1 billion in 2007 -- much of it paid for by Medicare and Medicaid .
Medicare covers about 44 million elderly and disabled Americans .
Medicaid serves low - income people .
The Commonwealth Fund , Families USA and the independent Institute of Medicine have all reported that streamlining Medicare can save money .
The budget says that using more competitive bids for the Medicare Advantage plan that allows outside insurers to supplement patients ’ coverage will alone save more than $ 175 billion over 10 years .
Across Africa , a war is being waged on women – but we are refusing to hear the screams .
Over the past fortnight , I have travelled into the secretive shadow world that mutilates millions of African women at the beginning of their lives , and at the end .
As girls , they face having their genitalia sliced out with razors , to destroy their " filthy " sexuality and keep them " pure " .
As old women , they face being hacked to death as " witches " , blamed for every virus and sickness blowing across the savannah .
For decades , we have not wanted to know , because it sounded too much like the old colonialist claims of African " primitivism " , used as an excuse by our ancestors to pillage the continent 's resources .
Our bad memories stop us hearing their bad experiences .
But today , a rebellion of African women has begun , in defence of their own bodies , and their own freedom .
They are asking for our support , and receiving it from Comic Relief and the tens of thousands of people raising money for them tomorrow .
This is the story of the great African feminist fightback – and how you can be part of it .
Witch - killing country
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I am driving deep into witch - killing country , with the address for the latest lynching .
To get to Kagaya village , you take the single asphalt road that rolls for hundreds of miles through Sukumaland , Northern Tanzania .
The land is flat and dry and thirsting on to the far horizon .
It is interrupted only by great fists of granite that punch through the earth towards the sky , and by bush - trees that look like mutant broccoli , vast and out of perspective .
Somehow , my guide knows which of the endless dirt tracks , feeding off the road like tributaries , takes us to Kagaya .
We swerve out into the bush .
Everybody in Kagaya knows where the lynching happened .
" There , " they say .
" That house . "
The village is small and seems to be in the process of being swallowed by the greenery that looms and spreads its branches over every shack .
Outside the victim's house – a small , sturdy red - brick building with two bare rooms – 11 people are lolling .
Some little girls are peeling potatoes .
An old man with a wooden leg is playing a board game with a child .
A group of women are weeping and shaking their heads , because the blood just wo n't wash out .
They are bemused by the arrival of a muzungu ( white man ) , and reluctant to talk .
But gradually , they tell their story .
Two days ago , Shikalile Msaji – a woman in her eighties , living alone – was here in this house , looking after her eight - year - old granddaughter .
She had spent the day tending her crops in the fields out back , and cooking .
But at six in the evening – when it is pitch - black here , the only light coming from the moon and the stars – three strange men appeared .
" Your days are over , old woman , " they said after smashing in her front door with a rock .
Her granddaughter ran into the next room .
" Stay there and shut up , or you will die , too , " they shouted after her .
Then they slashed into Shikalile 's skull with machetes , and tried to cut off her hands – suggesting this was a witch - killing .
Her granddaughter hid until morning , then ran for help .
It was too late .
Shikalile 's blood still stains the walls , and the small wooden chair where she sat in her last moments of life .
Her family – huddled here for the funeral – have to sleep in this room .
They have nowhere else to stay until they return to their own villages .
Shikalile 's youngest son , Matseo , is wandering around , dazed .
" My mother was a very kind person ...
I am worried people think she was a witch , she was n't , " he says , looking down , almost mumbling .
A neighbour speculates : " Her grandchildren have had sicknesses and fevers lately .
They have not been well .
So maybe she has been blamed .
Maybe they said she bewitched them . "
Others huddled here , in the shade and the sadness , believe her children just used the charge of witchcraft as an excuse to get her out of the way and claim their inheritance .
The villagers have petitioned for them to be arrested , and her eldest daughter has been taken away .
Nobody will tell me the details .
At the back , in the fields of maize and cassava she planted , Shikalile has just been buried .
A dog digs idly at the grave , only to be shooed away .
Witch killings are a daily event in Sukumaland .
The victims are almost invariably old women , living alone .
These women are frightening anomalies here : they have a flicker of financial independence denied to all other females .
It has to be stopped .
" Of course witches must be killed ! " , Emanuel Swayer tells me , leaning forward .
" They are witches ! "
We are sitting in the nearby town of Nasa - Gin now , in the soft breeze by Emanuel 's fields .
A skinny dog is lolling at Emanuel 's feet .
He is regarded as a local expert on witches – and how to dispose of them .
" Witches are people who use the power of our ancestors to harm others , " he explains , with a jeer .
Most people here believe there are two realms : the physical one which we can all see , and a higher realm , where the spirits of our ancestors reside , eternally watching us .
Everybody can appeal to the ancestors for help , by making offerings to them – but only witches ask them to do harm .
" The worst thing about witches is if you make a tiny mistake , they 'll kill you , " he says .
" It happened to my grandfather .
One day he got pricked by a thorn , and he died the next day .
How can a thorn prick kill somebody ?
He must have angered a witch .
It is the same with my father .
He was a mentally well man .
But then he was bewitched and became confused and disappeared and we have n't seen him since . "
But the witches ' most evil act in their war on Emanuel Swayer was to kill his baby son , Yusuf .
" He got severe diarrhoea and died , " he says .
" It was the witches .
Of course , they deny it – they say I 'm not , I 'm not , I 'm not – but they are .
Long ago , in 1984 , the Tsungu - Tsungu [ a local vigilante group ] captured some witches and they admitted it .
They admitted it was all true , and this is what they do . "

As I speak to the witch - believers , it becomes clear what is happening .
In this bitterly poor , bone - dry land , death is constantly swooping above their heads , ready to strike at any moment .
But to accept that their lives are precarious and arbitrary – that something as small as a thorn prick , or diarrhoea , can end their story , and soon – would be excruciating .
So it is , perversely , easier to imagine they are in a celestial war against evil , represented by the old women all around them .
Suddenly , the grief has a meaning – and can be killed .
A witch is death made flesh – and who has not dreamed of slaying death ?
As they sip beer and talk into the dusk about these " evil witches " , it becomes clear they have developed elaborate fantasies to maintain all this .
Bobu Masha , a rather plump 39 - year - old farmer , tells me : " Witches are a big danger .
They can kill you .
I know because I have participated in their evil . "
He says that one night , when he was 14 , his aunt woke him in his sleep , and revealed she was secretly a witch .
" She told me to come with her to a place but it was eight kilometres away .
I said I could n't get there , but she produced a hyena , and we rode on its back very fast .
She took me to a witch 's convention , where they plan their work .
We saw people dancing naked .
There were people who died years ago there , dancing and partying .
This is what I saw , vividly . "
Is he consciously lying ?
Or has he convinced himself this dream – or hallucination – is true , to give a purpose to all the grief he has been soaked in ?
" There is a special substance you can rub around your eyes , and then you will be able to see witches , " Bobu tells me .
Good .
Bring me the medicine , I say .
" Oh , it is very rare .
It is not easy to get hold of . "
A few miles away , I meet one of the monsters Emanuel believes should be wiped from the earth .
Sato Magdalena Ndela is a shrunken , hunched old woman , but she smiles awkwardly as she offers me her stump to shake .
She is sitting in the shade , eating sweet potatoes her grandchildren have peeled for her .
She can just about hold food with her remaining hand , although it juts from her wrist at a strange and painful angle .
Sato can remember when they came to kill her .
" It happened in the night .
I heard people opening the door without knocking , " she says .
" They shone a light in my face .
I thought – what is happening ?
What can I do ?
That was when I felt the first cut into my body .
I looked down and saw my hand was cut right off .
Then they cut into the right one and it was hanging .
Then I felt a blow against my head and I lost consciousness . "
She keeps repeating this part of her story , mumbling .
She does n't remember when she was first called a witch , or why .
She was old .
She was alone .
It was enough .
Her daughter , Salome Kashilima , is suckling a baby in the corner .
She says : " My mother totally changed after the attack .
She can't work , she can't hear very well , she feels sick all the time .
If there is any noise in the night , she screams ....
It is so sad , because she was a very good farmer , and so hard - working . "
Sato tugs off her headscarf to show me the wounds .
Her head is one long scar , and her ear is a twisted lump .
Ever since the attack in 1995 , her right eye has been weeping salt tears and pus .
She mutters : " Now I ca n't do anything .
I was n't born like this .
I can't do anything . "
And she tells the story of the attack again .
Only words
The women of Sukumaland – with nothing but their dignity – have begun to fight back .
Juliana Bernard is a small , firm 36 - year - old woman with an air of indestructibility , and a mission : make witch - hunting history .
She grew up across Tanzania , travelling with her father , who was a primary school teacher , and her mother , who was a nurse .
She felt instinctively that charges of witchcraft were " nonsense " – and she learnt from her mother that " illness is caused by disease and germs , not bad spirits " .
I sit in a van belonging to HelpAge , the organisation she works for , as she takes me to a village where she is – inch by inch – helping women to speak out and answer back .
She says : " Witch - hunting is the most extreme end of the extreme views towards women held by many men here .
Women do the vast majority of the work .
They build the houses , care for the children , and work in the fields .
They work 24 hours a day – but they have nothing at the end of it .
We are seen as the property of our husbands .
Women are not allowed to decide anything about our own lives .
We have no rights , no property , and no say .
Widows are the exception – and that is why they are targeted .
Anything bad is blamed on us , and we can't answer back .
It ends with us being blamed even for disease and death . "
Juliana trained as a lawyer in Dar es Salaam , but she came back here because she did not feel she could forget the old women living in terror .
" Of course , I have seen terrible things , " she says casually .
" I have been to villages where old women have been chopped to pieces and their legs were sticking out of the bonfire .
I have seen a mother and daughter hacked to death , because the mother was accused of being a witch , and the daughter tried to defend her .
But I believe in these women . "
When Juliana first turned up in the villages of Sukumaland to explain she was there to defend women accused of witchcraft , " everybody thought I was mad .
They said if I sat down with the witches , I would be poisoned and die .
But I ate with the witches – and I lived .
It was a useful sign . "
Juliana and the organisation she worked with – Maparece – had a simple programme : show the local people the real causes of the evils they attribute to witchcraft .
Women in Sukumaland spend a lifetime working over ovens fuelled by chopped wood .
This causes acrid smoke to sting their eyes every day – and by the time they reached their fifties , their eyes are bloodshot - red .
This is seen as a sign of witchcraft – and triggers killings .
So Juliana started with something strikingly simple .
She provided old women with adjusted ovens that blew the smoke not into their eyes , but up a funnel and out into the sky .
Their eyes soon healed – and the villagers started to listen .
Juliana has been working in Ngwasamba village for more than five years – and it has been transformed .
At the village meeting – where everyone gathers in a broad circle – a young man called Bahati Madirisha tells me : " Before , we thought old women were wicked and we could beat them or do anything we liked to them to stop them .
But then Juliana explained that disease and germs make you sick , not witches .
[ Her organisation ]
Maparece proved it ...
Before , we blamed polio on witches and punished them , but it did n't stop polio .
Then we got the polio vaccinations , and we all stopped developing polio .
We could see that modern medicine works . "
The village nods as one .
" We can see that we were deceived by the traditional healers who blamed witches , " a woman adds .
Just the smallest drop of rationality can – it seems – kill these superstitions stone dead .
One old woman in the village , Lois Mukwiga , tells me : " Before , you could n't sleep at night .
You were just waiting for the accusation .
Witch .
Witch .
Now we can walk the village freely , even late at night .
Now I 'm just like anyone else . "
Juliana 's work was able to spread further across Sukumaland because Comic Relief provided hard cash .
They were able to lobby the Tanzanian government to crack down on the " traditional healers " who blamed illnesses on witchcraft .
Now the government is registering all of them , and refusing a licence to anyone who makes such claims .
Driving from village to village where Juliana has worked , old women openly weep with relief – and for the friends they have lost .
Monica Abdell is a lined old woman swaddled in bright colours .
She stands up at the village meeting and declares : " In the old days , women never slept peacefully in their beds .
We lived in terror .
You could never settle .
You always thought – I could be next . "
She knows .
It happened to her .
Monica was thrown out by her husband for a younger woman , and forced to leave her two babies with them .
" It was the saddest day of my life , " she says .
" But men own the children here , and women have no rights . "
When she arrived in this village , she was poor and alone , and whispers soon began that she was a witch .
" Nobody would say it to my face , but people would shout it at my house , " she says .
" I could n't understand it .
I had n't done anything wrong .
Nobody would dare to help you .
Your own relatives would send you away broken hearted , because they were terrified of being accused of being witches , too . "
She lived like this for decades .
Then , one day , she saw a notice pinned to the primary school notice board .
It had her name on it , next to a drawing of a huge knife , and a pool of blood .
It said : " These are the last days of your life .
Go and sacrifice a goat .
You will die soon . "
She was being blamed for the mysterious death of several local children .
Monica angrily wipes away a tear and says : " I stopped eating .
After a while , you do n't even feel the hunger .
I was so confused .
It was as if I was no longer of this world .
I realised I had to run away , so I left everything and fled into the bush .
I slept on the floor .
I was so frightened I would be killed by a snake or wild animal .
I was starving .
But nobody would help you .
You had to carry the cross on your own shoulders . "
But then one day , weak and exhausted , Monica took a risk and returned to her house .
She half - expected to be hacked to death – but while she had been hiding in the bushes , Juliana had been to her village .
People knocked at her door and explained they now knew she was n't a witch .
Soon after , Comic Relief money built her a new house , where she has an oven that wo n't redden her eyes .
Monica weeps and shakes her head , but can't quite say any more .
Finally , she adds : " It is seared on to your bones .
Being shown a letter with a knife and blood and your name ...
I have starved in my life several times , and this was much worse . "
A year after Monica returned , two young women arrived in the village .
They had been travelling through every settlement in the area , asking for her , knowing only her name .
" When they came to my house , they said , ' Monica ?
We are your daughters . '
And I thought – ' Yes , you have my face ! ' "
Monica looks out towards the bush where she nearly died , and says softly : " If it was not for Maparece [ funded by Comic Relief ] , I would not have lived to know my daughters .
I would be dead , and the people here would not know there are no witches – only words . "
Cutting
Margaret Koilel is telling me how to cut out a woman 's genitals .
She has done it hundreds of times , and says it is simple .
" At seven in the morning , everybody turns up for the ceremony .
The girl – who is usually 12 – is seated on a cow - hide .
The girls often scream and howl and try to resist , so one woman holds her left leg , the other holds her right leg , and another holds her shoulders back .
We pour cold water on her vagina to make her numb .
Then I go down on one leg and start to cut with a razor . "
First , Margaret puts her finger under the hood of the clitoris , " and then I cut it completely off . "
Then " I cut out all the meat .
I know when to stop when I feel the bone and there 's nothing left to cut away . "
Then " we take her to bed and cover her with a cloth .
In the evening , the women come back to check I have done a good job .
If I have left anything by mistake , because the girl kicked and screamed too much , we cut her again . "
Every year , two million African women have their vaginas butchered .
It is called " circumcision " , but this is misleading : the male equivalent would be cutting off the head of the penis , and most of the shaft .
In many countries – such as Sudan , or Somalia – it happens to more than 90 per cent of women .
It kills many of them – and their babies .
I have come to the Rift Valley in Kenya to see this maiming for myself .
The valley is a long , dry depression in the earth , ringed by hard rock .
As you drive along the lumpy melting asphalt , you see nothing for miles except red - brown earth , and the occasional Masai goat - herd guiding his cattle to the next rare patch of edible scrub .
This is where humanity was born : its long blank vistas are encoded on our DNA .
Its landscape is soothing to our species , even as if feels like the sun is suspended inches above your head and burning down into your bones .
Outside a tin shack in the emptiness , Margaret explains why they do it .
" It is to please the men , " she says .
" They will not marry a woman who is uncut .
They think that a woman with an uncut vagina will be sexually insatiable , and have sex with anyone .
But if she is cut , she will not enjoy sex , so you know she will be a virgin on her wedding night , and she will not cheat on you after you are married . "
There are strange myths to reinforce this practice .
Some men believe an uncut woman will kill the crops if she touches them .
Others think an uncut clitoris will grow like a snake and strangle them in their sleep .
Dr Guyo Jaldesa sees the consequences every day .
" Instead of a normal vagina , these women just have scar tissue , " he says .
" This causes all sorts of problems .
It is basically torture for the women to have sex .
One of the purposes of female genital mutilation is to make it terribly painful and unpleasant for women . "
When he gets married , " the man has to prove his virility by forcing open the closed scar tissue .
If he fails to perform this the man is ridiculed , but it can be very difficult .
So often the man will use objects – like a knife or broken bottle – causing even more terrible damage to the woman . "
During childbirth , the woman 's vagina has no elasticity .
" The scars can not stretch to let the baby out – so it often becomes trapped there , " he explains .
The World Health Organisation calculates this causes a 20 per cent increase in still - born births .
I am about to see this is only the start .
The town at the centre of the valley is called Narok , but I think of it as Dust City .
The air is thick with dust ; every time you walk , you kick up great fireworks of dust .
Little whirlwinds form , carrying torrents more dust – where does it come from ?
– into your mouth , your ears , your eyes .
Narok has a small courthouse , and I am here to attend the first - ever trial of a father for killing his daughter – by cutting out her vagina .
Last August , Sision Nchoe – a 12 - year - old girl – was held down and cut .
Once it was over , she bled and bled and it would n't stop .
Within a few hours , she was dead .
Her father said this was a bad omen from the spirits – nothing to do with the cutting , oh no – and ordered she be buried immediately .
Normally the story would end there : another anonymous death .
But a local campaign to end this mutilation had a supporter in the community – and they called the police .
Her father , Ole Nchoe , was outraged , asking the police : " It is only a woman who died .
Why is there all this fuss ? "
But Sision 's mother was wailing " You have killed my daughter !
My daughter ! "
An array of prisoners shuffle into the courthouse , each wearing only one shoe : it turns out they confiscate one of them when you are arrested to stop you running away .
They each plead on minor charges in front of a stern magistrate , before being dismissed , or jailed .
Finally , Ole
Nchoe and the woman he paid to cut his daughter , Nalangu Sekut , shuffle into the witness box .
The father looks angry and uncomprehending .
As soon as he is given a chance to speak , he begins to shout .
" Forgive me – I was not involved in this incident ... " he says .
" God did this , not me !
I am asking for forgiveness . "
The circumcisor is even more angry .
She shouts , jabbing her finger in the air : " If what I did was wrong , why did the chief accompany me ?
Why does my local councillor approve ?
Why ? "
In a bar , their local councillor Stephen Kudate tells me : " There 's a lot of anger in the community at this coming to trial . "
It is adjourned .
There will be a verdict in April .
It 's not hard to find the other victims of the cutting : they walk every street in Dust City .
Kanako Sampao is a lean , drawn 25 - year - old woman who wanders the streets , her head covered with a red bandana .
She keeps her distance from everyone , in order to hide the stench that constantly leaks from her .
" I was cut when I was 10 , " she says , looking around nervously , and smirking at odd intervals .
" I screamed but they did it anyway . "
She did n't heal very well – it was months before she could walk again .
When she was 14 she was married off and had her first and only baby .
" He became stuck .
I could n't push him out , " she says .
" They cut me to pull him out but it was too late .
He died . "
The punishment did n't end there .
When the baby becomes trapped in a scarred vagina , there is huge pressure on the rectum , the bladder and the urethra – and a lot of the tissue can become damaged and die .
This happened to Kanako .
Her insides were crushed – and never recovered .
She has what is called a fistula : now all her urine and faeces leak in a long incontinent streak from her vagina .
" My husband said I stink and can't even produce a healthy child , so he found another woman and threw me out , " she says .
" Now no man will go near me .
I have nowhere to live .
People attack me , saying I stink and I 'm disgusting .
My sisters let me scavenge food from them , but their husbands wo n't let me in their houses . "
She looks down , her eyes dry .
She has heard fistula is treatable with surgery , but it is expensive , and she has no idea how she could afford it .
All over Africa , you find these women – shunned like lepers , on the streets , abandoned , hoping for a miracle .
The Woman With the Wooden Vagina
I walk into the courtroom in Narok with Agnes Pareiyo , a big , broad 53 - year - old woman with immaculately coiffed hair : she looks like a 1950s housewife in Masai tribal dress .
She is indeed a warrior – for women 's rights .
She is here to get justice for Sision – and all the girls like her .
Sision 's father glares at her with uncomprehending hate .
For Agnes , this trial is the culmination of a fight that began when she was 14 years old .
" One day , my father told me I was going to be made into a woman , " she says , almost whispering .
When he explained what this involved , she refused .
She thought it was barbaric and cruel .
But she was the daughter of the village chief ; she had to set an example .
" I tried to fight , I tried to resist – but they forced me .
So I was determined not to scream .
But because I did n't scream , they cut even more out .
They cut me very severely .
And afterwards , as I was lying there , I resolved I would n't let this happen to more girls . "
Agnes grew up to be a housewife and the treasurer for the local district .
One day , 15 years ago , they discussed at the district council why so many girls were dropping out of school .
Agnes pointed out that it happened after the girls were cut – so she began to tour the schools , telling girls they did n't have to do it .
" At first , people said I was a crazy woman .
Who is this madwoman explaining what clitorises are to our girls ?
My member of parliament condemned me , saying I was trying to destroy Masai culture and corrupt our girls .
But I kept to my course . "
She hit upon the idea of having a wooden model of a vagina carved for her , so she could demonstrate plainly what " circumcision " does to it .
" That was when people said I was totally insane ! " she says , with a great whooping laugh .
They called her " the woman with the wooden vagina " .
But after her school tours had been going for a few months , something happened that Agnes had n't anticipated .
Girls who were about to be mutilated began to run away from home to find her – and seek help .
" They were terrified .
What could I do ?
I let them stay with me , but soon I realised they could n't all stay with me . "
So – with help from Comic Relief , and from Eve Ensler , author of The Vagina Monologues – she set up an organisation called the Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative , and built a shelter for the fleeing girls .
She takes me there , to a bright , airy centre filled with freed girls .
They are cooking and reading and plaiting each other 's hair .
Agnes ' defence of her girls is legendary in the Rift Valley .
Everybody knows about the time an enraged father turned up at the gates of the shelter with a sword to reclaim his daughter and have her cut .
The gates were sealed ; the girls were gathered , unarmed , behind Agnes .
The father was howling revenge – and Agnes stood firm and shouted : " Come on then !
Try it !
We 're not afraid of you ! "
After a moment 's silence , he fled .
" I am a Masai woman , " she says , and chuckles .
The shelter triggered such a mass rebellion of young girls running away from home that the Kenyan government finally made it illegal to subject a girl to genital mutilation in 2001 .
But the first prosecutions are only beginning now .
Almost all the girls who still run away to Agnes are reunited with their families – once they agree to leave them unmaimed .
" I go bringing a blanket and sugar , the symbols of forgiveness , " Agnes says .
" I explain the health risks .
It usually works . "
They take the women who work as circumcisors on to training courses , to teach them the consequences of what they do .
When Margaret Koilel learnt the truth about what she had been doing , she was shocked .
" I realised I have the blood of hundreds of girls on my hands , " she says .
" It calls to me in the night . "
But Agnes soon realised that mutilation cannot be looked at on its own .
After a girl is mutilated , she is almost always forced to drop out of school and sold off for a dowry to an older man .
In the Rift Valley , mutilation and forced marriage are Siamese twins .
Agnes leads me to a girl who knows this better than anyone .
Wangari is a slim , bony 14 - year - old who was saved on her wedding day – at the age of nine .
She grew up in Taleki village , where she says a normal day involved cooking , cleaning , feeding the animals , and looking after the younger children .
" My father goes into the town and drinks .
He does n't work , " she adds .
She was cut when she was eight – she does n't want to talk about it – and from then on she had to stay at home .
" My brother – who was in his twenties – kept asking my dad : why is she still around ?
You should marry her off .
So one day my father brought home a suitor and told me I was getting married . "
How old was he ?
" Forty - five . "
She looks away , and breathes a little more deeply .
" I did n't really understand what it meant .
I just knew I did n't want to leave my mum .
But the man gave my father two sheep and one goat , and a wedding date was arranged .
On the day , I was covered with sheep fat , which is part of the ceremony .
My father explained that I was going to have to stop being a child , and do what I 'm told to do , and never come back .
You must build your own home now .
I did n't know what to say .
My father told my husband that he had to beat me to ensure I did n't come running back home . "
But a Tasaru supporter saw what was going on , and called Agnes .
She alerted the police – and Wangari was rescued on her way to the wedding and brought to the shelter .
Agnes enrolled her in school for the first time .
" I love school ! " , she exclaims , her fists unclenching .
" I did n't know how to read or write when I came here .
Now I speak English and Swahili .
I get so much encouragement !
They tell me I can do anything I want to . "
Unusually , her family refused to have her back .
Her father considers her a " whore " , who could kill the family crops if she touched them .
" I miss my mum , " Wangari says softly .
" But I could never go back there .
I value my school and my body too much . "
The Racist - Relativist Alliance
Why are these wars on women verboten in the West ?
Why do we refuse to hear Juliana or Agnes and their pleas for solidarity ?
Any discussion of these issues – the persecution of " witches " , and vaginal mutilation – is silenced in a pincer movement of racism and relativism .
Racists say that black Africans are inherently primitive .
Their " culture " will always and ineradicably contain such cruelties , so why bother tampering with it ?
Relativists say that African culture must be " respected " , and it is " imperialist " to interfere , on a par with the vilest parts of our own history .
Both make a basic mistake .
Africa consists of hundreds of fissiparous cultures and no culture anywhere is homogeneous and unchanging .
The culture of Massachusetts was to burn witches not so long ago – until some people there began to stand up and oppose the practice .
In the same way , there are huge divisions within African societies .
There are brutal misogynists who want to burn old women and destroy female sexuality with razors – but there are also women fighting back , and their will is just as strong .
The funding by Comic Relief , saving thousands of innocent women , is an act of solidarity , on a par with the millions of people who backed the African National Congress even though they were not South Africans , or who backed the civil rights movement even though they were not Americans .
Agnes leans forward , her hands bunched into fists .
" These girls do n't think [ mutilation ] is wrong because a white man told them so .
They know it 's wrong because it 's their body . "
With that , Agnes sits back , and looks out , towards the girls playing in the yard , free at last .
Is n't she an African ?
Are n't they ?

Microsoft Corp. would better protect users by severing Internet Explorer 's connections to Windows , then patching the browser invisibly in the background -- daily if necessary , a security expert argued today .
" The browser is the heaviest used application that interacts with the Internet , and the most likely source of malicious content .
IE vulnerabilities should be given the highest priority and patched first , " said Wolfgang Kandek , chief technology officer at security company Qualys Inc .
But that 's not what happens in the real world , he said .
" Unfortunately , the vulnerability data that we collect shows that companies treat browser patches just like all other patches .
IE 's patch deployment cycle correlates very closely with other critical patches . "
According to data that Qualys collected from scans of several hundred thousand Windows PCs owned by its customers , the patching pace for IE vulnerabilities was essentially the same as the rate at which users fixed other non-IE critical flaws .
To pick up that pace , Kandek suggested that Microsoft sever Windows ' links to IE completely , then boost IE 's update frequency and take some , or all , of the control out of users ' hands .
" There 's just too much user interaction required by Microsoft for IE , " he said , referring to the way Microsoft updates its software , IE included , using services such as Windows Update .
" If Microsoft removed IE from Windows and made it independently updatable , I think you 'd get improved update performance , " said Kandek .
Although pulling IE from Windows would mean that Microsoft would have to come up with a different mechanism for Windows Update -- currently the service relies on IE -- Kandek believes the benefit to users would be significant .
" Taking IE out of the [ monthly ] patch cycle would give us better protection , " he said .
Rather than patching IE only once a month , as it does now , Kandek would like to see Microsoft pick up the pace by rolling out fixes as soon as they 're ready , in effect mimicking the update process that Mozilla Corp. uses for Firefox , or the even less intrusive approach that Google Inc. applies to its Chrome browser .
Firefox users receive a notice when security updates are available , and can click through to download and install the patches .
Chrome users , meanwhile , do nothing : Google pushes patches to its browser automatically , and they 're installed with no user action required .
Either method would be preferable to Microsoft 's current update strategy for IE , Kandek said .
That applies for all IE users , including those working for companies where IE is mandatory , and patch deployment can be delayed by testing , or for fear of disrupting workflow .
" I think that you should just determine for the corporation to trust Microsoft and their quality control " on the patches , Kandek said .
" Browser patches are heavily tested by Microsoft , and unlikely to break any existing functionality on the desktop . "
Microsoft could conceivably split IE from Windows with its newest browser , Internet Explorer 8 , which reached " release candidate " status late last month .
" IE8 would be a good opportunity , " said Kandek .
Ironically , he may get his wish if the European Union has its way .
The Competition Commission , the EU 's antitrust agency , recently hit Microsoft with a new set of charges , this time concerning IE .
On Jan. 15 , the commission said that by tying IE to Windows , Microsoft " distorts competition " in browsers and gives IE " an artificial distribution advantage " over rivals like Firefox , Apple Inc. 's Safari and Opera Software ASA 's Opera .
" If the [ commission 's ] preliminary views were confirmed , the commission would consider ordering Microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose which competing Web browser (s ) instead of , or in addition to , Internet Explorer they wanted to install in Windows , and which one they wanted to have as default , " said EU spokesman Jonathan Todd in an e-mail .
" Microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable Internet Explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser . "
Although IE 's market share has been steadily shrinking -- under assault from Firefox , first of all , Safari second -- it accounted for about 68 percent of all browsers used last month , according to Internet metrics vendor Net Applications Inc .

NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gold rose above $ 1,000 an ounce on Friday for the first time since March last year as nervous investors piled into the yellow metal to preserve wealth amid a tumbling stock market .
Bars of 250 gram fine gold are stored at a plant of gold refiner and bar manufacturer Argor - Heraeus SA in the southern Swiss town of Mendrisio November 13 , 2008 .

Long - term inflation worries fanned by the massive U.S. economic stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama this week has driven investors into gold , which is perceived as the most likely asset to hold its value against economic head winds .
“ I think there ’s a little bit of panic out there .
Equities are setting new lows and gold is the place to run to .
I do n’t think there ’s much more than that , ” said Robert MacIntosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance in Boston .
Bullion continued to appreciate against other asset classes and commodities on Friday amid renewed fears that the U.S. government could be forced to nationalize banks amid a worsening financial crisis .
A ratio of gold against the S&P 500 index rose to its highest level since September 1990 , and gold / oil ratio was at its loftiest since December 1998 , according to Reuters data .
Gold futures for April delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up $ 25.70 , or 2.6 percent , at $ 1,002.20 an ounce .
They reached a session high of $ 1,007.70 , their highest price since March 2008 .
Spot gold hit a peak of $ 1,005.40 , its strongest level since March 18 .
It was at $ 993.80 an ounce at 2:42 p.m. EST , up 2.0 percent against $ 973.75 in New York late on Thursday .
The metal is poised to rise further , possibly targeting last March ’s all - time high of $ 1,030.80 an ounce , analysts said .
OPTIONS BULLISH
Gold options market also pointed to sharply higher prices of the metal .
COMEX gold floor trader Mihir Dange said that trading of December $ 1,200 call options were extremely active and that gold rising to between $ 1,200 and $ 1,300 by year end “ was not unrealistic by any standard . ”
Meanwhile , New York ’s SPDR Gold Trust , the No. 1 gold exchange - traded fund commonly known as GLD , said its holdings rose nearly five tonnes to a record 1,028.98 tonnes on Thursday , while the iShares Silver Trust ’s silver holdings climbed 18.4 tonnes to an all - time high of 7,892 tonnes .
U.S. equity markets tumbled as much as 3 percent to their weakest levels since November before they partially recovered .
Falling stocks boost the appeal of safe - haven assets like gold .
However , analysts cautioned that profit taking could be possible in an overbought market .
“ It ’s a huge psychological level for traders .
The fact that traders have become so bullish in gold , just like any index , we probably are looking at some kind of retracement in the future , ” said Rob Kurzatkowski , futures analyst of optionsXpress .
Among other precious metals , spot silver was at $ 14.41 an ounce , up 2.9 percent from its Thursday finish of $ 13.01 .
Spot platinum was at $ 1,081.00 an ounce , up 1.4 percent from its previous close of $ 1,066.50 , while spot palladium was at $ 212.50 , down 0.5 percent from its late Thursday New York quote .
Mexican ambassador : US should take marijuana legalization seriously David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Sunday April 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan joined CBS ' Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation today to talk about the violence on Mexico 's border resulting from the drug trade .
Among other things , the senior diplomat told Schieffer that the U.S. should take the debate over marijuana legalization seriously .
" Those that suggest that some of these measures need to be looked at understand the dynamics of the drug trade ; you have to bring demand down and one way to do it is to move in that direction [ towards legalization ] ... There are many others who believe that doing this will just fan the flames , " Sarukhan told Schieffer .
Some authorities close to the border violence are beginning to advocate for a legalization scenario .
At the end of February , Terry Goddard , Arizona 's Attorney General , said that while he's not in favor of legalizing marijuana , he thinks it should be debated as a way of curbing violence in the increasingly deadly clashes between Mexico 's gangs .
In addition , three former presidents of Latin America - Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria , former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso , and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo - have all urged the United States and Latin American governments to move away from jailing drug users , to debate the legalization of marijuana , and to place more emphasis on the treatment of addicts .
" This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously , that we have to engage in on both sides of the border : both in producing , in trafficking , and in consumption countries , " he said of the marijuana legalization debate .
Guns coming across the border into Mexico are also a matter of concern .
The ambassador believes that " 90 % of the guns we are seizing in Mexico ... are coming from the United States . "

Alexander the Great and the pirate
There was once a pirate who was notorious to the extreme .
He used to sail here and there , plundering small boats and raiding villages along the coastline .
He would torture people and then make off with their valuables .
It was very difficult for people to resist him because he had all kinds of guns and knives .
Everybody was afraid of him .
Nevertheless , there came a time when the people were able to trap this scoundrel and make him their prisoner .
They brought him before the mighty Emperor , Alexander the Great .
It was almost certain that he would be hanged for his misdeeds .
Alexander the Great said to him , " Now that we have caught you , are you not ashamed of the life you have led ?
You must know that you will receive a most severe punishment .
Before you are condemned , I would like to give you the chance to ask for forgiveness from all those whom you have injured .
I cannot restore their valuables , because you have already disposed of them .
But if you beg these people to forgive you , I feel it will give them some consolation . "
The pirate said , " I do not want to be punished .
I do not want to be forgiven .
But there is something that I would like to say . "
" What do you want to say ? " asked the Emperor .
The pirate looked directly at the Emperor and said , " If you feel that I should be ashamed of the life I have led , then I want to tell you that you should be infinitely more ashamed of what you are doing . "
No one had ever spoken to the Emperor in this manner before .
He was profoundly shocked and disturbed .
" Go on , " he said to the prisoner .
The pirate continued , " You and I are doing the same thing .
We are leading exactly the same kind of life , only I am doing it in a very small measure .
I may rob a few individuals and trading boats here and there , but you are doing it on a wide scale .
How many countries you have conquered !
How many lives you have needlessly destroyed !
How many valuable treasures you and your soldiers have plundered !
I tell you , it is you who should be ashamed , not I ! "
The Emperor remained quiet for some time , lost in thought .
Then he said , " You have spoken the truth .
But for me it will be extremely difficult to change my way of life .
In your case , since you are an individual , it will be infinitely easier for you to change .
I have decided to give you enough material wealth so that you can give up this life of piracy .
You can make a fresh start .
I know that I also need the transformation of my nature , but I am starting with you because it will be easier for you to do it .
In my case , gradually , gradually , I will try , but I fear it will prove too difficult . "
This is how Alexander the Great came to free the notorious pirate .
Part two in a series
How did it happen ?
Why did it happen ?
There ’s simply no way to measure how many hours have devoted to these questions in the ten years and four days since Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire at Columbine High School , and while we do n’t ( and never will ) have all the answers , we do have some of them .
Obviously a good bit of the discussion focuses on the individuals themselves , and other analyses cast a broader net , examining the social factors that shaped the individuals .
In a way , the question we ’re still debating perhaps boils down to nature vs. nurture .
Were Harris and Klebold Natural Born Killers ?
Or are they better understood as by - products of deeper social trends and dynamics ?
The answer is probably “ All of the above , ” but we ca n’t simply check C and be on our merry , uncritical way .
Checking C is n’t the end of the conversation , it ’s the beginning .
Nurture
In the Winter 2000 issue of 49th Parallel , Nicholas Turse ( then a doctoral candidate at Columbia ) , offered up an intriguing theory : that Harris and Klebold were , in some respect , the young radicals of their generation , the Abbie Hoffman and Mark Rudd of the New Millennium .
While these young boys may have no Port Huron statement , no manifesto , and no coordinated actions ( that we know of ) , they are a legitimate radical faction that may have one - upped the violent Weather Underground and the revolutionary Abbie Hoffman .
These boys have truly embraced “ revolution for the hell of it , ” maybe better than Abbie ever did .
The randomness of their “ non-campaign ” may be the ultimate expression of “ rage against the machine , ” ripping into the system , as it were , at its most vulnerable and fundamental level , perhaps more so than Weatherman ’s bombing of the U.S. Capitol .
While these school - age killers have no Vietnam War to protest , and may be criticized by former hippies for having no cause for which to fight , I contend that the struggle in which these boys are engaged may be as fundamentally important as ending the war in Vietnam ( or imperialism , or racism , etc. ) was to the hippies , Yippies , Diggers , and Panthers of the bygone era .
These children , while they do not articulate the sentiment or may not even realize it , are fighting a system as insidious as the military - industrial complex was to their 1960s counterparts .
They are fighting the American educational system and , by extension , the so - called American way of life .
I was invited to contribute a response .
In my dissent , I suggested that
Turse seems both right and wrong .
His suggestion that “ kids killing kids may be the radical protest of our age ” is most apt ( especially given that our age has produced so little in the way of radical protest otherwise ) .
Harris and Klebold represent a contemporary mode of resistance to the dehumanizing character of the American machine , and it is hard to imagine that thirty years from now we will have forgotten the names of those who burned the word “ Columbine ” into the collective consciousness .
However , instead of Hoffman and Rudd , it seemed to me that the Columbine killers owed more to
the likes of the Unabomber , Ted Kaczynski , as well as to a larger body of neo-Luddites whose discontent with technological society finds voice in the writings of Kirkpatrick Sale , Sven Birkerts , and Mark Slouka .
The public mind has n’t yet put these things together , but I suspect a critical minority will do so eventually .
While Harris and Klebold were n’t attacking the machine per se , it ’s hard to argue that the monolithic educational infrastructure that helped spawn them is somehow unrelated to the trajectory of technological society generally .
The intent of the killers aside for a second , contemporary society makes it hard for young rebels to find a clear focus :
For starters , millennial culture deprives would - be rebels of both easy targets and productive means of resistance .
In the sixties the enemy was easy enough to identify ; seemingly all grievances found a handy focus in the Vietnam war effort or the Civil Rights movement , or some combination of both .
Youth resistance found clear symbols of institutional evil against which to rally , and thus radical protest was relatively focused .
The social and political structure of the era was given to a more or less one - front conflict , with the enemy over there and the rebels over here .
The terms of engagement were clear , a fact that dictated and sanctioned certain forms of resistance and ruled out others .
Would - be radicals at the Millennium face a war being fought on a thousand fronts .
There is arguably as much or more social evil for a young radical to oppose , but it is diffuse and sometimes intangible .
Being ostracized by your high school ’s mainstream is perhaps a distressing thing , especially if routine physical harassment by the football team is part of the bargain .
When the school ignores the grievance it begins to take an institutional shape .
Still , that is a dramatically different thing than seeing friends coming back from Southeast Asia in body bags or watching redneck police turning the dogs on young people who differ from you only in skin color .
Millennial radicals have less obvious targets , and correspondingly their rage finds no moral sanction .
The lack of outlets for this anger undoubtedly makes the problem worse — the sixties radical could work these impulses out in a nonviolent fashion that found increasing acknowledgment by the press .
Regardless of public reaction , at least they knew someone was listening , a condition that simply did not exist for those unhappy with their lot at Columbine .
Even now , with a decade of hindsight , it ’s hard for me to tell how right or wrong I was .
We ’re in the midst of such dramatic political , economic and technosocial upheaval that I feel like I ’m trying to sketch a tornado from inside it .
Others have questioned the role of political and economic factors in breeding the culture from which Harrises and Klebolds might spring , though .
Just last week , David Sirota lamented that our national discourse , such as it is , has n’t “ yet matured past gun control and video games . ”
In a country that ascribes hubristic “ exceptionalism ” to itself and berates self - analysis as “ hating America , ” we seek absolution via scapegoat , and so we upbraid bogeymen like firearms and Xboxes .
Similarly , in a democracy increasingly conducting its politics through red-blue filters and 140 - character Twitter updates , we crave Occam ’s razors — and none are sharper than oversimplified arguments about gun control and video games .
But what about the questions and answers that are n’t so simple ?
For example , is n’t violence a predictable byproduct of our economy ?
When torture victims are waterboarded , they freak out .
When a winner - take - all economy tortures society , should we be shocked that a few lunatics go over the edge ?
For three decades , we converted our economy into one that enriches the rich and stresses out everyone else .
Paychecks dwindled , debts accumulated , health - care bills spiked .
We now spend more hours working or seeking work , and fewer hours on parenting and rest — all while schools and mental - health services deteriorate .
Sirota is asking important questions here , questions that take us far past “ why did they do it ? ”
The deeper question that we have to consider is n’t about the past , it ’s about the future – what kind of world are we building and what effect would we reasonably expect it to have on those who grow up in it ?
There are children in our nation right now for whom the verdict is still out .
Their futures have not been decided .
If Sirota is right , and if I was right in my fifth prophecy for the 21st Century , some are going to be school shooters .
What is happening in their homes right this minute that will make that outcome more or less likely , and what can we do to affect that equation ?
Nature
On the other hand …
Dave Cullen , who is probably the single best source of journalism on Columbine , characterizes Eric Harris as a stone - cold sociopath .
Harris , who conceived the attacks , was more than just troubled .
He was , psychologists now say , a cold - blooded , predatory psychopath — a smart , charming liar with “ a preposterously grand superiority complex , a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control , ” Cullen writes .
Harris , a senior , read voraciously and got good grades when he tried , pleasing his teachers with dazzling prose — then writing in his journal about killing thousands .
“ I referred to him — and I ’m dating myself — as the Eddie Haskel of Columbine High School , ” says Principal Frank DeAngelis , referring to the deceptively polite teen on the 1950s and ’60s sitcom Leave it to Beaver .
“ He was the type of kid who , when he was in front of adults , he ’d tell you what you wanted to hear . ”
When he was n’t , he mixed napalm in the kitchen .
The picture that emerges from ten years of study suggests that perhaps the two killers were necessary elements in a toxic cocktail – a legitimately deranged sociopath in need of a follower and a weak - minded loser willing to be led .
Would 4.20.99 have happened had they not found each other ?
And even given these facts , is there anything that could have been done – thinking back to Sirota ’s reasoning above – that could have altered the outcome ?
Maybe not .
And frankly , there ’s no way to know , now or ever .
So what to do with the possibility that social context was irrelevant , that some people are born hard - wired for atrocity , that Harris was a genetically flawed Natural Born Killer .
Even if this is true , not all school shooters are Eric Harris .
Disturbed , yes .
Broken children all , and perhaps broken for different reasons .
We still lack enough cases to pull together anything like a representative profile ( and with luck it will stay this way ) .
It seems uncontroversial enough to posit that there ’s a pool of kids who , depending on the circumstances , might or might not snap .
That “ snap ” might take a number of forms , not all of them harmful to others .
But if this hypothesis strikes you as reasonable , it ’s probably also not a stretch to suggest that greater stress ( in all forms , including the political and economic dynamics that Sirota talks about ) might nudge the likelihood of the snap in the wrong direction .
In the end , shootings happen and I fear they will continue to happen .
If we knew more than we did we could perhaps better understand the nature vs. nurture question as it applies here .
Maybe we ’d know whether Harris and Klebold were the rule or the exception , whether the Columbine massacre could have been prevented .
Hopefully we ’ll someday get to the point where we can answer these questions in ways that decrease the probability of more Columbines .
What we can say , though , is that a diseased body will exhibit symptoms , and that suppressing the symptoms is no substitute for curing the disease .

Greetings from G3Jewelry.com !
This is the website where you can get the latest jewelry trends and news from the marketplace .
Let ’s take a look at the latest headlines about antique jewelry , diamond alternatives and consumer behavior .
Old Fashioned Opulence from the People ’s Princess
Over the months of preparation there had been much talk amongst the press and public alike as to whether the modern royal couple would buck royal tradition entirely .
However , it was clear right from the outset that when it came to the ring , this was a couple ruled by old fashioned glamour and sentiment , as William proposed with his late - mother ’s breath - taking diamond encrusted sapphire .
Retailers selling jewelry have since noted a marked rise in the amount of couples keen to reject the previously popular diamond solitaire and embracing the alternative resplendence and historical beauty of antique rings .
Can Antique Assets Lead to Luck in Love ?
With antique jewellery having become a popular choice with engaged couples or those attracted to the treasures of a vintage era , the aesthetic beauty of a piece is only the start of the story .
From Ancient Greece to the Victorian era , gemstones and precious metals have long been thought to have special properties .
Be they healing and health related or luck and love bound , your precious stones could hold their own hidden treasures .
Diamonds Are Forever
It ’s no surprise that this wedding favourite is thought to represent innocence and constancy , remaining a popular choice with the traditional bride .
Disappointingly for the more new age couple , the Diamond is felt to have no specific healing qualities .
However , it is thought to enhance the energy contained in other precious stones and so another type of gemstone placed in a cluster of diamonds could be a suitable choice .
Amethysts : For the Boozy Bride and Gregarious Groom
Rather amusingly the word amethyst comes from the Greek word meaning ‘ without drunkenness ’ and is thought to instil a sober and clear mind !
Slightly more seriously , the amethyst is thought to protect the body from poisons and promote a peaceful sleep .
Natural healers suggest sleeping with an amethyst under the pillow can help with insomnia and night terrors .
So , if you want to be able to think clearly and get a good night ’s sleep on your wedding day , maybe this is the choice for you !
Emeralds : For the Lucky in Love
Old wives tales tell us that the Emerald is unlucky and suggests that grooms give it a wide berth when choosing a ring for that all important proposal .
However the Romans claimed that the Emerald was the sacred stone of Venus , the Goddess of Love .
Modern , new age thinkers also support this view , as the Emerald is said to promote faithfulness , harmony and love .
It is thought to heal matters of the heart and build bridges between a couple when the stone is purchased with feelings of love specifically in mind .
Rather than being unlucky for love , perhaps the Emerald is one for the true romantics .
Sapphires : Money Talks
Sapphires are said to induce mental clarity and perception whilst also boosting the likelihood of financial rewards .
Perhaps this is a stone for the practical couple who have a less starry - eyed outlook on love and embark on their married life together with a balanced sensible outlook .
This couple may also appreciate the stone ’s monetary value , so might need reminding to show off their jewels rather than hiding them in the safe !
Red Hot Rubies
Rubies are felt to be the most powerful gem and if worn on the left hand their properties are said to be all the stronger .
Representing strong sexual love and vitality , the ruby ultimately breeds contentment and peace .
Linked to the blood , healers suggest that rubies can have a positive effect on circulation and aids in the ridding of infection and germs .
The ruby is certainly the red - hot choice for couples seeking lasting powerful love .
With lasting value in monetary and sentimental terms , when it comes to antiques , buying and selling jewellery has never seemed more like discovering hidden treasure .
MUSIC NEWS - After several release date change s , Neil Young 's anticipated " Archives " collection will finally be releasing on June 2 , according to Neil 's manager Elliot Roberts ( from his March 21 SXSW announcement ) .
The June 2 release date for " Archives " was made during a SXSW panel discussion with Roberts and Larry Johnson , director of Young 's Shakey Films , who played samples of material from the anthology set .
The release will be available as a 10 - disc Blu - Ray edition listing for $ 399 , a 10 - dvd box for $ 199 and a cd version for $ 99 .
The same day , director Jonathan Demme unspooled his second Young concert film , " Neil Young 's Trunk Show , " at the Paramount Theatre .
Demme told the crowd that the film , recorded in Phialdelphia at the Tower Theatre back in December 2007 , " is a home movie in a way .
We did it all by ourselves . "
No word on its release .
The June Neil Young Archives is the first volume in a series of box sets , produced by Neil Young himself .
Volume I will cover the period from his earliest recordings with The Squires in Winnipeg , 1963 , through to his 1972 album Harvest ( buy cd here ) and beyond , including studio and live tracks with the legendary Buffalo Springfield ; Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young ; and Neil Young with Crazy Horse .
Neil also has his new FORK IN THE ROAD album due out soon .
Chinese scientists have made super - buoyant miniature boats from copper mesh coated with silver .
[ 1 ]
Despite looking like sieves , the boats are so buoyant that if they were scaled up to the size of a life - jacket , they could keep a horse afloat , the researchers say .
Although the material could prove impractical to scale up to the size of a life - jacket , the Chinese team hopes that with further research the mesh could be used to design some novel aquatic devices .
The matchbox - sized boats were made from a copper mesh with millimetre - sized pores , which was then coated with tiny deposits of silver - research which extends earlier work by Iain Larmour and colleagues at Queen ’s University , Belfast , UK .
[ 2 ]
The coating creates a ’ super - hydrophobic ’ water - repelling microstructure similar to the tiny hairs coating the legs of pond skaters .
The secret to the pond skater ’s ability to ’ walk ’ on water comes from the way these hairs trap air pockets between the legs and the water , creating a cushioned layer that cannot break the water ’s surface tension .
’ On the outer surface of our boats , there is effectively an air film surrounding the surface that prevents the boat from direct contact with water , ’ explains Qinmin Pan , who led the research at the Harbin Institute of Technology in Harbin , China .
’ We found that the presence of this film increases the amount of water the boat can displace , leading to a large loading capacity . ’
Pan ’s boats managed to keep floating despite holding nearly 15g of weight , compared to untreated mesh boats that could hold only 3.3g before sinking .
The boat also displayed some unusual properties , such as being able to continue floating despite being submerged just under the water : thanks to a curved meniscus that forms at the water line .
By reducing the pore size and tweaking the materials involved , the team are confident that they could make some of the most buoyant materials ever - which would have great potential in creating futuristic surveillance robots or environmental monitoring devices .
Another avenue of investigation is using the coatings to reduce fluidic drag , allowing boats to travel more quickly .
This is already a reality in aeroplanes , where super hydrophobic coatings have been applied to surfaces to keep them dry .
Robert Cohen , an expert on super hydrophobic materials at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , US , is interested by the Chinese research , but notes that the miniature boats may behave differently in real - world conditions , since super - hydrophobic materials can be affected by pressures such as depth or harsh weather conditions .
Larmour also warns that as the process requires an entire object to be coated in order to float , so will only be applicable on a small scale .
His own team set out to tackle this problem by further developing the material to be applicable to copper powder . [ 3 ]
’ This powder could support large external loads and does have extensive possibilities in the area of industrial scale application to marine structures of all kinds , be it tankers or oil rigs , with the clear benefit that it can be prepared in batches and applied as a final coating onto the desired structure ’ he explained .

Brown University biomedical engineers can now grow and assemble living microtissues into complex three - dimensional structures in a way that will advance the field of tissue engineering and may eventually reduce the need for certain kinds of animal research .
The team , led by Brown professor Jeffrey Morgan , successfully used clusters of cells grown in a 3 - D Petri dish also invented by the group , in order to build microtissues of more complex shapes .
Such a finding , detailed in the March 1 issue of Biotechnology and Bioengineering and posted at the end of January on the journal ’s Web site , has enormous implications for basic cell biology , drug discovery and tissue research , Morgan said .
Because the tissues Morgan ’s team created in the lab are more like natural tissue , they can be constructed to have complex lace - like patterns similar to a vasculature , the arrangement of blood vessels in the body or in an organ .
Morgan said that added complexity could eventually reduce the need to use animals in certain kinds of research .
The National Science Foundation and the International Foundation for Ethical Research funded the study , with the latter group ’s mission focused in part on reducing the use of animals in research .
“ There is a need for … tissue models that more closely mimic natural tissue already inside the body in terms of function and architecture , ” said Morgan , a Brown professor of medical science and engineering .
“ This shows we can control the size , shape and position of cells within these 3 - D structures . ”
But Morgan said the finding also makes an important contribution to the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine .
“ We think this is one step toward using building blocks to build complex - shaped tissues that might one day be transplanted , ” he said .
The new finding builds on earlier work by Morgan and a team of Brown students , which appeared in September 2007 in the journal Tissue Engineering .
The earlier study highlighted the invention of a 3 - D Petri dish about the size of a peanut - butter cup and made of agarose , a complex carbohydrate derived from seaweed with the consistency of Jell - O. Morgan and students in his lab developed the dish , creating a product where cells do not stick to the surface .
Instead , the cells self - assemble naturally and form “ microtissues . ”
For the new research , Morgan , with students including Adam Rago and Dylan Dean , made 3 - D microtissues in one 3 - D Petri dish , harvested these living building blocks and then added them to more complex 3 - D molds shaped either like a honeycomb , with holes , or a donut with a hole in the middle .
Those skin cells fused with liver cells in the more complex molds and formed even larger microstructures .
Researchers found that the molds helped control the shape of the final microtissue .
They also found that they could control the rate of fusion of the cells by aging them for a longer or shorter time before they were harvested .
The longer the wait , Morgan found , the slower the process .
Rago has since graduated from Brown , and Dean , an M.D. - Ph.D. student , has moved on from the Morgan lab to pursue his surgical rotations .

Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton .
For previous posts in his series on why the United States spends so much on health care , click here .
Few Americans probably have any inkling of how their neighborhood hospital prices the myriad of distinct services rendered patients .
I doubt many patients can understand the long hospital bills that feature exotic items such as “ cath porta cath perit ” or “ OP6 - central line reposit , ” and so on .
Even fewer still likely understand why a Tylenol pill or a rubber glove can carry the humongous price tags hospitals put on them .
Americans can be forgiven their ignorance on this issue because , as I put it in a recent paper on the subject , the pricing of hospital services is best described as “ Chaos Behind a Veil of Secrecy . ”
For starters , a hospital is paid by several quite distinct methods , depending on who is paying .
The federal Medicare program for the elderly typically pays hospitals a flat fee per hospital case , with a different per-case price for each of around 750 distinct diagnostically related cases ( D.R.G. ’s ) — such as a hip replacement without complications or one with complications , and so on .
These payments originally were set by Medicare in 1983 to reflect the cost then of producing each D.R.G. case .
They have been updated annually and periodically recalibrated by the federal government , with the advice of Congress ’s Medicare Payment Advisory Commission , a permanent body of private stakeholders with its own research staff .
Through lobbying and other informal political channels the hospital industry can , of course , influence these administered prices as well .
Over time , the attempt has been to keep these rates close to the average cost of providing the services per case , although many hospitals claim that often the case payments they receive are below their own full costs .
From the federal - state Medicaid program for the poor , blind and disabled , hospitals receive either ( 1 ) case - based payments ( D.R.G. ’s ) or ( 2 ) a set amount of dollars per day of inpatient stay ( per-diem payments ) or ( 3 ) fees for individual services and supplies ( fee- for - service or F.F.S. payments ) .
The levels of these payments are set unilaterally by the state governments .
In many states these payments are much lower than the full cost of providing the services .
Private insurers pay hospitals predominantly on the basis of per-diems or fee - for - service schedules .
On average these payments exceed the hospital ’s cost of providing the underlying services .
The profits built into these payments cover the losses hospitals book on serving Medicare and Medicaid patients , who are billed high prices but often do not pay their bills in full .
Private insurers also feed the net profits that most for - profit and not - for - profit hospitals book .
The per-diems or myriad fees that private insurers pay hospitals are negotiated annually between each hospital and each insurance carrier .
A given hospital may thus negotiate one by one with several dozen or even several hundred insurers .
Readers may wonder how the many fees that hospitals receive under the fee - for - service method are negotiated separately with each hospital .
Generally , the fees are not negotiated individually , but as across - the - board discounts off a giant schedule of list prices that each hospital maintains — like list prices at car dealers that no one actually pays .
These schedules of list prices are known as the hospital ’s “ charge master . ”
( For an illustration , see this list of prices for some 7,500 items charged by Dameron Hospital in California . )
For uninsured patients the discount is negotiated by the hospital on a patient - by - patient basis , with appeal to the patient ’s ability to pay .
Each hospital has its own charge master and updates it periodically by its own unique process .
Consequently , across hospitals in a given state , the list price for a particular item – e.g. , a normal chest X - ray — can vary tenfold or more .
In most states — California being one exception — hospitals are not required to make these charge masters public .
Over all , then , annually establishing the prices that a given insurer will pay a particular hospital and the prices charged the uninsured is an enormously cumbersome and highly labor - intensive process not used by any other health system in the industrialized world .
It adds a significant component to the high administrative cost that is unique to the American health system .
One interesting aspect of this process is the wide variation in how much a basic medical service costs at different hospitals — a variation that does not appear to be tied to quality .
Tables 6.3 to 6.5 below exhibit ranges or averages of the total payments that two private health insurers make to hospitals in their state for standard medical cases .
The data in the table should be understood as the total payments — per diems or fee - for - service — per standard case .
I had asked for these data in my role as the chairman of the New Jersey Commission for Rationalizing Health Care Resources in 2007 .
The tables below are taken directly from the commission ’s final report .
No one really understands the determinants of the wide variations in prices paid hospitals by a given insurer for basically the same medical episode .
Presumably these variances reflect the relative bargaining strength of the two parties in each instance .
Large insurance companies with relatively more market power vis-a - vis doctors and hospitals usually pay lower prices for given services than do smaller insurers with less market power .
And traditionally , the uninsured , lacking any market power , have been charged the highest prices ( i.e. , granted the lowest discounts off the charge master ) , although in recent years more and more hospitals have switched over to a means - tested schedule of discounts off the charge master .
Critics of the federal Medicare program routinely call Medicare a “ dumb ” price setter .
Perhaps it is .
But it stretches one ’s cerebral processes to conclude that the varied prices emerging from the cumbersome private market process described above are any smarter or more conducive to a rational , efficient health system .
This does not mean , of course , that some economists and other defenders of the system would not try .

The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant is one of the first and longest - running constructed wetland systems used to treat municipal wastewater .
Â
Known by locals as the Marsh , the city of Arcata , California ’s wastewater treatment facility is comprised of wetland marshes and a wildlife sanctuary .
Â
The Marsh is an example of this unique community ’s commitment to environmental politics and appropriate technology .
Â
It facilitates multiple usage of land that not only treats this small urban city ’s wastewater , but the Marsh provides wildlife habitat , research , recreation , and educational opportunities for the community .
Prior to becoming a wildlife sanctuary and marsh used in wastewater treatment , the land south of the city was an old landfill , decaying lumber deck , and pastureland :
Since the creation of the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary , the landscape has changed .
Plants have reclaimed the previous dumping sites , and prior “ wildlife ” that consisted of rats , house cats , and seagulls has been adopted by close to 200 species of birds , as well as many other animals .
The secondary treated water now flows through the chain of constructed treatment wetlands and enhancement marshes , and after two months it is piped into the bay , often cleaner and clearer than the bay water itself ( Eisenberg 1990 ) .
The process used at the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant , Marsh , and Wildlife Sanctuary is as follows :

Arcata wastewater treatment stages
Primary Treatment : Headworks remove sediment and other inorganic material by using bar screens and grit separators .
Next , the wastewater flows through a clarifier that is used to settle out suspended solids .
Â
Lastly , the solids are sent to a digester where they are turned into compost used in city parks and methane used in the digestion process .
Secondary Treatment : Effluent from the primary clarifier is pumped to the oxidation ponds , where microorganisms naturally remove up to 50 % of the biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) .
Â
Effluents then proceed to four treatment wetlands on six acres of shaded wetland .
Â Microorganisms living on the roots of native plants continue to reduce the BOD .
Tertiary Treatment : Some of the water from the four treatment wetlands is chlorinated and dechlorinated before going to the enhancement marshes .
Â
More BODs are removed in the enhancement marshes , and these marshes are open for public recreation .
Â
The enhancement marshes also reduce nitrogen and phosphorous content .
Â
The water is then either discharged into Humboldt Bay or used in the ehancement marshes to continue the cycle .
This unique use of wetland marshes to treat wastewater may not be practical for major metropolitan areas , but it certainly makes sense for Arcata :
Arcata ’s treatment system occupies 307 acres ( City of Arcata , 2008 ) , roughly the same area as the Los Angeles Hyperion Treatment Plant .
An activated sludge treatment plant , Hyperion utilizes energy intensive processes to treat waste such as the aeration of effluent with pure oxygen gas .
The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant is a constructed wetland that utilizes passive , biological processes to treat effluent .
Although non-energy - intensive , these processes do require a large area to function properly .
The Hyperion Plant serves a population of 4,000,000 with an average flow of 450 MGD ( City of Los Angeles , 2008 ) , and the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant serves a population of 17,000 with an average flow of 2.3 MGD .
It is important to note a marsh wastewater system does not require overhauling a city ’s infrastructure .
Much of Arcata ’s sewer system dates from the early 1900s .
The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary includes an interpretive center staffed by a naturalist .

ZDoom now comes in multiple flavours !
The primary port , GZDoom , sports advanced hardware ( OpenGL ) and enhanced software rendering capabilities , while the port LZDoom serves as an alternative with a different feature set , detailed below .
Although the parent ZDoom codebase has been discontinued , the latest official release is available here for posterity .
GZDoom is the latest version targeting current systems with modern graphics hardware .
( Vulkan / OpenGL 4.5 capability recommended , but the minimum requirement for the hardware renderer is OpenGL 3.3 , the minimum for the software renderer is Direct3D 9 )
LZDoom is based on an older version of GZDoom .
It does not provide all features currently supported by GZDoom but in turn is capable of running the hardware renderer on older hardware which does not support modern OpenGL features .
Want more features ?
Get more out of GZDoom !
The release builds are not all that GZDoom has to offer .
If you want to stay ahead of development , try out some and be the first to try out the newest features in development , before everyone else does !
In doing so you can help to ensure releases are smoother , by that you may find ! also available !
Primary | 2020 -06-16 GZDoom v4.4.2
Alternative | 2020-06-21 LZDoom v3.86a

( CNN ) -- Cafe owner Sam Lippert has come up with an innovative way to cope with the recession :
He 's done away with pricing and simply asks customers to pay what they want .
Cafe owner Sam Lippert says people have to look him in the eye and say what they think their meal was worth .
Lippert says sales and customer count has increased markedly since the change , and he 's looking at adding more staff .
Lippert spoke Tuesday with John Roberts on CNN's " American Morning " about how he came up with the idea and how customers have reacted .
Following is a transcript of their conversation :
John Roberts :
So you run the Java Street Cafe .
You actually own the Java Street Cafe there in Kettering , Ohio .
And you 've got a menu that 's got no prices on it .
People pay what they think the food is worth .
How did you come up with that idea ?
Sam Lippert :
Well , actually , that was thanks to my girlfriend .
She is from Bulgaria , and she says it 's a common practice in certain cafes in Europe to allow the patrons to decide how much to pay for their meal .
Watch Lippert explain how his no- price plan is working »
Roberts :
So , in terms of paying for something , if somebody gets a sandwich or maybe a bowl of soup or something like that , typically how close to the old menu price would they get in what they pay ?
Lippert :
Well , sometimes people shoot a few dollars over , and sometimes it 's a few dollars under .
And , you know , at the end of the day , it works out for me .
...
It works out even .

This week on CNN see full schedule »
Roberts :
Yes , so , does anybody try to game the system ?
You know , they 'll get a big meal that would be worth $ 10 , $ 12 and then give you 50 cents for it ?
Lippert :
Well , you know , they have to look me in the eye and say that that 's what they think is fair .
And , you know , that 's a big incentive .
When someone 's at the counter and you say , you get to pay what you think is fair , very few people are going to take advantage of that situation .
Roberts : Interesting .
So , let 's just set the stage for people here .
You bought the cafe in April of 2008 .
In the early going , business was up 10 percent over the previous owner .
Then what happened when the recession really took hold ?
Lippert :
The bottom just fell out .
I mean , I was still matching the previous owner 's sales , but that was not where this business needed to be in order to make it .
Roberts :
All right .
So , why did you think that taking prices off the menu would be a boon to your business ?
Lippert :
Well , I figured in the current times , people need a reason to go out and treat themselves .
You know , you 've got everybody saying , " Well , if you need to save money , do n't buy a cup of coffee out , stop buying lattes . "
You know , do n't go out and buy lunch , take your lunch .
And I 'm trying to give people incentive to actually go out and eat or go out and get a cup of coffee , because they get to pay what they feel is fair .
Roberts :
Now , we should point out to people , too , you 're not the typical cafe owner .
You 're an engineer by trade .
You went to school at MIT .
You took all of your 401 ( k ) savings out to buy this cafe .
It looked like business might be going under .
But since you adopted this no - price menu , how 's business been ?
Lippert :
Things have picked up .
My sales and customer count are up on a given day between 50 [ percent ] to 100 percent .
And I 'm starting to look at being able to bring some of my part - time people on full time and maybe being able to add a couple of new employees .
All About Recessions and Depressions • Ohio
Games like , andall have a certain level of name - recognition -- so it's no surprise that the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin , Texas featured a panel on not just indie games , but successful indie game developers .
When first asked how to define being indie , Kellee Santiago , president of thatgamecompany ( ) says , " I do think that 's an important distinction to make in some circles . "
Because of the business relationship with Sony , they 're not financially independent .
Santiago sees indie as process , or content , or both .
For John Baez , producer at The Behemoth ( ) , it 's the company itself that defines it , but adds that many companies calling themselves indie actually have two - hundred employees .
" It 's really all about the mindset , " he says .
And Ron Carmel , half of the team atdeveloper 2D Boy , remarks : " I do n't know how to define indie per se , but I do notice a lot of things that indies have in common .
" Small size is one factor , he says .
" Another thing is an emphasis on design over finance . "
Larger companies have a top - down direction , looking at when a game needs to ship , and therefore what features to invest in .
With an indie studio , says Carmel , there 's the need to create a good game , which results in the typically - indie question : " When 's the latest we can ship ?
" Santiago adds she believes it 's detrimental to the sector for people to believe that indie development is about not having cash flow .
" Early on , " says Baez , " We knew we were n't going to make money .
We needed to find alternate revenue streams . "
The Behemoth did that with selling the game rights for other territories , and through toys and t- shirts .
" Discovering alternate revenue streams was the most exciting , " recalls Baez .
" None of us has a business background .
I was an artist .
" Santiago agrees , saying that ownership is an incredibly powerful thing .
" Even when things are crap , we like , at least own it . "
She says she 's learned more in the first year than she ever would have at an established company .
When something goes wrong , " We can't blame a boss -- we have to fix it .
" Carmel adds that it 's good to " keep things balanced , despite a sense of ownership .
" Meanwhile , Baez tells the story of mortgaging his house -- twice -- during his company 's early days , and only having $ 500 left in the bank , and how being indie is a risk .
" That 's why it 's important to work on quality games that you want to see through to the end .
" He notes that it gets " really tough , especially when you have kids and family . "
The only thing that sees you through , believes Baez , is a good game that you 're driven to complete .
Santiago also warns : " Someone once told me , ' Do n't start a game studio if you like making games - start a game studio if you like running a business . '" Having defined indie , the panel moved on to broader topics .
Santiago , whose games are available through the PlayStation Network , talks about digital distribution taking hold soon .
" I remember when people thought you would n't watch content on YouTube .
And a year later , they completely flipped around .
" Baez warns that the business of indie games will change .
Currently , major publishers are ignoring the sector , but : " Once real money starts being made , we can be marginalized .
It 's a real danger . " " 2008 was a great year for indie games , " adds Carmel .
But he adds his opinion that publishers will look at the market .
" It 's already happening at EA , " he notes , detailing the indie team within Electronic Arts at work onCarmel wishes them the best , and the panel speculates that a successful indie team inside a publisher will be free to leave at any time , replicating their success on their own , outside the walls of a publisher -- but there 's a certain uneasiness about this new development in a clearly passionate corner of game development .
Turning to the subject of the recession , Baez says , " Downloadable games are a good niche to be in . "
Santiago looks at it from the console standpoint , saying that , for a platform holder like Sony to attract people , " you still need to be funding content for your platform .
" Santiago expressed her interest in pursuing the Facebook platform , saying the company had looked at it , but would be exclusive to Sony 's PlayStation Network platform for the next several years .
Part of a successful business is knowing what you 're good at , and what you 're not good at .
When asked about indie game developers being represented by agents , Baez says agents are to be avoided .
When an audience member specifically asked about Creative Artists Agency , whose game program is headed by former Xbox mastermind Seamus Blackley , Santiago said that her company was repped by CAA .
Baez advised against such representation , saying The Behemoth had relationships with Microsoft , Nintendo , and Sony .
And anyone who 's able to stand in front of a crowd , articulate a question , and is dressed normally meets the publisher criteria for presentability .
Baez concludes with the story of meeting with a development relations manager from a console maker , who remarked : " I do n't ' know why anyone would use an agent , because what we 're looking for is really good work . "
LOS ANGELES 
A growing number of big-city police departments and other law enforcement agencies across the country are embracing a new system to report suspicious activities that officials say could uncover terrorism plots but that civil liberties groups contend might violate individual rights .
Here and in nearly a dozen other cities , including Boston , Chicago and Miami , officers are filling out terror tip sheets if they run across activities in their routines that seem out of place , like someone buying police or firefighter uniforms , taking pictures of a power plant or espousing extremist views .
Ultimately , state and federal officials intend to have a nationwide reporting system in place by 2014 , using a standardized system of codes for suspicious behaviors .
It is the most ambitious effort since the Sept. 11 attacks to put in place a network of databases to comb for clues that might foretell acts of terrorism .
But the American Civil Liberties Union and other rights groups warn that the program pioneered by the Los Angeles Police Department raises serious privacy and civil liberties concerns .

TREND : Goodbye , Glue .
Hello , Digital .
The Once - Humble Hobby of Scrapbooking Has Moved On .
Students from the school , which has had a garden since 2001 , will also help plant , harvest and cook the vegetables , berries and herbs .
Virtually the entire Obama family , including the president , will pull weeds , “ whether they like it or not , ” Mrs. Obama said with a laugh .
“ Now Grandma , my mom , I do n’t know . ”
Her mother , she said , will probably sit back and say : “ Is n’t that lovely .
You missed a spot . ”
Whether there would be a White House garden had become more than a matter of landscaping .
The question had taken on political and environmental symbolism , with the Obamas lobbied for months by advocates who believe that growing more food locally , and organically , can lead to more healthful eating and reduce reliance on huge industrial farms that use more oil for transportation and chemicals for fertilizer .
Image Sam Kass , an assistant White House chef , left , and Dale Haney , the White House gardener , at the site of the new vegetable garden on the South Lawn .

Then , too , promoting healthful eating has become an important part of Mrs. Obama ’s own agenda .
The first lady , who said that she had never had a vegetable garden , recalled that the idea for this one came from her experiences as a working mother trying to feed her daughters , Malia and Sasha , a good diet .
Eating out three times a week , ordering a pizza , having a sandwich for dinner all took their toll in added weight on the girls , whose pediatrician told Mrs. Obama that she needed to be thinking about nutrition .
“ He raised a flag for us , ” she said , and within months the girls had lost weight .
Dan Barber , an owner of Blue Hill at Stone Barns , an organic restaurant in Pocantico Hills , N.Y. , that grows many of its own ingredients , said : “ The power of Michelle Obama and the garden can create a very powerful message about eating healthy and more delicious food .
I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to say it could translate into real change . ”
For investors , the first quarter was a case of one step forward but two steps back .
As the Federal Reserve , Treasury and governments around the world stepped up efforts to address the financial crisis , fears of a systemic collapse abated and investors showed glimmers of willingness to take on more risk .
It was n't enough to prevent stocks from ...
Everyone filed off the tour bus outside the police station in Sderot , less than a mile from the Gaza Strip border .
More than 30 journalists gathered around as police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld began his practiced presentation , complete with charts , graphs and weapon fragments , emphasizing the increasing range of rockets launched from Gaza and the 1 million Israelis living within the threat zone .
Suddenly , an alarm sounded , indicating an incoming rocket : an awkward squawk followed by a recorded female voice saying “ code red ” in Hebrew .
Everyone hustled inside the police station ; seconds later a thud shook the building .
Rosenfeld listened to his radio and reported that a pair of rockets had landed harmlessly , one of them about 330 yards away .

Within 10 minutes , a member of the police bomb squad dramatically clunked two mangled rocket stumps onto the sidewalk .
The journalists crowded around to take pictures and touch the metal , still as hot as the muffler of a running car .
Drawing on mistakes made during its 2006 conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , Israel has revamped its information operations , presenting a unified message , bottling up leaks from the field and working to drive a wedge in Arab public opinion .
Israel and its proponents have used set talking points : emphasizing the eight years that southern residents have endured Gazan rocket fire , highlighting Israel ’s 2005 withdrawal of its soldiers and settlers from Gaza , and declaring the Gazan people to be hostages of a Hamas regime that cynically sacrifices their lives .
There ’s also almost always some variation on the theme of , “ What would America do if Mexico was launching rockets at Texas every day ? ”
An Israeli reporter said he recently heard the Mexico analogy three times in one day from a military officer , a government official and a civilian analyst .

“ As a reporter , that ’s a bit unnerving because you realize you ’re dealing with someone who has been fed responses , ” said the reporter , speaking on the condition that his name or publication not be printed .
“ It ’s very clear Israel has heavily invested in its [ public relations ] machine since the Lebanon war . ”
Hamas media efforts are primitive in comparison .
With its leaders in hiding and without the technical sophistication of the Israeli operation , the militant group is often limited to videotaped statements and news releases to Gazan reporters .
The Israeli media offensive , meanwhile , has extended onto the Internet and television screens of viewers in the Arab world .
Government spokesman Mark Regev and army spokeswoman Maj .
Avital Leibovich have been daily fixtures on the Al Jazeera satellite TV network from the start of the Israeli air assault Dec. 27 .
The final television interview given by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before the attack was with the Al Arabiya satellite news channel , in which he appealed directly to Gazans to overthrow Hamas themselves .

“ We want to influence Palestinian thinking , ” Regev said .
“ We think there ’s a growing divide between Hamas and the Palestinian street . ”
A Dec. 31 article in the Jewish Chronicle , a London - based newsletter , noted the formation eight months ago of the National Information Directorate within the prime minister ’s office to coordinate the media activities of the government , army , overseas embassies and nongovernmental organizations like the Israel Project , the lobbying group that arranged the foreign journalists ’ trip to Sderot .
“ The Gaza attack is the first major demonstration of Israel ’s total overhaul of its hasbara [ information ] operation following the Second Lebanon War , ” the article stated .
On Dec. 29 , the third day of the air campaign , an Israeli army channel debuted on YouTube , complete with a daily video blog , presentations of the history of the conflict from an Israeli perspective and cockpit footage of missile strikes .

Elsewhere on the Internet , pro-Israeli students and bloggers created QassamCount , an application on the social networking sites Facebook and Twitter that posts an update every time a rocket hits Israel .
Pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian hackers have also engaged in a back - and - forth battle against websites on the other side .
Israel has worked to prevent the leaks from soldiers and officers that plagued the war with Hezbollah , even taking away cellphones .
In the 2006 conflict , calls from soldiers in the field influenced Israeli public opinion as reporters printed firsthand accounts of the soldiers ’ uncertainty in the mission and lack of preparedness .
“ By Day 2 the leaks had started , ” said the Israeli journalist .
“ I know I was getting calls from soldiers saying , ‘ I do n’t even have a helmet .
This is going to go badly . ’ ”
Army spokesman Brig .
Gen . Avi Benayahu said phones were taken away this time to prevent Hamas from picking up the soldiers ’ location and to keep information from leaking out .

Another key aspect of the information campaign : preventing foreign journalists from entering Gaza to report on the conflict firsthand .
Despite a recent Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to allow a limited pool of journalists , the army continues to block their entry .
On Thursday , two Israeli channels and the BBC were permitted to briefly accompany ground forces , but there has been no indication that the government will allow journalists unfettered access to Gaza in the near future .
The media blockade has left most TV networks broadcasting from a hill outside Sderot , and relying on Gazan journalists to serve as their eyes and ears .
Meanwhile , Israel and support organizations like the Israel Project have offered the journalists contacts , fact books full of charts and statistics , tours of the south and interviews with rocket victims .
“ We always end up starting with the Israeli side , ” said a Japanese television journalist , speaking on the condition of anonymity , “ because that ’s where we are and that ’s what we can see . ”

Batsheva Sobelman and Gabby Sobelman of The Times ’ Jerusalem Bureau contributed to this report .
But the Pakistanis offered a more nuanced portrait .
They said the contacts were less threatening than the American officials depicted and were part of a strategy to maintain influence in Afghanistan for the day when American forces would withdraw and leave what they fear could be a power vacuum to be filled by India , Pakistan ’s archenemy .
A senior Pakistani military officer said , “ In intelligence , you have to be in contact with your enemy or you are running blind . ”
The ISI helped create and nurture the Taliban movement in the 1990s to bring stability to a nation that had been devastated by years of civil war between rival warlords , and one Pakistani official explained that Islamabad needed to use groups like the Taliban as “ proxy forces to preserve our interests . ”
A spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington declined to comment for this article .
Over the past year , a parade of senior American diplomats , military officers and intelligence officials has flown to Islamabad to urge Pakistan ’s civilian and military leaders to cut off support for militant groups , and Washington has threatened to put conditions on more than $ 1 billion in annual military aid to Pakistan .
On Saturday , the director of the C.I.A. , Leon E. Panetta , met with top Pakistani officials in Islamabad .
Little is publicly known about the ISI ’s S Wing , which officials say directs intelligence operations outside of Pakistan .
American officials said that the S Wing provided direct support to three major groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan : the Taliban based in Quetta , Pakistan , commanded by Mullah Muhammad Omar ; the militant network run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ; and a different group run by the guerrilla leader Jalaluddin Haqqani .
Dennis C. Blair , the director of national intelligence , recently told senators that the Pakistanis “ draw distinctions ” among different militant groups .
“ There are some they believe have to be hit and that we should cooperate on hitting , and there are others they think do n’t constitute as much of a threat to them and that they think are best left alone , ” Mr. Blair said .
The Haqqani network , which focuses its attacks on Afghanistan , is considered a strategic asset to Pakistan , according to American and Pakistani officials , in contrast to the militant network run by Baitullah Mehsud , which has the goal of overthrowing Pakistan ’s government .
Historians of the future will doubtless marvel that a great and powerful republic , founded in part on “ liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” but now suffering from difficult economic times would waste billions of dollars every year in a futile war against a humble plant .
That plant , of course , is hemp — source of oil , fiber and a mild psychoactive drug .
It ’s so mild that in all of history , no one has ever died from a marijuana overdose .
And those who used it in their youth , like the three most recent American presidents ( Clinton claimed he “ did n’t inhale , ” Bush was “ young and foolish ” in his jejune days , and Obama confessed that “ pot had helped ” during his youth ) , somehow managed to go on to reasonably productive lives .
So why is the stuff still illegal ?
For one thing , there ’s an immense federal bureaucracy , the Drug Enforcement Administration , which naturally seeks to stay in business .
As long as pot is illegal , the DEA has plenty of work .
And when the need arises for a headline to show that the DEA is on the ball , its agents can always drive to some home that uses too much electricity , shoot the dogs , kick in the door , and announce that American youth are protected because it just seized plants with an estimated street value of $ 4.2 gazillion .
For another , there ’s our pharmaceutical industry , a major source of campaign contributions .
The pill - makers buy candidates so they can protect their revenue streams .
Now , it might be too much to expect the federal government to move sensibly here .
There are , after all , two wars and a crumbling economy to contend with .
But Colorado could help itself by legalizing the cultivation , sale and use of marijuana with a reasonable excise tax of $ 25 an ounce .
It would save money in several ways , like lower law - enforcement costs , as well as a reduction in the prison population .
Further , the corruption and violence associated with black markets should diminish .
More money would circulate in our state , as Colorado hemp farmers received money now going to Mexican drug cartels .
Profitable farms mean that open space gets preserved through market mechanisms , rather than taxes and zoning .
Further , it might enhance tourism , at least until other states catch on .
One possible snag is the federal government .
No matter how sensible we make our state laws , there would still be draconian and moronic federal laws enforced by federal agents .
So initially , the marijuana excise tax proceeds should go to our state attorney general ’s office , with instructions that the money be used to defend all Coloradans charged with marijuana violations that are crimes under federal law but not under our enlightened state law .
In other words , every “ probable cause ” for a search warrant would be vigorously contested .
The chain of evidence would come under intense scrutiny .
The credibility of informants and agents would be subject to brutal cross-examination .
Every such trial — our tenacious defense teams would never plea- bargain — would be a grinding ordeal for the U.S. Attorney ’s office .
The federal Department of Justice would soon move its prosecutorial resources away from pot and toward real crimes that people care about .
The downside ?
Maybe a few more lazy potheads munching junk food .
But in today ’s economy , there are n’t jobs for them anyway , so where ’s the harm to society ?
Contrast that with the benefits of reduced spending on cops and prisons , a boost to Colorado agriculture , and increased revenue for our hard - pressed state government , if we ’d just give up on this silly war against a plant .

The Treasury will use a $ 30 billion infusion into AIG to force the company to repay all of the bonuses promised to employees of its Financial Products group , a White House official said .
My suggestion : PAY THESE BONUSES WITH AIG STOCK .
Meanwhile , a Yale Law School student knows how the to stop the AIG bonuses :
Larry Summers claims that nothing can be done about the AIG bonuses .
As a former Secretary of the Treasury , he should know better .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner should direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to challenge the AIG bonuses as unreasonable compensation under the Internal Revenue Code .
Finding the AIG bonuses to be unreasonable compensation would render them nondeductible for federal tax purposes , and would strengthen potential shareholder derivative suits to recapture The Great AIG Giveaway .
Section 162 ( a ) of the Internal Revenue Code declares : “ There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business , including . . . a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered . ”

NYT : Obama Orders Treasury Chief to Try to Block A.I.G. Bonuses
President Obama vowed to try to stop the faltering insurance giant American International Group from paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to executives , as the administration scrambled to avert a populist backlash against banks and Wall Street that could complicate Mr. Obama ’s economic recovery agenda .
“ In the last six months , A.I.G. has received substantial sums from the U.S. Treasury , ” Mr. Obama said .
He added that he had asked Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner “ to use that leverage and pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . ”
In strongly - worded remarks delivered in the White House East Room before small business owners , Mr. Obama called A.I.G. “ a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed . ”
“ Under these circumstances , it ’s hard to understand how derivative traders at A.I.G. warranted any bonuses at all , much less $ 165 million in extra pay , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? ”

The religious right is simply besides themselves over the news that the Department of Homeland Security has reported the fact that for years white supremacists have tried to exploit social issues like abortion and same - sex marriage .
Would the religious right , and the Republican party it runs , prefer that America ’s law enforcement community not investigate all terrorist threats facing America .
Here is what the religious right is claiming in an email I received today :
When the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) made the outrageous claim – labeling pro-life supporters as ” extremists ” in a report on domestic terrorism – we sprang into immediate action .
We ’re fighting back .
To brand pro-lifers as ” rightwing extremists ” and ” domestic terrorists ” is more than offensive … it ’s incorrect as a matter of law and completely wrong as a matter of policy .
That is a lie .
And typical of the false witness that religious right leaders bear on a regular basis .
Here is what the Homeland Security report actually said :
Paralleling the current national climate , rightwing extremists during the1990s exploited a variety of social issues and political themes to increase group visibility and recruit new members .
Prominent among these themes were the militia movement ’s opposition to gun control efforts , criticism of free trade agreements ( particularly thosewith Mexico ) , and highlighting perceived government infringement on civil liberties as well as white supremacists ’ longstanding exploitation of social issues such as abortion , inter-racial crimes , and same - sex marriage .
During the 1990s , these issues contributed tothe growth in the number of domestic rightwing terrorist and extremist groups and an increase in violent acts targeting government facilities , law enforcement officers , banks , and infrastructure sectors .
The religious right is not made up of good Americans who simply disagree with you and me .
They ’re not even good Christians .
They ’re angry , intolerant , hateful bigots .
They ’re America ’s Taliban .
They are the offspring of the racists who supported slavery and miscegenation laws .
The Internet is their fire hose , but other than that , they are no different than the hate that came before them .
Considering the fact that the religious right is now demanding that civil rights laws preserve a conservative Christian ’s right to kill people he does n’t approve of , it ’s no wonder that a simple study from the Department of Homeland Security is giving the extremist who control the Republican party such angst .
CLEVELAND — Willie Robinson 's parents claimed they could n't afford medical treatment for the dying 8 - year - old boy 's cancer , prosecutors said , but they had enough money to pay a veterinarian to treat their pet pit bull for fleas .
A Cuyahoga County grand jury on Wednesday indicted William Robinson Sr. and Monica Hussing for involuntary manslaughter , child endangering and felonious assault .
Willie died nearly a year ago , on March 22 , shortly after he was admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center suffering from the final stages of Hodgkin 's lymphoma , one of the most common and curable of cancers to strike children .
The county coroner found that the child died of the cancer and pneumonia , but ruled his death a homicide .
Prosecutors said parental neglect was as responsible for Willie 's death as the diseases .
" They never once took him to a doctor , " said County Prosecutor Bill Mason .
" It just is not right .
This kid should be alive today . "
Investigators said while Willie suffered without care , his parents paid $ 87 to have the pit bull , Petey , treated for fleas .
Assistant County Prosecutor Anna Faraglia worked on the case for the past year with police and family members .
She said she is outraged by how the parents ignored a child who begged them to take him to see a doctor , but was rejected .
" There were some horrific symptoms , " she said .
" What were n't they seeing ?
Even a blind person would have known there was something wrong with him . "
The parents were not arrested Wednesday , and have remained free since Willie 's death .
They will appear in court for an arraignment hearing in about two weeks , Faraglia said .
Earlier this month , the Pacific Fishery Management Council met and created three public review options for the West Coast 2009 salmon season .
Unfortunately for commercial salmon fisherman in California , all three options include no season for the second year in a row .
Â California sport fisherman may be allowed to fish for 10 days in August and September under one option .
Â
The verdict is not out on an Oregon commercial salmon season yet .
Â
Options range from no season at all to allowing small catch quotas .

Last year ’s closure was a result of poor returns on the Sacramento River .
Â
Although things are looking up for the river , the expected returns are only sufficient to maintain the species .
According to the Curry Reporter :
While this year ’s returns are better than last year ’s , the season options are still limited .
Without any fishing , 122,196 fish are expected to return to the Sacramento River this year .
The minimum conservation goal is 122,000 â€ “ 180,000 spawning adult salmon .
The Klamath River is facing similar returns of only meeting the minimum natural spawning returns of 35,000 .
Â
Still , California fisherman are suffering from the closure on the heals of a poor dungeness crab season .
Dave Bitts , president of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen ’s Associations , expresses his concerns :
It ’s grim .
Â
The ocean conditions were supposed to have turned around and gotten a lot better , so I ’m kind of baffled , frankly .
Last year ’s ban cost coastal communities $ 250 million and over 2,200 people lost their jobs .
Â
We must fix our rivers to fix our economy .
You do n't have to look to hard to find bad science writing .
Here at Discoblog , we do our best to chronicle , analyze , and explain the worst of it , from the playing hockey with facts to the over - reliance on questionable studies to the always - popular " slapping pseudo - science on a stereotype and declaring bulletproof validation . "
But sometimes an article comes along that 's so egregious , so sloppy , so far from anything resembling actual fact , that even we are astonished .
Case in point : " Shopping is ' throwback to days of cavewomen , ' " a piece by Ben Leach at the U.K. Telegraph .
It refers to a study ( we use the term loosely ) led by David Holmes of Manchester Metropolitan University , which " found " that " skills that were learnt as cavemen and women were now being used in shops . "
According to Holmes :
Gatherers sifted the useful from things that offered them no sustenance , warmth or comfort with a skill that would eventually lead to comfortable shopping malls and credit cards .
In our evolutionary past , we gathered in caves with fires at the entrance .
We repeat this in warm shopping centres where we can flit from store to store without braving the icy winds .
The lead of the news article , found directly below a photo of a Nordic beauty staring lustfully into a shop window ( since , naturally , when an article like this refers to the " humans " who love shopping what it really means is " women " ) , reads as follows :
Shoppers are using instincts they learnt from their Neanderthal ancestors , researchers have found .
So let 's review : According to the study , we learned to spend our days in malls maxing out AmEx cards from our ancient Neanderthal precursors .
Except for the fact that Neanderthals are not direct ancestors of modern humans , and the two did n't have any overlap .
So just when did these " instinctual gathering " lessons occur ?
When we were all riding on the backs of Tyrannosaurs spearing woolly mammoths ?
Not to mention the glaring definitional problem :
If our non-ancestors are indeed responsible for " teaching " us all these spend - happy behaviors , how are they " instincts " ?
And to top it all off , you 'll never guess who commissioned the study :
The study was commissioned by Manchester Arndale shopping centre in response to a rise in January visitors , according to the Daily Express .

President Obama has indicated US policy on Cuba will change
The US Congress has voted to lift restrictions on relations with Cuba imposed by the Bush administration .
Cuban - Americans will be allowed to travel to the island once a year and send more money to relatives there .
Curbs on sending medicines and food have also been eased .
The measures were part of a $ 410 bn bill to fund US government operations .
The legislation was approved by the Senate after clearing the House of Representatives last month .
The bill was supported by two Cuban - American senators who had initially opposed it .
They changed their votes after receiving assurances from the Obama administration that the changes did not amount to a major reversal of the 47 - year - old US trade embargo on Cuba .
Lifeline
The legislation overturns rules imposed by the Bush administration which limited travel to just two weeks every three years , and confined visits to immediate family members .
President Obama - who needs to sign the bill - has said he supports it .
He has also indicated that he would be open to dialogue with Cuba 's leaders .
But he has said that like previous American presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo once Cuba 's communist government makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
Cuba 's President Raul Castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new US administration , providing there are no preconditions .
The BBC's Michael Voss in Havana says remittances from Cuban - Americans will provide an important lifeline in a country where the average salary is about $ 20 a month .
Let me ask you a quick question :
What demographic comes up with the best April Fool ’s pranks ?
College students ?
Internet pranksters ?
Independently funded joke - lovers ?
You might be surprised to find that companies –including media outlets–comes up with some of the most creative and believable pranks of all .
Here ’s a list of the 10 most hilarious April Fool ’s pranks by companies ( as derived from this fabulous Museum of Hoaxes list ) :
10 . Tesco ’s Whistling Carrots
In 2002 , Tesco ran a fake newspaper ad announcing the ‘ whistling carrot , ’ a carrot genetically modified to contain airholes on each side that caused the carrot to whistle when it finished cooking .
9. Lebanon Circle Magik Co. ’s Mummified Fairy
Lebanon Circle Magik Co. , a studio specializing in sculptures and curios , posted a picture of what appeared to be a mummified fairy on its homepage in 2007 .
The site explained that the fairy had been found by pedestrian in rural Derbyshire , leading to an explosion of online speculation about whether the fairy was real .
Even after owner Dan Baines revealed the hoax , people continued to believe the fairy mummy was real .
8. Signal - Disrupting Bras
In 1982 , the Daily Mail — a frequent April Fool ’s prankster — reported that 10,000 locally manufactured bras were interfering with radio and TV broadcasts through an extremely conductive copper underwire .
The metal in the underwire was normally used in fire alarms ; body heat and nylon made it produce signal - disrupting static electricity .
Quote :
The chief engineer of British Telecom , upon reading the article , immediately ordered that all his female laboratory employees disclose what type of bra they were wearing .
7. Sports Illustrated ’s Sidd Finch
Sports Illustrated took advantage of April Fool ’s Day in 1985 by publishing an article about Sidd Finch , a new Mets ’ recruit with a 168 - mph pitch .
Finch had purportedly learned the “ art of the pitch ” from a Tibetan master named Lama Milaraspa .
Mets fans went wild–until they learned it was a hoax .
6. Richard Branson ’s UFO
A mysterious flying saucer landed in a field near London on March 31 , 1989 .
The police arrived to inspect the scene and were shocked to see a human - like figure in a silver suit step out .
The “ alien ” was actually Virgin ’s Richard Branson , who had built a hot air balloon to resemble a UFO .
He had intended to land in Hyde Park on April Fool ’s Day , but the wind forced him to abandon the mission a day before April Fool’s .
5. Taco Bell Renames the Liberty Bell
In 1996 , Taco Bell announced that it was renaming the Liberty Bell to the Taco Liberty Bell .
The phone lines at Philadelphia ’s National Historic Park were clogged with citizen complaints at the unacceptable move .
Taco Bell enjoyed the joke for a few hours , after which it revealed the claim as a fake .
4. Swedish Color TV
In 1962 , Sweden ’s only TV channel broadcast in the news that viewers could get their black - and - white TV sets to display in full color by pulling a nylon stocking over the front of their TVs .
Thousands of people tried it — until the gag was revealed as an April Fool ’s hoax .
Color TV finally came to Sweden 8 years later .
3. Dick Smith ’s “ Iceberg ”
Dick Smith Foods a brand name in Australia .
In 1978 , owner and millionaire Dick Smith contracted a barge to tow an iceberg from Antarctica into the Sydney Harbor .
Smith said he would cut ice cubes from the iceberg and sell them for 10 cents a piece .
The public eagerly followed the iceberg ’s progress until rain washed off the shaving cream and firefighting foam that made up the exterior of the iceberg , which was really a combination of plastic and firefighting foam .
2. Burger King ’s Left - Handed Whopper
Burger King ran a full - page ad in USA Today in 1998 unveiling the Left - Handed Whopper , a burger whose condiments were turned 180 degrees to benefit left - handed consumers .
Burger King claimed that on the day of the joke , thousands of customers flocked to the chain to request the special Whoppers .
1. The BBC ’s Flying Penguins
The BBC has a reputation for April Fool ’s stunts , but last year ’s ( 2008 ) was one of the best .
The British news station announced that an Antarctica - based film crew had filmed Adelie penguins taking flight .
The video clip became an Internet sensation ( watch it to see why ) .
TEHRAN
The young Revolutionary Guardsman , in his light tan uniform , was all smiles .
“ I had longed to see a real American , ” he said , extending a hand .
We were standing near the shrine to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the man who inspired the Islamic Revolution whose defense is the mission of the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
“ And , what do you think ? ”
“ On the surface , great , ” Mohammad Piri , 21 , said .
“ But your government has done things that make me pessimistic . ”
Thirty years of noncommunication create a lot of mistrust .
The mistaken U.S. shooting down in 1988 of an Iran Air Airbus , killing 290 people , is often cited .
Conspiracy theories abound .
That the radical Sunni Taliban was an American creation designed to discomfort Shiite Iran is a near universal conviction .
The Obama administration , signaling a sharp departure from more than 20 years of federal policy , urged Congress on Wednesday to close the gap in prison sentences given to those convicted of dealing crack versus powdered cocaine .
Assistant Atty .
Gen. Lanny Breuer said the mandatory - minimum sentencing guidelines are so inherently unfair that they have undermined trust in the country ’s judicial institutions , particularly among minorities who bear the brunt of the law .
Currently , it takes 100 times more powdered cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger the same harsh mandatory minimum sentence .
Testifying before a Senate judiciary subcommittee , Breuer and other witnesses said that the guidelines , instituted in 1986 when authorities feared that crack use was becoming an epidemic , were based on faulty assumptions -- including that crack users were far more violent and dangerous to the community than powder cocaine users .

Breuer said the Obama administration and its Justice Department support equal sentencing for crack and powder cocaine dealers , and that sentence enhancements should be reserved for those who use weapons in drug trafficking crimes .
“ This administration believes our criminal laws should be tough , smart , fair and perceived as such by the American public , ” Breuer said .
To that end , he said , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has established a task force that will determine how to proceed , especially on the potentially explosive issue of establishing a retroactive policy .
The group will be headed by Deputy Atty .
Gen. David Ogden .
Critics of the current guidelines said that if Congress passed equal - sentencing legislation , it could affect thousands of families that have been torn apart .
“ This means a great deal , and more than symbolically , ” said Mary Price , vice president and general counsel of Families Against Mandatory Minimums .
She noted that although several bills to address the issue were pending in the House , previous Senate efforts to deal with sentencing disparity had been unsuccessful .

Breuer and other witnesses noted that applying a new law retroactively could swamp the courts with thousands of crack dealers seeking to have their sentences reduced .
The U.S. Sentencing Commission took an incremental step toward such retroactivity several years ago , which has strained the court system , U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton testified .
But the former federal prosecutor and drug policy official , who has been an outspoken opponent of the crack cocaine policy , said , “ I do n’t think we can let that burden impair us from doing what fundamentally has to be done to make our process fair . ”
Several senators , most of them Democrats , indicated that they supported such a change in policy but wanted to hear more details about how it could be implemented retroactively .
“ I think we need to know exactly what we ’re talking about , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) .

In the past , conservative senators have opposed changes in the law , saying they did not want to go easy on crack dealers .
But little of that was in evidence Wednesday .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) said he was concerned about testimony that indicated some juries were acquitting defendants rather than saddle them with long prison sentences for selling crack .

A frightening number of drug- related deaths in Mexico
Raymond Alvarez :
The quickly rising numbers graphically displayed on a Los Angeles Times web page are telling .
Mexico ’s drug war story is darkened by numbers , staggering numbers .
There were 7,337 drug- related deaths in 2008 , the Times reports .
The death toll from terrorist attacks in Mumbai last year approaches the average weekly body count in Juarez , which is just across the Rio Grande from El Paso , Texas .
Two years into a war on the drug cartels , the trend is not slowing .
USA Today reported Thursday ( Feb. 26 , 2009 ) that 1,000 have been killed in drug violence so far this year .
As the violence escalates Mexico President Felipe Calderon is coming under increasing criticism for ordering 45,000 troops and 5,000 federal police into 18 states .
Why are Mexicans taking to the streets to protest ?
The violence is not being contained .
Violence reaches far into U.S .
Along the U.S. - Mexico border , the region is a no - man ’s land of turf wars , kidnappings , and police intimidation that regularly claims the lives of Mexican lawmen .
On the U.S. side , authorities are reporting a spike in killings , kidnappings and home invasions connected to Mexico ’s murderous cartels .
And to the surprise of some , much of the violence is not confined to border towns .
Even cities a considerable distance away , places such as Phoenix and Atlanta , are affected .
Investigators fear violence could erupt elsewhere around the country because the Mexican cartels are believed to have operations all over the U.S. , in such far - flung places as Anchorage , Alaska ; Boston ; and Sioux Falls , S.D. On Wednesday ( Feb. 25 , 2009 ) , CBS News reported federal agents rounded up more than 750 suspects in a wide - ranging crackdown on Mexican drug cartels operating inside the U.S.
The operation netted 23 tons of illicit drugs , weapons and more than $ 63 million in cash .
If the numbers are disturbing , the trend toward more gruesome killings is all the more frightening .
More than 1,350 people died in Juarez last year in violence that included numerous beheadings and the killings of more than 60 police officers .
Unofficial tallies by the news media put the death toll so far this year at more than 300 in the state of Chihuahua , where Juarez is located .
In the long - running series called “ Mexico Under Siege , ” the Los Angeles Times has painted a picture of deteriorating conditions so severe some are drawing comparisons to war - torn Afghanistan .
Assassination list for U.S .
Ted Galen Carpenter , the vice president for defense and foreign - policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington , writes in an editorial for The Houston Chronicle :
While U.S. leaders focus on Afghanistan , Iran and other problems in distant regions , there is an alarming security problem brewing right next door .
Violence in Mexico , mostly related to the trade in illegal drugs , is spiraling out of control .
Even worse , it is increasingly apparent that the drug - traffickers are winning ….. …. Cartel enforcers have published lists of Americans , including police officers , who are targeted for assassination .
President Barack Obama must put the drug violence in Mexico at the top of his national security agenda .
While it is premature to describe Mexico as a full - blown failed state , as some experts have done , the situation has reached alarming proportions .
Almost daily , the headlines in major city publications and web pages carry fresh news of the war .
Here are but a few examples :
January 4 , 2009 New York Times : FELIPE ANGELES , Mexico – A string of kidnappings , singling out people with children or spouses in the United States , so panicked this village in the state of Zacatecas that many people boarded up their homes and headed north , some legally and some not …
“ The relatives of Mexicans in the United States have become a new profit center for Mexico ’s crime industry , ” said Rodolfo García Zamora , a professor at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas who studies migration trends .
“ Hundreds of families are emigrating out of fear of kidnap or extortion , and Mexicans in the U.S. are doing everything they can to avoid returning .
Instead , they ’re getting their relatives out . ”
The country ’s spiraling criminality appears not only to be keeping some Mexicans in the United States , but it may also be leading more Mexicans to flee their country .
“ It ’s a toxic combination right now , ” said Denise Dresser , a political scientist based in Mexico City .
“ Mexicans north of the border are facing joblessness and persecution , but in their own country the government can’t provide basic security for many of its citizens . ”
Feb 6 , 2009 Reuters TIJUANA , Mexico – Mexican drug gangs near the U.S. border are breaking into police radio frequencies to issue chilling death threats to cops which they then carry out , demoralizing security forces in a worsening drug war .
“ You ’re next , bastard … We ’re going to get you , ” an unidentified drug gang member said over the police radio in the city of Tijuana after naming a policeman .
The man also threatened a second cop by name and played foot - stomping “ narcocorrido ” music , popular with drug cartels , over the airwaves .
Sure enough , two hours later the dead bodies of the two named policemen were found dumped on the edge of the city .
Cartels killed some 530 police in Mexico last year , some of them corrupt officers who were working for rival gangs .
Others were killed in shoot - outs or murdered for working against the gangs or refusing to turn a blind eye to drug shipments .
Feb. 9 , 2009 MSNBC HOUSTON – More than 200 American citizens have been killed since 2004 in Mexico ’s escalating wave of violence , amounting to the highest number of unnatural deaths in any foreign country outside military combat zones , according to the U.S. State Department .
The deaths included a 22 - year - old Houston man and his 16 - year - old friend who were hauled out of a minivan and shot execution style .
They also included a 65 - year - old nurse from Brownsville found floating in the Rio Grande after visiting a Mexican beauty salon and a retiree stabbed to death while camping on a Baja beach , reported the Houston Chronicle in a story published Sunday , which examined hundreds of records related to the deaths .
The State Department tracks most American homicides abroad but releases few details about the deaths .
Most , however , occurred in border cities , including Tijuana , Ciudad Juarez and Nuevo Laredo , where violence has spiked with drug cartel feuds in recent years .
The Chronicle analysis showed some American homicide victims were involved in organized crime .
At least two dozen American victims were labeled as cartel hitmen , drug dealers , smugglers or gang members .
Others were drug users or wanted for crimes in the United States .
But in at least 70 other cases , the Americans were killed in Mexico while there on seemingly innocent business : visiting family , vacationing or living and working there .
The Council on Foreign Affairs carried an analysis in November 2008 .
The think tank writes that no progress can be made until Mexico ’s police and judiciary are reformed .
In the meantime , concerns mount about drug - related violence spilling across the border .
Calderon has sought U.S. assistance to tackle the problem .
A new aid package known as the Merida Initiative will provide $ 400 million in equipment and communications systems this year , with plans for further funding in the next two years .
Some Mexican and U.S. analysts criticize the package for its focus on equipment rather than training and institution building .
Others note that the package does not address how to reduce U.S. drug demand , the council said .
How did things go so wrong for so long ?
Mexico ’s drug cartels are rumored to supply campaign funds in elections .
The U.S. has been a generous partner in the war on crime , but critics say money is not directed at reforming the system .
Corruption is entrenched .
Harvard International Review wrote in December 2008 :
Mexico ’s Department of Defense estimated that , of the half million Mexicans involved in narco - trafficking in Mexico , at least one third are ex-military officers .
While these new figures are shocking , the trend ( soldiers deserting the military and joining the cartels ) is not new .
In the 1990s , the U.S. helped to train an elite force of Mexican soldiers to take on the cartels .
Not long afterward , the cartels offered to hike their salaries , and most defected .
They became Los Zetas , one of the most formidable mafia organizations in the country .
The Review went on to say that it would appear at this point that there are only a handful of realistic options for dealing with Mexico ’s cartels , none of which are particularly attractive :
1. Decriminalization of illicit drug sales .
2. Complete militarization of Mexican society , including a draft to increase the size of the army , and support from the United States for aggressive military assaults on the cartels .
3 . The final option is to negotiate with the cartels , just as the U.S. has considered negotiating with the Taliban .
To the Review list I might add the most sensible and appealing : More aggressive prosecution of drug criminals here in the U.S.
But none of the options are very attractive .
Our nations have arrived at a crossroads .
We must stop the flow of drugs here .
The outlook could not be more grim as Mexico faces growing isolation .
Tourism in affected areas , particularly Tijuana and Jarez , is drying up quickly .
Who can blame anyone for staying away ?
Who wants to venture into Mexico to be caught in heavy lines as the military steps up its vehicle inspections ?
Tourists may want to think twice about traveling to traditional playgrounds .
Economic hit
Some may be tempted to think that Mexico ’s problems are Mexico ’s , that the whole mess can be walled off .
Unfortunately , Mexico ’s stability is vital to the U.S. , both strategically and economically .
Mexico is the third most important source of oil to the United States .
Output has been dropping since 2005 , though .
A package of energy reforms passed Mexico ’s Congress on October 28 , but industry experts say it likely does not go far enough to attract the kind of private investment needed to build capacity .
Mexico also is the third largest trading partner to the U.S. , behind China and Canada .
Obviously , we can ill - afford to do nothing , even if our financial own crisis has us preoccupied .

Macros are a Menace
Dan Weinreb invited me to hold the " macros are bad " side of a debate held at the 2009 International Lisp Conference in Boston .
My backup was Richard Gabriel .
Opposing me was Pascal Costanza , with Guy Steele as his backup .
Dan Weinreb was moderating , although his facade of neutrality cracked pretty fast and he wound up backing up Pascal as well .
( As did the rest of the audience .
Lion 's den and all that . )
I think people enjoyed my talk , even if they did n't agree with it .

Two hundred years ago this week , the warship HMS Warren Hastings was struck by a weird phenomenon : " Three distinct balls of fire " fell from the heavens , striking the ship and killing two crewmen , leaving behind " a nauseous , sulfurous smell , " according to the Times of London .
Ball lightning has been the subject of much scientific scrutiny over the years .
And , as with many powerful natural phenomena , the question arises : " Can we turn it into a weapon ? "
Peculiar as it may seem , that ’s exactly what some researchers are working on — even though it has n’t even been properly replicated in the laboratory yet .
The exact cause and nature of ball lighting has yet to be determined ; there may be several different types , confusing matters further .
But generally it manifests as a grapefruit - sized sphere of light moving slowly through the air which may end by fizzling out or exploding .
In the mid-’60s , the U.S. military started exploring ways that the phenomenon might be weaponized .
Take this 1965 Defense Technical Information Center report on Survey of Kugelblitz Theories For Electromagnetic Incendiaries , ( Kugelblitz is German for ball lighting ) .
The document summarizes and evaluates the ball lightning theories then prevalent , and recommends " a theoretical and experimental Kugelblitz program … as a means of developing the theory into a weapons application . "
This led to an Air Force program called Harness Cavalier , which seems to have ended without producing anything conclusive .
However , some years later scientist Dr. Paul Koloc was looking at methods of containing high - temperature plasma during nuclear fusion .
There are many schemes for containing plasma in donut - shaped magnetic fields using a device called a Tokomak .
Koloc ’s insight was that , under the right conditions , a donut - shaped mass of moving plasma would generate the required fields for containment itself .
No Tokomak would be required for this " plasmoid , " which would be completely stable and self - sustaining .
It is a very close equivalent of the smoke ring — another type of dynamic " vortex ring , " which remains stable over a period of time , unlike an unstructured cloud of smoke .
Koloc also theorized that if a donut - shaped plasmoid was created accidentally — say , during a lightning strike — it would remain stable for a period of seconds of minutes .
This he believes is the explanation for ball lightning .
He has a lot of competition from other , wildly different theories of ball lightning , though , from nanobatteries to vaporized silicon to black holes .
There is no scientific consensus .
In the ’80s , Koloc ’s team succeeded in creating small , short - lived plasmoids from " chicken egg to softball " size in the laboratory .
It was a good start , but not enough to convince the world that he ’s right about ball lightning .
Ultimately the work might lead to a means of containing nuclear fusion … but there were some engineering challenges to tackle .
Moreover , the scientific mainstream has not bought into the concept .
While giant programs to achieve controlled fusion like ITER are sucking up billions , Koloc has found it much harder to attract funding .
This is not like cold fusion or bubble fusion which has been challenged on scientific grounds , but it ’s been very much sidelined in favor of other " confinement concepts " for fusion power .
However , in 2002 , Koloc ’s company , Prometheus II , briefly obtained funding from the Missile Defence Agency .
The aim was to create stable ‘ magnetoplasmoids ’ a foot in diameter which would last between one and five seconds .
In the subsequent phase , the magnetoplasmoid would be compressed and accelerate to two hundred kilometers a second .
This " encapsulated EMP bullet " would make an idea anti-missile weapon , generating an intense electromagnetic pulse on impact which would scramble the guidance system and any electronics , as well as causing thermal damage .
Koloc called the weapon " Phased Hyper - Acceleration for Shock , EMP , and Radiation " — PHASER .
" It can be used for a range of purposes from stunning personnel to destroying the functionality of electronically operated devices , smaller rockets , vehicles and packages that represent an immediate threat to the United States , " he wrote .
" This dial - able PHASER weapon can be set on ‘ Stun ’ or dialed down , selecting a non-lethal level for persons needed for later interrogation …
One mundane application for law enforcement would be the disruption of the engine electronics to stop vehicles that would otherwise be the target of a high - speed chase .
Dialable versions of the PHASER will be available for use in civilian encounters . "
Nothing seems to have resulted after the Phase I contract , so I contacted Koloc to see how his research had progressed .
He confirmed that they had successfully formed plasmoids a foot in diameter , but that these could not be made sufficiently stable .
To make it work and overcome the stability problem , they need a device known as a " fast rising parallel plate transmission line . "
There was not enough funding for this and the company is still trying to raise funds .
" Once the re-engineered formation system becomes operational , we will proceed to form plasmoids of approximately 35 to 45 centimeters in diameter with a stable lifetime of from one to thirty seconds , " says Prometheus II Vice President D. M. Cooper .
" The plasmoids should be rugged and energetic , and should attain quiescence ( thus becoming very stable ) within two or three milliseconds of the formation pulse .
The plasmoids will be useful for energy applications even if the military applications are not pursued . "
So a ball lightning weapon remains tantalizingly out of reach –- or does it ?
As I noted in a previous article on military ball lightning , the USAF ’s Phillips Laboratory examined a very similar concept in 1993 .
Again , this involved accelerating a donut - shaped mass of plasma to high speed as an anti-missile weapon in a project called Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed Energy and Radiation , or MARAUDER .
Based on the Air Force ’s awesome Shiva Star power system , experiments spat out plasmoids at ultra-high speed that were expected to reach 3,000 kilometers a second by 1995 .
But nothing was published after 1993 , and MARAUDER was classified , disappearing into the black world of secret programs .
Ball lighting is still mysterious 200 years later … and the next time a warship gets struck by weird fireballs they will probably be as baffled as were the sailors aboard the HMS Warren Hastings .
The question of what makes a journalist is due for yet another round of debate , now that Congress is weighing two competing versions of a federal shield law for reporters .
Last Friday , the Senate introduced its own version of the Free Flow of Information Act , a follow - up to the House 's action two days before .
Both versions would provide new -- if limited -- protection against subpoenas for journalists , and both version contain a range of exceptions .
Both bills were introduced in 2007 as well , with the House version passing overwhelmingly despite a veto threat .
The Senate bill was passed easily out of committee only to die without a vote of the full chamber as the session ran out of time .
( For details on the previous bills , see previous CMLP posts here , here , here , and here . )
Again , the 2009 bills differ in a key respect , namely in how they define journalists .
The Senate bill is fairly straightforward and generous in this regard .
It covers a person " who is engaged in journalism , " and defines the latter by :
the regular gathering , preparing , collecting , photographing , recording , writing , editing , reporting , or publishing of news or information that concerns local , national , or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public .
The House version , on the other hand , puts limits on who is covered in a way that potentially leaves most bloggers and many others outside the protective zone of the shield .
From the bill :
The term " covered person " means a person who regularly gathers , prepares , collects , photographs , records , writes , edits , reports , or publishes news or information that concerns local , national , or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public for a substantial portion of the person 's livelihood or for substantial financial gain and includes a supervisor , employer , parent , subsidiary , or affiliate of such covered person .
" Substantial " is n't defined , but one would assume that many bloggers , student journalists and even those who freelance for magazines or papers that pay poorly , could have a hard time utilizing the protections afforded by the bill , should this version become law .
It 's an old question , this issue of who qualifies as a journalist .
And it has been part of the debate over the so - called reporter 's privilege for decades , at least since Branzburg v. Hayes , 408 U.S. 665 ( 1972 ) , the 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision that ruled against press protections in 1972 .
The Louisville Courier - Journal reporter Paul Branzburg lost the case , but the fifth vote came from a sympathetic corner .
Justice Powell voted with the majority to compel Branzburg 's testimony , but penned an enigmatic concurrence that has been cited by many federal courts to bolster the idea that there is some protection , no matter how ill defined , stemming from the First Amendment :
The Court does not hold that newsmen , subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury , are without constitutional rights with respect to the gathering of news or in safeguarding their sources .
Branzburg , 408 U.S. at 709 ( Powell , J. , concurring ) .
A federal statute establishing a qualified journalists ' privilege would bring much - needed clarity and uniformity to this area of law , and it would also represent a historic step forward in vindicating the public 's right to know .
It 'll be a shame , though , if a shield law passes with the House language that effectively shuts out most bloggers and other independent journalists .
It will be journalism history , but with an asterisk .
With eight Oscars , including Best Motion Picture , Slumdog Millionaire was the absolute winner of last week 's Academy Awards show .
As was to be expected , Hollywood 's praise bumped up the download numbers of the film on BitTorrent .
Hundreds and thousands of people have downloaded the film this week .
This week there are only three newcomers in our BitTorrent download chart , including the Oscar winners Milk and Slumdog Millionaire .
Although the DVD Screener of Slumdog Millionaire has been available since December last year , it never made it into our weekly top 10 up until now .
According to our estimates the film was downloaded close to a million times after it won the awards last Sunday .
The data for our weekly download chart is collected by TorrentFreak , and is for informational and educational reference only .

I 've written about one of my heroes , Ben Goldacre , before : he writes the Bad Science column for the UK newspaper The Guardian , and is a tireless fighter against medical nonsense like vitamins curing AIDS , homeopathy , and chiropractic .
He 's in some hot water right now .
As I mentioned in February , a " journalist " named Jeni Barnett , who went on the radio and basically spewed dangerous antivax nonsense for an hour .
Ben posted the entire audio clip , and predictably the radio station asked him to take it down .
In America , given copyright restrictions , that would be understandable , but in the UK the laws are different , and the legality of this is questionable .
What I do n't understand is the radio station 's steadfast defense for themselves in their right to air fearmongering conspiracy theories which spend a lot of air time telling parents it 's better to put their kids at serious risk of fatal diseases than to get a simple vaccination , and to air someone saying demonstrably incorrect things while doing it .
Where does personal or company pride end when it puts little children at risk ?
Ben created an excellent short video news segment which is now on YouTube .
I strongly urge everyone to watch it and spread the word .
People like Jeni Barnett have a right to speech , but speech , even free , comes with a price when it advocates parents putting their kids at risk .
This story needs to be heard .
An aide says the prime minister 's fury has seen him hurl pens and a stapler as well as shoving a printer off a desk
What happens when Gordon Brown gets angry ?
The laser printer gets it
I 've read plenty of stories about Gordon Brown 's rage before ( normally involving mobile phones or a stapler ) , but I had never heard any anecdotes about a laser printer getting it in the neck until today .
This comes from Bloomberg , a pretty reliable news source :
The strain shows , say current and former Brown aides : among other things , it has inflamed a temper that has always been the subject of gallows humour among those who work with him .
The prime minister , 58 , has hurled pens and even a stapler at aides , according to one ; he also says he once saw the leader of Britain 's 61 million people shove a laser printer off a desk in a rage .
Another aide was warned to watch out for " flying Nokias " when he joined Brown 's team .
The tale crops up in a lengthy piece about Brown that also contains a description of how the prime minister 's aides have apparently learned to cope with his behaviour : they 've invented the " news sandwich " .
One staffer says a colleague developed a technique called a " news sandwich " – first telling the prime minister about a recent piece of good coverage before delivering bad news , and then moving quickly to tell him about something good coming soon .
Update , 11.30 am : I 've just come back from the daily Downing Street briefing for lobby journalists .
After 10 minutes on GDP figures , Gurkhas , MPs ' expenses etc , someone had to lower the tone and ask about this – and I 'm afraid it was me .
This is what the prime minister 's spokesman said in reply :
I think it is the sort of unsubstantiated , unsourced nonsense that you would expect to read in Sunday newspapers , not on the supposedly respectable financial wire services .
There was then a lovely moment of humour when someone else asked : " But is it untrue , though ? "
The spokesman said it was " the sort of nonsense that you might expect to read in diary columns " and " not an account that I recognise " .
But he did not actually say it was untrue .

Los Angeles commercial property landlords are going green on a bigger scale than their counterparts in other cities , the federal Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday .
The EPA awarded the most Energy Star ratings in the country last year to Los Angeles , where 262 buildings earned the agency ’s conservation designation .
Energy Star buildings use at least 35 % less energy than average buildings and emit 35 % less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
The sheer size of Los Angeles suggests it would have the most buildings going green , but size was n’t the only factor , said EPA spokeswoman Maura Beard .
“ California often leads the country in being progressive in looking at the environment and looking at what they can do , ” she said .
San Francisco came in second in the country .
Rounding out the top 10 in 2008 were Houston ; Washington ; Dallas - Fort Worth ; Chicago ; Denver ; Minneapolis- St. Paul ; Atlanta ; and Seattle .

One Los Angeles - area Energy Star - rated building is Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center San Pedro , where operators pushed for improvements because they knew they could save money while doing the right thing , said Andy Goldschmidt , the hospital ’s director of facilities .
“ We aggressively tried to make this happen , ” he said .
Steps included upgrading to energy - saving lighting and installing more efficient motors for elevators , fans and other mechanical systems .
Among the results was a 2.4 % reduction in electricity use , which saved the hospital $ 90,000 last year .
“ We spent $ 300,000 on this program over the past three years , but we ’ve already made it back , ” Goldschmidt said .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans , frustrated by endless waits at the doctor 's office , are sidestepping their family physician and taking their rashes , strep throat and pink eye to stores such as Wal - Mart and Walgreens instead .
As this trend gains more traction , experts say it could define the market for primary care .
" In many ways these retail clinics are a response to a broken health care system , " said Jonathan Weiner , professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
" Not everyone has good access to primary care .
We 're also dealing with a shortage of primary care doctors in this country , " he said .
Public health experts say retail clinics can , to some extent , fill the gap .
But there 's one caveat .
" I suspect these store clinics will be around for a long time , but they wo n't take over everything that a doctor can do , " said Dr. Sherry Glied , chairwoman of the Mailman School Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University 's School of Public Health .
Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , Walgreens ( WAG , Fortune 500 ) , CVS ( CVS , Fortune 500 ) and Rite - Aid ( RAD , Fortune 500 ) are among an expanding number of retailers that operate in - store health clinics .
It 's not merely a public service .
Bruce Carlson , publisher with health care market research firm Kalorama Information says retail clinics are a lucrative niche market for merchants .
The firm said these clinics numbered just over 1,200 in 2008 with annual revenue of $ 545 million .
By 2013 , Carlson said the total is estimated to reach 2,400 with revenue of about $ 2 billion .
These " retail clinics " are typically staffed by nurse practitioners .
They administer vaccinations and treat customers - both uninsured and insured - for minor ailments .
They also test for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes .
Although in - store clinics have only been around for a few years , it 's only recently that their appeal has grown with consumers , according to the latest industry survey from consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail .
The survey , which polled 1,500 consumers , showed awareness about retail clinics has jumped to 56 % in 2009 , up from 38 % in 2007 .
The survey also showed that usage of store clinics has increased the most among younger consumers , who are less likely to have ties to a family physician or to have insurance .
Another group - consumers making $ 100,000 or more per year - are warming up to retail clinics faster than low - income or uninsured consumers who may not be able to afford the average $ 60 fee .
Candace Corlett , principal and retail analyst with consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail , said the overall appeal of retail clinics is the convenience they offer .
" Suppose I have a sore throat and I do n't have time to go to the doctor , but I still have to buy my groceries , " said Corlett .
" I can stop at Walgreens after work , pick up my milk , and have my throat checked at the same time . "
Health care as a commodity
Corlett believes the survey findings indicate consumers are treating health care as a commodity .
" Just like you pick your favorite store to get your beauty advice and products , people are picking their favorite store to get their earache treated , " she said .
" There 's a cultural shift that 's going on with how we approach health care , and I think the retail market is ready for health care becoming a commodity , " Corlett said .
No . 1 drug store chain CVS already operates more than 500 MinuteClinics at its stores nationwide .
Rival Walgreens plans to expand its health and wellness clinics to more than 800 in - store locations by the end of the year .
Recently , Walgreens announced it would offer free care until the end of the year to people who are unemployed and uninsured .
" This is Walgreens being opportunistic .
What a great way to get people to develop a new habit of using retail clinics , " said Corlett .
Wal - Mart , the largest retailer , opened its first " limited scope " walk - in clinic in 2005 and currently operates more than 70 clinics in its stores .
Even supermarkets such as Safeway ( SWY , Fortune 500 ) and Kroger ( KR , Fortune 500 ) are staffing nurse practitioners in a few stores .
Will store clinics replace doctors ?
In addition to offering a no longer than 15 to 20 minute wait and comparatively low cost versus a doctor 's office , Johns Hopkins '
Weiner said price transparency is another big selling point of store clinics .
Weiner said price transparency has become increasingly important as employers try to control their health care costs by offering workers tax - free savings vehicles such as health savings accounts ( HSA ) or health reimbursement arrangements ( HRA ) .
These options typically lower premiums but raise deductibles before the insurance coverage sets in .
The clinics allow consumers to keep better track of their account balances .
" Store clinics clearly advertise their prices , but most doctors do n't , " Weiner said .
" This could be a competitive threat for doctors . "
Still , both Weiner and Glied said store clinics are unlikely to fully replace doctors anytime soon .
" Right now people are using them for four things .
Colds , sore throats , earaches and flu shots , " Weiner said .
" When it 's something more serious than this , most people want to go to a doctor . "
" No one really believes that retail clinics should be the model for health care , " he said .
However , if store clinics eventually collaborate with other sources such as HMOs and hospitals , and expand services to deal with more urgent care , it could shake up the primary care market , Weiner said .
" The way they exist today , they are ideal for busy moms and adults with colds , " said Weiner .
A portrait of Martha Washington , painted by Eliphalet F. Andrews in 1878 , hangs in the East Room of the White House
Martha Washington 's silk - and - sequin wedding shoes , which once featured glittery buckles , are on display at Mount Vernon until Feb. 23 . ( By Gavin Ashworth )
A team of Forensic anthropologists used the 1796 portrait of Mrs. Washington to create an image of what a young Martha Washington would have looked like in her 20s , inspiring this painting by Michael Deas .
MOUNT VERNON , Va. , Feb. 2 ( UPI ) --
The sequined purple silk high heels Martha Washington wore to marry George show she was n't frumpy , say curators in Virginia .
The wedding shoes , on display at Mount Vernon through Feb. 23 , are part of a revamping of the first first lady 's image , said Edward Lengel , senior editor at the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia .

" We always see Martha with a withered face in her old age .
But she was quite a beautiful woman in her younger years , and Washington loved her deeply , " Lengel told The Washington Post in a story published Monday .
Contrary to popular opinion , Martha was not fat when she married George , Lengel said , adding that she loved reading Gothic romance novels and was a much sought - after diminutive beauty who handily managed five plantations left to her when her first husband died .
Portraying Martha as dumpy served to foster a sense of legitimacy for the fledgling nation , said Emily Shapiro , a curator at Mount Vernon , the Washington home near Alexandria , Va .
" The country was still so young , " she said .
" I think it was reassuring to see its leaders as older , distinguished , stately and gray - haired people . "
( CNN ) --
An Ohio man who was suspended as the drum major of a band for giving President Obama a nod during last week 's inaugural parade is calling it quits .
John Coleman quit his band after it suspended him for nodding to President Obama last week .
John Coleman resigned from the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipes & Drums a week after the parade in Washington .
Publicity about his suspension had gotten to be too much , he told CNN affiliate WEWS .
" It 's come to a point where I do n't want embarrassment anymore between the pipe band and myself , " Coleman , who is a firefighter , told WEWS on Tuesday .
Coleman was seen during the nationally televised January 20 parade nodding toward the new president while marching with the band .
A few steps later , he appeared to wave briefly .
He told WEWS that as the band was marching past the grandstand where Obama was sitting , he made eye contact with the president .
" Contact was made with our eyes both together and he smiled and waved at the band , " he told the station .
" And just as a gesture , I nodded my head .
I gave him a slight wave and went on . "
Watch parade and explanation »
Representatives from the group did not return calls from CNN .
But bandleader Mike Engle told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Coleman was suspended because he ignored military protocol .
" We had gone over and over time and again with everyone in the band that this was a military parade , " Engle told the newspaper .
" Protocol and proper decorum had to be followed at all times .
Unfortunately , John chose to ignore that . "
Coleman had been suspended from the band for six months .
In a written statement , band manager Ken Rybka said Coleman 's resignation from the group " comes as a shock and surprise . "
The band has been inundated with phone calls , e-mails and messages on its Internet pages -- almost all of them critical -- since the story first broke on Monday , Rybka said .
iReport.com : ' Pretty cool thing that he acknowledged the president '
" It is unfortunate that an internal band issue has raised so much discussion and ire from the general public , " Rybka said in the statement .
" It has disheartened me more than you can imagine . "
Rybka said that he will be taking a leave of absence from the band because of the furor .
" The ' afterglow ' of participating in the inaugural parade is gone , " he said .

From HaskellWiki
Haskell requires an explicit type for operations involving input and output .
This way it makes a problem explicit , that exists in every language : Input and output functions can have so many effects , that the type signature says more or less that almost everything must be expected .
It is hard to test them , because they can in principle depend on every state of the real world .
Thus in order to maintain modularity you should avoid IO wherever possible .
It is too tempting to get rid of IO by unsafePerformIO , but we want to present some clean techniques to avoid IO .
Lazy construction
You can avoid a series of output functions by constructing a complex data structure with non-IO code and output it with one output function .
Instead of
-- import Control .
Monad ( replicateM_ ) replicateM_ 10 ( putStr " foo " )
you can also create the complete string and output it with one call of putStr :
putStr ( concat $ replicate 10 " foo " )
Similarly ,
do h <- openFile " foo " WriteMode replicateM_ 10 ( hPutStr h " bar " ) hClose h
can be shortened to
writeFile " foo " ( concat $ replicate 10 " bar " )
which also ensures proper closing of the handle h in case of failure .
Since you have now an expression for the complete result as string , you have a simple object that can be re-used in other contexts .
E.g. , you can also easily compute the length of the written string using length without bothering the file system , again .
Writer monad
If the only reason that you need IO is to output information ( e.g. logging , collecting statistics ) , a Writer monad might do the job .
This technique works just fine with lazy construction , especially if the lazy object that you need to create is a Monoid .
An inefficient example of logging :
logText :: ( MonadWriter String m ) => String -> m () logText text = tell ( text ++ "
" ) do logText " Before operation A " opA logText " After operation A "
( This is " inefficient " , because String means [ Char ] , tell " writes " to the " end " of the log using mappend , and mappend for lists ( i.e. (++ ) ) is O ( n ) , where n is the length of the left - hand list ( i.e. the log ) .
In other words , the bigger the log gets , the slower logging becomes .
To avoid this , you should generally use a type that has O ( 1 ) mappend , such as Data .
Sequence , and fold the complete log ( using Foldable ) afterwards if you need to . )
State monad
If you want to maintain a running state , it is tempting to use IORef .
But this is not necessary , since there is the comfortable State monad and its transformer counterpart .
Another example is random number generation .
In cases where no real random numbers are required , but only arbitrary numbers , you do not need access to the outside world .
You can simply use a pseudo random number generator with an explicit state .
This state can be hidden in a State monad .
Example : A function which computes a random value with respect to a custom distribution ( distInv is the inverse of the distribution function ) can be defined via IO
randomDist :: ( Random a , Num a ) => ( a -> a ) ->
IO a randomDist distInv = liftM distInv ( randomRIO ( 0 , 1 ) )
but there is no need to do so .
You do n't need the state of the whole world just for remembering the state of a random number generator , instead you can use something similar to this :
randomDist :: ( RandomGen g , Random a , Num a ) => ( a -> a ) ->
State g a randomDist distInv = liftM distInv ( State ( randomR ( 0 , 1 ) ) )
You can get actual values by running the State as follows :
evalState ( randomDist distInv ) ( mkStdGen an_arbitrary_seed )
ST monad
In some cases a state monad is simply not efficient enough .
Say the state is an array and the update operations are modification of single array elements .
For this kind of application the State Thread monad ST was invented .
It provides STRef as replacement for IORef , STArray as replacement for IOArray , STUArray as replacement for IOUArray , and you can define new operations in ST , but then you need to resort to unsafe operations by using the unsafeIOtoST function .
You can escape from ST to non-monadic code in a safe , and in many cases efficient , way .
Applicative functor style
Say you have written the function
translate :: String ->
IO String translate word = do dict <- readDictionary " english-german.dict " return ( Map .
findWithDefault word word dict )
You can only call this function within the IO monad , and it is not very efficient either , since for every translation the dictionary must be read from disk .
You can rewrite this function in a way that it generates a non-monadic function that can be used anywhere .
makeTranslator :: IO ( String -> String ) makeTranslator = do dict <- readDictionary " english-german.dict " return ( \ word ->
Map .
findWithDefault word word dict ) main :: IO ( ) main = do translate <- makeTranslator putStr ( unlines ( map translate [ " foo " , " bar " ] ) )
I call this Applicative Functor style because you can use the application operator from Control .
Applicative :
makeTranslator <*> getLine
Custom monad type class
If you only use a small set of IO operations in otherwise non-IO code you may define a custom monad type class which implements just these functions .
You can then implement these functions based on IO for the application and without IO for the test suite .
As an example consider the function
localeTextIO :: String -> IO String
which converts an English phrase to the currently configured user language of the system .
You can abstract the IO away using
class Monad m =>

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner By Alex Brandon , AP WASHINGTON  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday that the vast majority of U.S. banks are well capitalized , even while conceding that many have curtailed business and consumer lending despite receiving billions of dollars in federal bailout funds .
" Currently , the vast majority of banks have more capital than they need to be considered well capitalized by their regulators , " Geithner told a special oversight panel on Capitol Hill .
His comments cheered investors , who pushed bank stocks higher .
Geithner added , however , that skittishness about the economy and trillions of " toxic " mortgages and other assets clogging bank balance sheets have " sharply reduced lending across the financial system , working against economic recovery . "
WHO GOT HOW MUCH : Sortable list of TARP recipients BAILOUT PROBES : ' Almost 20 ' investigations
The Treasury secretary faced tough questions from the panel , which is overseeing implementation of a $ 700 billion financial rescue law .
Treasury has about $ 110 billion remaining under the law , which Geithner said had produced " mixed " results .
A special inspector general report Tuesday said a private - public partnership designed to buy up bad assets under the law is tilted in favor of private investors .
Also Tuesday , the International Monetary Fund predicted that U.S. financial firms could lose $ 2.7 trillion through 2010 .
Global losses could top $ 4 trillion .
Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren , chair of the oversight panel , pressed Treasury to make its programs more transparent and more equitable .
" People are angry that , even if they have consistently paid their bills on time and never missed a payment , their ( federally ) assisted banks are unilaterally raising their interest rates or slashing their credit lines , " Warren said .
While Geithner said most banks were adequately capitalized , markets are nervously awaiting the results of a special Treasury " stress test " of 19 large lenders to see if they can weather a deep recession .
Geithner said banks found to need capital will have options , such as raising private funds or converting government investments to common equity shares from preferred shares .
While Geithner defended the administration strategy of recapitalizing large banks , elsewhere on Capitol Hill top economists criticized the approach .
" The United States currently faces economic turmoil related directly to a loss of confidence in our largest financial institutions , because policymakers accepted the idea that some firms are just too big to fail .
I do not , " said Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig .

Expertos prevén larga indagatoria ; temen expulsiones
[ email protected ]
El Vaticano ordenó ayer una “ visita apostólica ” a los Legionarios de Cristo para revisar el estado en que se encuentra la congregación religiosa .
Los investigadores Jorge Traslosheros y Elio Masferrer explicaron que la disposición es un “ instrumento duro ” que la Santa Sede aplica cuando pretende “ limpiar o purificar ” ciertos actos .
Previeron una larga indagatoria y no descartaron que dentro de la depuración haya expulsados .
La orden religiosa , que posee una importante influencia en los medios empresarial , político y educativo , ha estado en el centro de la polémica en los últimos años luego de que se conoció que su fundador , el padre Marcial Maciel , estuvo vinculado en abusos sexuales a seminaristas y que procreó una hija .
Por esa razón , en mayo de 2006 el papa Benedicto XVI llamó a Maciel a retirarse del sacerdocio y de todo ministerio público .
Masferrer consideró que la visita apostólica a una de las órdenes religiosas que aporta amplios recursos a el Vaticano es una llamada al orden del Papa , en medio de una crisis de credibilidad de la Iglesia católica .
“ Si fue ordenada esta visita , es porque el Vaticano tiene información de que algo no está funcionando como debiera ” , mencionó Traslosheros , quien recordó que Benedicto XVI , cuando era el cardenal Joseph Ratzinger y prefecto de la Congregación para la Doctrina de la Fe , ya había investigado las acusaciones contra Maciel .
Ambos especialistas destacaron que el anuncio se haya dado en el periodo de la Cuaresma , que para el catolicismo representa un periodo de revisión , arrepentimiento y reconciliación .
A través de su director general , Álvaro Corcuera , la Legión de Cristo hizo pública la investigación instrumentada desde el Vaticano .
Sitting in a bare cubicle , with her reading glasses perched halfway down her nose and typing away on a laptop she ’d brought from home , Lois Draegin looked a bit like the extra adult wedged in at the kids ’ table at Thanksgiving .
This accomplished magazine editor lost her six - figure job at TV Guide last spring and is now , at 55 , an unpaid intern at wowOwow.com , a fledgling website with columns and stories that target accomplished women older than 40 .
“ The Women on the Web , ” or WOW , needed Draegin ’s magazine - world wisdom , and she needed their guidance through a maze of technology that was as baffling to her as hieroglyphics .
In a search for a new job in the media , she had suddenly found herself techno - challenged .
She did n’t know a URL from SEO .
It was n’t until she was teamed up with Randi Bernfeld at WOW that she understood the obsession with terms such as search engine optimization ( a method to increase traffic to a website ) or used Google Trends to pick story topics and write a uniform resource locater ( Web address ) .

“ She ’s my mentor , ” Draegin said of 24 - year - old Bernfeld .
“ No , she ’s my mentor , ” Bernfeld replied .
They were working at adjacent desks , and most often it was Draegin who was asking Bernfeld questions across the barrier .
Joni Evans , former president of Simon & Schuster and chief executive of WOW , has recruited several other victims of the downsizing in publishing as interns -- her site ’s way of doing good in a bad economy .

“ I think of this as a very WOW model -- women helping women , bringing us all back to our true ethic of empowering each other , ” Evans said .
She is one of five founders of the site ; the others are columnist Peggy Noonan , “ 60 Minutes ” correspondent Lesley Stahl , advertising executive Mary Wells and gossip columnist Liz Smith .
Draegin took the internship at WOW as a creative way to fill out her resume while waiting out a collision of bad events that has stalled her career :
She is in a media industry that was in a free - fall even before the recession took hold .
Other laid - off workers are attempting to be inventive by using newer social networking tools like LinkedIn and Twitter to find jobs .
Some are even employing what Betsy Werley of the Transition Network calls the “ extreme consulting model . ”
“ These are people who have defined a great set of skills and said , ‘ Since everybody is stretched and needs some of what I can provide , I ’m going to work as many different jobs as I can . ’
Employers are more flexible about how they think of workers , and employees are more accepting of what ’s acceptable to me . ”

Werley cited the example of a lawyer who is training as a mediator while getting paid to be a career coach , a public school advocate and a lawyer .
“ She ’s using every skill she has , ” Werley said .
Still others are more like Draegin , delaying what could be a futile job search by trying to learn something new .
A group that focuses on sabbaticals , yoursabbatical.com , reported that an out - of - work consultant who recognized early on that it was a terrible time to job - hunt decided to do a Spanish immersion in Peru for three months , giving the economy a little time to strengthen , and allowing him to return with “ fluent in Spanish ” on his resume .

After Draegin started at WOW ’s unglamorous offices in Midtown Manhattan , no one knew quite how to describe her position .
Was she a “ senior ” intern , an “ executive ” intern , a “ midcareer ” intern -- or , as she prefers , an apprentice ?
“ We ’re just glad to have her , ” said Deborah Barrow , WOW ’s editor in chief , who knew Draegin from the magazine network and dreamed up this scheme to give her a two - month , three - mornings - a - week internship .
Draegin has been getting a lot out of the experience because this has not been a business - as - usual internship .
As in : Get me my coffee , pick up my dry cleaning , and if you ’re lucky , by the end of the summer we ’ll let you write a caption .

Draegin has been learning by doing and watching and asking for help .
Arriving before 8 one day , her immediate task was to look for story ideas and mash together information from other websites into a brief news item for the “ Wow Watch ” column .
Finding topics was easy enough -- Draegin fits WOW ’s demographic and instinctively understands the interests of its savvy readers .
But she repeatedly had to check her gut instincts against that all - important tool -- Google Trends -- to make sure her ideas would attract readers to the website .
That morning , she chose to put yet another angle on a story about the California mother of octuplets who has been omnipresent on the Web .
Draegin quickly cranked out four paragraphs emphasizing that the “ octomom ” had decided to give all eight babies the same middle name -- Angel .
Advertisement
But everything else Draegin did that morning was more complicated .
In the past , she had n’t bothered to learn such skills as writing tags and URLs because she was paid to think globally about the direction of her magazine .
Now she had to think globally not only about each topic but about every word she wrote in the URL , headline , subhead , tag and links in the story .
Everything had to be crafted to draw readers .
“ It ’s really a challenge to do all of that at once , ” Draegin said .
Advertisement
Leaning back and crossing her arms thoughtfully during a break , she admitted that her mind sometimes wandered .
“ I find myself wanting to turn my head to what would be good for the website overall -- what kind of writers , kinds of new columns .
That ’s just what I ’m used to . ”
But a daunting task that lay ahead snapped her back to the keyboard :
She had to transfer eight babies ’ mug shots from an NBC video to her story .
She still had n’t successfully done a screen grab ( saving a Web page as an image ) .
After several attempts , she splayed her fingers , the nails unpolished , flat on the keys in frustration : “ Hey Randi , I have no idea how to get these pictures onto my story . ”
Draegin ’s lean frame slumped back from the computer .
She and her younger mentor were a study in contrasts .
Draegin , who lives on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side and summers in one of Long Island ’s vacation colonies , was dressed simply , wearing no makeup , short brown hair , a lavender suede shirt and black pants .
Bernfeld , who commutes to work from Long Island , where she grew up , wore thick black eyeliner , long blond hair with dark roots and a stylish short dress that looked like an oversized gray sweater .

Seconds after Draegin ’s cry for help , Bernfeld ’s fingers , the nails sparkling with polish , were flying across the intern ’s laptop , and eight pinched little faces appeared on the page next to the story .
The 2007 University of Florida graduate also had to remind the 1975 Washington University graduate to scroll through Google Trends before she wrote the tag and headline .
“ She took a whole course in this in college , ” Draegin said with a deep sigh .
“ And to think , I took European intellectual history . ”
At one point , Evans stopped by Draegin ’s desk and asked : “ How ’s our intern ? ”
Advertisement
Draegin plucked off her glasses and said with a smile , “ Surviving ! ”
Later , Evans boasted that Draegin was , not surprisingly , a fast learner .
“ She was so excited that by her second day she wrote a news story that was a big hit , ” said Evans , explaining that Draegin ’s first story received 200 clicks by viewers , whereas her second drew 5,000 .
As for what Draegin has done for the site beyond writing a few briefs every morning , well , perhaps that ’s not as obvious .
But there are moments .
Like during a discussion of the Israeli elections , Draegin discreetly corrected the pronunciation of a younger staffer who referred to the current foreign minister as “ Tipsy Livni . ”
Advertisement
“ Yeah , we really should do a story on Tzipi , ” Draegin said pointedly .
“ She ’s really a wowOwow woman ! ”
Draegin has definitely found her internship beneficial in ways she had n’t expected .
While she has long been proficient on Facebook and LinkedIn and has owned a Kindle for more than a year , working at WOW has revved up her interests in the online world .
She now tags and pokes and occasionally writes on somebody ’s wall .
She is considering Twittering -- just for the fun of it .
Draegin also corresponds regularly on Facebook with her 20 - year - old niece , who is still in college and preparing to launch her own career .
Shortly after Draegin landed the WOW gig , she used Facebook to tell her the good news .
Her niece responded with a message that made her overqualified aunt giggle :
Now they both had internships .

One articles are available online .
On a windswept rise in southwest Dallas , Frank Bracken squints into the late - afternoon sun and sweeps his wiry , flannel - clad arm across the empty expanse of chalky white caliche .
This ridge used to be thick with 30 - foot jade - green cedar and oak trees , the only species tenacious enough to cling to the rocky ground , their roots holding the soil in place .
Today , it resembles the nihilistic work of some profiteering strip miner .
Bracken , who owns a farm just south of here , and his neighbors call this land " the moonscape " for its lack of vegetation and stark , white rock .
The developer 's Web site , though , calls it Grady Niblo Estates — " a peaceful and serene family retreat . "
Four years ago , development company Marlin Atlantis bought this land , a verdant hill near Duncanville , planning to build a high - end subdivision with homes priced between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 .
In a series of community meetings in late 2004 , Bracken and his neighbors heard promises about preserving old - growth trees and directed the developer to a nearby subdivision — gorgeous , winding streets shaded with ancient oak and pecan trees — that neighbors hoped would be the model for Grady Niblo .
But in the summer of 2005 , a plume of ominous white dust rose from the Grady Niblo site , and before long , every tree was gone .
The last to go , says Bracken , was a row of cedar trees that blocked the view from the street ; no one could tell what was happening until it was too late .
Hundreds of semi trucks carted away the mulched trees .
The developer did not return Dallas Observer calls seeking comment .
For three years , the land stood empty .
Erosion washed silt and rocks into ruts left by the bulldozers , carving deep furrows in the land and choking storm sewers .
Today , Phase I of Grady Niblo Estates remains unfinished , with only a handful of imposing brick houses rising from the apocalyptic landscape .
There are no sidewalks , just streets and a few driveways .
A lone metal street sign , oblivious to its own irony , marks the corner of " Nature 's Way " and " Preservation Lane . "
After the bulldozers left , Marlin Atlantis could hardly make good on its promise to preserve old - growth trees , and Bracken and his neighbors were relegated to demanding that the developer at least fulfill its city - mandated obligation to replant trees equivalent to what it had cut down .
The city of Dallas ' tree ordinance requires that when a landowner cuts down protected trees — trees of certain species that are more than 8 inches thick — he or she has must " mitigate " for the cut trees in one of three ways : replanting , paying into a reforestation fund or donating trees to the city .
The landowner , however , can claim a " special exception " to mitigation if he or she can prove to the city that replanting " will unreasonably burden " the property 's use and that taking the exception wo n't harm neighboring property .
Marlin Atlantis sought an exception based on what it said was a prior agreement it had reached with the Dallas city attorney to satisfy its mitigation obligation by donating to the city as parkland a wooded ravine on the western edge of Grady Niblo .
Bracken and his neighbors , sick of dealing with silt in their sewer system and the dust rising from the empty land next door , hoped the city would see it their way and deny the developer an exception .
In November 2007 , the Dallas Zoning Board of Adjustment rejected Marlin Atlantis ' bid for an exception from the replanting requirement .
In 2008 , Marlin Atlantis ' lender , Graham Investments Inc. , foreclosed on the property , and that August , Graham brought a similar case before the board , whose ruling created a unique mitigation arrangement that attempted to satisfy the residents and the lender .
According to Joe Graham , president of Graham Investments , his company has " spent a tremendous amount of time and money trying to do the right thing , " including paying out " over $ 450,000 so far " to bring the property into compliance .
The tangible effects of that half - million seem scant : a thin layer of black dirt seeded with grass has been spread to cover the white caliche and slow erosion , and a pitiful line of oak and ash trees has been planted atop a levee at the far end of the property .
Several of these trees tremble at rakish angles , their thin trunks no match for the wind that now buffets this treeless plain .
Their roots — some of them still coiled in the ball like those of an unplanted tree — are unable to penetrate the hard , white rock and have done little to stanch soil erosion .
Bracken says that dirt and rocks still fill the roads and clog the sewers when it rains , and city officials who might monitor compliance with the ruling are a rare sight at the moonscape .
This seems to contradict City Hall 's stated desire to recast Dallas as " the greenest city in America " — or so proclaimed Mayor Tom Leppert last January when the Environmental Protection Agency recognized the city of Dallas for its use of renewable power .
City officials seem eager to promote eco-friendly activities .
The Sustainable Skylines Initiative , a joint federal , state and local effort to improve the city 's air quality , attracted science luminaries to its Dallas conference this March , and Earth Day and Arbor Day celebrations abound here in April .
But just how serious is the city about changing its support for developers and their antiquated clear - build - sell mentality — one that views trees as obstacles to be gotten rid of , or aesthetically pleasing amenities that can raise the price of their expansive subdivisions or high - rise condos ?
The city talks a good game .
In the past few years , local tree activists such as Steve Houser have made inroads at City Hall , beginning with the establishment of an Urban Forestry Advisory Committee , which instructs the city on the care and planting of trees and advocates sound urban forest management practices .
The city has endorsed the efforts of the nonprofit Texas Trees Foundation , which this March is scheduled to kickoff its " Road Map to Tree Planning and Planting in Dallas , " an ambitious plan for planting thousands of trees around the city .
And the city , as part of the Trinity River Corridor Project , has dedicated bond money to developing the Great Trinity Forest — at more than 6,000 acres , the largest urban hardwood forest in the United States .
Aside from the limited efforts of nonprofits and the advisory committee , there is no coordinated citywide effort to plant , replant and maintain trees .
The lack of an office of urban forestry means that there is no central oversight authority for Dallas ' urban forest .
A tree survey , which would inventory the billions of dollars of environmental and financial assets in Dallas ' urban forest , has never made it into the city budget ; further , the city 's unwillingness to strengthen its toothless tree ordinance has only exacerbated Dallas ' long and troubled history regarding the stewardship of its trees .
And if the city 's response to what happened at Grady Niblo is any indication of its new arboreal consciousness , Dallas has a long way to go before its rhetoric matches its reality .
----
Minutes from the Grady Niblo moonscape , a grove of ancient , gnarled bur oaks grows tall near the center of Dallas .
They soar into the breezy February sky , providing perfect nooks for birds ' nests and sylvan views for patients at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas .
There 's a creek bed behind the labor and delivery building , and it , too , is lined with the deep arcs of massive trunks and a tangle of bushes and shrubs .
This grove is where Dallas ' tree movement began in earnest when in 1994 , the hospital flirted with its own version of a treeless moonscape .
Steve Houser , a wiry , blue - eyed sprite of a man with boundless energy , played an integral role : that of the arborist who refused to do his job .
Houser owns the tree company Arborilogical Services Inc. , whose largest single client in the ' 80s was Presbyterian Hospital .
In 1989 , he helped the hospital find a way to build a new day - care center around two of the oldest bur oaks on its property .
According to Bill Seaman , then the hospital 's grounds manager , Houser got up in the trees himself , wrapping their branches with scraps of carpet to keep them from rubbing up against the nearby drilling machines during construction .
The epitome of a tree - hugger , Houser was appalled in 1994 when Presbyterian told him to cut down more than 30 trees on its property to make room for a new power plant .
" I had to do some soul - searching , " Houser recalls .
" I thought , ' I do n't want to lose my biggest account .
But do I want to live for the almighty dollar all my life or do what I know in my heart is the right thing ? ' "
He turned down the job , instead helping mount an advocacy campaign to save the trees .
Houser and other local tree advocates solicited enough money to post a two - page ad in The Dallas Morning News , in which they announced the formation of the Dallas Historic Tree Coalition , which opposed Presbyterian 's tree - cutting plans .
Calls and donations poured in , and the ranks of the coalition grew to hundreds .
Presbyterian backed down , agreeing to build the plant where it would n't require felling more than a few trees .
Despite the victory , Houser decided to let his short blond hair grow , vowing never to cut it until Dallas finally started to care about trees .
By the time the dust settled around Presbyterian Hospital , its trees were intact , and Dallas ' environmentalists had both a leader ( Houser ) and a cause ( trees ) .
Part of the Historic Tree Coalition 's ease in mobilizing support came out of frustration born a year earlier , when Dallas passed its first tree ordinance .
While Fort Worth had enacted a tree ordinance in 1873 , Dallas — embarrassingly enough — only began working on an ordinance to protect its urban forest in 1990 .
Two city council advisory committees proposed an original draft with strict penalties :
Anyone who wanted to cut down a tree of a certain size would be required to pay between $ 100 and $ 500 for a permit and a $ 400 fine for each tree cut without a permit .
The ordinance also would establish the position of city forester , to oversee tree planting and maintenance , and a 15 - member City Tree Board , composed of equal parts environmentalists , developers , homeowners and arborists , which would act as an arbiter for tree - related issues .
The ordinance , however , was deemed too stringent by some , who saw the idea of conserving a tree as anathema to development .
Then - city council member Glenn
Box called the ordinance " the most unnecessary , bad idea I 've ever seen come before the council , " and told The Dallas Morning News in May 1994 that " We might as well just hang signs up around the city saying , Development Not Allowed . "
Box 's view prevailed .
The final ordinance , passed by the city council later that month , raised the fine to $ 2,000 but made its actual levying unlikely .
According to the new ordinance , any number of small trees could be removed ( even clear - cut ) without penalty , and bigger trees could be removed as long as they were later replaced with trees equivalent to the trunk thickness of what had been cut .
That meant five 10 - inch - thick oaks , with all their attendant benefits — large , older trees release more oxygen , provide more shade and absorb up to 70 times more air pollution than young trees — could be replaced by 50 1 - inch saplings .
Developers could avoid replanting if they chose to mitigate by donating trees to the city or paying into the reforestation fund .
The enacted version also did away with the city forester and tree board , making enforcement nearly impossible since the task of overseeing all trees in Dallas fell to just four city arborists .
The ordinance 's passage in 1994 accentuated the split between environmentalists and " developers , " which in environmental circles had become as nasty an epithet as " tree - hugger " was to the other side .
John Giedraitis , the urban forestry program manager for the Texas Forest Service , a state agency focusing on tree - related issues , views the city 's tree ordinance as " a development ordinance , " not only because of its lax regulations and slap - on - the - wrist disciplinary measures , but also because of development 's perennial role in shaping the city 's history .
Although the ordinance seemed a triumph for developers , there was one hitch : Development and trees would have to co-exist , if not for aesthetic reasons — it is no coincidence that the priciest neighborhoods in Dallas also boast the nicest trees — then for environmental ones .
In 1990 , the EPA found that ozone levels in the Dallas area were unacceptably high .
The agency gave the Dallas - Fort Worth area until November 1996 to comply with federal air standards ; it failed .
The EPA extended the deadline to 1999 ; it failed again .
( Dallas achieved partial compliance in 2007 ; the deadline for full compliance has been extended to 2010 . )
Although nonprofit groups like the Texas Trees Foundation would later begin planting trees near state highways to gauge their effects on air quality , the scientific community has long been aware of the beneficial impact of trees on the atmosphere .
Trees store ( sequester , in scientific circles ) carbon dioxide and release oxygen .
In breathing , humans are just the opposite :
We use oxygen and release carbon dioxide , so trees are perfect breathing partners .
But since global climate change and the harmful effects of atmospheric ozone became widely accepted in the late 1990s , scientists have been looking to trees for answers .
In addition to carbon dioxide , trees also sequester harmful air pollutants — ozone , particulate matter , nitrogen oxides , sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide — many of which , in Dallas , derive largely from vehicle emissions .
" In particular with global climate change , " explains Janette Monear , executive director of the Texas Trees Foundation , " we need to be planting now for the future , and doing research around which trees can tolerate more drought , which trees can sequester more carbon dioxide , [ and ] which trees can take up the most amount of water . "
In cities such as Minneapolis , urban forestry programs have been around as long as women 's suffrage , and the benefits are striking .
Minneapolis has nearly 1 million trees that cover almost a quarter of its urban area , saving residents $ 6.8 million in energy costs and injecting an additional $ 7.1 million into its property values every year , according to a recent study by the U.S. Forest Service .
Giedraitis , of the Texas Forest Service , says a similar study in Houston found that a tree raised the property value of a house by an average of $ 4,000 — a number Houser likes to throw out when he advocates that Dallas fund an inventory to value the trees in its own urban forest .
" It 's like me giving you this portfolio of stocks , and you do n't know what 's in it , " Houser says .
" How can we manage an asset we do n't understand ? "
The perpetual push by tree activists for the city to provide meaningful tree protections gained some traction at City Hall after Laura Miller was elected councilwoman in May 1998 .
" She became a real advocate , " says Seaman , who joined forces with Houser after the Presbyterian Hospital imbroglio .
" When we had issues that came up , we could actually pick up the phone and call a council person .
We 'd never been able to do that before . "
Yet having a friend in a power position was n't enough to stop two incidents that seemed to corroborate continuing local government indifference to nature preservation .
One day before dawn in July 1998 , the city of Carrollton took a bulldozer to an egret breeding ground , citing complaints about the noise and " offensive odor " emanating from the area .
Many Carrollton residents were outraged ; the Morning News published a series of vituperative letters to the editor calling the action a " horrible slaughter " and a " dark - of - night atrocity . "
Speculations abounded that the rookery had been bulldozed to clear the way for a new senior center .
In response , some Carrollton residents formed an advisory Wildlife Task Force .
Nothing could bring back more than 300 dead birds — among them cattle egrets and herons — but " it was a way to help resolve the issue , " Houser says .
A year after the incident , Carrollton was ordered to pay the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service $ 70,000 for its violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .
Later that summer , Houser and the Historic Tree Coalition confronted the city of Dallas on a similar issue .
In June , the city and A.H. Belo Corp .
Foundation announced their plan to " upgrade " downtown Dallas ' Ferris Plaza by removing 21 mature live oak trees .
Though Belo representatives claimed their only intention was to refurbish the park , some coalition members claimed the real motive for cutting down the trees was to displace a noisy , poop - producing grackle population .
This issue , Houser recalls , was particularly stressful because it went all the way to the city Board of Adjustment , where the $ 1 million upgrade plan was ultimately defeated .
Houser says he met with power brokers who offered him incentives to back down .
" But they do n't know me very well , " he says .
" They can keep the money and the clout .
I 'll take the trees . "
----
Even the election of Miller as mayor in 2002 could n't stymie the dominance of the developers in the city .
Not only was Dallas ' tree ordinance weak , it was also under constant threat , says Miller .
" The elected officials from the underdeveloped parts of the city want to make it as easy as possible to get their districts developed , " she says .
" They do n't want tree preservation to get in the way of that . "
To that end , Miller adds , " some council members and certainly the development community wanted to completely reopen the tree ordinance and make it weaker . "
Miller says she and other tree advocates would scramble to prevent this , trying to reach compromises with individual developers on a case - by - case basis .
Though the ordinance requires developers to mitigate for trees they 've cut , it does comparatively little to actually limit that cutting in the first place — a fact made obvious by what happened at Grady Niblo .
Flower Mound , for example , expressly forbids clear - cutting ( " the indiscriminant removal of protected trees " ) ; Dallas does not .
Both Flower Mound and Frisco require that the caliper inches ( measured in trunk thickness ) of mitigation trees exceed rather than just equal what was cut .
Fort Worth requires the preservation of one - quarter of the existing tree cover on lots of more than one acre , regardless of tree species , and lists 26 protected species to Dallas ' 12 .
In 2003 , tree advocates succeeded in strengthening the ordinance somewhat by giving city arborists the power to issue stop - work orders for developers who were out of compliance .
Dallas chief arborist Phil Erwin estimates , however , that fewer than 50 stop - work orders have been handed down since the change , despite the thousands of development permits issued across the city each year .
The battle for a viable tree ordinance in Dallas seemed to go unnoticed by the city of Richardson , which in 2004 still did n't have one — and its largest cottonwood tree , 20 feet around and estimated at more than a century old , was then on the verge of being cut down .
The insurance company that owned part of the Coit Road shopping center where the cottonwood grew had deemed the tree unsafe and conservation measures ( pruning or installing cables ) too costly .
Houser 's bitterness at the prospect of felling the tree was evident in a letter to the editor published in the Morning News on October 4 , 2004 .
" The many benefits of trees ... are secondary to the almighty dollar , " he wrote .
" Since all trees can sustain structural failure , let 's cut them all down .
When it comes to dollars or liability , trees lose . "
The tree was cut down a month later .
In 2005 , Houser did have a modest victory when then - Mayor Miller played a pivotal role in establishing the Urban Forestry Advisory Committee .
The full council appointed Houser as committee chair , and he poured his energy into projects like the Citizen Forester program , which trains people to care for and properly plant trees .
But the committee lacked any sort of enforcement power over the tree ordinance and did n't have the funding or authority that an office of urban forestry would .
Such oversight could have helped craft a coordinated approach to managing the city 's trees — and might have prevented last August 's tree tragedy at the intersection of Woodall Rodgers and North Central Expressway .
In 2004 , in a triangle of green sandwiched between the two highways , the Texas Trees Foundation worked out a deal with the Texas Department of Transportation ( TxDOT ) .
The foundation proposed planting a grove of 1,100 bald cypresses — an " air filter for downtown , " as the foundation 's then - director , Mike Bradshaw , put it .
TxDOT owned the land and agreed to the project on the condition that after TxDOT installed an irrigation system and paid for water , the foundation would be responsible for watering the trees for the next five years .
But last summer , the trees ' water was switched off without anyone 's realizing it , says Patrick Haigh , a landscape architect for TxDOT .
The result was an enormous loss in resources and potential air - quality improvement :
More than 300 trees died , their leaves and branches withering to a reddish - brown in the August heat .
The incident illustrated the folly in planting trees without a coordinated oversight system in place to help manage them .
Hugh Brooks , the former executive director of the Friends of the Farm , a nonprofit that was attempting to revive city - owned Samuell Farm , says he encountered that same folly after he proposed a plan for a city reforestation tree farm .
In the summer of 2006 , as part of the mitigation process for the Pinnacle Park mixed - use development in southern Dallas , 200 trees were delivered to Samuell Farm , once a working farm on the border of Mesquite and Sunnyvale .
The farm had an ignominious history of animal cruelty and mismanagement ; in 2004 , Friends of the Farm took over management of the property from the city , attempting to revive it by building hiking trails , refurbishing historic buildings and generally tidying up .
When the nonprofit took delivery of the trees , says Brooks , they " showed signs of heat stress and insufficient watering . "
With his farm 's volunteers caring for them , he began to wonder :
Why not keep all the city 's reforestation trees in one place ?
At 340 acres , Samuell Farm was big enough to house 7,500 trees , and caring for them would provide work for volunteers and an educational opportunity for visitors .
It would cut down on water use and help monitor whether developers had fulfilled their mitigation requirements .
There could be a wood - composting site that would provide mulch to aid in tree planting .
Brooks secured funding for the project from the Simmons Foundation and asked a city irrigator , Howard Saucier , to draw up plans for the tree farm .
In the fall of 2007 , he presented them to the Park and Recreation Department .
The response was less than favorable , he says .
Not only was the Park Department not interested in a tree farm , it also sought to reassert its control over Samuell Farm , says Brooks .
Faced with these roadblocks , Brooks decided to go straight to the city council with his proposal .
Anticipating a meeting with the mayor , last April he requested information about the reforestation fund from the Park Department 's assistant director , Carolyn McKnight - Bray .
" We have more than enough trees , " McKnight - Bray replied in an e-mail .
" We have so many trees we do not need a tree farm to support the Park system . "
McKnight - Bray added that the problem was maintenance — the city felt it did not have the resources to irrigate and care for more trees .
" That is precisely the dilemma that our proposed Tree Farm will address , " Brooks fired back a week later .
He had the funding , and the farm could use court - ordered community service volunteers to provide tree maintenance .
McKnight - Bray had told Brooks that the city was keeping its reforestation trees in a " tree bank , " which Brooks asked to see .
In a subsequent e-mail , McKnight - Bray revealed that the bank was actually a collection of tree purchases in several nurseries across the metroplex .
" Saying they have trees in a tree bank is like saying I have a Ford in every dealership , " Brooks says , still frustrated .
" They 're vapor trees . "
McKnight - Bray also told the Observer what she told Brooks — that the city has a tree bank , but that it can't handle a tree farm .
Michael Hellmann , the Park Department 's manager of planning and acquisitions , says the current mitigation " tree bank " has around 1,000 trees — far short of the 7,500 trees proposed by Brooks .
After two weeks of e-mail correspondence between Brooks and McKnight - Bray , the Park Department issued its " official position " :
There would be no reforestation tree farm at Samuell Farm .
The city 's reforestation fund has also had its own set of problems , which became evident after a 2003 audit revealed not only that $ 40,000 was lost or missing but also that the fund 's accounting system was so disordered that checks that should have made it into the fund ended up in the city 's general fund or were never accounted for at all .
And when it came to actual tree donations , city auditor Thomas Taylor wrote in a March 2003 memo that " there is no follow - up by the arborists or any report from [ Park and Recreation Department ] staff back to the arborists verifying actual delivery and planting . "
In other words , there was no proof that developers and other landowners were , in fact , making the donations required under the tree ordinance .
After the audit , says city arborist Erwin , " the error was detected and immediately remedied .
There 's been no problems since ...
If anything , the process became more efficient . "
Erwin says he does n't handle reforestation fund money — that it goes directly to the accounting division — but he was aware that the 2007 cash balance of the reforestation fund , around $ 1.2 million , " has gone up considerably since then , but [ is ] well under $ 2 million . "
So where does that money go ?
Neighborhood planting projects and Park Department tree and property purchases , Erwin says .
And for now , none of it seems to be coming Houser 's way .
----
In late January , Houser appeared before the city council 's Quality of Life Committee and presented his ideas for the city to establish an office of urban forestry .
He had done his homework , lobbying each committee member over the past year and preparing a PowerPoint presentation filled with colorful photographs of inspiring treescapes .
In one of his final slides , he appealed to the city 's new green consciousness : " As part of Dallas ' leadership in the green movement , it is imperative that we properly manage our green infrastructure to attract business . "
In the end , Houser suffered a setback :
The committee decided to postpone its decision until its scheduled March briefing on the Texas Trees Foundation 's Road Map .
But things did n't look good .
" I had already decided that this was just one battle in the overall war , " Houser says .
" It certainly was n't worth pushing hard for , because I would n't have gotten anywhere anyway . "
Better to educate them about the need for the office , he adds , and let them reach their own conclusion that it will be necessary as the Trinity River project comes on line .
Even though Houser these days sounds more like an accommodating insider than an outside agitator , the tree activist agenda has had some success at City Hall .
In 2006 , with the help of a four - year , $ 100,000 grant from the Texas Forest Service , Dallas hired its first city forester .
Karen Woodard currently holds the job and spends much of her time spreading the word about the benefits of trees ; at stake right now , she says , is getting the city to fund and implement the management plan for the Great Trinity Forest , which Houser helped draft and provides recommendations for preserving the forest and planting new trees .
Stimulus money may help , and private funding for other tree - planting initiatives through organizations such as the Texas Trees Foundation may have more success .
But the city has yet to fund a tree inventory and still has no budget dedicated to urban forestry .
Instead , tree management and ordinance enforcement fall under a patchwork of departments ranging from public works to police .
" We 're still way behind places like Milwaukee or Chicago , which have multimillion - dollar forestry programs , " says Courtney Blevins , the Texas Forest Service 's regional urban forester for the Fort Worth area .
But Dallas ' tree - consciousness is growing , says Blevins .
" We are a long way from where we were 10 years ago . "
While there remains a divide between the city 's words and actions , Mayor Leppert continues to chant his " greenest city in America " mantra .
In a memo to council members accompanying the Urban Forestry Advisory Committee 's annual report in February , Leppert wrote : " Since Dallas trees and forests represent billions of dollars in green infrastructure that can grow in value when properly maintained , your continued support of the committee 's initiatives will leave a legacy of a greener city . "
Yet the committee 's most sought - after initiatives — an office of urban forestry and a tree inventory — seem to get only lip service .
When Steve Houser grows weary of this divide , he sometimes resorts to climbing a tall tree and sitting in the sanctuary of its branches .
" There 's things that go with climbing a tree , " he says .
" You go up in this 500 - year - old tree , and you get out on one of those limbs and sit ... It 's like you 're being rocked back and forth by this ancient , old giant . "
Houser brushes his hand across the top of his long , straight , blond hair pulled back in a ponytail that falls to the middle of his back .
It reminds him there 's still a lot of work to do .
In yet another case of Regulators Gone Wild , California legislation may soon restrict the color options for your next car .
The specific colors that are currently on the chopping block are all dark hues , with the worst offender seemingly the most innocuous color you could think of : black .
What resentment could California possibly harbor against black cars , you ask ?
Apparently , the Air Resources Board figures that the climate control systems of dark colored cars need to work harder than their lighter siblings , especially after sitting in the sun for a few hours .
Anyone living in a hot , sunny climate will tell you that this assumption is accurate .
Similar legislation already exists for buildings and has proven successful at reducing the energy consumption of skyscrapers .
So , what 's the problem ?
Paint suppliers have reportedly been testing their pigments and processes to see if it 's possible to meet CARB 's proposed mandate of 20 percent solar reflectivity by 2016 with a phase - in period starting in 2012 , and it 's not looking good .
Apparently , when the proper pigments and chemicals are added to black paint , the resulting color is currently being referred to as " mud- puddle brown . "
That does n't sound very attractive , now does it ?
Windshields , backlights and sunroofs are also slated to get reflective coatings starting in 2012 .
When we first heard of this issue , an internal debate immediately began as to whether this might be an elaborate April Fool 's joke .
Sadly , it is n't .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
How does the American public feel about the war in Afghanistan ?
In a word , wary .
U.S. forces have been engaged in fierce fighting to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan .
President Obama on Friday announced his strategy to fight terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan , a plan that includes more troops , new legislation , improved troop training and added civilian expertise .
" The United States of American did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan .
Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11 , 2001 , " Obama said Friday .
" We have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , " he said .
Stressing that " the safety of people around the world is at stake , " Obama said the " situation is increasingly perilous " in the region in and around Afghanistan , where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7 ½ years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon .
Nevertheless , the American public has been wary about the war in Afghanistan , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted in February .
Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider break down the numbers »
Last month , Americans were almost evenly divided between those who support the war and those who oppose it , the poll showed , with 47 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed .
Opposition to the war in Afghanistan is more muted than opposition to the war in Iraq , but it 's not so muted among Democrats .
Two - thirds of Americans overall oppose the war in Iraq , but 64 percent of Democrats oppose the war in Afghanistan .
The anti-war movements in Vietnam and Iraq helped define what the Democratic Party stands for .
Watch : Is Afghanistan Obama 's Vietnam ? »
" If we do n't learn from our Iraq experience , we are doomed to repeat it , " Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D - California , said on the House floor Thursday .
Why are Americans wary about Afghanistan ?
The recession .
Iraq
War fatigue .
And frustration .
Only 31 percent of Americans believe the United States is winning the war in Afghanistan .
Fifty percent believe the United States is winning in Iraq -- the highest number in at least five years .
But Americans still want to get out of Iraq .
Last month , when President Obama said he would send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , the public was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt .
Democrats were willing to go along with the president , but they were less enthusiastic than Republicans
A solid majority of Americans believe the United States can win a military victory in Afghanistan , but Afghanistan has become a political war .
Winning depends , not just on what the United States can do , but also what Afghanistan and Pakistan can do .
Americans have far less confidence in them .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll surveyed 1,046 adult Americans by telephone on February 18 - 19 , 2009 .
The sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .

Carol
Thatcher faces being banned from the BBC after she referred to a tennis player as a " golliwog " .
Thatcher , the daughter of former prime minister Lady Thatcher , made the remark in a private conversation in the green room of The One Show after the broadcast of the BBC1 programme on Thursday night .
Sources have said that Thatcher will not be used again on the show , where she is a roving reporter , until she formally apologises to those who were offended by the remark .
According to insiders , Thatcher – who won ITV1 reality series I'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of Here ! in 2005 – was chatting with The One Show host Adrian Chiles and guest Jo Brand about the Australian Open when she described an unnamed player as a " golliwog " .
Show insiders said Chiles was " outraged " by the comment and he and Brand challenged Thatcher about it .
The pair also complained to show executives – as did production staff who later heard about the incident – and it is understood that Thatcher was approached the following day by the show 's executive producer .
Thatcher 's spokeswoman had not responded to a request for comment before publication , but was quoted in The Times today as saying the word was an " off - the - cuff remark made in jest " and that she had apologised to the show 's producer .
Sources said Thatcher had also written to the show 's executive producer to apologise and that the BBC was currently considering its decision .
However , insiders said this may not be enough .
" Her apology seems to be that it was just a joke , but the BBC feels it is not acceptable under any circumstances to call someone a golliwog , " the source said .
" Unless you do n't think that is an acceptable joke , how can you be sorry ?
Until she apologises to the people who were offended her future is in question .
There are people working on the show who do n't feel they can work with her .
Adrian was outraged by what he heard . "
A BBC spokesman said there were " no confirmed plans to work with Carol on The One Show at the present time " .
He added : " The BBC considers any language of a racist nature wholly unacceptable .
We have raised the issue with the individual concerned and are discussing it as a matter of urgency . "

Peter Klein wrote a blog post yesterday on the Mises Economics blog continuing the agorist vs. anarcho - capitalist discussion on organization .
In his post , Klein summarized his contribution to the discussion followed by a quoting Rothbard ’s assessment of agorists view on organization .
But both Klein and Rothbard make unsupported general conclusions that they seem to base on some agorists ’ personal preferences rather than agorist theory .
It is true that agorists in general do not fancy “ organization , hierarchy , leaders and followers , etc. ” , which is a common preference among anarchists of all varieties .
Rothbard ( and Klein ) is right in that there is not necessarily anything wrong with voluntary organization or voluntary “ membership ” in hierarchical structures where one is subjected to the rule of majority vote or the whims of a ruler .
But as good economists both Rothbard and Klein seem to assume too much : there is nothing wrong with making an informed decision to take a low - level position in a hierarchy ceteris paribus .
Ceteris paribus should here be understood as choosing in a situation where the only thing that distinguishes the hierarchical position from the non-hierarchical is hierarchy .
But this is hardly ever the case in State society .
Rather , individuals have to choose ( if at all ) from a very limited set of alternatives , where hierarchy and submission is part of all or most of the alternatives .
Vietnamese children working in a Nike sweatshop are better off than as child prostitutes , ceteris paribus .
But one cannot take the choices as exogenous to the political situation in the area , the region , the country , or the world .
A political theory such as agorism needs to take into account the effect of political rule in the choices people make .
Agorists do just that : they realize that the limited options for a child , i.e. working in a sweat shop or becoming a prostitute , are not the result of the market but of political institutions .
The choice in itself may be easy , but the context certainly is n’t .
The person making the choice is subjected to political oppression through the unavailability of choices due to political regulation , rule , and coercive institutions .
This is not the same as making choices “ subject to ” alternatives made available in a free ( d ) market .
The market measures costs to benefits and awards individuals with alternatives to the extent economically feasible .
Political rule , however , causes imbalances in the marketplace which forcefully ( directly or indirectly ) removes alternatives that should have existed were it not for political oppressive rule .
The choice between a sweat shop and prostitution is a choice only because of politics ; it is not a “ real ” choice set , since it is forcefully limited .
The same is true with any choices we make today , and agorists , compared to other anarcho - capitalists , tend to put more weight on the choices that have been forcefully taken away from us .
While many libertarians would compare a choice to status quo , an agorist would compare the choice situation with that which should obviously have been real in a free market .
It is not an economic analysis , it is a political analysis based on a radical passion for justice .
This is relevant to the debate on organization , since agorists have a slightly different perspective than anarcho - capitalists , especially economist anarcho - capitalists .
There is of course nothing supporting any counter - factual view on what would have been the case under different circumstances .
But it is reasonable to draw some conclusions : the child would have more alternatives in a free market than sweat shop work and prostitution , of which some would likely have been better than both .
Only the better alternatives are important to our analysis , but it is safe to say that we can remain fairly confident that such better alternatives ( subjectively identified and valued ) would exist .
State oppression has therefore deprived the child ( in this case ) from the choice he or she would have made were it not for State oppression .
An economic analysis , at least using the tools commonly taught in academia , is too limited : it does not take into account the fundamental and far - reaching effect of the State on institutions and individual as well as collective behavior .
From this perspective , it is not necessarily the case that people in a freed setting would organize the way the presently choose to .
It could be the case that people organize in large corporations , but it is unlikely .
Why ?
Because people in general tend to dislike being “ bossed around ” by others , and they tend to very often dislike management because it is management or because they believe management ’s decisions are incorrect or improper .
Ask yourself : in a free (d ) market , would more or fewer people choose to work in large structures where their actions are subjected to the decisions / management by others ?
The answer is n’t necessarily obvious , but considering the multitude of organizational solutions that would be available were it not for the State , as well as the cost of e.g. corporation - like limited liability if fully internalized by the individual actor / organization , the answer becomes clearer .
Agorists do n’t despise or dislike organization per se , but I believe it is reasonable to say their analysis takes more facts into account .
In quantitative economics lingo , agorists tend to control for many more variables .
So how does this relate to Klein ’s post and the Rothbard quote ?
It provides the reason agorists , on average , are more skeptical than other libertarians to contemporary organizational structures .
Agorist theory does not dismiss organization , but agorist class theory identifies , comparatively speaking , a great many more State - caused and State - inflicted problems with severe effects on the very bases on which choices are made .
This makes agorists more skeptical towards organizational choices in contemporary State society .
If it were indeed the case that agorists were opposed to organization in and of itself , they would abstain from organize themselves .
But this is not the case : agorists organize their efforts in the Molinari Institute as well as the Center for a Stateless Society and the Agorist Action Alliance .
Furthermore , agorists are strong proponents of voluntary organizing of free markets to create individual wealth while withdrawing support for the state to the greatest degree possible and providing real and viable free alternatives to State - controlled institutions .
Agorism provides a theory for how to set the world free through liberating yourself and thereby fully take advantage of the economic incentives naturally provided in a free society .
So - called counter - economics is a cornerstone in agorist theory and practice , and arranging or joining a counter - economy is voluntary in a sense no choice made in the State sanctioned market ever is .
This is perhaps what distinguishes agorists from anarcho - capitalists the most : that they define “ voluntary ” in a much more absolutist sense .

Peter Pocklington , one - time owner of the NHL's Edmonton Oilers , was expected to be released on bail Friday after the former coach of the team said he would put up the bail .
In a California courtroom , Glen Sather put up a $ 1 million piece of property as security to allow Pocklington to be released on bail .
" Mr. Sather worked for Mr. Pocklington for approximately 25 years and he felt that Mr. Pocklington should not have to sit in jail while he awaits his day in court , " said Gabriel Colwell , who represented Sather in court .
" Mr. Sather then contacted the Edmonton Oilers to ask them for assistance in facilitating the bond process and the Oilers out of respect for Mr. Sather agreed to make counsel available in the form of me . "
Thom Mrozek , a public affairs officer for the U.S. Attorney 's Office , said there are conditions attached to Pocklington 's bail .
" He 'll be subject to home detention , which is sometimes called house arrest , and he 'll be subject to electronic monitoring , " he said .
Pocklington , who appeared in court in handcuffs and shackles , wearing an orange jump suit , has been in jail since being arrested on bankruptcy fraud charges on Wednesday .
The two - count indictment , which was unsealed Wednesday , accuses Pocklington of making false statements in bankruptcy and making false oaths and accounts in bankruptcy .
Sather , who is currently the president and general manager of the New York Rangers , worked for Pocklington during Sather 's stint in Edmonton .
Sather led the team to four Stanley Cups in five final appearances as coach from 1979 - 80 until the 1988 - 89 campaign .
Pocklington sold the Oilers in 1998 to a group of Edmonton business people who banded together to keep the team in the city , an arrangement that remained in place for a decade until pharmacy billionaire Daryl Katz took over ownership last year .
But Pocklington is still remembered by many fans in Edmonton as the man who traded Wayne Gretzky to the L.A. Kings in 1988 .
International pop star Sting is the latest British celebrity to throw his weight behind 9/11 truther and admitted Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon , the U.K. man who 's still fighting tooth and nail to avoid a U.S. trial on computer hacking charges .
" It 's a travesty of human rights that Gary McKinnon finds himself in this dreadful situation , " the former Police front man told the Mail on Sunday .
" The U.S. response in relation to the true nature of Gary 's crime is disproportionate in the extreme , " Sting said , referring to the extremely disproportionate response of charging a 43 - year - old man with computer intrusion , when all he did was intrude into some computers .
Prosecutors say McKinnon broke into more than 90 unclassified Pentagon systems in 2001 and 2002 , allegedly crashing some of them .
He has said he was looking for proof of a UFO cover - up , though he left this message in an Army computer in 2002 : " U.S. foreign policy is akin to government - sponsored terrorism these days ...
It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September 11 last year ... I am SOLO .
I will continue to disrupt at the highest levels . "
With the help of British police , " Solo " was easily tracked down , and is now charged with damaging protected computers in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
Threat Level knows better than anyone that hackers in the United States are starting to face life - ruining sentences stretching to decades in prison .
McKinnon , though , is not .
He already turned down an 18 - month plea deal , and he now faces six months to six - and - a- half years in custody under federal sentencing guidelines , depending on how much damage he caused .
He claims to have caused none , and if he 's telling the truth , he could be extradited tomorrow and be back home for Christmas .
Instead , McKinnon has garnered massive support in the U.K. in a years - long legal battle to avoid extradition .
Several prominent British lawmakers joined his side after his lawyer announced last August that McKinnon had been diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome .
It 's not clear , though , if any of them have the foggiest idea what they 're talking about , since they 're often heard grumbling about McKinnon 's " 70 - year " sentencing exposure on " terrorism charges . "
Even Sting worries that the hacker might take his own life rather than go to jail " as a terrorist . "
He also complains : " The British Government is prepared to hand over this vulnerable man without reviewing the evidence . "
That last bit is especially puzzling , because McKinnon gave the British government a signed confession in January .
He was hoping to get U.K .
prosecutors to charge him locally , keeping him out of America .
They recently declined and his case is now under judicial review to decide if his alleged Asperger 's syndrome should keep him from being tried in the United States .
Throwing the kitchen sink into his defense of his countryman , Sting even told the Mail that McKinnon faces extradition under a one - sided treaty the U.K. signed , and the United States did not .
Wrong again .
Who would have thought a pop star would be ignorant of international treaty law ?

( CNN ) --
The unlikely alchemy of a hard - rock legend and a bluegrass superstar created Grammy gold Sunday night , as Robert Plant and Alison Krauss picked up five awards -- including album and record of the year -- for their work , " Raising Sand . "
Alison Krauss and Robert Plant 's song " Please Read the Letter " won record of the year .

" Sand " won album of the year honor , while a song from the set , " Please Read the Letter , " won record of the year .
" I 'm bewildered .
In the old days we would have called this selling out .
But it 's a good way to spend a Sunday , " said Plant , the legendary Led Zeppelin front man .
" Raising Sand " was produced by T Bone Burnett , whose production and oversight of the " O Brother , Where Art Thou " soundtrack won three awards -- including album of the year -- in 2002 .
For " Sand , " Burnett selected several songs , mostly obscurities such as Gene Clark 's " Polly Come Home " and Sam Phillips ' " Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us , " and let Plant and Krauss mix it up in stark , often subdued fashion .
The result was widely praised and reached No. 2 on the album charts .
Watch Plant and Krauss talk about their win »
The win adds to Krauss ' eye - popping Grammy total of 26 awards -- more than any female artist in history and third only to conductor Sir Georg Solti ( 31 ) and producer - arranger - mogul Quincy Jones ( 27 ) .
The awards were overshadowed by news that performer Chris Brown , who had been up for two Grammys , had become the focus of a domestic - violence allegation .
Brown turned himself in to Los Angeles police Sunday evening .
Watch a report on the latest developments in the Brown case »
He was released on $ 50,000 bail , according to the Los Angeles Police Department .
Authorities said Brown and a woman were involved in an argument in a vehicle .

The argument escalated when Brown stopped the car and the woman got out , the LAPD said , citing the victim 's account .
A representative for Brown at the ICM agency in Los Angeles could not immediately be reached for comment .
Coldplay took home one of the Grammys ' big three honors , song of the year , for the title track of their album " Viva La Vida . "
The group also won best rock album .
" Thank you and sorry to Sir Paul McCartney for blatantly recycling the ' Sgt. Pepper ' outfits , " the band 's Will Champion said , noting the group 's colorful attire .

Jennifer Hudson brought the house down with an emotional performance of a new ballad , " You Pulled Me Through , " and won best R&B album -- an award presented by another big-voiced vocalist , Whitney Houston .
Hudson was equally emotional in her acceptance speech .
" I 'd like to thank my family in heaven and those who are with me today , " she said , her voice catching .
" Everybody , thank you all , " she concluded .

Jamie Foxx took a star turn with a quartet of singers -- including Smokey Robinson -- in a medley of Four Tops songs in tribute to the group 's late lead singer , Levi Stubbs .
The University of Southern California marching band backed Radiohead 's performance .
Paul McCartney , backed by powerhouse Dave Grohl on drums , did " I Saw Her Standing There " -- the first track from the Beatles ' first album , " Please Please Me , " in 1963 .
Four famed rappers -- T.I. , Kanye West , Jay - Z and Lil Wayne -- were called the " Rap Pack " in a segment that followed a tribute to one of the Rat Pack singers , Dean Martin , who received a lifetime achievement award .
With them was M.I.A. , extremely pregnant but giving it her all .
Then there was the pairing of Stevie Wonder with the Jonas Brothers in a medley that concluded with Wonder 's " Superstition . "
Brown and Rihanna , each scheduled to perform , were notable for their absence .
Rihanna was scheduled to sing " Live Your Life / Disturbia " and Brown was later to sing " Forever . "
Apparently substituting for one of the slots was an all - star version of Al Green 's " Let 's Stay Together , " led by the good reverend himself .
With more than 100 categories , only a relative handful were presented on the show .
Among the winners not televised on the broadcast -- though available on the Internet -- was best comedy album , which went to the late George Carlin for " It 's Bad for Ya . "
It was his fifth Grammy .
Carlin 's daughter , Kelly , accepted on his behalf , saying she 'd take better care of it than Carlin did with his first Grammy .
That one , she observed , was taken apart in a " chemically induced , altered state . "
Carlin was eventually sent a new Grammy for his trouble .
Israeli forces have shot dead a Palestinian woman who fired on a police base in southern Israel , officials say , in the second fatal clash within hours .
No Israelis were reported hurt in the incident , near the town of Beersheba .
The woman 's death came hours after two Palestinian militants were shot and killed by Israeli troops as they approached Gaza 's border with Israel .
Palestinian emergency service workers said they had recovered two bodies from the scene and taken them to hospital .
One of the militants was reportedly a member of Islamic Jihad while the other belonged to a renegade militant group .
Both Israel and the main Palestinian militant group in Gaza , Hamas , declared unilateral truces following Israel 's three - week Gaza offensive on 17 January that killed more than 1,100 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
That invasion , Israel said , was meant to stop rocket attacks from the coastal enclave on nearby Israeli communities .
But dozens of rocket strikes and other attacks from Gaza have been reported since then , apparently involving smaller militant groups .
Israel has responded with air strikes .
What is claimed to be a copy of the Australian Communications and Media Authority ’s ( ACMA ) secret blacklist of prohibited websites has been leaked on the whistle - blower website WikiLeaks .
I can confirm the list includes a range of legal websites , including that of a political group supporting euthanasia and a popular Australian owned adult website to name only two .
The list is currently only distributed to approved filter vendors , but if mandatory ISP level filtering is introduced as planned this would be the list of websites that all Australian ’s would be restricted from viewing .
In other words , the blacklist which can not be opt out of .
ACMA ’s annual reports and Senator Stephen Conroy ’s answers to questions from Senator Scott Ludlam already confirmed that only around half of the sites on the list included content relating to child abuse material .
This is the first time we ’ve been able to identify the remaining legal content .
Electronic Frontiers Australia notes that a site containing poison information is present on the list , as well as many other harmless sites such as that of a tour operator .
EFA ’s Vice - Chair Colin Jacobs says
‘ Now that we have seen the list , it is clearly not the perfect weapon against child - abuse it has been made out to be . ’
‘ Many of the sites clearly contain only run -of - the - mill adult material , poker tips , or nothing controversial at all .
Even if some of these sites may have been defaced at the time they were added to the list , how would the operators get their sites removed if the list is secret and no appeal is possible ? ’
However , Senator Stephen Conroy told SMH the leak and publication of the ACMA blacklist would be ‘ grossly irresponsible ’ and undermine efforts to improve cyber safety .
Asher Moses at SMH writes :
He said ACMA was investigating the matter and considering a range of possible actions including referral to the Australian Federal Police .
Australians involved in making the content available would be at “ serious risk of criminal prosecution ” .
Moses also notes :
The leaked list , understood to have been obtained from an internet filtering software maker , contains 2395 sites .
ACMA said its blacklist , as at November last year , contained 1370 sites .
Assange [ of WikiLeaks ] said the disparity in the reported figure is most likely due to the fact that the list contains several duplicates and variations of the same URL that stem from a single complaint .
Alternatively , some sites may have been added to the list by the filter software maker .

When British businessman Imran Ahmad was made redundant in January , instead of hitting the Job Centre he decided to arrange a one - man speaking tour of the United States to spread his message of peace and Muslim moderateness .
" Do you think the American drone raids in Afghanistan , in which women and children are killed , are actually obstructing the movement for an Islamic reformation ? "
" What can be done about the alienation of young Muslim men in the UK ? "
" Did you learn English in England ? "
I 've had an interesting range of questions at my speaking events in the US , but thankfully there have been some laughs with the audience too .
But first things first : what am I doing with a rented hybrid car on a 12,000 - mile , 40 - city speaking tour of America ?
Imran Ahmad decided to take Mr Obama at his word I 'd always been grateful that Britain , the land of my upbringing , had remained remarkably tolerant of Muslims despite the shock of the 7 July bombings and continuing provocation from some extremist elements .
I think there 's still a good general understanding in the UK that the actions of a few do not represent all Muslims .
But I was n't sure the same could be said for the United States - a country where I 'd lived for five years and for which I 'd always had great affection .
There had been a dreadful incident on New Year 's Day this year in which nine Muslims - all US citizens , including three young children - had been removed from a domestic flight because two of them had been overheard discussing where was the safest place to sit on an aeroplane .
The FBI had been called in , the " suspects " questioned and the airline had initially refused to rebook them even after they were released without charge .
My own experience of the US had been formed in the years immediately before 9/11 , when I 'd lived there .
Religion and ethnicity had never been an issue .
Contrast this with the years since the 2001 attacks , when , on each visit , I 'd been detained for " secondary " questioning at immigration control sometimes for hours .
I do n't blame them for this , given the circumstances .
But it still had made me sad .
' Mutual respect '
Then , in January , I 'd been made redundant after many years as a programme manager in the UK .
Given the current economic situation , it did n't feel like a good time to be job - hunting .
If this is Washington , it must be Tuesday ...
Then one evening , I was reclining in my sofa , watching President Obama 's inauguration speech , and heard his mention of a new era of " mutual respect " between America and the Muslim world .
Suddenly the penny dropped .
I thought : " I can do that . "
My book , Unimagined - a Muslim Boy Meets the West , had been released in the US last autumn , and I 'd received a few e-mails from readers suggesting I come and speak in their church should I ever find myself in America .
As a trustee of British Muslims for Secular Democracy , I am committed to a positive relationship between the Muslim and Western worlds .
I became excited by the thought of a US speaking tour .
That evening , I sat down in my study , pulled out a map of the US , and began plotting a course starting in Chicago and working clockwise around the major population centres : the East Coast , the Carolinas , Florida , the Deep South , Texas , Kansas , Colorado , the deserts , up the entire West Coast , across the mid-West , and back to the Windy City .
I began contacting various organisations on the route , asking if I could speak at their venues .
Within days , I 'd had my first acceptances and the proposed plan quickly became a reality .
Of course , I 'd had moments of doubt .
Should I be doing this when I really needed to find a job ?
But with President Obama 's rhetoric in my sails , my goal , to re-humanise the relationship between America and the Muslim world ; to counter the unthinking tribalism which results in polarisation , dehumanisation and demonisation , seemed too important .
Questioned by police
But then , on my day of departure , two things happened which caused me to think twice .
Mr Ahmad is eight dates into his 40 - date tour An Iranian - born film - maker had been interviewing me about the trip , in my car whilst I was driving .
A few minutes after getting home , there had been a knock on the door .
Two police officers were investigating a report of two Middle Eastern men suspiciously filming in the town centre .
They were extremely polite , even apologetic , and once I 'd explained what was going on , they left without a fuss .
I do n't make any judgment here - it 's right that people should be vigilant .
Then , upon my arrival at Chicago O'Hare airport , I was n't detained for secondary screening .
The immigration officer , a pretty Hispanic woman , looked at my passport ( " Cute picture ! " ) , stamped it and wished me well .
I was relieved and surprised .
Now , I 'm eight dates into my tour .
It is tiring , but the audiences are giving me the energy to keep going .
They have been , without exception , warm and receptive .
Even people I meet outside the events ( generally hotel and restaurant staff ) have been delighted to hear I am a writer from England on a speaking tour around America on the subject of relations with the Muslim world .
I have always wanted to drive around the US , but had imagined this would be something I would do nearing retirement - otherwise , how would I have the time ?
To be doing it now with purpose is even better .
And I can look for a new job when I get back .
Below is a selection of your comments .
What a wonderful story .
I sincerely hope that this is the start of a movement away from confrontation toward mutual respect and tolerance .
How about some programmes along these lines on the BBC ?
Gary Stewart , Uckfield UK
It 's interesting , according to the itinerary on his website , Mr Ahmed is n't speaking at any Jewish organisations .
Is this because he was n't invited , did n't contact them , or was he worried about how he would be perceived if he did ?
Obviously this is a constituency that needs to be reached in the US as well .
Alejandro Sol , London , UK " Two police officers were investigating a report of two Middle Eastern men suspiciously filming in the town centre ...
I do n't make any judgment here - it 's right that people should be vigilant . "
They made judgment on you though .
Just the fact that you looked Middle Eastern and had a camera was enough for someone to call the police .
How accepted do you actually think you are in this community ?
Tabs , London Love this !
What an open - hearted , brave , positive thing to do .
From all us Muslims out there who regularly cringe when we read about what 's being done in our name in the news , thank you .
This is a breath of fresh air .
Farrah Jarral , London Al - salaam ' alaykum .
May
God reward you for your efforts to illuminate the darkness of ignorance and put into proper perspective the sensationalist stories broadcast by some sections of the media .
However , we human beings are God 's stewards on this planet , and it is our responsibility to take the greatest possible care of the resources that He has given us .
Therefore , I should feel happier if you travelled around the United States by TRAIN instead of by car , thus promoting the use of public transport and helping in the reduction of the carbon footprint .
Please think about it .
With salaam and best wishes .
Sylvia Juliette Hunt , Wester Ross , Scotland
This speaking tour is a great idea .
Do you plan any dates in Charleston , SC ?
Greg Brown , Charleston , South Carolina , USA
Is this guy trying to make a point because I have obviously missed it .
Has he been nominated as a Muslim ambassador ?
No .
So he should get back to the UK and get a job .
Paul Mayer , Leigh on Sea , Essex
When I hear stories like this it makes me cringe .
Why does Mr Ahmed think it 's necessary for him to go round and explain who he is ?
Is this a plug for his book ?
I guess there 's money to be made in being a professional Muslim nowadays and saying all the right things to soothe a predominantly ignorant audience .
It does n't answer the important issues because people do n't want to hear .
Also , what I find objectionable is this incessant use of the prefix " moderate " as if by default everyone else is an extremist .
Bilal Patel , London , UK
It would be best if his talks were given to audiences in Iran , Saudi Arabia or Pakistan explaining to them how the US and Britain do not want to be at war with Islamic terrorists and seek to tell them the West is not against them .
After all , all the terrorists concerned are Muslims attacking America and the west not the other way around .
Rob , Northwich , UK As a Northern Irish man who grew up during the troubles in Northern Ireland i can relate to Imran 's thinking .
During the 70's , 80's and 90's Irish people were treated very badly in the rest of the UK and around the world once it was learned where you were from .
For example my wife and i where in a small grocery shop in North London , we were discussing what to buy and within 5 mins two police officers arrived and questioned us about what we were doing .
The shopkeeper had overheard our accents and thought we were planting a bomb !
Rather the discussing the choice of our dinner for that night !
Richard Hayes , Bangor , Northern Ireland " As a trustee of British Muslims for Secular Democracy . "
Are n't you pretty much preaching to the converted ?
I mean , we 're mostly not Muslim , but we 're almost all for secular democracy .
You should be doing your tour in the new no - go for non-Muslim areas of England .
Nate , Portland USA
It would be interesting to read some excerpts from Mr. Ahmed 's speaking engagements .
And also to know how US audiences are responding to his tour and their concerns about this issue .
As a Muslim who returned to the US a month ago after five years of absence , I have had some limited conversations with folks here .
However , unlike Mr. Ahmed 's experience , I have always ( since 911 ) been singled out for extra scrutiny by the US airline authorities .
They call it random , but is it really random when it occurs every single time ?
It 's a distasteful , racist , unacceptable , and insulting profiling .
Selim Hassan , Dallas , Texas , USA
One must not forget 9/11 when over 3,000 people were killed and there was no backlash in the USA where majority of the population is Christian .
Just imagine what would have happened to minority Christians in a majority Muslim populated nation ?

After this beating , Abu Zubaydah was placed in a small box approximately three feet tall .
“ They placed a cloth or cover over the box to cut out all light and restrict my air supply .
As it was not high enough even to sit upright , I had to crouch down .
It was very difficult because of my wounds .
The stress on my legs held in this position meant my wounds both in the leg and stomach became very painful .
I think this occurred about three months after my last operation .
It was always cold in the room , but when the cover was placed over the box it made it hot and sweaty inside .
The wound on my leg began to open and started to bleed .
I do n’t know how long I remained in the small box ; I think I may have slept or maybe fainted .
“ I was then dragged from the small box , unable to walk properly , and put on what looked like a hospital bed , and strapped down very tightly with belts .
A black cloth was then placed over my face and the interrogators used a mineral water bottle to pour water on the cloth so that I could not breathe .
After a few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position .
The pressure of the straps on my wounds was very painful .
I vomited .
“ The bed was then again lowered to horizontal position and the same torture carried out again with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from a bottle .
On this occasion my head was in a more backward , downwards position and the water was poured on for a longer time .
I struggled against the straps , trying to breathe , but it was hopeless . ”
After being placed again in the tall box , Abu Zubaydah “ was then taken out and again a towel was wrapped around my neck and I was smashed into the wall with the plywood covering and repeatedly slapped in the face by the same two interrogators as before .
“ I was then made to sit on the floor with a black hood over my head until the next session of torture began .
The room was always kept very cold .
This went on for approximately one week . ”

Walid bin Attash , a Saudi involved with planning the attacks on American embassies in Africa in 1998 and on the Navy destroyer Cole in 2000 , was captured in Pakistan on April 29 , 2003 :
“ On arrival at the place of detention in Afghanistan I was stripped naked .
I remained naked for the next two weeks ....
I was kept in a standing position , feet flat on the floor , but with my arms above my head and fixed with handcuffs and a chain to a metal bar running across the width of the cell .
The cell was dark with no light , artificial or natural . ”
This forced standing , with arms shackled above the head , seems to have become standard procedure .
It proved especially painful for Mr. bin Attash , who had lost a leg fighting in Afghanistan :
“ After some time being held in this position my stump began to hurt so I removed my artificial leg to relieve the pain .
Of course my good leg then began to ache and soon started to give way so that I was left hanging with all my weight on my wrists . ”

Note :
This article has been edited to correct a previously published version .
Former University of Waterloo statistician David X. Li did n't burn down the American economy .
He just supplied the matches .
As economists and market watchers cast about for people to blame for the U.S. market meltdown , Li has surfaced as a scapegoat .
Recently , Wired magazine ran an article on Li's work subtitled , " The Formula That Killed Wall Street . "
The formula in question is the so - called Gaussian copula function .
On the most basic level , the formula allows statisticians to model the behaviour of several correlated risks at once .
In a scholarly paper published in 2000 , Li proposed the theorem be applied to credit risks , encompassing everything from bonds to mortgages .
This particular copula was not new , but the financial application Li proposed for it was .
Disastrously , it was just simple enough for untrained financial analysts to use , but too complex for them to properly understand .
It appeared to allow them to definitively determine risk , effectively eliminating it .
The result was an orgy of misspending that sent the U.S. banking system over a cliff .
" To say David brought down the market is like blaming Einstein for Hiroshima , " says Prof. Harry Panjer , Li's mentor at the University of Waterloo .
" He was n't in charge of the financial world .
He just wrote an article . "
When David X. Li first arrived from China in 1987 , he was known as Xiang Lin Li .
He already held a masters in economics from Tianjin 's Nankai University .
He was one of a group of the faculty there who won a scholarship to study business in Canada through CIDA .
In order to claim his prize at Quebec City 's Laval University , Li was given four months to master French .
" We were all highly motivated , " says Jie Dai , who was in the program with Li . " He was from a small town in the south of China .
A small family , very ordinary , not poor or rich .
There was n't anything distinguished about his personality . "
Li graduated with an MBA in 1991 .
Most of his Chinese classmates were bound for academia .
Li saw a more worldly future .
Says Dai : " I clearly remember him mention that if you are an actuarial guy , you can earn a lot more money . "
Li had recently married a colleague from Nankai when he decided to study at Waterloo 's department of statistics and actuarial sciences .
He was drawn by the work of Panjer , a world leader in the study of loss modelling , especially as it applies to the world of insurance .
" He had the ability to take ideas from different fields and synthesize them , " Panjer says .
In Waterloo , Li lived the hand - to - mouth life of a grad student .
He anglicized his name .
He and Panjer became close , and still correspond .
Over six years , he earned his third masters and a PhD .
After graduation in 1997 , Li taught briefly .
He worked for CIBC World Markets .
But his ambition quickly drove him to New York .
He tore up the corporate ladder .
By 2000 , he was a partner in J.P. Morgan 's RiskMetrics unit , trying to find ways to leverage a new generation of risk - based financial assets .
His breakthrough was an article published that year entitled , " On Default Correlation : A Copula Function Approach . "
Many of the ideas contained within it were drawn from statistics research Li had observed firsthand at Waterloo .
His insight was to transfer the work to financial models .
Li's model sidestepped the problem of trying to correlate all the variables that determine risk .
Instead , it based its assumptions on the historical dips and swells of the market itself .
In essence , Li used the past to map the future .
" It was a very simple mathematical answer almost anyone could use , " Panjer says " And when you 've got a hammer , everything suddenly looks like a nail .
They jumped on it . "
Through the lens of Li's theorem , even the shakiest investments suddenly looked viable .
The Gaussian cupola created the sort of financial alchemy that made high - risk mortgages and credit card debt look like triple - A rated gold .
Money poured into CDSs ( credit default swaps ) , a financial device that acts as an insurance policy against defaults .
By the end of 2007 , the total investment in credit default swaps had swelled to $ 62 trillion ( U.S. ) , a 6,700 per cent increase in only six years .
Li did n't make money directly off the idea , but it made him famous .
Maybe he sensed the danger inherent in the system he'd help establish .
By 2005 , Li was among those warning about the limitations of his model .
" The most dangerous part is when people believe everything coming out of ( the model ) , " he told The Wall Street Journal .
What Li's theorem could not do was predict what might happen in extreme economic environments , what experts call " tail dependency . "
And one was arriving .

The 2008 collapse of the U.S. housing bubble rendered Li's model useless .
Defaults that the model had not predicted piled up , rippling through U.S. banks and wiping out trillions of dollars in investment .
But Li's colleagues say he 's not to blame .
" We have a saying in statistics , ` All models are wrong , but some are useful , ' " says Panjer .
" He supplied something , a tool kit , for financial analysts .
They took one small part of it and used it in ways he had never intended . "
Li since moved to Beijing , where he heads the risk management department for the China International Capital Corp. , a major investment bank .
He has not commented on the meltdown or his role in it .

In Japan , their movies about mall cops are actually movies about mall cop robots .
I love that country so much .
Here then are my observations for what the obvious jokes are for a mall cop movie , how to avoid them and , with the insertion of some unnecessarily obscene biological humor , how to make a movie eight billion times better in the process .
How can I make such bold claims ?
Because I write on the Internet and none of you will check my math .
__ Obvious Joke / Theme # 1 : Mall Security
Guards are self - serious buffoons who want desperately to be real cops .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor : Syed Chowdhury was a doctor in his native Bangladesh .
But because none of his training is recognized in America , he has been forced to take a menial job as a mall security guard to feed his family .
The humiliating nature of his job , combined with the low levels of racism he regularly faces , has engendered in him an enormous antipathy towards most Americans in his heart .
He relieves these feelings of ill will by rubbing his genitals on selected items in the Williams & Sonoma after hours .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 2 : Mall Security
Guards make humiliatingly small salaries , and have horrible home lives because of it .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor :
Syed does make a humiliatingly small salary , but works two other jobs at different malls to compensate .
To make extra money , Syed operates a private members club after hours in the Sears furniture department , a place where " Spokane 's fattest swingers " can come to play .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 3 : Mall Security
Guards are fat and lazy .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor :
Syed is smaller than average , and possesses the trim physique of a cricket player .
His small hands and slender wrists get him unwanted attention from Friendly Mike , a regular at his after - hours club .
Friendly Mike produces videos of the sort where things that are n't meant to be inserted into other things , are , repeatedly and vigorously .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 4 : Mall Security
Guard gets in over his head when actual criminals perform actual crime in his mall .
Hilarity ensues .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor :
Syed himself gets caught up in a criminal enterprise within his mall .
The wife of one of Spokane 's most important car salesmen dies on mall premises during the production of one of Friendly Mike 's films .
It is not a good death .
Hilarity ensues .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 5 : Thanks to some quick thinking , and the use of a useless - seeming skill that was demonstrated earlier in the movie , the Mall Security Guard battles the villains in an action packed sequence .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor :
Syed makes things much , much worse , and soon finds himself in the center of a dark carnival of death and intrigue .
The film of the car salesman 's wife 's demise does brisk business thanks to the horror that is the Internet .
This business opportunity is seized upon by Syed and Friendly Mike .
By day Syed begins offering " parole " programs to shoplifters who want to avoid a criminal record , and by night Friendly Mike films these same shoplifters as they meet horrifically erotic demises between the racks at the Hallmark Store .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 6 : The Mall Security Guard overcomes his enemies and learns some important lessons about himself and life .
Not Obvious
Joke with the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor :
Syed disposes of the bodies in the dumpsters used by the food court .
They go unnoticed as it turns out they already smell like death .
He learns that he should stop eating at the food court , perhaps the hardest lesson of all .
Obvious Joke / Theme # 7 : The Mall Security Guard wins the heart of the girl who is much too hot to plausibly be attracted to him .
Not Obvious
Joke without the insertion of unnecessarily obscene humor : Syed and Friendly Mike begin spending time socially , and soon develop a platonic relationship that is more fulfilling than anything Syed has had in his life .
The film ends with the two of them riding a paddle boat in the park , laughing and splashing water on each other .

Disclaimer :
This article deals with ambiguous sociological concepts .
Many religious terms are used loosely , often in a different context from traditional beliefs in both the atheist community and in the religious community .
Context is provided where needed .
The word “ religion ” generally refers to supernatural religions .
The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious .
It is the source of all true art and all science .
He to whom this emotion is a stranger , who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe , is as good as dead : his eyes are closed .
– Albert Einstein , The Merging of Spirit and Science
In the above quote by Einstein , the condition of the “ mysterious ” that he refers to is neither a state of ignorance of reality , nor one of rational understanding ( both of which together form the limits of the factual knowledge gradient ) .
He seems to be alluding to an emotional purpose that transcends both these states .
Knowledge and Emotion :
Before I present the thesis of this article , I want to assert that human emotional purpose is on a different dimension to the one containing knowledge itself , both dimensions being facets of the human experience .
Factual knowledge and emotion are separate and yet interdependant aspects of human beings .
Despite evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould ’s infamous assertion about the separation between religion and science , the two magesteria really do overlap .
The bubbling battle between religion and science for socio-political domination , is evidence for the existence of this mutually inclusive contentious territory between the two .
The defense of science comes in the form of a philosophical line between itself and religion , drawn by those who study “ the demarcation problem “ .
Those of us who follow the progress of scientific understanding are aware that this demarcation line has been pushed far into religion ’s traditional territory over the decades .
This is indeed because of the resilience of the scientific method in explaining reality .
Both religion and science are in a race to control the factual knowledge dimension , and science is making solid progress there .
However , the emotional dimension is not being addressed in the debate between the two .
While religion has always exerted its control over the emotional dimension , science has been passive in this regard .
Thus , while science may be winning on the knowledge front , society is still ruled by the primitive emotions of conditioned thought that religion breeds .
The Thesis :
Science has , for the most part , ignored that “ mysterious ” emotional quality that Einstein referred to , while religion has influenced the emotional dimension since cultures invented mystical explanations .
Even the phrase “ mystical explanation ” is a religious construct to marry the emotional ( mystical ) dimension with a knowledge claim ( explanation ) manufactured by religion .
( Note : Here “ mystical ” is used in a general sense to refer to the emotional sense of wonder ) .
My argument is that in the light of the new and superior system of knowledge called science , “ mystical explanations ” need not be false religious ones , but can be true scientific ones .
They can be a way of looking into the window of objective reality that science opens to us , with the subjective eyes that open the internal window into our sense of emotional well - being .
As an example , consider Carl Sagan here :
Who are we ?
We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people .
– Carl Sagan
Sagan ’s soulful ( there ’s another one of those words ) agony at the insignificance of humanity in the vastness of the universe is as powerful an emotion as his ecstatic joy at being allowed by science this glimpse into a reality that is orders of magnitude more magnificent than anything written or imagined by the world ’s great “ prophets ” .
You may notice that there is a semantic game being played here by adopting the words “ mysticism ” and “ soul ” to portray an emotional view of a scientific concept .
I will soon explain why I believe that learning how to play this game of semantics is key to the survival of our values and ideas , but first let us question our assumptions about the need for a scientific sentimentalism .
Can Science Afford to Leave the Emotional Dimension to Religion ?
The emotional purpose is that which gives us our humanity .
It is what gives us our morality and our culture .
So let us look at this emotional dimension a little closer .
Here are three areas where emotion is key to human culture :
Human Interaction :
This is by far the area of human emotional behavior that is the most contested between religion and reason .
It consists of morality and social tradition .
The rules of social organization that religion imposed on young cultures thousands of years ago have become archaic and obscure as civilizations learned and grew up into reason .
But the myth that morals are derived from a divine source is still very persuasive in our culture .
Science must influence the emotions controlling human social interactions by promoting knowledge and moral education in social contexts .
We must push for alternatives to the religious morality being taught in Churches , Temples and Mosques .
We must prepare for a future of ethical and compassionate young rationalists to carry the torch of human endeavor into the next social paradigm .
Art , literature and music :
No atheist will deny that religion has had a huge influence on the arts .
From Michaelangelo ’s paintings to the ancient sculptures devoted to Hindu gods and goddesses , from the architecture of the Islamic enlightenment to Bach ’s ethereal compositions , from the great epics of Milton and Valmiki to the eight classical dance - forms in India , religion is pervasive in our culture .
Art that is inspired by religion adds beauty to our cultural sphere .
But this beauty will not diminish when we relegate those religious beliefs to the pages of mythology .
Roman and Egyptian art still stand for powerful symbols of human capacity for beauty , although the supernatural beliefs that inspired the art are not in favor any more .
Thus the value of Christian , Hindu , Islamic or Buddhist art will still contain emotional value long after those belief systems are mythologized and considered as the quaint fables believed by an ancient people .
I am not incapable of appreciating great art inspired by religion , but there is no reason why we cannot create art from the grander inspirations of nature .
Even today , Indian art is mostly religious , especially in the commercial art market .
This must change .
Pursuit of happiness :
Without a subjective and emotional perspective , life can not be .
It is obvious that our most basic actions are controlled by emotion and not by reason .
Furthermore , naturalistic philosophy implies that objective logic has limitations in this regard and that pursuing subjective wants such as happiness is left to the emotional aspects of our personalities .
Our desires and dreams are subject to emotion .
But we MUST remember to apply the emotional perspective only to non-naturalistic areas of our lives , and always use reason and science when dealing with factual claims .
This is a complicated area and I will try to address it in future posts .
A human being is a part of a whole , called by us ‘ universe ’ , a part limited in time and space .
He experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest … a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness .
This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty .
– Albert Einstein , 1954
To answer the question posed by the sub - heading , no , I do n’t think science can afford to leave the emotional dimension to religion .
The Semantics : New-age Mysticism Vs Scientific Mysticism :
We all draw lines to mark our understanding of ideas .
For example , many of us like to think of the line between science and religion as a clear boundary .
One set of beliefs is evidence - based and the other is faith - based .
( Some folk would disagree , saying that there could be evidence - based religions , but I ’m only concerned with supernatural religions here . )
I ’d like to direct your attention to a few other such boundaries , some not so clearly defined .
Consider the idea of “ mysticism ” that I alluded to above .
Let ’s say that mysticism usually refers to emotional concepts , but occasionally makes factual claims about reality .
Now , it is quite clear that those factual claims contained in any mystical statement can be analyzed for scientific validity .
This draws a line through the idea of “ mysticism ” .
There can be mystical claims that are true ( scientifically ) and those that are not .
If the emotional perspective is indeed as indispensable to humans as I propose above , then it is imperative that scientific mysticism replace religious mysticism in all aspects of culture .
The problem is complicated by the popularity of parasitic ideas such as new - age mysticism .
Let me explain .
New - age beliefs run the entire gamut , from factual claims to supernatural claims .
The one thing they have in common is a supernaturalistic appeal to concepts that were discovered / popularized through the successes of science .
Very often scientific ideas are stolen from their contexts and built into supernatural ideas , claiming the latter as scientific fact .
For example , there is quantum mysticism , magnetic therapy , electronic ghost hunting , space - traveling aliens , homeopathy , phrenology and so on - all ideas that borrow their credibility from the legitimacy of scientific language .
This is a semantic game .
Religions have been very successful at appealing to popular memes in society , usurping them in order to gain a presence .
This is very similar to the way in which mainstream religions such as Christianity take on some distinguishing characteristics of the local traditional beliefs when they spread to new areas .
There are plenty of examples of this , notably in South America and Africa .
In a similar fashion , new - age mysticism adopts the power of scientific language into its deceptive arsenal .
In general scientists do n’t want to talk about mysticism because of the fear of being misunderstood as promoting new - age concepts .
I think that they are right to fear the new - age movement , because the new - age folk are very well tuned into the mind - set of the masses .
In the liberal community new - age beliefs have become the dominant religious force , just as fundamentalist beliefs dominate the religious right .
However , I believe that scientists must not ignore mysticism altogether simply because they feel that the price of being accused of new - age mysticism is too high .
Instead , science educators must attempt to clarify the misunderstandings , clearly drawing the line between new - age mysticism and scientific mysticism in order to protect society from the former .
There is a war of linguistic annexation going on .
Religion wants the words that science has because these ideas in their scientific contexts have proved themselves time and again and have a newly found legitimacy in political thought .
Science , however , has become reticent to borrow terminology from religion .
I am arguing that science must turn around and annex mystical language , allowing scientific mysticism to claim a prominent role in humanity ’s emotional understanding of our natural world .
Wittgenstein ’s Nightmare :
The early 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is known for his thoughts on language and on the meaning of words used in understanding complex concepts .
When the meaning of these words are ambiguous , they must be well - defined before we form our understanding of the concepts they describe .
This is particularly important in today ’s information age where we have neither the time nor the patience to sort through the exponentially increasing quantities of descriptive data available .
There is a feeling in the popular culture that as large qualtities of information becomes more accessible to everyone , through the global spread of ideas and cultures , people will be better - off in general .
This is not supported by the evidence .
To the contrary , it appears more and more likely that information overload can actually have the opposite effect .
The clinical psychologist Steve Beller writes ,
I ’m defining information overload as a state of having more information available than one can readily assimilate , that is , people have difficulty absorbing the information into their base of knowledge .
This hinders decision - making and judgment by causing stress and cognitive impediments such as confusion , uncertainty and distraction .
Beller is specifically talking about the quantity of information vs the quality of knowledge paradox in the health - care field , when he describes “ a viscous cycle of information input –> information overload –> information rejection– > inhibited knowledge growth . ”
It can be argued that this state of perpetual information overload occurs across the board in the age of the internet .
Couple this over - abundance of information with a ) shorter attention spans , b ) less awareness of philosophical concepts because of more focus on skill - training in schools rather than on critical thought and c ) the booming pop-culture with its fascination for fleeting & transitional pleasures , and it is clear that developing a culture of scientifically aware individuals is becoming increasingly challenging .
This is what I call Wittgenstein ’s Nightmare .
The popular rationalist strategy in combating Wittgenstein ’s Nightmare is to promote scientific temper , thereby providing the masses with the means of thinking for themselves and evaluating the truth - value of specific claims .
It is definitely the most effective strategy , especially for those masses in rural areas who are fooled by simple tricks because they are unaware of science altogether .
The brilliant rationalists who write at Nirmukta - Narendra Nayak , Meera Nanda and Prabir Ghosh - are all very accomplished proponents of this effective way of spreading reason .
Their work towards this end is priceless .
This strategy of spreading awareness of the scientific way of thinking is also a common theme in popular skeptical programs like The Skeptics Guide to the Universe podcast .
However , this strategy can only be a partial solution .
I am committing rationalist heresy , in a manner of speaking , when I say that not all people are interested in learning the scientific method , and some are even incapable of meaningfully internalizing scientific ways of looking at reality !
The vast majority of human beings are more interested in appealing to our emotional judgments when it comes to many of the practical issues that are increasingly better understood through science .
Also , the scientific method can itself become a victim of Wittgenstein ’s Nightmare , causing people to deny science ’s naturalistic supremacy because they are confused by false information and propaganda against science .
For these folk , religion provides simpler and more emotionally satisfying answers .
Popular culture is now the most influential way to generate consensus on the meaning of terms .
This popular culture is driven by the social desires that propel the mass media .
Therefore , the solution to Wittgenstein ’s Nightmare is to embrace popular emotional aspects of culture , but using scientific reality as the inspiration for the emotion .
I believe that as information grows and the nightmare intensifies , only an emotional rescue of the interests of science will continue the propagation of the scientific way of thought in society .
Without developing a scientific mysticism , scientific rationalism will be increasingly hard to preach , while religious mysticism will continue to rise above the muddled chasm of contradictory beliefs regarding reality .
Religion and Naturalism :
The Religion of the future will be a cosmic religion .
It will transcend a personal God and avoid dogma and theology .
Covering both the natural and spiritual , it will based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity .
– Albert Einstein
There is no shortage of debate on this subject of reconciling science , emotion and culture in our society .
The most poignant of these debates is in the philosophical arena .
The philosophy behind science is naturalism .
In its most general form , naturalism is the understanding that all observed phenomena have natural causes .
The religious view , on the contrary , posits supernatural causes .
A few philosophical approaches are trying to bring religion and naturalism together .
Prominent among these is religious naturalism , a concept that came out of religious thinkers in America in the mid 19th century .
Despite its monastical beginnings , the term is used today not by the religious but by a few brilliant scientific minds .
There are different approaches to this idea .
There are those trying to save religion by naturalizing it , and those trying to save scientific culture by mysticizing it .
I am against the former and vehemently for the latter .
As in all cultural endeavors , the boundaries are less clear in practice .
Let me demonstrate three different sides to this issue .
Religious Naturalism :
If one revels in the beauty and wonder of the natural world that science opens to us , if one marvels at the unknown and quivers at the prospect of finding out what ’s out there waiting just beyond reach , if one can find meaning , purpose and a spiritual reason to love life in the scientific reality that we know and understand , then that is religious naturalism .
Carl Sagan can be described as a fervent “ religious ” naturalist .
But he never distorted scientific naturalism in order to incorporate factually unsupported ideas into his emotional worldview .
For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love .
– Carl Sagan
This is a classic example of religious naturalism .
The above mystical statement can be translated factually as : We are small .
The universe is vast .
Love is a fulfilling emotion that we can experience in relation to a natural universe .
Naturalizing Religion : Taking religion and infusing it with science is attempting to naturalize religion .
According to Michael Dowd who wrote the book “ Thank God for Evolution “ , “ Evolution can deepen one ’s faith ” .
In essence , Dowd is preaching the gospel of cognitive dissonance , by incorporating fables into a scientific worldview .
This is a corruption of science .
( Update : Michael Dowd has responded to the above criticism in the comments section ( highlighted ) .
I may have been harsh in saying that his position in his book is a corruption of science .
Also , the quote I presented that refers to “ faith ” does not show the context in Mr. Dowd uses the word .
He has written to me explaining that his use of the word is in a strict naturalistic sense to imply “ trust ” .
His strategy is aimed at religious believers , and although I believe that truly turning the lens of scientific scrutiny onto one ’s religious beliefs must lead one to reject the essence of religion itself , I must agree that his approach is primed for the religious mind .
Please check out our exchange below . )
The Middle Ground : Ursula Goodenough is one of the leaders in the new revival of the religious naturalism movement .
She is a true naturalist as far as her personal beliefs are concerned , not subscribing to any supernatural beliefs .
Her book “ The Sacred Depths of Nature ” beautifully weaves a mystical narrative of the natural world , borrowing heavily from religious language and popular ideas to fill the emotional gaps .
Her metaphors are breathtaking .
Patterns of gene expression are to organisms as melodies and harmonies are to sonatas .
It ’s all about which sets of proteins appear in a cell at the same time ( the chords ) and which sets come before or after other sets ( the themes ) and at what rate they appear ( the tempos ) and how they modulate one another ( the developments and transitions ) .
– Ursula Goodenough , The Sacred Depths of Nature .
There is , however , another side to her philosophy .
Although her book has spawned a new generation of religious naturalists , Goodenough favors sometimes bending the rules of naturalism for the purpose of unifying science and culture .
She has no qualms about distorting the naturalistic agenda of science by including those who have supernatural beliefs into the fold of religious naturalists .
I should mention , however , that the few times that I have heard her support this position it was in the context of attempting to bring people of different extremes together to accept science .
I think that Goodenough may subscribe to the “ practical reality ” that David Sloan Wilson preaches .
I must disagree with their strategy for three reasons .
( 1 ) The first is that this is a deceptive strategy , neither honest to itself nor to its opposition .
Science is concerned with objective truth .
We cannot condone perpetuating falsehoods while integrating naturalistic reality with emotion .
We must ask ourselves if such a misguided society would really be worth striving for , even if we accept the assumption that science will become more mainstream if we allowed religious explanations for naturalistic processes like evolution to go uncriticized .
( 2 ) My second opposition is to the assumption that such a deceptive strategy that compromises the integrity of the scientific understanding of reality would really be effective in making science more popular / mainstream .
I am yet to see any evidence for this popular claim by those appealing for this deception .
( 3 ) Finally , I also have a semantic disagreement with some of these religious naturalists .
I feel that they are taking the word game to the other extreme , where naturalism loses its significance because the terms being co-opted into scientific mysticism are too loaded .
Words like “ Spiritual ” , “ Love ” , “ Mystical ” , “ Beauty ” are all fine because they are easily understood as metaphysical metaphors for specific emotional states .
However , terms like “ Religion ” and “ God ” are going over the line , in my view , because they strongly suggest supernatural forces in action .
It would be hard to infuse those words into a scientific culture without compromising science itself .
It is possible that in a few decades humanity would be willing to accept a purely naturalistic “ God ” and “ Religion ” .
If this happens , let ’s remind ourselves that our goal is to remove the influence of supernaturalism as an explanatory concept , not to stubbornly target the words “ religion ” and “ God ” even after they have become purely neutral and emotional ideas .
If the supernatural connotations of these words can be removed over time ( in the not - so - distant future ) , then the words can become benign and even useful for scientific mysticism of a more honest type than the one that Ursula Goodenough endorses .
Epilogue :
To summarize the arguments , science must enter the emotional dimension and influence society , but
must not itself become corrupted by religion and supernatural beliefs .
This can only happen if the distinction between naturalism and supernaturalism is preserved in the cultural sphere , as it is in the scientific .
New - age mysticism and some false forms of religious naturalism attempt to distort science and incorporate supernatural or false factual claims , but that must only strengthen our resolve in working towards incorporating science in popular culture .
For most science - minded folks , scientific mysticism is already part of their lives even if they do n’t see it that way .
Millions of people congregate every day to celebrate their love for a rational and science - based understanding of reality .
Libraries , museums , planetariums , conventions , art - houses , college dorms and online forums come alive daily with wide - eyed science - lovers expressing their passion for the scientific worldview .
In many ways we have already begun to cross over into the mainstream .
The road ahead is long and religion will make it hard for science to influence the emotional dimension .
Given the success of science in the knowledge dimension , the emotional dimension is the only avenue that religion has left open to monopolize , and we can be sure that religion will not give up its emotional hold over society without a fight .
However , we MUST fight back knowing that society will truly be free only when the human condition is informed by science and guided by compassion .
Underground Orchids by Sarah Lindsay
Life on this planet persists in knitting its minerals
into animal and vegetable variations , behaving
at all times like the central point of the cosmos ,
and because it is water it seeks the paths of least resistance
and pauses sometimes to admire itself ,
because it is earth it may subside in camouflage
or darkness or cease to move for its own good reasons ,
because it is air it might seem like nothing
yet be the invisible sustenance of oceans or forests or a shade of blue ,
and because it is fire it leaps and is uncertain
and leaves smelly waste and goes everywhere it can uninvited .
It presses its lips where boiling sulfur cracks the ocean floor ,
swims in acid cavities below the roots of mountains ,
burrows and flits and infects and strangles and hatches ,
constructs mats , reefs , trunks , tunnels , stained - glass windows
and ad campaigns for raspberry - scented chinchilla dust .
Mammalian bipeds especially intrude where they are unfit to go ,
chewing coca leaves to walk on ridges where oxygen falls away ,
training beasts to carry weight in the desert and drinking their blood ,
beating sea water back with little hands .
On the southern ice cap , one turns his frozen socks inside out
and shakes his blackened toes into his lap .
In the country he comes from , earth is parched ,
air warped with the heat he longs for .
Thirsty flies glue themselves to plants that begin to digest them ;
modest orchids bloom underground .
In his country
glinting saucers are filling with penicillin
while soldiers don uniforms .
There is singing .
A shimmer over cannon mouths .
Fire consumes .
Mud consumes .
Many stars since they were born
have been sending their light to shine upon us ,
but some are rushing away as fast as they can .

Bespin
六本木にある SNS の会社で開催されたデータベースの勉強会に向かった私は道に迷って会場に辿りつけず失意のまま帰宅した.
もうサーバサイドなんて知らねーよ!
そう( 地図を忘れた自分に ) 憤り , 現実逃避にクライアントサイドのコードでも読むかと
Bespin を眺めた .
Bespin は Mozilla が開発中のウェブで動くテキストエディタサービス. デモ版 が公開されている .
もう少し詳しい話 によると , HTML5 の < canvas > で色々実装しているらしい .
そういえばそんな機能があったなーと思いだし , どんなものかと コード をチェックアウトした .
ツリーの構 成
Bespin のソースは今のところ約 3 万行 ある. サードパーティのライブラリを除くと 2 万行くらい .
backend / frontend / mocks / slices / docs / research / template /
アプリケーションのコードはサーバサイドの backend / とクライアントサイドの frontend / に収まっている .
サーバサイ ド( backend ) は python と java のコードが混じっている .
今は python しか使っていないらしい .
README の指示に従って動かすこともできた .
デモサイトと同じものがローカルで起動する.
backend のコードはだいたい 6000 行ある .
クライアントサイ ド( frontend ) のコード は大半が JavaScriptで , ちょっとだ け HTML と CSS .
外部ライブラリを除くとサイズはだいたい 10000 行. 今日は backend を無視して frontend を眺めたい .
( テーマ は <もうサーバサイドなんて知らねーよ> ですからね . )
フロントエンドのコードは大半が frontend / js にある. 内訳はこんなかんじ :
client / commandline / editor / external / syntax / th/ util / bestin.js bootstrap.js events.js registation.js
client はサーバとの xhr 通信を隠蔽したデータアクセス層 .
commandline は画面下にあるコンソール部分のハンドリング.
editor はテキストエディタの GUI .
syntax はエディタが利用するテキストの色付け機能. th は GUI コンポーネント .
util はブラウザ互換などの細かいコード を実装している .
external には外部ライブラリとして prototype.js と scriptaculous が入っている .
GUI コンポーネントの " th " とエディタを実装している " editor " の周辺が今回の見所です .
th
まず " th " から .
Bespin には二つの画面がある .
一つ目がレポジトリブラウザである dashboard で , サーバ上のファイルを一覧 , 選択できる .
dashboard でファイルを選ぶと , テキストを編集する editor の画面が起動する .
これが二つ目 .
dashboard の画面は RIA 風味のウェブアプリというミタメをしている .
実際ユーザにとってはそのとおりなんだけど , 実現には色々と頑張りがある ; dashboard 画面の GUI はほとんどが < canvas > 上に描かれている .
( Firebug で簡単に確認できる . )
" th " ではその GUI コンポーネント一式を定義している .
th/ th.js を眺めてみると , Component や Container などそれらしいクラスの定義がある .
... var Component = Class.define ( { .... members : { init : function ( parms ) { if ( ! parms ) parms = {} ; this .
bounds = parms .
bounds || {} ; this .
style = parms. style || {} ; this .
attributes = parms.attributes || {} ; this .id = parms.id ; ... } , getPreferredHeight : function ( width ) {} , .... paint : .... repaint : ... } } ; var Container = Class.define ( { ... superclass : Component , ... members : { init : function ( parms ) { this ._super ( parms ) ; this .children = [ ] ; } , ... paintChildren : function ( ctx ) { ... } ... layout : ... } } ;
th/components.js には Button , Panel , ... と具体的なコンポーネントの定義が続く:
var Button = Class. define ( { type : " Button " , superclass : Component , .... } ; var Scrollbar = Class.define ( { type : " Scrollbar " , superclass : Container , .... } ; var Panel = Class.
define ( { type : " Panel " , superclass : Container , ... } ; var Splitter = Class. define ( { type : " Splitter " , superclass : Container , ... } ; ...
他にも色々定義されているけれど , これだけでも雰囲気は伝わると思う. 要するに < canvas > と JavaScript を使ったベタな GUI ライブラリが " th " の中身だった .
コンポーネントのツリー構造は , Scene クラスが管理する .
var Scene = Class.define ( { uses : [ EventHelpers ] , members : { bus : th_global_event_bus , css : {} , sheetCount : 0 , currentSheet : 0 , cssLoaded : false , renderRequested : false , init : function ( canvas ) { this .
canvas = canvas ; ... this .root = new Panel ( { id : " root " , style : { ... }} ) ; this .root. scene = this ; ... } , render : function ( ) { if (! this.cssLoaded ) { this .
renderRequested = true ; return ; } this .layout ( ) ; this .paint( ) ; } , } ;
レイアウトはルートのコンポーネン ト( Panel コンテナ ) に移譲される .
layout : function ( ) { if ( this.root ) { this .root.
bounds = { x : 0 , y : 0 , width : this.canvas.width , height : this.canvas.height } ; this.root.layoutTree( ) ; } } ,
描画も同じノリだけれど , ちょっと前準備がある :
paint : function ( component ) { .... if ( component ) { // 自分が透明なら親を描く if (!component.opaque && component.parent ) { return this.paint( component.parent ) ; } // < canvas > から graphics context を取り出して ... var ctx = this.canvas.getContext ( " 2d " ) ; Bespin.Canvas . Fix(ctx ) ; // ブラウザ互換のワークアラウンド ctx.save( ) ; // 状態を push // 相対座標を絶対座標に変換 var parent = component .
parent ; var child = component ; while ( parent ) { ctx.translate(child.bounds.x , child.bounds.y ) ; child = parent ; parent = parent .
parent ; } // 画面をクリアしてクリッピングの設定をして... ctx.clearRect(0 , 0 , component.bounds.width , component.bounds.height ) ; ctx.beginPath ( ) ; ctx.rect( 0 , 0 , component.bounds.width , component.bounds.height ) ; ctx.closePath ( ) ; ctx.clip ( ) ; // 描く. component.paint(ctx ) ; ctx.restore ( ) ; // 状態を pop } } ,
GUI プログラミングをしたことがある人には見慣れた光景だと思う .
でもウェブアプリのコードでお目にかかるとは思わなかったなあ...
描画やレイアウトだけでなく , イベント配信も自前でやる :
var Bus = Class.define ( { members : { init : function ( ) { // map of event name to listener ... this .events = {} ; } , // リスナをイベントに登録する bind : function ( event , selector , listenerFn , listenerContext ) { var listeners = this.events [ event ] ; if ( ! listeners ) { listeners = [ ] ; this.events [ event ] = listeners ; } ... } .... // イベントの発火 fire : function ( eventName , eventDetails , component ) { var listeners = this.events[ eventName ] ; .... for ( var i = 0 ; i < listeners.length ; i++) { .... this.dispatchEvent(eventName , eventDetails , component , listeners [ i ] ) ; .... } } , dispatchEvent : function ( eventName , eventDetails , component , listener ) { eventDetails .
thComponent = component ; .... if ( listener.context ) { listener.listenerFn.apply(listener.context , [ eventDetails ] ) ; } else { listener.listenerFn(eventDetails ) ; } } } } ) ;
もちろんイベントの出所を辿れば DOM がある. 先に登場し た
Scene オブジェクトが DOM からのイベントをまとめて受けとり , それを " th " のイベントとして先 の
Bus オブジェクトに送りだしている .
... var th_global_event_bus = new Bus( ) ; ... var Scene = Class.define ( { ... members : { ... init : function ( canvas ) { ... // DOM のイベントリスナを登録 .
似たような各イベント用に一通りある .
Event.observe ( window , " mousedown " , function (e ) { self.wrapEvent(e , self.root ) ; self.mouseDownComponent = e.thComponent ; th_global_event_bus.fire(" mousedown " , e , e.thComponent ) ; } ) ; ... } , ... } ... } ;
こうしてみると , < canvas > の上で DOM や CSS のようなレンダリングモデルを再発明するのが " th " の仕事というかんじ .
イベントだけでなく CSS も再発 明( というか再実装 ) している .
コンポーネント群のミタメを設定するために , jQuery 由来の CSSParser を使ってスタイルシートを解釈 , 適用しようとする .
// th/th.js ... processCSS : function ( stylesheet ) { // ブラウザに頼らず CSS を解釈 this.css = new CSSParser ( ) .parse ( stylesheet , this.css ) ; if ( ++this.currentSheet == this.sheetCount ) { this .cssLoaded = true ; if ( this.renderRequested ) { this .render ( ) ; // この中で this.css を使うつもり？ this .
renderRequested = false ; } } }
ただし今のところこの機能を使っているコンポーネントはない. まだつくりかけらしい. 各コンポーネントはコンストラクタの引数でスタイルづけされている.
dashboard
レポジトリブラウザ dashboard の GUI は " th " を使い実装されている .
client/dashboard_components.js
で th のサブクラスを定義し , client / dashboard.js で それらをインスタンス化する .
// dashboard.js ... Event.observe ( document , " dom:loaded " , function ( ) { ... scene = new Scene ( $ ( " canvas " ) ) ; ... tree = new Horizontal Tree ( { style : { ... }} ) ; // Finder 風のツリービュー var renderer = new Label ( { style : { border : new EmptyBorder ( { size : 3 } ) } } ) ; renderer. paint = function ( ctx ) { ... } ; .... projects = new BespinProjectPanel( ) ; var topPanel = new Panel( ) ; topPanel.add ( [ projects , tree ] ) ; topPanel.layout = function ( ) { ... } ; ... var splitPanel = new SplitPanel ( { id : " splitPanel " , attributes : { ... }} ) ; ... scene.root.add( splitPanel ) ; .... // setup the command line _server = new Bespin. Server ( ) ; _settings = new Bespin. Settings .
Core ( ) ; _files = new Bespin.FileSystem ( ) ; _commandLine = new Bespin.CommandLine.
Interface ( $ ( ' command ' ) , Bespin.Commands .Dashboard ) ; .... } ) ; ...
現段階で既にレイアウトや描画をフックしているあたり , th の出来は推して知るべしだなあ ... そのうち直すんだろうけどね .
dashboard ではツリービューのダブルクリックを拾い , エディタを開く .
var go = Bespin .
Navigate ; // short cut static method .... scene.bus.bind ( " dblclick " , tree , function (e ) { var newTab = e.shiftKey ; var path = tree.getSelectedPath( ) ; if ( path.length == 0 || path.last ( ) .contents ) return ; // do n't allow directories either go.editor ( currentProject , getFilePath ( path ) , newTab ) ; } ) ;
editor
というわけでテキストを編集する " editor " へ.
editor / editor.js model.js actions.js undo.js ...
" editor " の主だったコードは editor.js にある .
UI , API , Scrollbar , Events といったクラスが定義されている .
他のファイルを概観すると , model.js は編集中のテキストを保持する DocumentModel オブジェクトを定義している .
actions.js には各種エディタコマンドが , undo.js はアンドゥ可能なコマンドリストを管理する
UndoManager が定義されている .
まず " editor " の facade として Editor .
API が定義されている .
Editor .
API は Editor .
Xxx クラス群をまとめてインスタンス化し , つなぎあわせている .
Bespin.Editor .API = Class.create ( { initialize : function ( container ) { ... this .model = new Bespin.Editor.DocumentModel( ) ; ... this .ui = new Bespin. Editor .
UI ( this ) ; this .
theme = Bespin. Themes [ ' default ' ] ; // set the default which is in themes.js ( Coffee ) this.cursorPosition = { row : 0 , col : 0 } this.editorKeyListener = new Bespin.Editor.DefaultEditorKeyListener( this ) ; this.undoManager = new Bespin.Editor.UndoManager ( this ) ; this.customEvents = new Bespin.Editor .
Events ( this ) ; } , .... } ;
テキストのデータ構造を実装するのが Editor.DocumentModel :
Bespin.Editor.DocumentModel = Class.create ({ .... initialize : function ( ) { this .rows = [ ] ; } , ....
" 文字列の配列 " という , いたって素朴な構造を使っている .
描画を支援するために dirty な( 変更された ) 行の管理くらいはしている .
setRowDirty : function ( row ) { if (! this.dirtyRows ) this.dirtyRows = new Array ( this.rows.length ) ; this.dirtyRows[row ] = true ; } ,
そのほかエディタっぽいテキスト操作がいくつか実装されている.
// 文字列の挿入 insertCharacters : function ( pos , string ) { var row = this.getRowArray( pos.row ) ; while ( row.length < pos.col ) row.push ( " " ) ; var newrow = ( pos.col > 0 ) ? row.splice(0 , pos.col ) : [ ] ; newrow = newrow.concat( string.split ( " " ) ) ; this.rows[pos.row ] = newrow.concat( row ) ; this.setRowDirty(pos.row ) ; // ダーティーフラグを立てる } , // 置換 replace : function ( search , replace ) { for ( var x = 0 ; x < this.getRowCount( ) ; x++ ) { var line = this.getRowArray(x ) .join ( '' ) ; if ( line.match ( search ) ) { var regex = new RegExp ( search , " g " ) ; var newline = line.replace ( regex , replace ) ; if ( newline != line ) { this.rows[ x ] = newline.split('' ) ; } } } // ダーティーフラグは？ } ,
こうした API はエディタのコマンド ( action ) から利用される .
モデルの描画を担当するのが Editor .
UI クラス .
コマンドに応じてスクロール情報やカーソルをなどの
UI の状態を更新し , それら UI の状態 と DocumentModel のデータ構造を参照しながら編集領域を描画する .
Bespin.Editor .UI = Class.create ( { initialize : function ( editor ) { this.editor = editor ; this.syntaxModel = new Bespin.Syntax.Model( editor ) ; this.selectionHelper = new Bespin.Editor.SelectionHelper(editor ) ; this.actions = new Bespin.Editor.Actions ( editor ) ; this.toggleCursorFullRepaintCounter = 0 ; .... // combining them like sane people , but ... meh this.horizontalScrollCanvas = new Element ( " canvas " ) ; this.verticalScrollCanvas = new Element ( " canvas " ) ; ... } , .... } ) ;
なぜか th のコンポーネントモデルに載らず , 自分で canvas を作っているのがわかる .
実際 " editor " 全体が " th " に依存していない .
コンストラクタに渡された DOM 要素に新しく < canvas > を作り , その canvas に対してエディタの編集領域を描画する .
Bespin.Editor .API = Class.create ( { initialize : function ( container ) { this .
container = container ; this .
model = new Bespin.Editor.DocumentModel( ) ; $( container ).innerHTML
= " < canvas id=' canvas ' moz-opaque= ' true ' tabindex= '-1'></ canvas > " ; this.canvas = $ ( container ).childElements ( ) [ 0 ] ; .... } , } ;
編集領域のみならず , ツールバーにも " th " は使われていない .
ツールバーは DOM で作ってある .
そのへんの一貫性は気にしないのか...
脇道にそれた .
UI クラスに戻ると , ほかにも色々とエディタっぽいメソッドがある .
... // カーソルの点滅 toggleCursor : function ( ui ) { ui.showCursor = !ui.showCursor ; if (++this.toggleCursorFullRepaintCounter >
0 ) { this.toggleCursorFullRepaintCounter = 0 ; ui.editor.paint( true ) ; } else { ui.editor.paint ( ) ; } setTimeout ( function ( ) { ui.toggleCursor ( ui ) } , 250 ) ; } , ... // 範囲選択 setSelection : function(e ) { var clientY = e.clientY - this.getTopOffset ( ) ; var clientX = e.clientX - this.getLeftOffset( ) ; ... // DOM のイベントを内部の範囲指定に変換し , Editor .
API に移譲する var down = Bespin.Editor.Utils.copyPos(this.selectMouseDownPos ) ; .... var point = { x : clientX , y : clientY } ; point.x += Math.abs( this.xoffset ) ; point.y += Math.abs ( this .yoffset ) ; var up = this.convertClientPointToCursorPoint( point ) ; .... if (! Bespin.Editor.Utils.posEquals( down , up ) ) { this.editor.setSelection({ startPos : down , end Pos : up } ) ; } else { .... } } , // 文字幅の計算 : 等幅フォントを仮定 getCharWidth : function ( ctx ) { if ( ctx.measureText ) { return ctx.measureText ( " M " ) . width ; } else { return this .
FALLBACK_CHARACTER_WIDTH
; } } , ...
そして編集画面の描画 .
Editor .
UI の山場だ :
... paint : function ( ctx , fullRefresh ) { .... // 変数宣言色々 var c = $ ( this.editor.canvas ) ; var theme = this .editor .
theme ; var ed = this .editor ; .... // 描画範囲の算出 , 座標の変換 , ... this.lastCursorPos = Bespin.Editor.Utils.copyPos(ed.cursorPosition ) ; ... ctx.save( ) ; // take snapshot of current context state so we can roll back later on ctx.translate ( 0 , this .
yoffset ) ; ... // only paint those lines that can be visible this.visibleRows = Math.ceil( cheight / this.lineHeight ) ; this.firstVisibleRow = Math.floor ( Math.abs( this.yoffset / this.lineHeight ) ) ; lastLineToRender = this.firstVisibleRow + this.visibleRows ; ... for ( currentLine = this.firstVisibleRow ; currentLine <= lastLineToRender ; currentLine ++ ) { // 部分書き換え : ふつうはこっち. if ( !refreshCanvas ) { if ( !dirty[ currentLine ] ) { // 書き換え不要な行はスキップ y += this .
lineHeight ; continue ; } .... // 行の部分だけをクリップして... ctx.save( ) ; ctx.beginPath ( ) ; ctx.rect( x + ( Math.abs ( this.xoffset ) ) , y , cwidth , this.lineHeight ) ; ctx.closePath ( ) ; ctx.clip ( ) ; } // 選択部分の背景を塗って... var selections = this.selectionHelper.getRowSelectionPositions(currentLine ) ; if ( selections ) { tx = x + ( selections.startCol * this.charWidth ) ; tw = ....
ctx.fillStyle = theme.editorSelectedTextBackground ; ctx.fillRect(tx , y , tw , this .
lineHeight ) ; } // 構文ハイライトモジュールに行の着色情報を問合せて var lineInfo = this.syntaxModel.getSyntaxStyles(currentLine , this.editor.language ) ; for ( ri = 0 ; ri < lineInfo.regions.length ; ri++ ) { var styleInfo = lineInfo.regions[ri ] ; // 色ごとにテキストを描く. for ( var style in styleInfo ) { if ( !styleInfo.hasOwnProperty ( style ) ) continue ; var thisLine = " " ; // 該当色でない部分は空白を詰める var styleArray = styleInfo[style ] ; var currentColumn = 0 ; // current column , inclusive for ( var si = 0 ; si < styleArray.length ; si++) { var range = styleArray[si ] ; for ( ; currentColumn < range.start ; currentColumn ++) thisLine += " " ; thisLine += lineInfo.text.substring(range.start , range.stop ) ; currentColumn = range.stop ; } // ようやくテキスト描画 ctx.fillStyle = this.editor.theme[style ] || " white " ; ctx.font = this.editor.theme.lineNumberFont ; ctx.fillText ( thisLine , x , cy ) ; } } .... y += this .
lineHeight ; // 次の行へ } // カーソルやスクロールバーを描くコードが続く... ... } , ....
行の描画をスタイル単位でやっているのは面白い. font の変更が高くつくのか , fillText ( ) が重いのか .
syntax
編集領域の描画に利用している構文ハイライトモジュールは , " syntax " ディレクトリにある .
今のところ大したものではない( とコメントに書いてある ) .
たとえば HTML の構文ハイライトを実装した HTMLSyntaxEngine のコードを見てみよう .
// syntax/html.js Bespin.Syntax.HTMLSyntaxEngine = Class.create ( { keywordRegex : " /*( html|head|body|doctype|link|script|div|span|img|h1|h2|h3|h4|h5|h6|ul|li|ol|blockquote ) " , ... highlight : function ( line , meta ) { if ( ! meta ) meta = {} ; ... var regions = {} ; ... var currentRegion = {} ; // should always have a start property for a non -blank buffer var buffer = " " ; ... for ( var i = 0 ; i < line .
length ; i++) { var c = line.charAt ( i ) ; ... // コメントの内側かどうかをチェック... if ( this.isWhiteSpaceOrPunctuation ( c ) ) { // 字句の区切れ目なら... if ( buffer != " " ) { currentRegion.stop = i ; if ( currentStyle != K.STRING ) { if ( buffer.match (this.keywordRegex ) ) { // キーワードだった // the buffer contains a keyword currentStyle = K.KEYWORD ; // キーワードである旨を記録 } else { currentStyle = K.OTHER ; } } // 字句の region と種別を 追記 this .
addRegion( regions , currentStyle , currentRegion ) ; currentRegion = {} ; stringChar = " " ; buffer = " " ; // i do n't clear the current style here so I can check if it was a string below } ... } ... buffer += c ; } ... return { regions : regions , meta : { inMultilineComment : multiline } } ; } , addRegion : function ( regions , type , data ) { // region はスタイル種別毎の表である. if ( ! regions [ type ] ) regions [ type ] = [ ] ; regions [ type ].push ( data ) ; } , ... // グローバルなレジストリにオブジェクトを登録 Bespin.Syntax.EngineResolver.register(new Bespin.Syntax.HTMLSyntaxEngine( ) , [ ' html ' , ' htm ' , 'xml ' , ' xhtml ' ] ) ;
基本的に行単位で文字列を字句にばらし , それをスタイル種別毎の region 集合に分解している .
コメントの内外判定など行をまたぐ継続は 引数と戻り値の meta プロパティに含まれている .
html 以外に css と javascript の構文ハイライトに対応している .
どちらもおよそ似たような作りだった .
action とキーマッ プ
エディタ実装の定石( 伝聞ですが ) として , キー入力イベントをそのまま 内部モデルに渡すことはしない .
かわりにキーと API を対応づけるオブジェクトをはさんでカスタマイズの余地を残す .
Editor.DefaultEditorKeyListener がその対応づけを受け持つ .
// editor/editor.js ... Bespin.Editor.DefaultEditorKeyListener = Class.create ( { initialize : function ( editor ) { this .editor = editor ; this.actions = editor.ui.actions ; this.skipKeypress = false ; this.defaultKeyMap = {} ; //
Allow for multiple key maps to be defined this .keyMap = this.defaultKeyMap ; } , ... // this .keyMap に action 関数を登録する bindKey : function ( keyCode , metaKey , ctrlKey , altKey , shiftKey , action ) { this .defaultKeyMap [ [ keyCode , metaKey , ctrlKey , altKey , shiftKey ] ] = ( typeof action == " string " ) ? function ( ) { var to Fire = Bespin.Events.toFire(action ) ; document.fire(toFire.name , to Fire.args ) ; } : action.bind(this.actions ) ; } , // bindKey ( ) の指定に文字列を使うためのヘルパ bindKeyString : function ( modifiers , keyCode , action ) { var ctrlKey = ( modifiers.toUpperCase().indexOf ( " CTRL " ) != - 1 ) ; .... return this .
bind Key( keyCode , metaKey , ctrlKey , altKey , shiftKey , action ) ; } , // キー入力に応じた action 関数を this .
keyMap から検索して呼び出す. onkeydown : function(e ) { ... var action = this.keyMap[[e.keyCode , e.metaKey , e.ctrlKey , e.altKey , e.shiftKey ] ] ; ... if ( typeof action == " function " ) { hasAction = true ; action ( args ) ; this .lastAction = action ; } // ブラウザとしての挙動を保つため , 一部のイベントをブラウザに横流しする //
If a special key is pressed OR if an action is assigned to a given key ( e.g. TAB or BACKSPACE ) if ( e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey || e.altKey || hasAction ) { this .skipKeypress
= true ; this .
returnValue = true ; if ( hasAction || !Bespin.Key.passThroughToBrowser(e ) ) Event.stop(e ) ; } } , ... } ;
デフォルトのキーバインドは別のところで登録される:
// editor/editor.js installKeyListener : function ( listener ) { // ついでに listener を DOM に登録する this .oldkeydown = listener.onkeydown.bindAsEventListener(listener ) ; this .
oldkeypress = listener.onkeypress.bindAsEventListener(listener ) ; Event.observe ( document , " keydown " , this .oldkeydown ) ; Event.observe ( document , " keypress " , this .oldkeypress ) ; // キーバインドへのアクションの登録 ... listener.bindKeyString ( " CTRL " , Key. K , this.actions.killLine ) ; listener.bindKeyString (" CTRL " , Key.L , this.actions.moveCursorRowToCenter ) ; listener.bindKeyString ( " " , Key. BACKSPACE , this.actions.backspace ) ; listener.bindKeyString ( " " , Key.DELETE , this.actions.deleteKey ) ; listener.bindKeyString ( " " , Key.ENTER , this.actions.newline ) ; listener.bindKeyString ( " " , Key. TAB , this.actions.insertTab ) ; listener.bindKeyString ( " APPLE " , Key.A , this.actions.selectAll ) ; listener.bindKeyString (" CTRL " , Key.A , this.actions.selectAll ) ; ... }
リスナ登録される action 関数群は Editor .
Actions に定義されている :
// editor/actions.js Bespin.Editor .
Actions = Class.create ( { initialize : function ( editor ) { this .editor = editor ; this.ignoreRepaints = false ; } , .... // 右にカーソル移動 moveCursorRight : function ( args ) { // end of the line , so go to the start of the next line if ( _settings.isOn(_settings.get ( ' strictlines ' ) ) && ( this.editor.cursorPosition.col >= this.editor.model.getRowLength(args.pos.row ) ) ) { var originalRow = args.pos.row ; this.moveCursorDown(args ) ; if ( originalRow < this.editor.model.getRowCount( ) - 1 ) this.moveToLineStart( args ) ; return ; } this.editor.cursorPosition.col = args.pos.col + 1 ; this.handleCursorSelection( args ) ; this .repaint( ) ; } , .... }
このレイヤで再描画を意識するのは茨の道な気がするなー...
見ていないところと雑感
これで内部モデル、描画からイベント受取まで、 一通り Bespin のテキスト編集を眺めた .
さくさく読める小さなコードでいい気晴らしになった.
レポジトリブラウザの dashboard はちゃんと見てないし , Emacs の minibuffer みたいな commandline も見てないけれど , どちらも特に面白くなかったので割愛いたします .
Mozilla 自身がプロトタイプだと強調するとおり , Bespin 自身はまだ先は長い仕事という印象 .
機能が少いとか日本語が使えないとかはさておき , 構造が練られている感じがしない. 特にエディタや IDE は歴史が長く ユーザのこだわりもある分野だから , もうちょっと素敵設計になっていないと寂しい .
外野が拡張していける夢を感じない .
いまはミタメやデモ映えを重視している風なので , バージョンを重ねる時には構造も洗練して欲しいと思う.
もっともコードの規模が小さい今のうちからフォローするのは
成長を見届ける意味で面白いかも知れない.
腕に覚えがあれば patch の寄稿もしやすいだろう .
他の言語の構文ハイライトとかね .
< canvas > を使い倒すアイデアは気に入った. < canvas > はけっこう前からある機能だし , ソフトウェアの 3D レンダリングをやっている人もいる くらいだから それなりの性能が出ることは知っていたはずなのに , なんとなくナナメに線が引けるくらいの印象しかなかった.
でも editor を読んで , アプリケーションの描画を任せていいかも知れないという感触を持った.
どこまで < canvas > を使うべきかはよくわからない.
個人的には " th " のように GUI ライブラリを作るのは やりすぎな気がする .
たぶん DOM を使う方が楽だろうし , 反応速度も上だろう .
ウィンドウサイズを変えたときなど , HTML 部分のレイアウト変更から一息遅れて th の描画部分が更新される .
ライブラリとして使いまわすときも DOM の方がインテグレートしやすそうだ. せめて < canvas > をネストできて , Flash の DisplayObject のようなイベント配信や描画順制御をしてくれれば , DOM の延長として扱いやすいだろうにね .
エディタの編集領域や , あとはドローツールやチャートのように , 描画を細かく制御したいものには < canvas > の方が苦労は少いだろう .
IE が対応しない限り仕事では使えないけれど , 趣味のコードに は Flash より < canvas > の方が宗教上の嗜好と合う .
JavaScript と ActionScript を往復せずに済むのも ウェブの技術がよくわからない年寄りに( 比較的 ) 優しい .
その昔 , Windows プログラミングの時代のこと .
MFC はよくわかんないけ ど OpenGL や Direct3D ならわかるプログラマが ウィンドウの枠やメニューを出すためだけに MFC を使って , 主な描画は OpenGL / Direct3D でやるという選択肢があった .
今なら DOM はよくわかんないけど線を引いたり色を塗ったりするのは得意なプログラマが 最低限の枠組みだけを HTML / DOM で作って , あとは < canvas > でがんばるという選択肢もあるんだね.
まとめ :
Bespin は < canvas > で色々がんばってるウェブ上のテキストエディタ

Nokia launched the 5800 in the US last Friday Nokia is investigating reports of problems with its touchscreen 5800 phone in the US , just days after the mobile was launched .
The device has been removed from sale at two flagship stores in the US .
The problem is with connections to US 3G networks , BBC News has learned .
A spokeswoman for Nokia told BBC News : " A small number of devices are not connecting with 3G networks and we are looking through that right now . "
She said the phone continued to be sold in " certain network areas " .
At the New York and Chicago flagship stores only the European version of the Nokia 5800 is on sale .
Sales agents at the New York store are telling customers the phone has a " little issue " and they are " not being sold at all while the problems are looked into " .
Nokia launched the 5800 Xpress Music phone in the US last Friday and the device has been described as the firm 's response to the iPhone .
The European version of the 5800 , which cannot access 3G networks in the US , is still being sold and is unaffected by the problem , BBC News understands .
In a statement Nokia said the issue was " a very isolated problem concerning only the North American market and is not specific to any other region or country " .
It added : " Nokia is investigating the issue .
Existing customers of the 5800 XpressMusic who experience 3G signal issue with the device are advised to contact Nokia Customer Care . "

The ad - serving system profiles the sites people visit online Amazon has said it will not allow online advertising system Phorm to scan its web pages to produce targeted ads .
Phorm builds a profile of users by scanning for keywords on websites visited and then assigns relevant ads .
It has proved controversial because it scans almost all sites a user visits and there is an ongoing political debate about how a user gives consent .
Last month the Open Rights Group wrote to the world 's leading websites asking them to opt out of Phorm .
Phorm has conducted trials with BT of its technology , which is marketed as Webwise .
BT plans to roll out the service to users after analysing the results of the trials .
In a statement , Amazon UK said : " We have contacted Webwise requesting that we opt out for all of our domains . "
The company declined to comment further on the reasons behind its decision .
In a statement , Phorm said : " There is a process in place to allow publishers to contact Phorm and opt out of the system , but we do not comment on individual cases . "
Last month the Open Rights Group wrote to the chief privacy officers at Microsoft , Google / Youtube , Facebook , AOL / Bebo , Yahoo , Amazon and Ebay urging them to opt - out of Phorm .
Drop plans Amazon is the first company to give any sort of response at all .
Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group , said :
We expect more sites to block Webwise in the near future and also ISPs to drop plans to snoop on web users . "
He said other sites - LiveJournal , mySociety and Netmums - had contacted the Open Rights Group to say they too would be blocking Phorm 's technology .
Earlier this week the European Commission said it was starting legal action against the UK over its data protection laws in relation to Phorm 's technology .
The European Commission has described the technology as an " interception " of user data and wants UK law to reflect more explicitly the need for consent from users in order for the service to be implemented .
At present , UK law only covers " intentional " interceptions and requires there only to be a " reasonable grounds for believing " that consent to interception has been given .

Around 21,000 homes were destroyed or damaged during the recent conflict .
The United States is preparing to donate some $ 900 m ( £ 621 m ) for Gaza , an Obama administration official said .
The aid would not go to Hamas , the group that controls the territory , but it would help the Palestinian Authority , the official added .
It comes as the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepares to attend a Palestinian donors ' conference .
Any US aid would have to be approved by Congress , where some are wary that funds could still end up with Hamas .
The donors ' conference in Egypt next week will discuss humanitarian and reconstruction needs in the Gaza Strip after Israel 's recent military offensive .
Two separate Palestinian surveys have put the cost of the damage at just under $ 2bn .
Without power
The US official spoke anonymously because the donation has not received final approval and he was not authorised to talk about it before it was announced by Mrs Clinton .
The US secretary of state will travel to Egypt for the conference , which is being held next Monday .
Later that week she will visit Israel , according to officials in Jerusalem , for her first trip to the region in her new role .
GAZA CRISIS
Gaza : Humanitarian situation Counting casualties of Gaza's war Gaza slowly begins rebuilding She is also expected to visit the West Bank .
Although she is unlikely to go to Gaza , a US official said .
The US considers Hamas a terrorist organisation and refuses to deal with the group but it recognises the West Bank - based Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
The aid would go to nongovernmental and UN organisations , with some going to the Palestinian Authority , the official said .
Around 1,300 Palestinians , of whom 412 were children , were killed during the Israeli offensive on Gaza ; 21,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged .
Thirteen Israelis were killed during the three weeks of violence .
In its latest report , the UN says 90 % of Gaza 's 1.5 m residents have intermittent electricity , while 50,000 people do not have access to piped water .
Israel meanwhile continues to keep Gaza 's borders closed , allowing in only essential supplies .
Hamas has called for the reopening of the crossings as part of on - going Egyptian truce talks but Israel says there first needs to be an end to rocket fire from the territory , plus a halt to the smuggling of weapons and the release of a captive Israeli solider .

Since the dawn of the white - collar age , office designs have cycled through competing demands : openness versus privacy , interaction versus autonomy .
Here 's a brief history of how seating arrangements have reflected our changing attitudes toward work .
1 Taylorism ( ca. 1904 ) American engineer Frederick Taylor was obsessed with efficiency and oversight and is credited as one of the first people to actually design an office space .
Taylor crowded workers together in a completely open environment while bosses looked on from private offices , much like on a factory floor .
2 Bürolandschaft ( ca. 1960 ) The German " office landscape " brought the socialist values of 1950s Europe to the workplace : Management was no longer cosseted in executive suites .
Local arrangements might vary by function — side - by - side workstations for clerks or pinwheel arrangements for designers , to make chatting easier — but the layout stayed undivided .
3 Action Office ( 1968 ) Bürolandschaft inspired Herman Miller to create a product based on the new European workplace philosophy .
Action was the first modular business furniture system , with low dividers and flexible work surfaces .
It 's still in production today and widely used .
In fact , you probably know Action by its generic , more sinister name : cubicle .
4 Cube Farm ( ca. 1980 ) It 's the cubicle concept taken to the extreme .
As the ranks of middle managers swelled , a new class of employee was created : too important for a mere desk but too junior for a window seat .
Facilities managers accommodated them in the cheapest way possible , with modular walls .
The sea of cubicles was born .
Virtual Office ( ca. 1994 ) Ad agency TBWA \Chiat \Day 's LA headquarters was a Frank Gehry masterpiece .
But the interior , dreamed up by the company 's CEO , was a fiasco .
The virtual office had no personal desks ; you grabbed a laptop in the morning and scrambled to claim a seat .
Productivity nose - dived , and the firm quickly became a laughingstock .
5 Networking ( present ) During the past decade , furniture designers have tried to part the sea of cubicles and encourage sociability — without going nuts .
Knoll , for example , created systems with movable , semi-enclosed pods and connected desks whose shape separates work areas in lieu of dividers .
Most recently , Vitra unveiled furniture in which privacy is suggested if not realized .
Its large tables have low dividers that cordon off personal space but wo n't guard personal calls .

A referee ordered a penalty to be retaken in a Sunday league football game when an opposition player broke wind as the ball was kicked .
The Chorlton Villa player got a yellow card for the noise which was classed as " unsporting behaviour " .
The team , who conceded a goal on the second take , went on to win the match 6 - 4 against International Manchester FC at Turn Moss in Stretford , Manchester .
Villa manager Ian Treadwell said their conduct was " normally exemplary " .
We are not a dirty team and we like to play football
Chorlton Villa manager Ian Treadwell
" One of our players ' broke wind ' and only the referee heard it and he booked the player , " he said .
" The other player had the penalty saved because it was a bad penalty ; it was nothing to do with any noise .
They were as shocked as we were as to why . "
Mr Treadwell said he was waiting for the Football Association to contact them after it had received a report .
The Manchester Publicity league club faces total fines of £ 97 for three dismissals and two yellow card bookings from the game .
' Just hilarious '
Mr Treadwell said : " We are not a dirty team and we like to play football .
" While I wo n't condone the actions of the players , it is an emotive game and some of the players were sent off for entering into conversation with the referee .
" This has come at a bad time in the season as we do n't have sponsor and we are looking for a new sponsor for next season . "
Pauline Riley , secretary and treasurer of International Manchester FC , said both teams were " very friendly " .
" There 's no animosity .
It was just hilarious , " she said .

There is nothing more annoying than having your head used as a napkin by your elders
There is nothing more annoying than having your head used as a napkin by your elders .
Ogilvy Johannesburg tapped into the idiosyncrasy of this local tradition to devise a quirky ad to promote KFC ’s Streetwise 2 meal .
The hand - on - head wiping is a ritual meant to bode well for lots of cows and therefore wealth for the young boy on the receiving end .
The boy in the ad decides he ’s had enough of the head - wiping business and comes up with the idea of buying KFC ’s Streetwise 2 special for himself and his uncle .
Instead of wiping his hands on the boy ’s head , the uncle instead licks his fingers , because KFC is just so “ finger - licking good . ”

A botnet is a hugely parallel supercomputer .
If they so desired , botnet operators could use this processing power to , say , simulate exquisite climate models , or defeat Deep Blue ( which defeated Gary Kasparov ) in chess .
But the botnet ’s most valuable attribute is its distributed bandwidth .
This is how to send a billion emails in a day or coordinate a denial of service attack to take down a website — “ the digital equivalent of filling a fishtank with a firehose ” .
Take the Storm botnet as an example .
Some say it controls over a million computers .
Some security experts suspect that Storm is run by the Russian Business Network , a group of renegade Russian ( surprise ! ) computer scientists also blamed for the denial of service attacks that crashed Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili ’s website along with the National Bank of Georgia just before the 2008 South Ossetia War .
Storm is also responsible for a considerable fraction of the world ’s email spam .
How much money is in spam ?
IBM Security Systems expert Joshua Corman is widely quoted as claiming that spam sent by Storm is generating “ millions and millions of dollars every day ” .
And , does Storm send its own spam or does it rent its bandwidth to specialized spammers — a disconcerting possibility , suggesting a maturing underground economy .
A team of researchers in Berkeley and San Diego set out to investigate .
First they figured out how Storm works .
It ’s complicated but here ’s the gist : infected computers are classified as either workers or proxies based in part on whether they have a firewall installed .
Workers do the actual spamming , receiving instructions from proxies that coordinate the jobs .
Proxies take orders from a master server .
The researchers set up eight proxies , simply by installing the software ( the did n’t have to go looking ; it was in their email ) .
This way , workers contacted them , requesting tasks .
But just as the instructions were shipping out , they modified the text of the spam messages , replacing the link with their own — a mock pharmaceutical website complete with Viagra , “ Viagra professional ” , a shopping cart , etc. ( though they never collected any money or personal information about their customers ) .
In this way , they tracked half a billion spam messages — a Viagra campaign and a botnet expansion campaign with fake greeting cards ( complete with dancing banana ) — over 26 days .
Here is the big result : 350 million emails resulted in 28 purchases .
Average purchase size was $ 100 .
Estimating they tracked 1.5 % of the full network and assuming continuous active spamming , this gives about $ 3.5 million in Viagra - inspired revenue per year .
Much less than millions in a day , but not too shabby either .
Is this good or bad ?
Well , it ’s annoying .
If nobody ever bought anything as a result of email spam , it would stop .
And 28 in 350 million — 1 in 12.5 million — is awfully close to nobody .
It ’s good in the sense that at $ 3.5 million per year , it ’s unlikely that Storm is running an affiliate program — renting their services to third party spammers — since profit margins are so slim .
The bad news is two - fold .
First , the greeting card expansion campaign was considerably more successful .
One in ten people that visited the greeting card page downloaded and installed the software ( no purchase necessary ) .
If people are gullible enough to install Storm themselves , it ’s very hard to imagine how to slow down the botnets .
Second , so much mystery remains .
Perhaps this particular spam campaign was just a side - project , an experiment much less fruitful than the botnet ’s ordinary activities .
Further analysis shows national differences .
While the U.S. received over 10 times more spam than Japan ( the 2nd most spammed country ) , it is the least efficient of targets : the U.S. response rate was lowest , while India , Pakistan , and Bulgaria showed the highest response rates .
The researchers believe these differences are due more to spam - filtering technology and anti-spam awareness than to varied interest in Viagra .
Ok .
A few statistics to close out this installment .
Spam doubled in 2007 to 120 billion messages sent daily .
The rate seems to have doubled again in 2008 .
Microsoft recently estimated that over 97 % of all email sent is spam , and that nearly 1 % of all computers are infected by some botnet .
Bill Gates , it is said , receives around 10000 spam emails every day .
GHC allows let / where bindings for unlifted values , but they are necessarily strict .
That does lead to confusing behaviour .
For example , 'f ' and ' g ' behave differently here :
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-} import GHC .
Base import GHC .
Exts main :: IO ( ) main = do print ( I# ( f 5 # 0 # ) ) print ( I# ( g 4 # 0 # ) ) f :: Int# -> Int# ->
Int# f x y | False = x `divInt#` y f x y = x g :: Int# -> Int# ->
Int# g x y | False = z where z = x `divInt #` y g x y = x
Suggestion : require that an unlifted let / where binding has a bang on it .
That would make lifted and unlifted bindings behave uniformly .

Joe Satriani v. Christopher Martin et al. ( Coldplay ) is back in the news now that laywers for Coldplay and Capitol Records have filed their responses to Satriani ’s copyright infringement claim .
They list nine defenses , including the tack that Satriani ’s song “ lacks originality and is thus not protectable by copyright ” .
This was the argument of our previous post on the case , where we provided several songs , spanning decades , which share the same melodic structure as the tunes under litigation .
Still there were those partisans who were unconvinced and claimed that if we would only transcribe the two melodies — the chorus of “ If I Could Fly ” and the opening verse of “ Viva la Vida ” — we ’d see that they are note - for - note identical and that Coldplay ’s collective goose is cooked .
So for those interested parties who can read music , click the image above for the two transcribed melodies in approximate alignment .
It should be noted that Satriani ’s excerpt was originally in B - minor and has been transposed to F - minor to match the key of “ Viva ” .
Other analyses have pounced on the similarities of the phrases ’ starts and the fact that there are some note sequences that are the same or even reverses of one another .
But I think there is one rather large difference between these two melodies that overshadows those parallels : Satriani ’s phrase is nearly a measure longer than Coldplay ’s .
The red arrows in the image above indicate where the first phrase resolves in each case .
“ Viva ” has already moved on to pickup notes into the next phrase while Satriani is still finding his way to F , home plate in this key .
Let your ears confirm it for you .
With all production stripped , you can clearly hear how the phrases begin the same but diverge in the third bar with Satriani ’s melody ( stereo right ) lagging behind Coldplay ’s ( stereo left ) :

If Satriani ’s case truly hangs on that initial three - note sequence — long , short , long ; five , six , four — I imagine it will be difficult to argue that one of his predecessors is not more deserving of that copyright :

Media were allowed to film the empty , ruined streets of Mullaitivu A major humanitarian crisis is unfolding in northern Sri Lanka , with a quarter of a million people trapped by fighting , the Red Cross says .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) estimates that hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between troops and separatist rebels .
It called on both sides to allow immediate and free access to the combat zone for humanitarian workers .
The military say they are involved in a final push against retreating rebels .
See map of the region
Moving north from the captured rebel town of Mullaitivu , they are trying to secure the north - east coastline to encircle the rebels and say they hope to control the entire north within weeks .
The Tamil Tiger rebels could not be reached immediately for comment .
Access to the combat zone is tightly controlled , making it difficult to verify the actual situation .
' Fundamentally trapped ' Speaking in Geneva , the ICRC 's head of operations for South Asia , Jacques de Maio , said the civilian population was paying the price for the conflict .
INSURGENCY TIMELINE 1976 : Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam form in the north - east 1987 : India deploys peace - keepers to Tamil areas but they leave in 1990 2002 : Government and rebels agree ceasefire 2006 : Heavy fighting resumes 2009 : Army takes main rebel bases of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu
Voices from Sri Lanka Tamil diaspora voices Winning war and peace " We talk about approximately a quarter of a million persons who are fundamentally trapped in a very small restricted perimeter - 250 sq km [ 96 sq m ] - which is the theatre of very intense combat , " he said .
" They find themselves simply under fire and highly vulnerable .
Access to medical care is almost non-existent at this point .
They are in need of food , they are in need of shelter and most of all they are in need of security . "
The ICRC based its figure of hundreds dead on body counts by its staff in local hospitals .
Access for aid workers was so limited , it said , that the ICRC 's own presence in the region was virtually meaningless .
The ICRC wanted to evacuate 200 critically wounded people on Tuesday but did not receive security clearance .
Those patients , it says , now face death .
The UN secretary general and the European Union have also expressed deep concern for civilians caught in the fighting .
Ghost town
The military did take a group of journalists , including the BBC's Chris Morris , to the region on Tuesday .
Brig Nandana Udawatte , who led the capture of Mullaitivu , said that " mortar fire , indirect fire and close - quarter battles " were going on 1.5 km from the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu .
Pro-rebel sources have previously accused the army of killing hundreds of civilians with shellfire - allegations the military denies .
Our correspondent says that apart from soldiers on every corner in Mullaitivu , it is a ghost town .
Most of the buildings , houses and shops are damaged or destroyed .
He says its capture is a big victory for the army but that the Tigers also appear on the surface undaunted , with the sound of artillery fire not that far away echoing down the empty streets .

NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - A world manufacturing slump eased in January but the data showed the global economic downturn , which Beijing said had already cost as many as 20 million jobs , was still in full swing .
The biggest improvement was in the Institute for Supply Management ’s index of U.S. factories , which climbed to a still - anemic 35.6 in January from 32.6 in December .
European and Chinese surveys also edged higher .
Yet the outlook for U.S. consumer spending , which accounts for two - thirds of the world ’s largest economy , remained bleak .
Spending rose just 3.6 percent in 2008 as a whole , the smallest increase since 1961 .
Against that backdrop , analysts said it was difficult to envision any near - term rebound in global growth .
“ With incomes falling and confidence shattered , we have to expect spending to keep falling for some months yet , ” said Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla , New York .
With that in mind , U.S. President Barack Obama called Democratic congressional leaders to a meeting on Monday to drive home his message of urgency in passing an $ 800 billion economic stimulus package .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was also urging that strong and effective stimulus plans be enacted to boost economies hit by the global financial crisis .
INKLING OF STABILIZATION
Like the ISM survey of U.S. factories , surveys of manufacturing firms in Europe and China suggested at the very least that things were not getting worse as quickly as in previous months .

In Europe , a survey of about 3,000 manufacturers showed only Germany among the euro currency zone ’s leading four economies registered a deepening contraction in January .
France , Italy , and Spain all saw some slowing in the pace of decline .
The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing purchasing managers ’ index for January rose to 34.4 from 33.9 in December , the eighth month in a row the index was below 50.0 , which separates growth from contraction .
A similar purchasing managers ’ index on China , produced for brokerage CLSA , rose to 42.2 in January from 41.2 in December , indicating conditions were deteriorating but at a slower pace .
China Premier Wen Jiabao also pointed to signs of recovery .
“ During the last 10 days of December it started to get better , ” Wen told a business audience in London .
“ The goods piled up in port started to decrease and the price of industrial products started to rise . ”
But data from the United States showed consumers cut spending for a sixth straight month in December and their incomes shrank .
The index of leading European shares dropped 2.11 percent , while the Dow Jones industrial average was off 1 percent , having suffered its worst - ever January .

JOBLESS BY THE MILLIONS
Chen Xiwen , director of China ’s Office of the Central Rural Work Leading Group , said a recent survey showed 15.3 percent of the 130 million migrants moving from villages to cities and factories had returned jobless to the countryside .
That , combined with this year ’s 6 to 7 million new entrants in the rural labor market , would leave China with about 25 million jobless and potentially restive rural unemployed this year , Chen said .
South Korea reported its biggest - ever plunge in exports and a slide in the value of the rouble highlighted the dramatic change of fortunes for oil - rich Russia , where thousands took to the streets at the weekend over deteriorating conditions .
The Russian protests follow protests across several European countries in recent days and weeks , from Latvia and Bulgaria in the east to France , where upward of a million marched on Friday .
In South Korea , home to some of Asia ’s top manufacturers and exporters , a 32.8 percent year - on - yearn drop in exports in January raised the specter of the first recession in more than a decade .
“ The fall was really shocking , ” said Jun Min-Kyoo , economist at Korea Investment & Securities .
India also showed more signs of the impact of the global crisis .
Manufacturing activity contracted for the second month in a row in December , when exports also fell from a year earlier for the third straight month .
The global downturn started with a U.S. housing market slump that sparked a crisis in debt - derivatives markets and wiped out nearly $ 14 trillion in global stock market value last year as banks got into difficulty , requiring government bailouts .
The financial crisis has in turn triggered recession in all of the big industrialized economies , sharp slowdowns elsewhere and put millions of jobs on the line .
( CNN ) --
The mysterious deaths of 21 prized polo horses Sunday at a club in Florida provides a peek inside the private world of a sport that generally is off limits to all but the very wealthy .
The Lechuza Caracas polo team may not recover from the loss of 21 ponies for years , a polo executive says .
The University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville and the state - run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando are conducting necropsies on the animals .
Initial tests failed to reveal a cause , said Liz Compton , a representative of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services .
Tissues , organ samples and blood are now being screened for toxic agents , she said .
Scientists have ruled out any contagious disease because the animals died so quickly , said state Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Fagan .
Authorities initially requested necropsies for only the eight horses that were insured , according to Sarah Carey , a representative of the veterinary school , which got the bodies of 15 horses .
Later , the order was expanded to all 15 horses , she said .
The U.S. Polo Association is among the parties cooperating in the investigation .
" In the meantime , we all mourn the loss of these horses , " U.S. Polo Association Executive Director Peter Rizzo said in a news release .
" There are no words to describe the grief and sadness shared by everyone -- particularly the devastated owners of those magnificent horses . "
Watch what investigators are studying »
Players form strong emotional bonds with the horses they ride , said John Wash , operations president of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington , Florida , where the horses fell ill .
" I 've heard a couple of polo players who were affected with this loss the other day , a couple of them I do n't think have left their house since Sunday night , " Wash said .
" There were a lot of tears there -- these big , tough guys just on their hands and knees , crying over what happened . "
The U.S. Open Polo Championship that was interrupted by the tragedy will resume Wednesday with semifinal matches , Wash said .
Lechuza Caracas , the team whose horses died , was offered spare mounts from other competitors so they could remain in the competition , but the devastated team chose to withdraw , Wash said .
The Wellington tournament is one of the sport's three major championships , on a par with the U.S. Open in tennis or golf .
Authorities say they believe that the competition facility is safe for the other horses and that whatever killed the 21 horses entered their bodies away from the site .
Fifteen of the animals fell ill shortly before they were to compete Sunday ; some died immediately and others lingered for almost an hour .
Six others died overnight Sunday to Monday as they were kept in the same trailer in Wellington .
Animals are not kept overnight at the competition site , so no special precautions are in place regarding food , water or bedding , Wash said .
Organizers are planning a short memorial and laying of wreaths in honor of the horses , he said .
Grief counselors are on hand at the facility to help employees deal with the trauma , Wash said .
" The scene can be described as almost like an airplane crash that involved not human life , but horses , " he said .
" It was horrific . "
Polo ponies in the United States are not drug - tested , but the U.S. Polo Association has been considering taking up the practice for several years , Wash said .
" People are calling for reform , and maybe that needs to happen , but until toxicology reports come back , and autopsy reports , we do n't even know if [ Sunday 's incident is ] anything related to that . "
The Humane Society of the United States has no record of abuse of polo ponies , but that may be a function of the sport 's exclusive nature , society spokeswoman Holly Hazard said .
" We are learning about this , as is everyone else , " she said .
" It may be that perhaps because it 's not televised or not as popular as other sports , it 's not something that either our constituents or our program is particularly focused on .
" But if there are either performance - enhancing drugs or some problem that is associated with this , we will investigate and we will offer a reward to bring whoever is responsible to justice . "
Keith Dane , director of the Humane Society 's equine protection program , was en route to Florida on Tuesday to interview people involved in the incident and keep an eye on the investigation , Hazard said .
No evidence has been brought forth suggesting someone deliberately poisoned the animals .
" I guess everything 's possible , " Wash said .
" I 've heard all different rumors .
I do n't know if I even want to go there and think about that . "
Compton , the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services representative , said authorities have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the case .
" Clearly , law enforcement has gotten involved , given the complexity and the scope of the deaths , and they are fact - finding and gathering information , and once we have a specific cause of death , then they can determine where their investigation will go , " she said .
The devastated team , Lechuza Caracas , is one of the top teams in the world .
The loss could set it back for years , Wash said .
" It 's just like baseball or basketball or football , " he said .
" You 're taking years of grooming , training , nurturing to create , really , a first string of horses .
And for four polo players , it takes anywhere from six to eight horses per polo player to play a game of polo .
So if you 're taking 21 horses , they 're probably 21 of your first - string horses ... and you 've just lost every one of your best players .
" It 's not like you could just go out and buy 21 new horses and start at that point . "
Polo ponies are thoroughbreds , many of them former racehorses retrained for the game , but they cover a wide range of ages , Wash said .
When they get too old to play , they are retired to pasture or stud , he said .
" A polo horse is treated quite well , " Wash said .
" In fact , when you 're a polo horse , you might play three months here in Palm Beach , you might take three months off , you might play another three months , say , in Argentina or England , you take three months off .
They 're not pushed 12 months out of the year . "

It 's getting difficult to overstate the importance of battery technology .
Compact , high - capacity batteries are an essential part of portable electronics already , but improved batteries are likely to play a key role in the auto industry , and may eventually appear throughout the electric grid , smoothing over interruptions in renewable power sources .
Unfortunately , battery technology often involves a series of tradeoffs among factors like capacity , charging time , and usable cycles .
Today 's issue of Nature reports on a new version of lithium battery technology that may just be a game - changer .
The new work involves well - understood technology , relying on lithium ions as charge carriers within the battery .
But the lithium resides in a material that was designed specifically to allow it to move through the battery quickly , which means charges can be shifted in and out of storage much more rapidly than in traditional formulations of lithium batteries .
The net result is a battery that , given the proper electrodes , can perform a complete discharge in under 10 seconds — the sort of performance previously confined to the realm of supercapacitors .
This appears to be one of those cases where applications badly lagged theory .
Since lithium ions are the primary charge carriers in most batteries , the rates of charging and discharging the batteries wind up proportional to the speed at which lithium ions can move within the battery material .
Real - world battery experience would suggest that lithium moves fairly slowly through most types of batteries , but theoretical calculations suggested that there was no real reason that should be the case — lithium should be able to move quite briskly .
A number of recent papers suggested that , in at least one lithium battery class ( based on LiFePO 4 ) , the problem was n't the speed at which lithium moved — instead , it could only enter and exit crystals of this salt at specific locations .
This , in turn , indicated that figuring a way to speed up this process would increase the overall performance of the battery .
To accomplish this , the authors developed a process that created a disorganized lithium phosphate coating on the surfaces of LiFePO 4 crystals .
By tweaking the ratio of iron to phosphorous in the starting mix and heating the material to 600 �C under argon for ten hours , the authors created a material that has a glass - like coating that 's less than 5 nm thick , which covers the surface of pellets that are approximately 50nm across .
That outer coating has very high lithium mobility , which allows charge to rapidly move into and out of storage in the LiFePO 4 of the core of these pellets .
In short , because lithium can move quickly through this outer coating , it can rapidly locate and enter the appropriate space on the LiFePO 4 crystals .
The results are pretty astonishing .
At low discharge rates , a cell prepared from this material discharges completely to its theoretical limit ( ~166 mAh / g ) .
As the authors put it , " Capacity retention of the material is superior . "
Running it through 50 charge / discharge cycles revealed no significant change in the total capacity of the battery .
But the truly surprising features of the cell came when the authors tweaked the cathode to allow higher currents to be run into the cell .
Increasing the rate by a factor of 100 dropped the total capacity down to about 110 mAh/g , but increased the power rate by two orders of magnitude ( that 's a hundred - fold increase ) compared to traditional lithium batteries .
Amazingly , under these conditions , the charge capacity of the battery actually increased as it underwent more charge / discharge cycles .
Doubling the charge transport from there cut the capacity in half , but again doubled the power rate .
At this top rate , the entire battery would discharge in as little as nine seconds .
That sort of performance had previously only been achieved using supercapacitors .
At this point , the authors calculate , the primary limiting factor is no longer storing lithium in the battery ; instead , getting the lithium in contact with an electrode is what slows things down .
The electrodes also become a problem because they need to occupy more of the volume of the battery in order to maintain this rate of charge , which lowers the charge density .
That 's a major contributor to the halving of the battery 's capacity mentioned in the previous paragraph .
A more significant problem is that these batteries may wind up facing an electric grid that was never meant to deal with them .
A 1Wh cell phone battery could charge in 10 seconds , but would pull a hefty 360W in the process .
A battery that 's sufficient to run an electric vehicle could be fully charged in five minutes — which would make electric vehicles incredibly practical — but doing so would pull 180 kW , which is most certainly not practical .

Scott Cooney of Red , Green , and Blue recently wrote a thought provoking post about the need for population control as a fundamental and necessary tool to deal with a wide range of environmental crises .
He refers to population control as the elephant in the room when it comes to policymakers .
This is certainly an apt description of the issue , and it may even be considered an understatement .
I would go so far as to say that population control is regarded as political suicide and a topic that is seemingly avoided at all costs .
Even though the rapid growth of the human population is such an obvious concern , very few people outside of the academic world and some dedicated NGOs are willing to discuss the issue .
The earth ’s population is projected to rise an astonishing 40 % to 9.2 billion people by 2050 !
This level of increase will put tremendous strain on a wide range of already - stressed resources , including food stocks , fresh water , precious metals , and of course fossil fuels .
So why are policymakers so reluctant to approach this issue ?
The problem is that population growth is seen to be inextricably tied to economic growth .
Does anyone know of a politician or governing party in a major industrialized nation that has tried to implement population control policies specifically because of the impact on the earth ?
Population growth represents prosperity and desirability , while population losses conjure up visions of boarded up buildings on Main Street and Rust Belt decline .
Surprisingly it is not just the politicians that are avoiding this can of worms .
Even the activists stay away from it .
David Suzuki , one of the most beloved and revered environmental spokesmen in Canada , is refusing to address the issue in an official capacity .
A good friend of mine met Dr. Suzuki at a book signing a few years ago just before he was traveling to China to meet his new adopted daughter .
My friend wanted Suzuki to sign the book to his new daughter and mentioned the upcoming adoption during the signing .
Instead of congratulations , what he received from Suzuki was an insensitive ( although arguably valid ) diatribe about the irresponsibility of bringing a child from a low - consumer country ( China ) to a high - consumer country ( Canada ) .
Obviously Suzuki recognizes that population is a critical issue , but when reporter Hans Tammemagi asked the David Suzuki Foundation why they do n’t include the population issue in their programs he was told “ We only deal with Canada , and it has a small population ” .
Even though slowed or negative population growth makes sense from a resource and environmental perspective , we need to be realists about how we approach the issue .
If population control goes too far there will not be enough working - age people to support the social safety nets and tax base that is required to maintain a functional and productive society .
This has been a problem in certain European countries that are experiencing negative growth rates , aging populations , and inverse population pyramids .
It is obvious that there are a lot of questions to be asked about population control .
What is the optimal population level to ensure that society can continue to provide fundamental services to its citizens but will not exhaust the finite resources of the earth ?
Where do developing nations fit into the issue of population control ?
Much of this post has discussed the issue from the perspective of industrialized nations .
Devleoping countries have much higher rates of population growth but they also have lower per-capita resource consumption rates and higher infant mortality rates .
One thing is for certain – it is frustrating to try to find the answers to these questions when nobody seems to want to talk about the problem .

KUALA LAMPUR , Malaysia ( CNN ) -- Malaysia will swear in a new prime minister Friday -- one tasked with reuniting a multi-racial nation and shoring up an economy in dire straits .
Outgoing Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi , facing , hugs his successor , Najib Razak last week .
Until now , Najib Razak had served as the Southeast Asian country 's deputy prime minister .
He succeeds Abdullah Badawi who turned in his resignation after five years as leader .
Both are part of Malaysia 's ruling party , the National Front Coalition , which has ruled the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1957 .
But last year , a loose coalition of opposition parties won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections .
It was only the second time in the country 's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two - thirds majority needed to amend the constitution .
The election upset led to calls for Abdullah to step down .
Various challenges await Najib :
In recent months , the country has seen riots with the country 's ethnic Chinese and Indian communities who accuse the government of passing laws that favor the Malay majority .

Meet the 10 most amazing high tech crimes– and the fate of the criminals that pulled them off .

WANK Worm Bugs NASA
When NASA laid out plans to launch the nuclear - powered , unmanned Galileo spacecraft on a mission to Jupiter , protesters feared that the radioactive vibes could harm the Earth .
But instead of merely grumbling about it , a group dubbed “ Worms Against Nuclear Killers ” hacked into NASAs systems and presented scientists with the image pictured above .
The hack also tricked employees into thinking their files were being deleted , and spit random messages promoting anarchy and decrying the government .
Cultural references in those messages suggest that the hackers came from Australia , but no one knows for sure .
$ 1.3 m Made in “ Easy ” Roulette Scam
In 2004 , a trio of cheating roulette players raked in £ 1.3 million from a British casino .
Reports suggest that they used mobile phones fitted with laser scanners , calculating the likely position of the ball based on the speed of the wheel .
That ’s pretty clever on its own , but one physicist told New Scientist that there ’s an easier way :
Use the phone as a stopwatch , click it once when the wheel starts spinning and again after a revolution , and use a formula to calculate the outcome .
Either way , the group was arrested , because you ca n’t win millions in a day at the casino without drawing some suspicion .
High - Tech Gadgets Aide Massive Poker Run
Aided by a camera up his sleeve , a tiny earpiece and a pair of accomplices , Yau Yiv Lam won $ 250,000 playing poker at six casinos .
One of the cohorts , in a remote location , played back the video in slow motion to see the cards before they hit the table .
Then , his person relayed the information to a veteran player that was in on the heist .
Alas , it was too successful ; casino staff called out the other player and caught the crooks red-handed .
One officer said cheating like this is otherwise “ extremely difficult ” to prove .
ATM Scam Yields $ 9 M
This is n’t your typical scan job , in which a single ATM is fitted with a camera for identity theft .
This is a hack involving RBS WorldPay , which serves workers around the world with a direct - to - debit payroll system .
Last November , someone hacked it , stole the information need to make clone ATM cards and lifted the withdrawl limits on those accounts .
In a matter of hours , dozens of henchmen hit over 130 ATMs around the world , pulling out cash over and over again until $ 9 million was stolen .
Police had no suspects as of early February .
Spy Gear Used to Cheat on Immigration Test
The “ Life in the UK ” test — the last step on the path to British citizenship — can be a daunting task , particularly if you do n’t speak English .
Last year , police caught two men making it easier by transmitting the answer over an earpiece .
The test takers inside paid the men for their services and used a buttonhole camera to transmit the answers .
When police found the masterminds in a nearby a BMW filled with high - tech equipment , they originally thought an ATM card - skimming scam was at work .
Then , they realized the men could be part of a network that helps immigrants cheat on their tests .
The perps will spend eight months in jail , and the men inside taking the exam , they were sentenced to 180 hours of community service .
Crowdsourcing Crime on Craigslist
After taking control of an armored truck by subduing the driver with pepper spray last September , a perpetrator in Monroe , Wash . , needed to cover his tracks .
Fortunately , he thought ahead by hiring decoys on Craigslist .
The job ad offered $ 28.50 per hour for road maintenance work for anyone who could show up near the Bank of America wearing a yellow vest , safety goggles , a respirator mask and a blue shirt if possible .
Roughly a dozen guys showed up , sporting the very outfit the robber was wearing .
In a surprising switch to low - tech , the man then escaped down the river via innertube .
Police eventually caught up to him in November using DNA evidence .
Infrared Aides Jaguar Break -In
Ever worry that your car ’s remote lock system might not be foolproof ?
In 1999 , at least , there was good reason for concern .
Using an infrared transceiver , someone copied the keyless entry signal on a Jaguar in England and opened up the car to steal the Rolex watch inside .
One wireless security expert said the trick could be done with a £ 15 device , or made at home for about £ 2 .
Even Palm Pilots and other PDAs could be manipulated into break - in tools .
Improvements to the technology have since made this crime much more difficult , but with keyless systems expanding to include ignition , it ’s also more tempting .
Walkie - Talkies and Hot -Wiring in Tech Robbery
It ’s the sum of its parts that makes this tech - assisted 1997 heist impressive .
In order to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars in Lexmark printers , a band of criminals hotwired a tractor and used it to pull two huge in front of the yard where the goods were held .
This blocked a view from the road while two men ordered in a pair of rental trucks by walkie - talkie .
Another man kept lookout and monitored police band radio while the other guys loaded up the stash .
It was like butter , and just one of many burglaries that had high - tech companies concerned in the late 1990s .
Tunnel - Digging Operation Had All the Comforts of Home
In one of the largest bank burglaries of all - time , a gang of criminals dug an 80 - meter tunnel into Brazil ’s Banco Central from a nearby house .
This was n’t just a shovel job ; along the way , the burglars installed air conditioning and rudimentary lighting in the tunnel .
At the end of their trip , they had to drill through a meter of steel - enforced concrete .
They broke into the bank with no guns and no fuss , and stole 3.5 tons of money , valued at almost $ 70 million .
In the end , though , one of the suspected accomplices was kidnapped and murdered , and police arrested 13 others .
“ Mission Impossible Burglar ” Makes Like Tom Cruise
Though we do n’t know if Steven Jay Kreuger had to avoid any floor - activated security systems , he certainly had a penchant for Hollywood - style burglaries .
With the help of sophisticated cutting tools , ropes and a strong upper body , Kreuger broke into Laptop Solutions in Irvine , Calif. , from the roof , climbing down to pull out $ 300,000 worth of wireless modems .
This was after he used a grappling hook to get onto the roof .
Police nabbed Kreuger in 1998 , but a press release from 2006 suggests that he ’s out of jail and at it again .
His new thing , allegedly , is cutting through metal roll up doors and stealing computer memory and laptops from industrial complexes .

Footage showing alleged police brutality at a memorial event for Ian Tomlinson led to the suspension last night of a second police officer .
Shot the day after the main 1 April demonstrations , it shows an incident during which frontline police were attempting to contain protesters who had gathered at the Bank of England for the vigil .
The 47 - year - old newspaper vendor had collapsed and died nearby the previous night , and demonstrators had come dressed in black to lay flowers and demand answers about his death .
At the time protesters were not aware of footage showing Tomlinson being attacked from behind by an officer before he collapsed .
The film begins showing hundreds of protesters gathered opposite the Royal Exchange .
They are surrounded by lines of police who appeared to have formed a cordon , or " kettle " , to contain them .
A man holding a newspaper attempts to leave the police cordon .
He is seen remonstrating with police , who refuse to let him out .
The crowd reacts angrily when minor scuffles break out between the man and police .
It is at this point that a short woman standing outside the cordon reacts angrily toward police .
Her identity is not known .
Photographs taken at precisely the same time show her clutching a digital camera and carton of orange juice .
Swearing , she directs her anger at one particular officer .
The officer , who has concealed his badge numbers , appears to shove her back , saying : " Move back . "
She replies : " [ I 'm a ] fucking woman . "
The officer then appears to slap her across the face with the back of his hand , saying : " Go away . "
The footage captures what appears to be an angry reaction from protesters who witnessed the strike .
The same officer then removes an extendable baton from his left pocket and strikes the woman on her legs .
The footage is not clear , but the woman appears to fall to the ground .
The crowd again erupts angrily with chants of " shame on you " .
The footage was shot by Tristan Woodwards , a 25 - year - old administrator from Basingstoke , placed on YouTube and subsequently handed to the Guardian .
Woodwards said last night he felt the officer had " abused his power " .
" If someone was chucking a bottle or hitting a police officer I could have understood their behaviour , " he said .
" She [ the woman ] was n't doing anything out of order .
He 's pretty tall and pretty big .
Hitting a small woman is n't the most acceptable thing he could do . "
The film is one of a number showing alleged police brutalities obtained by the Guardian since the footage showing Tomlinson being attacked by an officer .
Referring to the latest footage , a spokeswoman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission said : " The IPCC has been made aware that the Metropolitan police service will be referring an incident to us following footage which has come to light this afternoon .
As soon as we get the referral , we will look into it and decide the best way to progress an investigation into the actions of the officer involved . "
A climate change activist threw a cup of green " slime " over Business Secretary Lord Mandelson today as he arrived at the launch of the Government 's low carbon economy summit .
Leila Deen from campaign group Plane Stupid said she was protesting at reports that Lord Mandelson met lobbyists from Heathrow owner BAA before the Government gave the controversial go - ahead for a third runway at the London airport .

The incident happened a few seconds after Lord Mandelson got out of his ministerial car to attend the summit in central London .
Ms Deen , 29 , threw a cup full of what she described as " green slime " over the minister , who tried to duck when he realised what was happening .
Ms Deen , who calmly walked away after the incident , said : " The only thing green about Peter Mandelson is the slime coursing through his veins . "
Lord Mandelson dismissed the incident , which raises questions about his personal security , as an " adolescent protest " .
He told Sky News : " She was so busy throwing what seemed like green soup or something in my face that she failed to tell me what the protest was about but , as you can see , thankfully it was n't paint and I 've come through it intact . "
Ms Deen questioned the Business Secretary 's attendance at the summit .
" That Mandelson is trying to make political capital out of climate change just days after reports that he met with BAA 's top lobbyists to push through the third runway is an insult to my generation , " she said .
Ms Deen accused Lord Mandelson of only representing business interests , adding that he was an unelected Government representative .

Lord Mandelson quickly walked into the building where the summit is being held after the incident and emerged a few minutes later , minus his coat .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown was also due to attend the summit along with other Government representatives and business leaders to discuss the " greening " of industry and opportunities for new jobs .
Plane Stupid has launched a series of high profile stunts in recent years against the Government 's environmental policies .
Ms Deen was one of three Plane Stupid protesters who sounded horns during a speech at an environmental conference in London by Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon earlier this week .
She and the other demonstrators left after being warned they would be thrown out if they interrupted the speech again .
At one point they sounded horns when Mr Hoon reached the part of his speech when he said that proper debate rather than " stupid stunts " was the way to address the aviation - and - the - environment issue .
Ms Deen added later : " We know that Mandelson is best buddies with BAA 's top lobbyist Roland Rudd , and reports suggest it was him who bullied [ Energy Secretary ]
Ed Miliband into accepting a third runway .
We ca n't let the Prince of Darkness cast his shadow over west London . "
A Scotland Yard spokesman said no arrests had been made and an investigation would only be launched if a complaint was received .
Ms Deen told the Press Association later that the substance she threw at the minister was custard , which had green colouring added to it .
" Peter Mandelson is trying to say he does n't know what it was about , but as I threw it I said ' This is for the third runway ' .
" He knows he is in bed with business , working against the interests of the climate and the people of this country .
" He was trying to make political capital out of this summit but we are just not prepared to let him get away with it . "
I ’ve written before about my strong desire to seek official excommunication from the Catholic church .
The Pope ’s pronouncement yesterday , that condoms are the cause of HIV AIDS , was the straw that broke the camel ’s back .
After watching an interview on Channel 4 television yesterday , in which a spokesperson for a Catholic relief charity screamed her way from one factual falsehood to another — literally condoning the teaching of lies to those most in need of the facts , I leapt to my feet and knocked on the door of my local parish priest .
Perhaps it was better for both of us that he was otherwise engaged .
I doubt he wanted to hear about how his employers disdain for contraception , contradicts their financial investment in the companies who make them — much less did I want to hear yet more apologetics , on the moral imperative of prayer , while protecting pedophile priests is a “ media exaggeration ” .
Dr John Hunt , a nurse , is one of a growing number of people around the world who want their former involvement with faith groups to be struck from official records .
[ MORE ]
Having given myself a good night ’s sleep to calm down and thanks to magic of twitter , I now read the heart warming news that I am not alone , in my desire to have my name officially removed from the record as being baptised Catholic .
Roman Catholic canon law allows a process known as a “ formal act of defection ” from the faith .
This means that a note will be made on a person ’s baptismal record stating that they have left the church .
Stay tuned here and follow me on twitter , for updates on how my campaign goes , in seeking official conformation I am no longer a Catholic , from the diocese of Hexham and Newcastle .
As Twitter grows up , one of the best examples of its becoming mainstream is how widely and quickly real - life celebrities have latched onto the service , pushing Twitter 's early heroes -- Internet - famous - types and tech journalists -- aside .
Consider the differences in the most popular Twitter users today and just 15 months ago .
This time last January , Twitter 's two most famous human users were Robert Scoble , a tech blogger best known for his years at Microsoft ; and iJustine , a cute girl in her mid-20s famous for strapping a Web cam to her head and fawning over Apple gadgets .
According to a Web cache of Twitterholic , a Twitter user - tracking service , Scoble had 6,900 followers on Jan. 18 , 2008 , and iJustine had 6,700 .
But fast - forward a little more than a year and Twitter 's top users have more than 150 times the number of followers and millions more dollars in the bank .
Actor and wannabe tech entrepreneur Ashton Kutcher got his 1 millionth follower today , having beaten an account owned by CNN for the milestone .
Wednesday , Kutcher blew past third - place Britney Spears and her 950,000 + followers .
The fact that a race to 1 million followers existed at all is nothing short of amazing for Twitter , a barely three - year - old messaging / microblogging service .
Today , Kutcher and Twitter CEO Evan Williams will appear on the Oprah Winfrey show , where Oprah will send her first tweet as @ Oprah .
As of Friday morning , she had 63,000 followers without sending a single toot .
Within weeks ,
Oprah could be one of Twitter 's top users .
Of course , Williams and Twitter 's other founders , Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey , had a lot to do with this .
It was n't until recently that Twitter added a new feature to the sign - up process , which recommended several Twitter feeds for new users to follow -- so they get the hang of the service .
This , coupled with Twitter 's rapid growth over the last three months , boosted those suggested accounts considerably .
Twitter includes many real - world celebrities on its list of suggestions , such as Phoenix Suns star Shaquille O'Neal , one of the earlier -- and one of the best -- celebrity Tweeters ; and some Internet - celeb - types , too , such as iJustine .
( And even our feed . )
Shaq now has 660,000 followers , up from 5,500 last November ; iJustine now has 435,000 .
" I 'm happy for Evan , Biz , and Jack ... they played it exactly right , " says Jason Calacanis , long - time Internet entrepreneur / celebrity - type and former Big Man On Twitter .
" They courted early adopters and now are courting the celebs to get the mainstream -- that 's perfect strategy . "
Last month , Calacanis publicly offered the company $ 250,000 for a two - year slot on the suggested list .
Twitter has n't accepted yet .
But that 's one of many easy ways that Twitter could generate significant revenue -- when it decides to .
Update :
This chart and story text previously incorrectly referred to the Jan. 18 , 2008 stats as Jan. 18 , 2009 stats .
This has been updated ; we apologize for the error .
It does not change the thesis .
Soon another semester will start .
And , like every semester , I received the list of assignments that are due , with their deadlines .
Up till now I used to type into Google Calendar each deadline and set SMS reminders , to make sure I wo n’t forget to hand the assignment , but this time I realized I ’ve had enough of this , and do n’t feel like entering 30 different tasks over and over again , set the sms reminders etc .
So I figured ‘ Google has an API for everything , why not automate it ? ’
So I opened their tutorial and started reading .
Just about all the information was there , other then information on setting a reminder ’s type ( pop up , sms , email etc ’ ) .
I ’ve read the python API code , and could n’t find a reference for this .
Googling for it I saw a few people mentioning it and saying the easiest solution is setting the default reminder type to SMS and then using the samples in the tutorial .
After looking a little harder I saw the JavaScript API let ’s one set this type ( in the API it ’s ‘ method ’ ) , so I ran a javascript test and sniffed it just to make sure it ’s a simple attribute .
After seeing that is the case I came to the conclusion that all that ’s needed to set the ‘ method ’ of a reminder is this :
reminder = gdata.calendar.Reminder(minutes=’40 ’)
reminder._attributes [‘ method ’] = ‘ method ’
reminder.method = ‘ sms ’
event.when[0].reminder.append(reminder )
Those two bold lines do the trick , where method can be ‘ all ’ , ‘ sms ’ , ’ email ’ and ‘ alert ’ ( meaning a pop-up ) .
Happy SMSing !
The dog was found with only soil and wood in its stomach A dog was tied to a barbed wire fence in Angus and left to starve to death for up to two weeks , animal welfare officers have revealed .
The dead female mastiff cross was discovered on the Kinnaird Park Estate on the outskirts of Brechin on Friday .
An examination of the animal 's stomach contents found only grains of soil and fragments of wood as she tried to eat anything within her limited reach .
Scottish SPCA staff described it as one of the worst cases of animal cruelty .
The dog was tightly tethered to the fence with blue twine and she was wearing a blue collar and black muzzle .
' Extreme fear '
The Scottish SPCA said it would have been a " slow and lingering death from starvation and dehydration . "
Senior Inspector Mark Lumgair added : " I can only describe the scene that met me as horrendous .
It 's one of the worst cases I 've ever had to deal with in all my time as an inspector .
" This poor dog has been made to suffer unimaginable cruelty over a prolonged period of time .
" She looks to have been there for at least a week , maybe two .
Those last days of her life must have been filled with extreme fear and pain .
" I can't begin to imagine how she was feeling and thinking in the days and hours that she spent there alone and suffering . "
The penalty for abandoning an animal is a fine of up to £ 5,000 and six months in prison .
The Scottish SPCA said it would also seek a lifetime ban on keeping animals for anyone found guilty of this crime .

The prevalence of autism has increased nearly 1000 % in the United States over the last 15 years .
Now , as many as 1 in 150 children may be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders .
We now include people who would have been previously diagnosed with mental retardation , as well as people who were merely labeled “ eccentric , ” on the autism spectrum .
Research into the causes , treatments , and cures of autism is extensive , and covers the entire scientific continuum .
Supporters , advocates , and opponents of autism rights , likewise , run the gamut from those who think autism needs to be cured , to those who think that autism is simply a different way of functioning and needs no treatment at all .
The neurodiversity movement is not new , though it is gaining in strength and numbers around the world .
Its supporters , often parents of autistic children as well as adults with autism , believe that autism is not an illness or disease , but merely an atypical way of functioning .
They contend that society must embrace this different way of thinking and functioning , just as we accept diversity in culture , religion , sexual orientation , and personality .
The supporters of the neurodiversity movement argue that people with autism are not incapable of learning certain skills or participating in social interactions .
These abilities must simply be learned and practiced in a different way .
Autism , these activists contend , is simply an alternative way of being .
According to recent research , people with autism who accept the neurodiversity platform have more self - esteem , and have more academic and career ambition that those who see autism as a medical condition with its array of disadvantages .
In one study , students with autism who held the latter view more often applied for special assistance and monetary allowance through disabled students programs .
Not surprisingly , most neurodiversity advocates with autism are high functioning , with little to no significant intellectual impairment .
There is fierce disagreement among autism rights activists , of which neurodiversity supporters are one - third of the argument .
Another set of activists insists that toxins , mostly vaccines , cause autism and these poisons and pollutants should be removed from the environment to cure autism .
There is a third group of activists who believe autism is a genetic characteristic and should be cured by concentrating on genome research .
Each group believes the other is either redefining autism or trivializing a serious disease , depending on which side of the debate they support .
However , the one thing they share is a desire for people with autism to have a happy and fulfilling life .
How they get there is another story .
Many neurodiversity supporters are against almost any treatment , and generally do not support many of the drug therapies used in children with autism .
While many parents are willing to try any medical treatment , even experimental ones , to treat their children with autism , some neurodiversity advocates do not even support behavioral therapies for autism .
The only neurodiverse option is to accept the autistic person for who they are , differences and all .
However , are these advocates willing to give up the protection of autism spectrum disorders under the United States Americans with Disabilities Act ?
They want children with autism to feel special and unique , but what if they need special education classes ?
How do they explain the vast differences between mild social impairment and severe disability that fall under a single “ autism ” label ?
Some neurodiversity proponents seem to want to have it both ways : autism as a disability when it suits them , and autism as a socially acceptable norm the rest of the time .
We , undoubtedly , live in a diverse society : diverse in thought , action , and principles .
We have made great strides to accept all types of people as a part of our collective standard .
But , where does the acceptance end ?
Where is the line between “ just a little bit different ” and a diagnosis of a medical illness ?
Autism research will continue , and the associated debate will rage on , but it is unlikely that any one cause or any one cure will be found for the extensive spectrum of autism disorders .

A plan to require registered sex offenders to notify police of their email addresses and social networking identities has been shelved while the government battles a human rights judgment in the High Court , according to the Home Office .
The measure was the centrepiece of a suite of announcements on child protection on and offline in early April last year , but no detailed proposals have since emerged .
At the time Jacqui Smith said failure by the more than 30,000 registered sex offenders to supply online identities or supplying false identities would attract up to a five year jail term .
" We need to patrol the internet to keep predators away from children in the same way as we patrol the real world , " she told the breakfast television show GMTV .
However , in December the High Court found that indefinitely retaining details on the Sex Offenders Register with no right to appeal was a breach of offenders ' human rights under European law .
A Home Office spokesman said officals had decided not to try to extend the reach of the sex offenders register online while government lawyers appeal that decision .
He said the case had " an impact " on notification requirements , but was not able to explain how .
Other planned changes to the register , such as a trial of " Sarah 's Law " allowing parents to demand details of sex offenders , have gone ahead .
The NSPCC , which supported plans to monitor internet use by sex offenders , said it had not heard of any developments .
" It 's hard to comment as we do n't know enough about where this email register idea has got to , " a spokesman said .
The policy was heavily criticised when it was announced by internet experts , who said the profusion of free email and social networking services and the simplicity of setting up new accounts would make it unworkable .
The Home Office said the government remains committed to collecting sex offender email addresses and social networking identities , which was first mooted by then - Home Secretary John Reid in February 2007 .
Last year it said the details of monitoring sex offenders ' online identities would be handled by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ( CEOP ) .
CEOP declined to comment on progress , saying policy announcements were a matter for the Home Office . ®
Andrea and Greg Killgore were already living on the streets in Las Vegas when they decided to relocate to Lancaster in early March .
They thought their job prospects would be better in California .
But the couple were unable to find work and feared they would soon end up back on the streets .
A few days later , they were on a bus headed to Denver , where a relative had agreed to take them in .
To their surprise , a local nonprofit group had agreed to pay for their one - way ticket out of town .
Since January , the Grace Resource Center has offered to cover transportation expenses for homeless people to return to their home states or wherever they have families or other means of support .
So far the group has spent about $ 2,500 to help more than a dozen people leave Lancaster through the Opportunity Bus Pass Program .

“ It ’s to help people get well and start over , ” said Steve Baker , the center ’s executive director .
Andrea Killgore , 31 , said she was grateful for the free bus voucher .
“ This is a step for us to get back on our feet , ” Killgore said .
Without it , she said , “ we ’d be on the streets , or stuck here until my next [ Social Security ] check . ”
Mayor R. Rex Parris is a strong advocate of the bus program , even contributing $ 10,000 of his own money .
He said he is upset by what he believes is an unspoken policy by Los Angeles agencies and others to use his city as a “ dumping ground ” for the homeless .

“ The more economically disadvantaged people they can ship to the Antelope Valley , or encourage to go there to live , then they do n’t have to pay for services for them , ” he said .
Homeless people who have chosen to relocate to Lancaster are putting a strain on local police and social services , Parris said .
The city ’s own needy should come first , he said .
“ We have an obligation to take care of our own homeless , ” he said .
There are an estimated 73,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County , including at least 2,000 in the Antelope Valley , on any given night , according to statistics from the United Way of Greater Los Angeles .
Anecdotal evidence suggests the number is rising because of the economic downturn , said Christine Marge , officer of the agency ’s Basic Needs program .

Jonathan Powell , a spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , disputed allegations that the city was encouraging its homeless to relocate to the Antelope Valley or anywhere else .
“ We ’re doing everything possible to get our homeless families the services and shelter they need to get back on their feet , ” he said .
Powell said Los Angeles ’ social service agencies view accusations of homeless dumping by other municipalities as “ urban legend , to deflect from their lack of achievement on this issue . ”
Some homeless advocates take issue with the philosophy behind homeless busing programs .

“ It makes the assumption that someone has some fabulous support system someplace far away , ” said Anat Rubin , director of public policy at Lamp Community , an advocacy group based in L.A. 's skid row , who acknowledged that she was not familiar with the specifics of Grace ’s program .
“ If someone is living on the street , the likelihood they have some great support system someplace else is slim . ”
So far , most beneficiaries of the free bus program in Lancaster have been local residents who chose to go elsewhere , according to the Grace Resource Center .
Several homeless people who learned about Parris ’ views when he visited the center in January said they were offended .
“ The way the mayor put it , ‘ homeless go home , ’ I did n’t like that .
That was kind of cold , ” said Grace Guijarro , 57 , of California City , who lives at the Lancaster Community Shelter .
“ Not all homeless are . . . robbers and killers . ”

“ I think it ’s very narrow - minded , ” said Isis Wickham , 26 , who is also homeless .
“ He ’s stereotyping all of us .
It ’s not like we want to be here . ”
In addition to hot meals and showers , the Grace Resource Center provides emergency groceries , clothing , counseling and other services to at least 8,000 needy residents each month , officials said .
Baker , the center ’s director and a pastor for more than three decades , said that he and the mayor have different motivations for the bus pass program .
But they agree on its goal : to reduce homelessness in Lancaster and help people get their lives back on track .
“ We ’re not in the business of shipping people out of here , ” Baker said .
“ We ’re in the ministry of compassion .
We know that God can turn people ’s lives around . ”

Baker said he talks to more than two dozen people each day who come to the shelter seeking advice or assistance .
“ When I see that they are sort of jogging in place . . .
I ask the question : ‘ Do you have a relative anywhere ? ’ ” he said .
If the answer is no , he inquires : “ If you could go anywhere in the country and start over , where would you go ? ”
As for the Killgores , the couple said they were happy for the helping hand and a chance to reconnect with family .
“ I ’m so excited , ” Angela Killgore said shortly before departing for Denver .
“ It ’s going to be a fresh start for us . ”

Everyone knows the stock market is a long - term game .
But investors are starting to wonder these days : Just how long is " long - term " ?
The market 's latest slump took the Dow Jones Industrial Average this week to its lowest level since 1997 .
But that 's only part of the story .
Thanks to inflation , investors have lost ground simply if they have n't gained it .
And ...
By Erica Thompson February 26 , 2009 -- Committee in Solidarity of the People of El Salvador ( CISPES ) --
Polls on the March 15 presidential vote show the election will likely open a new progressive chapter in El Salvador 's long , violent history of war and dictatorships with a victory by the left - wing FMLN , which is promising to build a people - centred government .
But the right is not taking its impending defeat lightly ; it has been orchestrating a massive fear campaign and has worked feverishly to secure corporate - driven development contracts before its rule is set to expire .
" An historical event is underway in El Salvador .
For the first time , a government especially dedicated to the popular sectors is possible .
The current government , subjected to the interests of small groups , has shown their inability to lead the country for the common good .
A new government is born precisely of the hope of citizens to break the pattern and install a government that will be at the service of the entire Salvadoran population . "
— Program of Government , FMLN .
In less than three weeks , millions will mobilise to vote for El Salvador ’s next president .
A victory for the candidate of the Farabundo Martí Front for National Liberation ( FMLN ) , Mauricio Funes , and his running mate Salvador Sanchez Cerén , seems imminent .
Despite a dirty campaign against the left , rampant fraud from the right and heavy police presence at the polls in legislative and municipal elections on January 18 , 2009 , voters catapulted the FMLN into position as the strongest political force in the country , setting the stage for another win in March .

The FMLN ’s path to national influence has been defended with roadblocks , organised with political caravans and public forums , door - to - door discussions , thousands of marches , inspiring speeches and political struggle within the government .
Its transition from peasant uprising to major political party has been made possible by unions , students and campesinos , vendors and families , teachers and nurses , mothers and migrants .
On the electoral front , Funes has maintained solid backing from El Salvador ’s broad - based social movement , and the party has found new key support from a sizable Salvadoran immigrant business community in the United States .
Also rallying to Funes ' side are rural communities and small and middle - sized business sectors in El Salvador that are outraged with the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) party ’s economic policies and systematic siphoning of public resources .
ARENA has tried to divide support for the FMLN by portraying a criminal image of the party and attributing its rising popularity to Funes , a journalist who critics call a “ political moderate who only serves for the photos ” .
But the FMLN ’s current popularity is not an isolated phenomenon and Mauricio Funes is n’t the anomaly the right would like us to believe .
It is true that Funes ’ candidacy has strengthened the FMLN ’s chances of winning .
His 20 years of investigative journalism and his popular morning news show , The Interview , which provided a forum for the public to challenge the government ’s actions and official reporting , has given millions of Salvadorans a long look at Funes and a wide - open view into his politics .
For this work he is widely respected .
It is also true that the FMLN ’s current popularity is very much in line with increasing electoral gains the party has made in past elections .
In 1994 , the first year it competed in elections , the FMLN earned 12 mayoral seats and 22 legislative deputies ; in the presidential elections of 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , the FMLN earned 32 % , 29 % and 37 % of the vote , respectively .
The 2006 mid-term elections marked a turning point for the party as it closed an enormous gap in voter turnout and won the election with 943,936 votes to ARENA ’s 854,166 .
By that time , the FMLN was governing over 40 % of the total population of El Salvador at the municipal level .
Today , the party has 96 mayoral offices – governing 60 % of the population – and the most deputies of any single party in the legislative National Assembly , holding 35 of 84 seats .
When asked in November 2008 by Nicaraguan newspaper
The Monocle why he was running for president , Funes replied , " There 's an historical opening for me to be president .
The problems here are so powerful that I can't continue working as a journalist .
Journalism has allowed me to know the realities of El Salvador – especially , the reality of poverty .
But journalism does n't allow me to change that reality . "
' The El Salvador we want '
Financial exclusion and major news media blackouts have all but dismissed the FMLN as a party , negating its popular support .
Right - wing ownership of mainstream media has made it practically impossible for the left to fully participate in the established political structure .
Since the signing of the peace accords in 1992 and the recognition of the FMLN as a political party , the party has consistently submitted policy recommendations to the National Assembly to little avail .
The FMLN 's long - standing political objectives can are reflected in its 2009 platform , which can be found in the 96 pages of the Programa de Gobierno ( Government Program ) .
The FMLN 's political project is outlined by 10 central principles of action to be implemented at the highest levels of government :
1. Overcome unemployment , the high cost of living , poverty , exclusion and inequality in the distribution of benefits and costs of development .
2 . Exceed the slow growth of the economy by accelerating and diversifying the country ’s production of resources .
3 . Overcome the insecurity of the population and state impunity .
Defeat delinquency and organised crime .
Overcome violence and the damage to norms of social coexistence .
4 . Overcome exclusion and inequality in the access to knowledge and reduce the gap of knowledge , science , technology , and information that distances our country from highly developed countries .
5 . Clean up public finances , ending incompetence and irresponsibility in the handling of public money that precipitated the financial crisis .
Overcome the lack of political will and reach an accord that opens a passage for the integral fiscal reform that El Salvador needs .
6 . Confront the effects provoked by the global economic crisis : Agricultural insecurity , energy vulnerability , consequences of climate change , and the local effects of the recession in the United States .
7 . Unify the country : dismantle the foundations of intolerance , polarisation and a fractured economy .
8 . Remove the obstacles to democracy and to the implementation of the Peace Accords .
9 . Overcome the fragility , deterioration and degradation of state institutions with legal security for people , families and the life of the country .
10 . Overcome regional fragmentation and the lack of integration that has impoverished and disadvantaged people in this region of the world .
Move forward toward integration that is justified by the interests of the people .
Evidence of the FMLN ’s popularity is not hard to find .
It can be glimpsed in massive attendance at rallies and in the results of the first round of elections .
Electoral opinion polls consistently show the FMLN has the plan that voters want ; and one that ARENA is n’t inclined to follow : putting the Salvadoran government to work for the Salvadoran people .
According to the ARENA government , the FMLN is making promises it cannot keep and its electoral campaign is only a smokescreen for its true ambition : Creating " armed groups " of children in the Salvadoran countryside for a fight alongside Hugo Chávez , Hezbollah , Colombian guerrillas and street gangs to overthrow the US empire .
This gem of fiction makes one wonder what ideas must have been scrapped in ARENA ’s campaign strategy meetings .
A more revealing incident of ARENA ’s militaristic preoccupations , if less fantastic than the above - mentioned “ armed groups ” story , which has received incessant and unsubstantiated coverage , was President Antonio Saca ’s address to the Salvadoran military on the “ Day of the Soldier ” .
On the military holiday in May 2007 , Saca addressed a large group of young soldiers and implored that they summon the spirit of the soldiers who fought in the civil war to stop the “ waves of dangerous populism that threaten the region today ” .
Saca made similar statements to war veterans in 2008 .
Who 's afraid of the Salvadoran people ?
Reacting to its dire performance in the polls and the public 's deep opposition to some of its cornerstone policies , such as the repressive Mano Dura ( Iron Fist ) policing program or the privatisation of public resources , ARENA would need a dramatic about face to improve its chances of turning the election in its favor .
ARENA would have to start by pulling back on its national water privatisation plan , signing public water provision agreements with the water workers ' union .
But then the party would be going against its own commitments .
ARENA could gain voter confidence by canceling its mining contracts with Pacific Rim Corporation and the scores of other exploitative projects it has promoted in northern El Salvador .
But that is not the ARENA party .
It will never choose such a path .
For ARENA , predatory foreign investment and diminished public ownership are signs of " efficiency " and " progress " .
ARENA has shown contempt for voters , while putting its friendly foreign investors on notice of what looks to them as an impending disaster : A functioning democracy .
While asking for tougher electoral intervention from the US government , the party has spent nearly US $ 10 million on a campaign of fear and distortion as well as requested more than $ 1.5 billion in international loans .
ARENA party leaders who have been selling El Salvador piecemeal to multinational corporations for years are now working quickly to secure corporate - driven development contracts before President Saca ’s term expires in June .
One such project is the Port of La Unión , a multibillion - dollar transnational trade hub that ARENA believes should be 90 % privately owned .

An FMLN victory would immediately open up the government ’s accounting books , exposing ARENA 's systematic siphoning of national and foreign aid budgets – this , among ARENA 's myriad other abuses to the people , land and resources of El Salvador .
For example , the FMLN has repeatedly cited the more than $ 600 million in still unaccounted for “ missing taxes ” that corporations and individuals should be paying into the national budget each year .
In addition , the FMLN has repeatedly denounced the fact that 85 % of El Salvador ’s land and commercial sectors are owned by a five - family oligarchy .
Despite its worries and its reluctance to engage honestly with the Salvadoran electorate , ARENA is not going down without a fight – even if it means acting illegally .
Indeed , it is pulling out all of the stops in an attempt to buy the election .
In perhaps its strangest act of irony , the party is blasting email advertisements throughout US cities that offer discounted airfares to Salvadorans who are willing to return home to vote for ARENA candidate Rodrigo Ávila .
The $ 330 price tag almost certainly guarantees a ride from and back to the airport and a full - time escort , who will ensure that visitors find their way to the ballot box and then promptly return to work in the United States .
Interestingly , while the mainstream media has helped the ARENA party to stunt and vilify the FMLN 's aspirations for government , Funes ' candidacy has been maintained as a positive and prolific campaign .
While the FMLN has had to pay exorbitant rates for costly and minimal ad space in right - wing daily newspapers and prime - time television slots , the internet contains dozens of interviews , monologues , campaign speeches and ads surrounding Funes and the FMLN campaign .
One of the most inventive media pieces of the campaign are the party 's Microprogramas , which are short , smart and stylish tutorial programs that explore various aspects of El Salvador ’s government and economy and outline the FMLN ’s platform on such issues .
Each program lasts 5 - 10 minutes and the FMLN has made 45 of them .
The Microprogramas are windows into how the FMLN has led public education campaigns in strengthening people ’s understanding and approach toward the government ’s role in Salvadoran society .
If the FMLN has its way , El Salvador will join the growing movement for participatory democracy across Latin America in its own unique way , as prescribed by the people who voted it into power .
Funes has promised a transparent budget prioritisation process and a functional attorney general ’s office .
He has also committed himself to strengthening citizen 's rights to basic necessities such as food , education , housing , health care and civil liberties , while enhancing El Salvador ’s role in the local and regional economy over the next five years .
The FMLN ’s ability to make these goals a reality begins and ends with its base of support and the poor majority .
“ The people ’s resistance in El Salvador walks on two feet ; one foot is the social movement and the other is the FMLN , " says Estela Ramirez , a factory worker turned union organiser .
" The work of the government is to create the legal and financial framework for all people and sectors of society to be able to access the government .
This way the majority of Salvadorans can determine the course of our country ’s future . ”

With technology , it 's easy to break the law Legally , it 's been a gray week for me .
I took apart and repaired a 15 - year - old , Freon - filled air conditioner without an EPA permit .
I destroyed a wasp's nest with a makeshift flamethrower , using an aerosol can of cleaner " in a manner inconsistent with its labeling . "
And then I went hardcore .
Well , sort of .
I got myself a new laptop at work ; I bring it home on weekends for safekeeping .
It has built - in Wi-Fi networking , and I had a Wi -Fi hotspot in my house .
As soon as I turned it on , the laptop found and connected to a Wi -Fi network .
This was cool ; I appreciate how easy it works .
But it was also odd , because my Wi-Fi network is encrypted .
You need a password to access it , and I had n't entered one .
I pulled up the list of networks , and there was mine , locked down , along with a few others , also locked .
There was also one unencrypted one and I was connecting through it .
The computer is set to search for the strongest network it can access and use it .
As I was n't planning on bringing my machine home more than occasionally , it was easier to piggyback on this mysterious signal than to set up my own network .
There have been plenty of stories about how you should secure your wireless network , and doing so is n't difficult : a handful of clicks , really .
Some neighbors had done so , but one had not , and now I was using his Internet connection .
Technically , this is theft .
Sort of .
( One reason it 's not is that I figured out which neighbor it was , and I told him .
He did n't mind . )
But it 's a good example of how traditional definitions do n't always fit in the brave new world .
Was I stealing ?
I was depriving my neighbor of bandwidth .
I was slowing his access .
But what if he was n't online ?
( In fact , he was n't home at the time . )
More importantly , he was leaving his network unsecured , so any PC with a Wi -Fi card in the area would pick it up .
He does n't pay for time on the network , so I 'm not costing him anything .
He was n't using the network then , so I was n't depriving him of anything .
Free WiFi connections are all over , so I was n't depriving an ISP of revenue .
Still , that has n't stopped other people from getting arrested for " stealing " a signal .
Terrible twos
My two - year - old does not quite understand the concept of " do n't scratch your DVDs . "
He 's already ruined a few CDs , but DVDs are more expensive and we 've been good about keeping them out of his ( literally ) grubby hands .
The smart thing to do is make a backup and keep the original safely put away .
This way Sam only risks a 50 - cent disk , not a $ 20 one .
There are a bunch of programs out there for making backups of your DVDs with names like 1 Click DVD Copy , DVD Wizard Pro , and DVD Cloner .
I use one called DVD Decrypter , which I like for two reasons : 1 ) It 's free , and 2 ) it can remove UOPs from the DVD before making a copy .
If you have a DVD player , you 've bumped into UOPs , or " user operation prohibitions . "
They stop you when you try to do something to the DVD you 're not supposed to do .
For example , some of Sam 's disks come from a company that fills the first 10 minutes with commercials for its other products .
The UOPs prohibit you from skipping them .
Can you imagine if you tried to read your child a book but could n't start until you flipped through 20 pages of ads ?
That 's why , when I made a backup of these disks , I also removed the UOPs .
Now Sam can be as rough as he likes and we can skip the commercials , too .
The original is safe , and Sam is spared from yet more advertising .
Is what I did against the law ?
Not yet , but the entertainment industry wants it to be .
Gray area
My father sent me birthday greetings with a card that has a photo of a New York scene of Fort Washington Park with the George Washington Bridge in the background .
I 'm always happy to see scenes of New York , but this one made me stop .
From the angle the shot was taken , you could just see , under the bridge , the Little Red Lighthouse .
" Holy moly ! " I said .
Entirely by accident , he had sent me a card that brought back memories of one of my favorite childhood books .
I scanned the card and sent it to a friend with a note , " Holy moly ! "
Now that card was copyrighted art , yet here I was , scanning it and sending it to someone .
Breaking the law or fair use ?
Obviously , fair use .
I think .
I was n't profiting from it and was n't depriving anyone of anything .
It was in the context of a review .
Had it been a digital image I paid for , however , and not an analog one , that would have been exactly the kind of thing content creators want to prevent .
For now , though , I still have my copyrights — at least to some extent .
( And let 's not forget that the idea of copyright was to protect the rights of content consumers as much as those of creators .
It 's something the entertainment industry has paid Congress to ignore . )
I still can change my car 's oil without a license , permit , or certification .
I can still build a potato cannon and fix my air conditioner .
I can still copy my CDs to my MP3 player and use my TiVo to watch Friday 's Battlestar Galactica again .
But as technology marches on , our laws do n't always march with it .
They 're written by men with agendas that are different than ours — men who do n't understand ( or have the incentive to understand ) what they 're trying to legislate .
So chances are there will come a day when there wo n't be room for men to meddle with technology .
The sad thing is that we 'll think what they do is against the law in the first place .
